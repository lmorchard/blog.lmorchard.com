    "summary": "In my last post, I got all fluffy about how cool Ubiquity is but didn't share any code to prove the point.  As it happens, I have come up with at least one useful command that I'm starting to use habitually in posting bookmarks to Delicious.  You can subscribe to my command or check out the full sourceâ€”this post will serve as a dissection of the thing.  Since this will be fairly lengthy, follow along after the jump.\nOh, and it's been awhile since I posted something this in-depth around here, so feel free to let me know how this first draft works.  And, bug reports and patches are of course welcome.",
