I think it's often a matter of developers not wanting to (and/or being politically unable to) venture into what they consider the sysadmin's domain. Take the way-too-common case of apps that make the client wait while it does housekeeping. Why isn't this in a cron job? One reason is maybe this is KewlOSSBlogWikiPackage and it's simpler to say \"just untar the package under htdocs and you're done\" instead of saying \"also, unpack these scripts in a non-servable area and set them up to run hourly, but not all at the same time; stagger them a little. And run them with the same UID your web server is running as\". But we end up with a lot of apps that (badly) reimplement basic tools their OS ships with in the first place.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083327\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1d7a7610cb0f02de44be3c4186f82ac3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083327\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-28T21:23:06\">2008-07-28T21:23:06</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I wonder if you're still setting the bar too high for low-priority connections.

The other part of the user interface, retrieval, serves simply to get the original content distributed as fast as can be reasonably expected.\r\n\r\nNow, preparing for fast retrieval is another story.  The flip side to processing queues are message inboxes—expect content duplicated everywhere and fetched simply, rather than using cleverly expressed SQL joins that bring a system to its knees.  But, that's another post altogether. :)\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083313\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://fatalerror.in\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=15516fd23722eeca86b8ea91738eea4b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://fatalerror.in\">shyam</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083313\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-04T21:12:46\">2008-07-04T21:12:46</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Interesting bits of conversation happening all over the place regarding queues and the irony of it all - the much maligned Java has had workqueues since the early days.</p>\n\n<p>What everyone will learn, rather painfully in in cases like Twitter, is that all data is not created, consumed or processed equally.

I think it's often a matter of developers not wanting to (and/or being politically unable to) venture into what they consider the sysadmin's domain. Take the way-too-common case of apps that make the client wait while it does housekeeping. Why isn't this in a cron job? One reason is maybe this is KewlOSSBlogWikiPackage and it's simpler to say \"just untar the package under htdocs and you're done\" instead of saying \"also, unpack these scripts in a non-servable area and set them up to run hourly, but not all at the same time; stagger them a little. And run them with the same UID your web server is running as\". But we end up with a lot of apps that (badly) reimplement basic tools their OS ships with in the first place.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083327\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1d7a7610cb0f02de44be3c4186f82ac3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083327\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-28T21:23:06\">2008-07-28T21:23:06</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I wonder if you're still setting the bar too high for low-priority connections.
