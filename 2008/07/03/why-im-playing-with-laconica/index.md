I just posted [a quick writeup][howto] on Laconica installation.  But, beyond the how, there's the why.  

As I mentioned in that entry, I've started and neglected at least two attempts at building a distributed Twitter clone.  That's mostly been a function of how busy I've been; how long I screwed around with making my own PHP framework; how far I wandered playing with the look and feel; how well Twitter was working; and how bored I got.

As for Laconica, I'm somewhat displeased with the state of the Laconica code and the installation process—and it certainly needs many more features.  In other words, it's very itchy to me.  But, the important things are:

* It exists and it works.
* Someone's actively hosting it.
* Others are trying to install it.
* Someone got off their ass and persisted long enough to get it to this point.

That's more than I can say for my own efforts—because mere [ideas are worthless](http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/08/26/ooobeh)—so maybe I can find a way to help. :)

            <div class="content"><p>One thing that would be interesting would be to write a new implementation of the same "OpenMicroBlogging" spec, or indeed take an existing microblogging project you prefer the look of, and add the support in there. It might even be less work that way, and it'd certainly be a valuable contribution.</p></div>
