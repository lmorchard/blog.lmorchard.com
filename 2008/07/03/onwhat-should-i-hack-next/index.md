I know this isn't LiveJournal, but I just found what looks like a decent poll plugin for WordPress.  So, I'll try it out and solicit your opinion all at once:

[poll id="2"]


<div id="comments" class="comments archived-comments">
            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>
            
        <ul class="comments">
            
        <li class="comment" id="comment-221084377">
            <div class="meta">
                <div class="author">
                    <a class="avatar image" rel="nofollow" 
                       href="http://mikewarot.blogspot.com"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=04f21a4b6a007063d191b66c34f71710&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png"/></a>

                </div>
                <a href="#comment-221084377" class="permalink"><time datetime="2008-07-04T15:04:52">2008-07-04T15:04:52</time></a>
            </div>
            <div class="content"><p>Your work getting Laconica up and running is very valuable (because you didn't write it, and thus offer a new perspective to share with the rest of us).</p>

<p>I'm personally interest in doing some sort of load testing, to help prevent recurrences of twitter's broken growth curve.</p>

<p>After that, I'm interested in stopping the inevitable spam that will crop up once the federation really works and interoperability takes off.</p>

<p>Of course, temper this with your previous observation that ideas aren't worth squat.</p></div>
