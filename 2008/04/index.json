But, that didn&#39;t really matter: Since becoming <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital\">newly digital in 1983</a>, I&#39;d already spent years plugging away at personal projects big and small, frequently abandoned, talking to myself all the time anyway.</p>\n<p>So, blogging, I thought, would give me a real or imagined motivation to finish some projects.  The difference between writing a blog and working alone in the basement, is that there&#39;s a chance someone outside my physical neighborhood might catch a few mutterings and knock on my door to have a chat—rather than just walking a little faster and avoiding my house in the future, like the local neighbors usually do when I find myself really going off on a tear.  </p>\n<p>Thus if someone, somewhere showed interest in things I was doing and describing—then maybe I might just stick with one or two of them long enough to declare a version worthy of a <a href=\"http://freshmeat.net/\">freshmeat.net</a> release.  (It&#39;s been awhile, but that used to be my gold standard for Real Software.)</p>\n<p>However, I&#39;ve realized that occasional visitors won&#39;t magically help me finish software.  I&#39;ve come to accept that I&#39;m far too much a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiast</a> to release much at v1.0 without a paycheck or some other substantial incentive.
