But, that didn&#39;t really matter: Since becoming <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital\">newly digital in 1983</a>, I&#39;d already spent years plugging away at personal projects big and small, frequently abandoned, talking to myself all the time anyway.</p>\n<p>So, blogging, I thought, would give me a real or imagined motivation to finish some projects.  The difference between writing a blog and working alone in the basement, is that there&#39;s a chance someone outside my physical neighborhood might catch a few mutterings and knock on my door to have a chat—rather than just walking a little faster and avoiding my house in the future, like the local neighbors usually do when I find myself really going off on a tear.  </p>\n<p>Thus if someone, somewhere showed interest in things I was doing and describing—then maybe I might just stick with one or two of them long enough to declare a version worthy of a <a href=\"http://freshmeat.net/\">freshmeat.net</a> release.  (It&#39;s been awhile, but that used to be my gold standard for Real Software.)</p>\n<p>However, I&#39;ve realized that occasional visitors won&#39;t magically help me finish software.  I&#39;ve come to accept that I&#39;m far too much a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiast</a> to release much at v1.0 without a paycheck or some other substantial incentive.  But that&#39;s okay, because tinkering with unfinished software still seems to attract occasional visitors.  And, where there are visitors, there are contacts and conversations.  And, where there are contacts and conversations, there&#39;s learning and fulfillment—two of my favorite things.</p>\n<p>Apropos of conversations, though, I&#39;ve gone <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/10/13/throttling-the-basement-hacker\">habitually quiet</a> in the past few years.  I&#39;ve gone from claiming that <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/03/hacking-is-my-world-of-warcraft\">hacking is my World of Warcraft</a> to just getting <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/06/world-of-warcraft-is-my-world-of-warcraft\">sucked into WoW proper</a>.  It&#39;s gotten to the point that I&#39;ve wondered what I ever talked about here.  Yeah, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/12/21/my-semi-annual-blogger-navel-gazing-post\">I&#39;ve written this kind of entry</a> <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/07/14/dork-funk\">many times before</a>—but I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s gotten better.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m really out of the flow here, but I don&#39;t think giving it up is the right thing to do.  I&#39;ve been doing some retrospection (in volumes <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/04/26/greatest-hits-vol-1-the-tinkery-bits\">one</a> and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/04/26/greatest-hits-vol-2-the-babble-bits\">two</a>), and have been reviewing what I&#39;ve done here.  I&#39;m getting some ideas, and hoping I can get myself back into acting on them.</p>\n<p>It might be a little while before I produce anything on a regular basis, because I&#39;m currently working on a third book, entitled <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047038459X.html\">Professional JavaScript Frameworks</a>.  And, on top of that, I&#39;ve got <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/787565793\">a bit of a transition going on in my life right now</a>.  </p>\n<p>But, waking things up here is something I&#39;d like to make part of that transition.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087645\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mpwilson.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e79b5fc97a604e3b1b41c158e9d61267&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mpwilson.com/\">Mike Wilson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087645\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-04-27T03:45:47\">2008-04-27T03:45:47</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Interesting.
