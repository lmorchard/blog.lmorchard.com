  "html": "<p>When I first <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/02/14/ooooah\">created this blog</a> back in February 2002, I was talking to myself and I knew it.  But, that didn't really matter: Since becoming <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital\">newly digital in 1983</a>, I'd already spent years plugging away at personal projects big and small, frequently abandoned, talking to myself all the time anyway.</p>\n<p>So, blogging, I thought, would give me a real or imagined motivation to finish some projects.  The difference between writing a blog and working alone in the basement, is that there's a chance someone outside my physical neighborhood might catch a few mutterings and knock on my door to have a chat—rather than just walking a little faster and avoiding my house in the future, like the local neighbors usually do when I find myself really going off on a tear.  </p>\n<p>Thus if someone, somewhere showed interest in things I was doing and describing—then maybe I might just stick with one or two of them long enough to declare a version worthy of a <a href=\"http://freshmeat.net/\">freshmeat.net</a> release.  (It's been awhile, but that used to be my gold standard for Real Software.)</p>\n<p>However, I've realized that occasional visitors won't magically help me finish software.  I've come to accept that I'm far too much a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiast</a> to release much at v1.0 without a paycheck or some other substantial incentive.  But that's okay, because tinkering with unfinished software still seems to attract occasional visitors.  And, where there are visitors, there are contacts and conversations.

I've gone from claiming that <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/03/hacking-is-my-world-of-warcraft\">hacking is my World of Warcraft</a> to just getting <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/06/world-of-warcraft-is-my-world-of-warcraft\">sucked into WoW proper</a>.
