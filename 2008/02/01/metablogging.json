Through it, I wanted to finally get my head around playing with the web publishing features of <a href=\"http://eastgate.com/Tinderbox/\">Tinderbox</a> — and I hoped that after the <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving\">Yak Shaving</a>, I would enjoy the results enough to be motivated to continue pushing out small particles of thought.  That worked for awhile.  Thanks to my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiasm</a>, though, the shine wore off after a month or two and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/recaffeinated/archives.html\">my output</a> has since dwindled.  The interface is pretty cool, but there are just enough clunky bits to make me think twice about starting up the app.</p>\n<p>In December, I built <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/accum/\">0xDECAFBAD accumulator</a> in an attempt to automatically capture and accumulate in one spot all the stuff I leave behind on 15 services or so across the net.  A month later, it&#39;s still running.  It&#39;s filled with crap day after day.  It&#39;s all my crap, and I&#39;m glad to have my crap all in one pile, but it&#39;s <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/01/28/comments-fixed#comment-326727\">very noisy</a>.</p>\n<p>Between recaffeination and accumulation, I think I&#39;m bracketing the same issues.  On one side, I&#39;ve got <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore)\">John Henry</a> hammering down the microcontent spikes, and on the other I&#39;ve got the machine cronjobbing away.  What I really want is something a bit in between: Maybe a crap pile for myself and an easy manual selection method that I&#39;ll remember to use habitually for editorial control.  It&#39;s all really just attempts to try to reconstitute the diffuse spew that used to be more or less concentrated into one spot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.molly.com/2008/01/05/twitter-sucked-the-blogging-out-of-me/\">Twitter sucked the blogging out of Molly</a>, but I was already well down that path long before I think Twitter was a glimmer in <a href=\"http://obvious.com/\">Obvious</a> eyes.  </p>\n<p>Apropos of that, here I am back at my traditional blog.  The blog where I&#39;ve been hoping to get myself writing again.  Maybe I&#39;ll swing back this way and not make this the last post for another few months.  I&#39;ve certainly got lots in my head, and there&#39;s certainly been lots going on worth thinking about out loud — but I&#39;ve also got plenty I shouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t actually babble about in mixed company.</p>\n<p>So, what to expect from me, then?  Eh, who knows.  This might be the last post here for another few months.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082972\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082972\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-02-01T06:31:37\">2008-02-01T06:31:37</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I found that Twitter helped me get back in touch with my personal voice that had gotten lost from spending too much time reading the echo chamber.

Although, like you, I figure I should probably suck those back into my main site.</p></div>\n\n        </li>\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082975\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://alltom.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7a28bf7b0932a9486c21f1a33eb431ba&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://alltom.com/\">Tom</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082975\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-02-01T11:32:38\">2008-02-01T11:32:38</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>My blog URL is in the signature of every e-mail, which means that I want the front page to always have something thoughtful.

Hmm.</p>\n\n<p><p>@Tom: That&#39;s another thing I&#39;m thinking about.  My home page is a cruddy redirect to the accumulator now.
