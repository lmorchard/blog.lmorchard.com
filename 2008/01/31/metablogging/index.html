        <section class="post-content">
          <p>Back in November, I built <a href="http://decafbad.com/recaffeinated/">decafbad recaffeinated</a> using <a href="http://eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a>.  Through it, I wanted to finally get my head around playing with the web publishing features of <a href="http://eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> — and I hoped that after the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">Yak Shaving</a>, I would enjoy the results enough to be motivated to continue pushing out small particles of thought.  That worked for awhile.  Thanks to my <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast">serial enthusiasm</a>, though, the shine wore off after a month or two and <a href="http://decafbad.com/recaffeinated/archives.html">my output</a> has since dwindled.  The interface is pretty cool, but there are just enough clunky bits to make me think twice about starting up the app.</p>
<p>In December, I built <a href="http://decafbad.com/accum/">0xDECAFBAD accumulator</a> in an attempt to automatically capture and accumulate in one spot all the stuff I leave behind on 15 services or so across the net.  A month later, it&#39;s still running.  It&#39;s filled with crap day after day.  It&#39;s all my crap, and I&#39;m glad to have my crap all in one pile, but it&#39;s <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/01/28/comments-fixed#comment-326727">very noisy</a>.</p>
<p>Between recaffeination and accumulation, I think I&#39;m bracketing the same issues.  On one side, I&#39;ve got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore)">John Henry</a> hammering down the microcontent spikes, and on the other I&#39;ve got the machine cronjobbing away.  What I really want is something a bit in between: Maybe a crap pile for myself and an easy manual selection method that I&#39;ll remember to use habitually for editorial control.  It&#39;s all really just attempts to try to reconstitute the diffuse spew that used to be more or less concentrated into one spot.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.molly.com/2008/01/05/twitter-sucked-the-blogging-out-of-me/">Twitter sucked the blogging out of Molly</a>, but I was already well down that path long before I think Twitter was a glimmer in <a href="http://obvious.com/">Obvious</a> eyes.  </p>
<p>Apropos of that, here I am back at my traditional blog.  The blog where I&#39;ve been hoping to get myself writing again.  Maybe I&#39;ll swing back this way and not make this the last post for another few months.  I&#39;ve certainly got lots in my head, and there&#39;s certainly been lots going on worth thinking about out loud — but I&#39;ve also got plenty I shouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t actually babble about in mixed company.</p>
<p>So, what to expect from me, then?  Eh, who knows.  This might be the last post here for another few months.</p>

<div class="content"><p>Hmmm...good call on the personal voice aspect, Kellan. I find that I can be "freer" posting to Jaiku / Facebook status because it has less eyes (closer eyes?) on it than the broad distribution of my main site.</p>
<p>And the accumulator looks like, well, er, a Jaiku clone :P Many people have told me that they like the fact that Jaiku gives my delicious bookmarks a place where they can comment on my observations of that link...I like that. Although, like you, I figure I should probably suck those back into my main site.</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>My blog URL is in the signature of every e-mail, which means that I want the front page to always have something thoughtful. So I added a checkbox to determine whether a post could appear there. I realized later that this was also perfect criteria for whether the article was signal or noise, so now I have feeds for "front page stories" (non-crap) and "everything" and I think it works out quite well.</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>I found that building an accumulator sorta killed my blogging desire as well... as in "well, I listened to a song on Last.fm so now I don't have to blog tonight."  I think the accumulator is going to have to become a secondary page to my blog to get me practicing my writing again.</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>Yeah... that's the other thing I've been thinking - I wonder if I'm not really ever going to get back to blogging, and will end up doing something else.  I want to keep writing and I want to keep hacking — blogging seems social enough to keep me from becoming a complete hermit.  Hmm.</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>@Boris: I can't say that my accumulator wasn't inspired by Jaiku at all - but the main difference is that this one is <em>mine</em> :)  The issue of comments in context is on my mind, though - I've considered hooking haloscan or something up to the accumulator, though that would then be another divergent stream of comments (assuming anyone participated) from all the original items.  Hmm.</p>
<p>@Tom: That's another thing I'm thinking about.  My home page is a cruddy redirect to the accumulator now.  I should make it a more focused summary page, maybe have one or more "featured" items along with "about me" info.</p>
<p>@Micah: Yup, that's where I'm at too. :/  Outsourced my "I listened to X" to last.fm — done.</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>It's interesting... I see a lot of people confronting exactly this. I think having stuff like the Action Streams to capture my delicious/twitter/etc. activity has freed me up to do more writing, not least because I want to show up on everybody else's aggregations. :)</p></div>
