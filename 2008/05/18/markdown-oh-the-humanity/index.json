  "html": "<p>I use <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> to write for this blog, and I don&#39;t think I could write much online without it.  (Of course, that&#39;s not saying much lately—but nevermind that for now.)</p>\n<p>Although I do appreciate all the effort put toward enhancing <code>&lt;textareas&gt;</code> on the web, I&#39;m not a fan of WYSIWYG writing interfaces.  They hide too much in an effort to make things &quot;easy&quot;—yet, for all that ease, they make me miss <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordperfect#Reveal_codes\">Reveal Codes</a> in WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  Hell, I wish I could write books using <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> instead of Microsoft Word.  (And, yeah, I know that some O&#39;Reilly authors have written books in <a href=\"http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html\">perlpod</a>—but that&#39;s a bit too far even for me.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think the issue is that it really bothers me to compose HTML in the same mental context as writing prose—HTML is too much like code.  Coding and <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prosing\">prosing</a> are two different modes for me, and I don&#39;t like the constant context-switching thrash.  (And, yes, I&#39;ve just learned today that <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prosing\">prosing</a> is a word.)</p>\n<p>So, apropos of this, there&#39;s been a <a href=\"http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2520\">thread</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001116.html\">blogophere</a> lately <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2008/05/a-million-littl.html\">naysaying</a> non-HTML, wiki-text, and <a href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/SmartAscii\">smart-ASCII</a> formats.  They seem to be mostly attacking the idea from a technical perspective, where it&#39;s more like a usability problem to me.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t see where Jeff Atwood&#39;s &quot;<a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001116.html\">Is HTML a Humane Markup Language?</a>&quot; makes the case for HTML as humane.  As far as I can tell, the inhumanity is that markup schemes are harder to keep track of than HTML.  Yet, there&#39;s a kind of coder macho thing going on there that&#39;s decidedly not humane—i.e. real programmers should be fine with getting their eyes poked by angle brackets on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I do agree that some of these formats are horrendous.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page\">Wikipedia markup</a> and <a href=\"http://www.phpbb.com/community/faq.php?mode=bbcode\">BBCode</a> are nasty in particular.  Though, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page\">Wikipedia markup</a> at least has some semantic purpose beyond HTML.  But, I can&#39;t follow from that to seeing how the whole idea is wrong.  </p>\n<p>I used <a href=\"http://textile.thresholdstate.com/\">Textile</a> for awhile, and then switched to <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> when it came around.  At this point, I&#39;ve been using <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> since it came out in 2004.  I now plug <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> into everything I can where I&#39;ll be doing any writing.  There&#39;s a version of <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> in just about every language known to the web these days—you can even find <a href=\"http://attacklab.net/showdown/\">Markdown in Javascript</a>.  I write notes to myself in <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a>, even when there&#39;s no URL to view it.  I&#39;ve even used <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> semi-consciously when writing by hand in a paper journal.</p>\n<p>Perhaps I&#39;ve said too much.  </p>\n<p>Anyway, I&#39;ll expend as many brain cells as it takes to not need to compose raw HTML by hand in the course of writing.  As it happens, I can usually just use <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a>, so those brain cells were spent years ago.  And thus, I feel I&#39;ve saved more brain cells in avoiding coding/<a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prosing\">prosing</a> thrash. So, it could just be personal preference, but I agree with the reasons why <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhyDoesntWikiDoHtml\">the original wiki doesn&#39;t use HTML</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085294\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://megalar.890m.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=750dbcc9cc192bfad37a3daa4edf139e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://megalar.890m.com/blog/\">megalar</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085294\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-05-18T22:19:07\">2008-05-18T22:19:07</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I couldn't agree more on this dude.
