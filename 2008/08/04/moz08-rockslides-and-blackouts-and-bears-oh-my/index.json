  "html": "<p>Since the beginning, I&#39;ve been a Mozilla fanboy.  But, up until very recently, I&#39;ve only shown that as a user and a verbal supporter, with a shallow understanding or participation in what&#39;s really done in the Mozilla community.  Sure, I&#39;ve checked out source code from time to time going back to the first code release, built and poked at it, but I&#39;ve never really contributed back.</p>\n<p>But now, I&#39;m an employee of the Mozilla Corporation, and I feel like I found a little-known cheat code for getting into the place where all the cool stuff happens.

Throughout the course of the event, I felt humbled by the efforts of everyone and have come away with a feeling that I really need to step up my game.  Somehow, it seems I managed to sneak into the place without having first run the decade-old traditional gauntlet of meritocracy and contribution.</p>\n<p>Being a newbie of just a few months, I barely know anyone at Mozilla, so I was quite overwhelmed socially.
