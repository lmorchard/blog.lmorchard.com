    "html": "<p>When I was a wee hacker, I lived my digital life though a <a href=\"http://www.virtualsky.net/iadoremyc64/\">Commodore 64</a>.  I played games on it, did homework, talked to people far away—you know, all the stuff they showed in the pictures on the box.  I also took things apart—both the machine itself and software running on it.  I grew up learning that my digital environment was ultimately understandable, <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/\">susceptible to tinkering</a>, and open to being bent to my own purposes.</p>\n<p>From the Commodore 64, I graduated eventually to terminals and text editors, opening portals mostly onto computers elsewhere via powerful UNIX command shells.  And, of course, over the past decade, this has largely given way to life in a browser.  </p>\n<p>Yet, for a little while, particularly in the first few years of browsers, freedom to tinker seemed cramped.  JavaScript had yet to arrive, and was a little messy when it did.  There was no relatively easy addon development.  And, though the portals opened by a browser were richer than those provided by terminals, the paths of navigation defined by links controlled by site owners offered less freedom of movement than UNIX commands.  I could create my own pages, but I couldn&#39;t do much to others&#39; pages.</p>\n<p>But then, javascript: URLs came around, dots were connected, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet\">bookmarklets</a> were born.  Suddenly, it was possible to customize <em>my</em> browsing environment with arbitrary JavaScript code having access to the current page—no matter <em>whose</em> page it was.  And, through the various tricks of the AJAX trade, bookmarklets have only gotten more capable throughout the years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/docs/end-user/keywords.html\">Smart keyword shortcuts</a> came around a little later, allowing quick access to bookmarks via simple keywords typed into the location bar.  The smart part, though, came in the form of bookmarked URLs with placeholders and keywords given arguments to fill the placeholders—allowing not only quick access to bookmarked pages but also search engine forms bookmarked with late-bound fields.</p>\n<p>Bookmarklets inherited the benefits of smart keyword shortcuts.  The same placeholder in http: URLs can be inserted into the code of a javascript: URL, thus parameterizing the JavaScript code and incidentally turning the location bar into a kind of primitive command line.  For example, one of my most heavily used &quot;<a href=\"http://naeblis.cx/weblog/2004/08/09/DeliciousAddresslets\">addresslets</a>&quot; is based on <a href=\"http://ejohn.org/blog/super-fast-delicious-bookmarklet/\">John Resig&#39;s original &quot;Super-Fast Delicious Bookmarklet&quot;</a>.</p>\n<p>Another leap in prying open the browser tinkering space came in the form of <a href=\"http://www.greasespot.net/\">Greasemonkey</a>—an addon-powered environment created explicitly for the purpose of end-user scripting applied to others&#39; pages.  <a href=\"http://www.greasespot.net/\">Greasemonkey</a> user scripts can do more than bookmarklets, and with a much better development environment to boot.  And, though a user script can&#39;t do quite as much as a proper browser addon, they&#39;re much easier to hack on and distribute.</p>\n<p>Now, consider one of <a href=\"http://labs.mozilla.com/\">Mozilla Labs</a>&#39; <a href=\"http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/\">newest projects</a>, named <a href=\"http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/\">Ubiquity</a>.

There's still a lot more room for experimentation.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089578\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://abcdefu.wordpress.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=af8b180d6d4092fb42fe6b5e0b21536c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://abcdefu.wordpress.com\">Abi</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089578\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-31T15:45:59\">2008-08-31T15:45:59</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p></p>\n\n<p>But otherwise, I <em>really</em> like your command especially the preivew.

You'll think smarter if you do.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085080\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/stephend\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=dcd8fb7ab4882537c2ce0ca6a1df159a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/stephend\">Stephen Donner</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085080\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-05T03:26:49\">2008-08-05T03:26:49</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Les -</p>\n\n<p>You implemented the <em>sexy theme browser</em> -- need I say more?</p>\n\n<p>:-)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stephen</li>\n</ul></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085081\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.corporatehippy.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=98448f231ca596089f5ff6299d22865c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.corporatehippy.com\">Marty</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085081\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-05T15:05:59\">2008-08-05T15:05:59</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Now that you're back in the mitten - don't be a stranger :D</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

And, since I&#39;m pretty sure everyone over there is either burnt out or still insanely busy at the moment, it might be awhile before anyone tells the full story of what this relaunch offers.  As it is, even I only know a bit of what all went into this effort.</p>\n<p>So, off the top of my head, I thought I might point out <strong>just a few</strong> of the easily-missed improvements the new site offers beyond the great new love-it-or-hate-it visual redesign that seems to have occupied most of the discussion I&#39;ve seen so far:</p>\n<p><strong>Search works and is incredibly fast.</strong>  In fact, search may really be the real star of the redesign show here—especially since del.icio.us often took 30 seconds or more for a simple search, rendering it all but useless.  Today, though, it&#39;s at ludicrous speed in comparison—and so finally, the real power of search applied to social bookmarking might start to shine with the critical mass of content found by real people using Delicious.</p>\n<p>To scratch my own itch, I&#39;ve created <a href=\"http://mycroft.mozdev.org/developer/devlist.html?email=l.m.orchard%40pobox.com\">an unofficial OpenSearch search engine plugin for Delicious</a> on Mycroft.  Though I think it comes along with <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/tools\">the browser extensions</a>, I&#39;ve yet to find this for <a href=\"http://mycroft.mozdev.org/developer/hosting.html\">autodiscovery</a> from the site itself.</p>\n<p><strong>The notes field in bookmarks has been expanded from 255 to 1000 characters.</strong>  Yes, this means that you can now include long running quotes from pages, or complete paragraphs of rambling discourse. </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/feeds\">The feeds have all been overhauled and reorganized</a>.</strong>  An attempt at backward compatibility was made, but the old feed URLs are all deprecated.  Replacing these, there&#39;s now <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/feeds\">a common and consistent URL namespace for feeds across formats</a>.  </p>\n<p>Almost all RSS feeds have <a href=\"http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/\">JSONP</a> counterparts, and further feed formats could be considered.  Additionally, the old mix of RSS 1.0 and 2.0 has been dropped in favor of RSS 2.0 format across the board to support podcast and media enclosure elements consistently.  The <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/tools\">linkrolls, tagrolls, network badges, and tagometers</a> now all use the new JSONP feeds—and the widgets can be examined as example code in using the feeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Tag bundles can now be viewed as combined bookmark views, complete with feeds.</strong>  This augments bundles from a simple visual organization tool to a more powerful content aggregation function.  Personally, I never had much use for tag bundles until now, but since they can actually be used to partition tags and bookmarks I might actually take the time to use them.  Check out these example URLs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://delicious.com/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign\">http://delicious.com/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign\">http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bundles now work for tags, network contacts, and subscriptions.</strong>  This means, for example, that you can partition your network contacts into topical groups.  From there, you can subscribe to those partitioned bookmarks in different folders in readers, or use the bundled bookmark views in mashups through JSON feeds.  Check out these example URLs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://delicious.com/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard\">http://delicious.com/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard\">http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Network member and fan feeds now include the date when the contact was added.</strong>  Pro tip: Subscribe to fan feeds to see when new people have started following your bookmarks.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/api\">Several previously undocumented parts of the V1 API have now been documented</a>.</strong>  In particular, the following new parameter combinations have been used with the browser extensions for primitive bookmark sync:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?hashes\">https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?hashes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?meta=yes\">https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?meta=yes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?fromdt=%7BDT%7D&amp;todt=%7BDT%7D\">https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?fromdt={DT}&amp;todt={DT}</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?start=%7B##%7D&amp;results=%7B##%7D\">https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?start={##}&amp;results={##}</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The posts/all API URL works again for users with large collections.</strong>  With my 11k+ bookmarks, del.icio.us was keeling over with the attempt to assemble and deliver my entire collection with a posts/all call.  Now, however, Delicious 2.0 appears able to handle this call for my account.</p>\n<p><strong>Easter eggs have been rotated and recalibrated.</strong> No, I&#39;m not going to tell you what or where or how many they are.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085469\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085469\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-05T02:31:52\">2008-08-05T02:31:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n<p>Since I’m pretty sure everyone over there is either burnt out or still insanely busy at the moment, it might be awhile before anyone tells the full story of what this relaunch offers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Admit it, Les, you just got impatient after building a bunch of shiny toys that no one at Yahoo! seemed to be coming forth to tell the world about them. :) (I would be miffed too.)</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085470\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.yining.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cd8af1a8b7c1cfdca49fb19d4a98a7bc&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.yining.org\">Yining</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085470\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-05T06:51:44\">2008-08-05T06:51:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>one thing in the new version that disappoints me is the tab-to-complete feature is gone.

Now, however, Delicious 2.0 appears able to handle this call for my account.\r\n\r\n**Easter eggs have been rotated and recalibrated.** No, I'm not going to tell you what or where or how many they are.\r\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085469\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085469\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-05T02:31:52\">2008-08-05T02:31:52</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n  <p>Since I’m pretty sure everyone over there is either burnt out or still insanely busy at the moment, it might be awhile before anyone tells the full story of what this relaunch offers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Admit it, Les, you just got impatient after building a bunch of shiny toys that no one at Yahoo! seemed to be coming forth to tell the world about them. :) (I would be miffed too.)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085470\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.yining.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cd8af1a8b7c1cfdca49fb19d4a98a7bc&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.yining.org\">Yining</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085470\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-05T06:51:44\">2008-08-05T06:51:44</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>one thing in the new version that disappoints me is the tab-to-complete feature is gone.

    "html": "<p>As you&#39;ve probably seen by now, <a href=\"http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2008/07/oh-happy-day.html\">Delicious 2.0 has launched</a>.  It&#39;s an all new design and the whole thing has been rewritten from the ground up.  Most of the gripes I&#39;ve seem like general dislike of change—which actually attests to the gargantuan effort put forth to reimplement the original from scratch in a whole new language and architecture.</p>\n<p>That said, I found <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/875002291\">at least one little bug</a> that stops my usual bookmarklet flow.  And, what&#39;s really annoying is that, it&#39;s probably a bug in code I wrote at one point.  As it turns out, the original URL parameters for the bookmark posting form don&#39;t seem to be accepted anymore, so legacy bookmarklets may be broken.  I swore I tested that, since I&#39;ve got some personal investment in it.</p>\n<p>But, although I can&#39;t contribute code to the project anymore, I&#39;ve at least still got <a href=\"http://www.greasespot.net/\">Greasemonkey</a>.  And, through <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2008/deliciouscom_legacy_book.user.js\">this quick &amp; dirty user script</a>, I&#39;m back to using my legacy bookmarking bookmarklets.

    "body": "As you've probably seen by now, [Delicious 2.0 has launched][del2].  It's an all new design and the whole thing has been rewritten from the ground up.  Most of the gripes I've seem like general dislike of change—which actually attests to the gargantuan effort put forth to reimplement the original from scratch in a whole new language and architecture.\r\n\r\nThat said, I found [at least one little bug][tw1] that stops my usual bookmarklet flow.  And, what's really annoying is that, it's probably a bug in code I wrote at one point.  As it turns out, the original URL parameters for the bookmark posting form don't seem to be accepted anymore, so legacy bookmarklets may be broken.  I swore I tested that, since I've got some personal investment in it.\r\n\r\nBut, although I can't contribute code to the project anymore, I've at least still got [Greasemonkey][gm].  And, through [this quick & dirty user script][legacyfix], I'm back to using my legacy bookmarking bookmarklets.  In case you're interested, [here's my favorite Firefox keyword shortcut bookmarklet][bm]—just select some text, type the keyword in the URL bar with some tags, and hit return.\r\n\r\n[gm]: http://www.greasespot.net/\r\n[tw1]: http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/875002291\r\n[tw2]: http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/875004144\r\n[del2]: http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2008/07/oh-happy-day.html\r\n[legacyfix]: http://decafbad.com/2008/deliciouscom_legacy_book.user.js\r\n[bm]: javascript:u=%22USERNAME%22;q=location.href;e%20=%20%22%22%20+%20(window.getSelection%20?%20window.getSelection()%20:%20document.getSelection%20?%20document.getSelection()%20%20:%20document.selection.createRange().text);p=document.title;window.location.href=%22http://del.icio.us/%22+u+%22?jump=doclose&noui&tags=%22+encodeURIComponent(%22%s%22)+%22&url=%22+encodeURIComponent(q)+%22&description=%22+encodeURIComponent(p)+%20%20%22&extended=%22%20+%20encodeURIComponent('%22'+e+'%22').replace(/%20/g,%20%22+%22);\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084822\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4762519f72e7ada7f2050a77eedca0e5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Peter Beardsley</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084822\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-03T13:52:14\">2008-08-03T13:52:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Just curious-- what language was del.icio.us originally implemented in, and what language was it re-implemented in for 2.0?</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084825\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084825\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-03T18:30:58\">2008-08-03T18:30:58</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@peter: The original del.icio.us was built with Mason in Perl, backed by MySQL.
