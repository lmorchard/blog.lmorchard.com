    "summary": "TL;DR: A little over a year ago, one of my favorite radio DJs, Darren Revell, started up a new streaming radio station named Big Sonic Heaven. I got the idea to try building a Spotify playlist collected from the music he plays. My quick & dirty program for doing that turned 1-year-old on April 24 and the playlist has collected over 2000 songs, so far.",
