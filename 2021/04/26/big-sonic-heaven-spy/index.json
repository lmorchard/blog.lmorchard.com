It aired every Sunday night for \"four sonic hours\" on 96.3 FM with playlists full of shoegaze, dream pop, trip hop, and Britpop. Some electronica and Goth tunes often found their way into rotation, too.</p>\n<p>It ran for about 8 years until 2003 and covered an interesting chunk of my life: from mid-college, through my first years as a bachelor, and ending around when I met the girl who <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/2006/06/09/wedding-day-is-today/\">I'd later marry</a>.</p>\n<p>So, not only does the general musical space of Big Sonic Heaven claim enormous tracts of my psyche, but I have a lot of life events scored by it as well.</p>\n<img src=\"./boombox.jpg\" class=\"inset right wide\" width=\"\" height=\"\">\n\n<p>Early on, I would often set up a boombox with a kitchen timer to record the show. With having to get up early for class or work on Monday mornings, I usually couldn't catch it live. But, I'd have at least part of the show ready on tape for the next day.</p>\n<p>In the early period of the show, internet radio and MP3 downloads from the web weren't really things yet. I could sometimes find someone posting playlists from the show <a href=\"https://bigsonic-heaven.livejournal.com/\">on LiveJournal</a>, so I took notes on what to dig for whenever I hit the record store.</p>\n<img src=\"./fm-tuner.jpg\" class=\"inset left wide\" width=\"\" height=\"\">\n\n<p>At some point after college, I managed to acquire a USB FM radio. That let me upgrade my recording rig to .wav files dumped to my hard drive. For awhile, I had some automation to burn the show overnight as a set of 30-minute-long .mp3s to a CD-RW that I could play in the car on the way to work and on my PC at my desk.</p>\n<p>I really wish I had saved more of those recordings, though: I tended to reuse the same CD-RW every week and wiped out the previous burn.

I think Darren still ran some club nights in the Detroit area for a few years, but eventually he moved off to California and I lost track of him for a long while.</p>\n<p>The Big Sonic Heaven shaped hole in my life kind of got filled by a few streaming stations, some of which were themselves inspired by the original.
