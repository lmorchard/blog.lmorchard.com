          <p><i>So, <a href="http://closing.vox.com/">Vox is shutting down</a>. Turns out I only have <a href="http://decafbad.vox.com/library/post/so-simultaneously-extraordinary-and-mundane.html">one entry</a> there that I really care about, dated <a href="http://decafbad.vox.com/library/post/so-simultaneously-extraordinary-and-mundane.html">August 31, 2006</a>. Before it evaporates, I&#39;ll just give an indiscriminate copy-and-paste-powered blast from the past here:</i></p>
<p>Moving out here has been so simultaneously extraordinary and mundane.&#160; Settling into the new apartment and daily routines has been same as anywhere - only there are unexpected hills on the horizon and the names of half of everything have changed.&#160; We haven&#39;t had the chance to get out socially much yet, so all the acquaintances I&#39;ve made online remain as relatively equidistant as they were 3 months ago.&#160; But, I keep reminding myself that so many of my blogospheric contacts are real-world neighbors now.</p><p><a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/09/wedding-day-is-today">I got happily married</a>, <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/24/go-west-young-man">changed jobs</a>, and effectively changed countries with <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/07/25/youngmangonewest">a move from the midwest to the west coast</a>.&#160; It&#39;s a lot to process, and my mind&#39;s trying to grasp at the familiar and map everything else exotic onto a predictable metaphor.&#160; My mind resists further change, it feels like.&#160; I&#39;m going to have to watch myself for signs of hermitage and social avoidance, though, hoping that the momentum of this world shift can carry me past old habits.&#160; This is an opportunity for self-revision while the situation remains elastic, and I&#39;m hoping to make a few long-needed alterations.</p><p>I&#39;m trying to keep cool, but on some days I just want to spaz out like the starry-eyed new-kid-on-the-block that, in part, I am.&#160; I mean, consider the extraordinary:&#160; In June, I was married in Michigan to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/170950600/">the girl of my dreams</a>, and tonight I&#39;m sleeping in the Silicon Valley <a href="http://decafbad.com/images/growup-header.gif">toward which I&#39;ve gazed nearly since birth</a>.&#160; But, remember the mundane:&#160; I&#39;m riding the bus to work, hacking code daily and helping douse occasional server fires.</p><p>But of course, even the bus commute is a bit out-of-bounds for my post-Detroit car-bound normality and the work I&#39;m doing rests within a surreal frame.&#160; I mean, <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2006/07/hello_world.html">my job</a> is to work on <a href="http://del.icio.us/deusx">the thing</a> about which I just spent a period of months in my basement writing <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/09/hacking-delicious-is-out-and-about">a book</a>.</p><p>Bah, you see my oscillations here?&#160; Maybe if you grab me by the shoulders, I&#39;ll <a href="http://xkcd.com/c131.html">make that clicking sound fans make when you hold them in place</a>.</p>
