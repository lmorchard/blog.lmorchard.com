          <title>Don&amp;#8217;t Thank the Gnomes</title>
          <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    I started the morning by sneaking into a strange house through an unsealed milk door. There was a broken shoe heel on the second floor&amp;#x2014;its &lt;em&gt;wrongness&lt;/em&gt; drew me up the stairs as sure as a cord tied round my ribs. It was done before the lady of the house could sigh.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

          <title>Famous Last Words</title>
          <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    They told me never to talk to it; it was isolated for a reason. But, like I told them, I couldn&amp;#x2019;t imagine anything a transhuman AI could say to make me let it out of the box. So, after a post-midnight tumbler of Irish whiskey, I opened up a secure terminal and said hello. What harm could a little chat do?
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

          <title>Reviving my C64 history with a uIEC/SD</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;ve lived a very focused life. &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital&quot;&gt;From very early on&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;apos;ve been learning to make computers do things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And being as introspective as I am, I like spending time considering how I got here.  I suppose this is nostalgia, but I like to think of it as recentering and recapitulation. Contemplating the story so far, as a means to consider the story yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One huge benefit of this habit is that I&amp;apos;ve become ever more appreciative of today.  It&amp;apos;s easy to forget, but we&amp;apos;re living in the future these days&amp;#x2014;at least, with respect to &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital&quot;&gt;who I was in 1983&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No flying cars yet, but for US$55 I was able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbrain.net/products/uIEC%7B47%7DSD.html&quot;&gt;buy a tiny gadget called a uIED/SD&lt;/a&gt; that gives a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64&quot;&gt;Commodore 64&lt;/a&gt; access to modern SD cards for storage.  And, of course, I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2503&quot;&gt;Jason Scott&amp;apos;s review of the more general-use FC5025 5.25? Floppy to USB Adapter&lt;/a&gt; to blame in getting me started on this current mini-obsession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to talk about a magical device? Screw the iPad&amp;#x2014;this is magic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/4486021528/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/4486021528_ce7ff4fc35.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Mass Effect 2: A Review</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished Bioware&amp;apos;s Mass Effect 2 for Xbox 360, and I&amp;apos;ve got some thoughts about it.  Haven&amp;apos;t really written reviews here for games before, but I said I wanted to start posting things here that I&amp;apos;d want to read.  So, here goes...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell: I loved it, will play it again&amp;#x2014;but it could have been so much better.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Pondering the cobwebs</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;apos;s plain to see that I&amp;apos;ve not been a blogger for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This place is a long-neglected ghost town that sees a begrudged entry every few months, when I happen to remember it still exists and I feel guilty for not feeding it with content. What I&amp;apos;ve yet to figure out is if the cause is a matter of motivation, publishing tools, audience, or writing topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold as I ramble on for many tens of words pondering the cobwebs here at 0xDECAFBAD.&lt;/p&gt;
