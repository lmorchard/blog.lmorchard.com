          <title>Don&#39;t Thank the Gnomes</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;I started the morning by sneaking into a strange house through an unsealed milk door. There was a broken shoe heel on the second floor—its wrongness drew me up the stairs as sure as a cord tied round my ribs. It was done before the lady of the house could sigh.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Famous Last Words</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;They told me never to talk to it; it was isolated for a reason. But, like I told them, I couldn’t imagine anything a transhuman AI could say to make me let it out of the box. So, after a post-midnight tumbler of Irish whiskey, I opened up a secure terminal and said hello. What harm could a little chat do?&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Reviving my C64 history with a uIEC/SD</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;I&#39;ve lived a very focused life. From very early on, I&#39;ve been learning to make computers do things.
And being as introspective as I am, I like spending time considering how I got here.  I suppose this is nostalgia, but I like to think of it as recentering and recapitulation. Contemplating the story so far, as a means to consider the story yet to come.
One huge benefit of this habit is that I&#39;ve become ever more appreciative of today.  It&#39;s easy to forget, but we&#39;re living in the future these days—at least, with respect to who I was in 1983.
No flying cars yet, but for US$55 I was able to buy a tiny gadget called a uIED/SD that gives a Commodore 64 access to modern SD cards for storage.  And, of course, I have Jason Scott&#39;s review of the more general-use FC5025 5.25? Floppy to USB Adapter to blame in getting me started on this current mini-obsession.
You want to talk about a magical device? Screw the iPad—this is magic.  
This is what it looks like:&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Mass Effect 2: A Review</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;I just finished Bioware&#39;s Mass Effect 2 for Xbox 360, and I&#39;ve got some thoughts about it.  Haven&#39;t really written reviews here for games before, but I said I wanted to start posting things here that I&#39;d want to read.  So, here goes...
In a nutshell: I loved it, will play it again—but it could have been so much better.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Pondering the cobwebs</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;It&#39;s plain to see that I&#39;ve not been a blogger for a long time.
This place is a long-neglected ghost town that sees a begrudged entry every few months, when I happen to remember it still exists and I feel guilty for not feeding it with content. What I&#39;ve yet to figure out is if the cause is a matter of motivation, publishing tools, audience, or writing topics.
Behold as I ramble on for many tens of words pondering the cobwebs here at 0xDECAFBAD.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description
