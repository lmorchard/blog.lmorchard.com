But, none of that says they&#39;ve found a home or that it will be easy to transplant if they do. In the meantime, there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty and probably only an overworked skeleton crew left onboard.</p>\n<p>Much of Delicious now depends on home-grown technology that is shared by many other Yahoo! properties. This should not be a surprise: Beyond the money, <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2005/12/09/yahoo-acquires-delicious/\">that was kind of the point of selling to Yahoo! in particular</a>. As a major search company in 2005, they presumably had the indexing mojo help scale it up. So, transferring the site to a new technology stack will definitely figure into the value proposition of anyone looking to take over Delicious. </p>\n<p>In short, any buyers of Delicious will have their hands full—probably more so than Yahoo! did when they first bought it. Don&#39;t hold your breath for a bright future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-cares\">Who cares?</h2>\n<p>What it comes down to this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you use Delicious regularly, you care about your bookmarks. </li>\n<li>If you&#39;re part of an interest group, you care about their bookmarks and they about yours.</li>\n<li>If you&#39;re a random web surfer, you care about finding things relevant to your interests.</li>\n<li>If you&#39;re Yahoo!—well, I would have thought you cared about building a human-powered index of the web, but who knows where your collective heads are at these days.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The important thing is that no owners of Delicious will care in particular about #1 and #2—that is, your bookmarks and those of your colleagues. If they care about anything, it&#39;s the overall value of a well-indexed set of web resources to #3 and how they can monetize that.</p>\n<p>In other words: If they can&#39;t figure out how to monetize the aggregate index, <a href=\"http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Why_Back_Up%3F\">don&#39;t expect them to start caring about your data</a>.

What made Delicious hard is what made it interesting, and it&#39;s possible that no one service will ever again reach a critical mass in social bookmarking.</p>\n<p>But, I don&#39;t think Delicious could have scaled up forever and stayed interesting.

All of these bookmarks would be somehow merged to produce intelligent data.\nKind of what Automattic does with WordPress.org and WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>Aside, this new Delicious system should have a more \"sharing\" side with ability for networkers to comment on each bookmark, \"redeli\" the bookmark (like retweet), etc... Unite bookmark and twitter functions - What Yahoo! should have try to developp during these past five years and failed to.\nI already tried to find some link posted in the past in my Twitter stream, and it made me really angry and frustrated. And I didn't succeed. Twitter is nice but still has a too bad signal-to-noise ratio : Tweets are way too much passing, impossible to organized, and replies are not enough differentiated from normal tweet.</p>\n<p>What could be an ideal way to go is a WordPress plugin. Based on already there custom post type system, tags system, comments sytem...\nWordPress is already a successful product, widely used. It would make easier the process of leaving current doomed delicious to a decentralized system.</p>\n<p>And Automattic should integrate this plugin to their WordPress.com blogs. They even would not have to buy Delicious to Yahoo!, just spread the word and invite people to subscribe to their service and import their delicious data.</p>\n<p>Finally, imagine that Automattic creates a subdomain of wordpress.com where all the data (bookmarks and data) would be gathered. The plugin on self hosted blogs would propose to the owner to share his personal bookmarks data with this website via an API.\nA network could be based on wordpress.com optional subscription.</p>\n<p>I don't have any personal or business interest in Automattic (just a WordPress user) but it seems the perfect way to go.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087684\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087684\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T16:49:26\">2010-12-20T16:49:26</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>@Rogers: Yeah, I totally glossed over the horrors of sysadmin work and security.

There are interesting alternatives that don't involve handing everything over to someone who doesn't actually care about you and your stuff.\r\n\r\nAnd, if it turns out that social bookmarking settles down into a small but highly involved niche of curators, so much the better that they keep their own lights on.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087678\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://workbench.cadenhead.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=70fe121c9172e9882762d7f28f233567&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://workbench.cadenhead.org/\">Rogers Cadenhead</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087678\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T05:44:29\">2010-12-20T05:44:29</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hosting is cheap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Running web applications on your own server securely and reliably is expensive, assuming you value your own time.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087680\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bb266673ec59acafd5d3ed68238551a5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">JB</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087680\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T10:05:58\">2010-12-20T10:05:58</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I really like this article.\r\nThere should indeed be a system where you can self-host your bookmarks with some CMS and a centralized site for less techy people. All of these bookmarks would be somehow merged to produce intelligent data.\r\nKind of what Automattic does with WordPress.org and WordPress.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside, this new Delicious system should have a more \"sharing\" side with ability for networkers to comment on each bookmark, \"redeli\" the bookmark (like retweet), etc... Unite bookmark and twitter functions - What Yahoo! should have try to developp during these past five years and failed to.\r\nI already tried to find some link posted in the past in my Twitter stream, and it made me really angry and frustrated. And I didn't succeed. Twitter is nice but still has a too bad signal-to-noise ratio : Tweets are way too much passing, impossible to organized, and replies are not enough differentiated from normal tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What could be an ideal way to go is a WordPress plugin. Based on already there custom post type system, tags system, comments sytem...\r\nWordPress is already a successful product, widely used. It would make easier the process of leaving current doomed delicious to a decentralized system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Automattic should integrate this plugin to their WordPress.com blogs. They even would not have to buy Delicious to Yahoo!, just spread the word and invite people to subscribe to their service and import their delicious data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, imagine that Automattic creates a subdomain of wordpress.com where all the data (bookmarks and data) would be gathered. The plugin on self hosted blogs would propose to the owner to share his personal bookmarks data with this website via an API.\r\nA network could be based on wordpress.com optional subscription.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't have any personal or business interest in Automattic (just a WordPress user) but it seems the perfect way to go.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087684\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087684\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T16:49:26\">2010-12-20T16:49:26</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@Rogers: Yeah, I totally glossed over the horrors of sysadmin work and security.
