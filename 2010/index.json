But, none of that says they&#39;ve found a home or that it will be easy to transplant if they do. In the meantime, there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty and probably only an overworked skeleton crew left onboard.</p>\n<p>Much of Delicious now depends on home-grown technology that is shared by many other Yahoo! properties. This should not be a surprise: Beyond the money, <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2005/12/09/yahoo-acquires-delicious/\">that was kind of the point of selling to Yahoo! in particular</a>. As a major search company in 2005, they presumably had the indexing mojo help scale it up. So, transferring the site to a new technology stack will definitely figure into the value proposition of anyone looking to take over Delicious. </p>\n<p>In short, any buyers of Delicious will have their hands full—probably more so than Yahoo! did when they first bought it. Don&#39;t hold your breath for a bright future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-cares\">Who cares?</h2>\n<p>What it comes down to this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you use Delicious regularly, you care about your bookmarks. </li>\n<li>If you&#39;re part of an interest group, you care about their bookmarks and they about yours.</li>\n<li>If you&#39;re a random web surfer, you care about finding things relevant to your interests.</li>\n<li>If you&#39;re Yahoo!—well, I would have thought you cared about building a human-powered index of the web, but who knows where your collective heads are at these days.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The important thing is that no owners of Delicious will care in particular about #1 and #2—that is, your bookmarks and those of your colleagues. If they care about anything, it&#39;s the overall value of a well-indexed set of web resources to #3 and how they can monetize that.</p>\n<p>In other words: If they can&#39;t figure out how to monetize the aggregate index, <a href=\"http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Why_Back_Up%3F\">don&#39;t expect them to start caring about your data</a>.

Also, hosting is getting cheaper every day. Gamers host servers for themselves and their friends, so why not start thinking about hosting a social bookmarking server for interesting people by invite?

What made Delicious hard is what made it interesting, and it&#39;s possible that no one service will ever again reach a critical mass in social bookmarking.</p>\n<p>But, I don&#39;t think Delicious could have scaled up forever and stayed interesting.

All of these bookmarks would be somehow merged to produce intelligent data.\nKind of what Automattic does with WordPress.org and WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>Aside, this new Delicious system should have a more \"sharing\" side with ability for networkers to comment on each bookmark, \"redeli\" the bookmark (like retweet), etc... Unite bookmark and twitter functions - What Yahoo! should have try to developp during these past five years and failed to.\nI already tried to find some link posted in the past in my Twitter stream, and it made me really angry and frustrated. And I didn't succeed. Twitter is nice but still has a too bad signal-to-noise ratio : Tweets are way too much passing, impossible to organized, and replies are not enough differentiated from normal tweet.</p>\n<p>What could be an ideal way to go is a WordPress plugin. Based on already there custom post type system, tags system, comments sytem...\nWordPress is already a successful product, widely used. It would make easier the process of leaving current doomed delicious to a decentralized system.</p>\n<p>And Automattic should integrate this plugin to their WordPress.com blogs. They even would not have to buy Delicious to Yahoo!, just spread the word and invite people to subscribe to their service and import their delicious data.</p>\n<p>Finally, imagine that Automattic creates a subdomain of wordpress.com where all the data (bookmarks and data) would be gathered. The plugin on self hosted blogs would propose to the owner to share his personal bookmarks data with this website via an API.\nA network could be based on wordpress.com optional subscription.</p>\n<p>I don't have any personal or business interest in Automattic (just a WordPress user) but it seems the perfect way to go.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087684\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087684\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T16:49:26\">2010-12-20T16:49:26</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>@Rogers: Yeah, I totally glossed over the horrors of sysadmin work and security.

There are interesting alternatives that don't involve handing everything over to someone who doesn't actually care about you and your stuff.\r\n\r\nAnd, if it turns out that social bookmarking settles down into a small but highly involved niche of curators, so much the better that they keep their own lights on.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087678\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://workbench.cadenhead.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=70fe121c9172e9882762d7f28f233567&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://workbench.cadenhead.org/\">Rogers Cadenhead</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087678\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T05:44:29\">2010-12-20T05:44:29</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hosting is cheap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Running web applications on your own server securely and reliably is expensive, assuming you value your own time.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087680\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bb266673ec59acafd5d3ed68238551a5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">JB</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087680\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T10:05:58\">2010-12-20T10:05:58</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I really like this article.\r\nThere should indeed be a system where you can self-host your bookmarks with some CMS and a centralized site for less techy people. All of these bookmarks would be somehow merged to produce intelligent data.\r\nKind of what Automattic does with WordPress.org and WordPress.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside, this new Delicious system should have a more \"sharing\" side with ability for networkers to comment on each bookmark, \"redeli\" the bookmark (like retweet), etc... Unite bookmark and twitter functions - What Yahoo! should have try to developp during these past five years and failed to.\r\nI already tried to find some link posted in the past in my Twitter stream, and it made me really angry and frustrated. And I didn't succeed. Twitter is nice but still has a too bad signal-to-noise ratio : Tweets are way too much passing, impossible to organized, and replies are not enough differentiated from normal tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What could be an ideal way to go is a WordPress plugin. Based on already there custom post type system, tags system, comments sytem...\r\nWordPress is already a successful product, widely used. It would make easier the process of leaving current doomed delicious to a decentralized system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Automattic should integrate this plugin to their WordPress.com blogs. They even would not have to buy Delicious to Yahoo!, just spread the word and invite people to subscribe to their service and import their delicious data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, imagine that Automattic creates a subdomain of wordpress.com where all the data (bookmarks and data) would be gathered. The plugin on self hosted blogs would propose to the owner to share his personal bookmarks data with this website via an API.\r\nA network could be based on wordpress.com optional subscription.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't have any personal or business interest in Automattic (just a WordPress user) but it seems the perfect way to go.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087684\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087684\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T16:49:26\">2010-12-20T16:49:26</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@Rogers: Yeah, I totally glossed over the horrors of sysadmin work and security.

    "html": "<p><em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/firefox-sync-appengine\">I built an implementation</a> of the <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Sync/1.0/API\">Firefox Sync server API</a> for <a href=\"http://appengine.google.com/\">Google App Engine</a>.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\" style=\"float: right; padding: 0 0 0em 0em; display: block; text-decoration: none; border: none\"><img src=\"http://mozcom-cdn.mozilla.net/img/firefox/sync/sync-background.png\" style=\"border: none\" /></a></p>\n<p>To celebrate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_%28United_States%29\">Independence Day</a>, I figured I might take a shot at liberating <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\">Firefox Sync</a> from the tyranny of <a href=\"https://services.mozilla.com/\">Mozilla&#39;s servers</a>. </p>\n<p>Thus, over the past few days, I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/firefox-sync-appengine\">built a sync server</a> using the <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Sync/1.0/API\">1.0 Sync API</a>, hosted on <a href=\"http://appengine.google.com/\">Google App Engine</a>.</p>\n<p>I lied about the <em>tyranny</em> thing, though—I just wanted to say something clever about the holiday. In reality, with respect to <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\">Firefox Sync</a>, Mozilla has done all of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Published <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Sync/1.0/API\">the Sync API spec</a>;</li>\n<li>Released <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/services/sync-server/\">the source code for the server used in-house</a>;</li>\n<li>Explicitly included the option to use a custom server when setting up sync in the browser.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This means that, although Mozilla offers servers to go along with <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\">Firefox Sync</a>, you&#39;re totally free to take your data elsewhere. Since your sync data is encrypted and practically opaque to the server, there&#39;s no direct profit for Mozilla in offering free sync hosting—not even through any clandestine data mining for devious purposes. It&#39;s just that sync makes Firefox a better browser, and <em>somebody</em> has to run some servers to make it work.</p>\n<p>So, there&#39;s every incentive to make it easy for you to switch sync providers and <em>stop freeloading</em> on Mozilla&#39;s servers. Building a server on <a href=\"http://appengine.google.com/\">Google App Engine</a> means I can freeload on <em>Google&#39;s</em> servers!</p>\n<p>I kid, of course. No one&#39;s really complaining about freeloaders, and App Engine has quotas in place to head off any serious mooching—which is why I&#39;m not telling you where to find <em>my</em> sync server deployed on Google App Engine, by the way. </p>\n<p>No, I did this because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firefox Sync and Google App Engine are interesting and important technologies;</li>\n<li>I&#39;ve already done a bit of work on the PHP-based Firefox Sync server at Mozilla;</li>\n<li>I really wanted to take a break from PHP and spend some time with my old friend Python.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are, of course, a number of bugs in this server. But, it seems to be working between a number of machines and browser profiles I have at home. Things are really in need of optimization, it suffers from my inexperience with App Engine, and I keep running into those aforementioned App Engine resource limits—especially when updating or deleting large numbers of items (ie. 1000&#39;s to 10000&#39;s of items).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/firefox-sync-appengine\"><em>Pull requests and issue reports on GitHub are welcome!</em></a></p>\n<p>A next step I&#39;d like to take with this thing is to revisit another old friend, the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer\">desktop web app server</a>. (Also known as the <a href=\"http://www.scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/04/desktopWebsites.html#4\">desktop website</a>.) It seems to me that it would be interesting to scale this server down to a household appliance—say, just for use by my wife and I.</p>\n<p>I&#39;d be especially happy if the work I&#39;m doing for a Google-hosted app could be self-hosted at home. Seeing as the development environment for App Engine runs on my laptop, I&#39;m willing to bet I can hack the whole shebang into a simple, special-purpose app to download and double-click on a home desktop PC for use as your sync hub.</p>\n<p>Anyway, <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/firefox-sync-appengine\">check it out</a> and let me know what you think.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088097\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://coffeeonthekeyboard.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8371744716a9335eb3dcae228fd9d996&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://coffeeonthekeyboard.com/\">James Socol</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088097\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-07-06T01:28:02\">2010-07-06T01:28:02</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Assuming you already had a network and a Mac Mini or something at home, it would be pretty interesting to run your own small Sync server just to keep your home computers together.

    "body": "<em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> [I built an implementation][impl] of the [Firefox Sync server API][api10] for [Google App Engine][appengine].</em>\r\n\r\n[impl]: http://github.com/lmorchard/firefox-sync-appengine\r\n[api10]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Sync/1.0/API\r\n[appengine]: http://appengine.google.com/\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\" style=\"float: right; padding: 0 0 0em 0em; display: block; text-decoration: none; border: none\"><img src=\"http://mozcom-cdn.mozilla.net/img/firefox/sync/sync-background.png\" style=\"border: none\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTo celebrate [Independence Day][july4], I figured I might take a shot at liberating [Firefox Sync][sync] from the tyranny of [Mozilla's servers][servers]. \r\n\r\nThus, over the past few days, I've [built a sync server][impl] using the [1.0 Sync API][api10], hosted on [Google App Engine][appengine].\r\n\r\nI lied about the *tyranny* thing, though—I just wanted to say something clever about the holiday. In reality, with respect to [Firefox Sync][sync], Mozilla has done all of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Published [the Sync API spec][api10];\r\n2. Released [the source code for the server used in-house][sync-server];\r\n3. Explicitly included the option to use a custom server when setting up sync in the browser.\r\n\r\nThis means that, although Mozilla offers servers to go along with [Firefox Sync][sync], you're totally free to take your data elsewhere. Since your sync data is encrypted and practically opaque to the server, there's no direct profit for Mozilla in offering free sync hosting—not even through any clandestine data mining for devious purposes. It's just that sync makes Firefox a better browser, and *somebody* has to run some servers to make it work.\r\n\r\nSo, there's every incentive to make it easy for you to switch sync providers and *stop freeloading* on Mozilla's servers. Building a server on [Google App Engine][appengine] means I can freeload on *Google's* servers!\r\n\r\nI kid, of course. No one's really complaining about freeloaders, and App Engine has quotas in place to head off any serious mooching—which is why I'm not telling you where to find *my* sync server deployed on Google App Engine, by the way. \r\n\r\nNo, I did this because:\r\n\r\n* Firefox Sync and Google App Engine are interesting and important technologies;\r\n* I've already done a bit of work on the PHP-based Firefox Sync server at Mozilla;\r\n* I really wanted to take a break from PHP and spend some time with my old friend Python.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, a number of bugs in this server. But, it seems to be working between a number of machines and browser profiles I have at home. Things are really in need of optimization, it suffers from my inexperience with App Engine, and I keep running into those aforementioned App Engine resource limits—especially when updating or deleting large numbers of items (ie. 1000's to 10000's of items).\r\n\r\n[*Pull requests and issue reports on GitHub are welcome!*][impl]\r\n\r\nA next step I'd like to take with this thing is to revisit another old friend, the [desktop web app server][desktopserver]. (Also known as the [desktop website][dw].) It seems to me that it would be interesting to scale this server down to a household appliance—say, just for use by my wife and I.\r\n\r\nI'd be especially happy if the work I'm doing for a Google-hosted app could be self-hosted at home. Seeing as the development environment for App Engine runs on my laptop, I'm willing to bet I can hack the whole shebang into a simple, special-purpose app to download and double-click on a home desktop PC for use as your sync hub.\r\n\r\nAnyway, [check it out][impl] and let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n[dw]: http://www.scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/04/desktopWebsites.html#4\r\n[dave]: http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html\r\n[desktopserver]: http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer\r\n[sync-server]: http://hg.mozilla.org/services/sync-server/\r\n[july4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_%28United_States%29\r\n[sync]: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\r\n[servers]: https://services.mozilla.com/\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088097\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://coffeeonthekeyboard.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8371744716a9335eb3dcae228fd9d996&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://coffeeonthekeyboard.com/\">James Socol</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088097\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-07-06T01:28:02\">2010-07-06T01:28:02</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Assuming you already had a network and a Mac Mini or something at home, it would be pretty interesting to run your own small Sync server just to keep your home computers together.

    "html": "<p>I just finished Bioware&#39;s Mass Effect 2 for Xbox 360, and I&#39;ve got some thoughts about it.  Haven&#39;t really written reviews here for games before, but I said I wanted to start posting things here that I&#39;d want to read.  So, here goes...</p>\n<p>In a nutshell: I loved it, will play it again—but it could have been so much better.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3 id=\"mass-effect-1-the-obsession\">Mass Effect 1: The Obsession</h3>\n<p>After having had a blast playing through <a href=\"http://sc2.sourceforge.net/\">Star Control 2 / The Ur-Quan Masters</a> and loving the classic (albeit pulpy) sci-fi storyline, someone suggested <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect 1</a> would feel like a modern remake.  I forget who it was, but they were right.  Galactic exploration, negotiation between alien races, even taking a moon patrol buggy (a.k.a. the Mako) down to planets for resource gathering—it all matched up pretty well and compared very favorably.</p>\n<p>So, I was set up to be impressed.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect 1</a> was <em>cinematic</em>—even down to the film grain simulation in graphics options.  It was also the first major next-gen console game I spent any time with on a nice, big HDTV.  </p>\n<p>The storyline gave me a nice <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder\">sensawunda</a>, like a season of a well-made sci-fi series like <a href=\"http://www.henson.com/fantasy_scifi.php?content=farscape\">Farscape</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1\">Stargate SG-1</a>.  I actually cared about what happened in the dialog sequences, and I wanted to explore those bits equally alongside combat and planetary exploration.  I actually said &quot;Whoa,&quot; when I first saw the inside of the Citadel, with its massive cylindrical interior dotted with neighborhoods and landscaping.  I read all the Codex entries and planet descriptions to soak in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding\">worldbuilding</a>.</p>\n<p>And then there were the art and music direction of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect 1</a>, both of which were note-perfect for me.  </p>\n<p>The art was like the future <a href=\"http://www.atarimuseum.com/otherprojects/bionics/proto/index.html\">Atari computer designers had envisioned</a>, all clean surfaces and angles.  </p>\n<p>The music was like a modern Vangelis soundtrack for an alternate reality Blade Runner.  The transition from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhN4CUG4ek\">Eden Prime</a> to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdfc4GVPsRk\">Battle at Eden Prime</a> was a great build-up of suspense in the opening mission.  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9SiMTmCqvI&amp;feature=related\">The Citadel</a> was a big <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder\">sensawunda</a> moment—in fact, the whole soundtrack had a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder\">sensawunda</a> thread throughout. You might be on a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph6XcHu9ZB8&amp;feature=related\">dangerous safari</a>, but damn if it ain&#39;t an awesome universe to do it in.</p>\n<p>At the end—spoiler alert—they surprised me by carrying through the total feel of an 80&#39;s movie with a <em>real band</em> playing out the closing credits. It was a total &quot;the end&quot; kind of song that you&#39;d walk out of a theater listening to, all jazzed about the show you&#39;d just seen.  The first things I did after the game ended was to look up that song (<a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M4_Part_II\">M4 Part II</a> by <a href=\"http://www.faunts.com/\">Faunts</a>), buy that band&#39;s albums, and then buy the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XXWKAW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000XXWKAW\" title=\"Mass Effect Original Game Soundtrack\">game soundtrack</a>.  </p>\n<p>During a plane ride to California, I watched <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lPsGxJhyq4\">the making-of videos</a> on my iPod Touch.  I bought an <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/3501486581/\">SR1 hat</a> when I got back home.  </p>\n<p>I have done these things before for favorite movies, but only rarely for games.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-i-liked-in-me2\">What I liked in ME2</h3>\n<p>So... that brings me to <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">Mass Effect 2</a>, and the large shoes it had to fill.</p>\n<p>As a game, <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> is much improved over <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> in many ways.  They&#39;ve streamlined a lot of fiddly tedium in the gameplay; amped up the combat to compete with other cover-based shooters; backed away from the cookie-cutter procedural environments to hand-craft all missions.</p>\n<p>That last part, hand-crafting every mission, is easily the biggest improvement.  In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>, nearly every mission was a <a href=\"http://www.madlibs.com/\">Mad Libs</a> mashup of some pre-fab warehouse / mine / space station; an assortment of cloned enemies; some loot lockers; and maybe a unique objective or two.  I still liked it: dungeon-crawlers like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_%28video_game%29\">Diablo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.torchlightgame.com/\">Torchlight</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nethack.org/\">Nethack</a> are fun, and I have an even softer spot for space opera than fantasy.  </p>\n<p>But, <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> clearly shows more effort in mission design.  It&#39;s obvious that a human being spent many, many hours building every environment rather than just filling out a few data structures with object IDs and sketching out simple maps.  I&#39;m sure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> was more involved than I make it out to be, but the fact that <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> spans two discs alone is a testament to the extra effort.</p>\n<p>Oh, and the new &quot;circuit bypass&quot; and &quot;code hacking&quot; mini-games? They&#39;re a <em>huge</em> improvement over the all-purpose &quot;Simon&quot; game from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>.  I miss having the cheating option to just throw some omnigel at a locked door, but I don&#39;t have the overstuffed inventory to constantly recycle into wonderstuff any more either.</p>\n<p>In terms of the story, well, it has a very brief main arc accompanied by a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales\">Canterbury Tales</a> parade of side-stories for everyone you need to recruit to go up against the <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Collectors\">Collectors</a>.  The <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Collectors\">Collectors</a> are very definitely bad—but, all told, you rarely see them in the act of doing bad things.  They&#39;re less of a constant nemesis, and more of a looming threat that will nonetheless wait until you&#39;re done puttering around with your sniper&#39;s family problems.</p>\n<p>Really, the <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Collectors\">Collectors</a> felt like a blatant <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macguffin\">MacGuffin</a> for getting Shepard involved in the lives of some interesting characters.  I <em>did</em> find most of those characters interesting, so I was able to go with it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"its-a-small-world\">It&#39;s a small world</h3>\n<p>What I missed in the story, though, was a real sense of exploration and worldbuilding.  I guess maybe they figured they got it all out of the way in the previous season and just wanted to plow through with action in the second.</p>\n<p>I <em>was</em> expecting Omega to be the &quot;anti-Citadel&quot;, though, so I was a bit disappointed to find that the area was so sparse and small.

    "body": "I just finished Bioware's Mass Effect 2 for Xbox 360, and I've got some thoughts about it.  Haven't really written reviews here for games before, but I said I wanted to start posting things here that I'd want to read.  So, here goes...\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell: I loved it, will play it again—but it could have been so much better.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n### Mass Effect 1: The Obsession\r\n\r\nAfter having had a blast playing through [Star Control 2 / The Ur-Quan Masters][urquan] and loving the classic (albeit pulpy) sci-fi storyline, someone suggested [Mass Effect 1][me1] would feel like a modern remake.  I forget who it was, but they were right.  Galactic exploration, negotiation between alien races, even taking a moon patrol buggy (a.k.a. the Mako) down to planets for resource gathering—it all matched up pretty well and compared very favorably.\r\n\r\nSo, I was set up to be impressed.  [Mass Effect 1][me1] was *cinematic*—even down to the film grain simulation in graphics options.  It was also the first major next-gen console game I spent any time with on a nice, big HDTV.  \r\n\r\nThe storyline gave me a nice [sensawunda][sensawunda], like a season of a well-made sci-fi series like [Farscape][farscape] or [Stargate SG-1][sg1].  I actually cared about what happened in the dialog sequences, and I wanted to explore those bits equally alongside combat and planetary exploration.  I actually said \"Whoa,\" when I first saw the inside of the Citadel, with its massive cylindrical interior dotted with neighborhoods and landscaping.  I read all the Codex entries and planet descriptions to soak in the [worldbuilding][].\r\n\r\n[worldbuilding]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding\r\n\r\nAnd then there were the art and music direction of [Mass Effect 1][me1], both of which were note-perfect for me.  \r\n\r\nThe art was like the future [Atari computer designers had envisioned][ataridesign], all clean surfaces and angles.  \r\n\r\nThe music was like a modern Vangelis soundtrack for an alternate reality Blade Runner.  The transition from [Eden Prime][eden-prime] to [Battle at Eden Prime][edenbattle] was a great build-up of suspense in the opening mission.  [The Citadel][citadel] was a big [sensawunda][] moment—in fact, the whole soundtrack had a [sensawunda][] thread throughout. You might be on a [dangerous safari][virmire], but damn if it ain't an awesome universe to do it in.\r\n\r\n[eden-prime]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhN4CUG4ek\r\n[edenbattle]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdfc4GVPsRk\r\n[virmire]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph6XcHu9ZB8&feature=related\r\n[citadel]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9SiMTmCqvI&feature=related\r\n[presidium]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7V6P8MUwKw&feature=related\r\n\r\nAt the end—spoiler alert—they surprised me by carrying through the total feel of an 80's movie with a *real band* playing out the closing credits. It was a total \"the end\" kind of song that you'd walk out of a theater listening to, all jazzed about the show you'd just seen.  The first things I did after the game ended was to look up that song ([M4 Part II][m4] by [Faunts][faunts]), buy that band's albums, and then buy the [game soundtrack][me1soundtrack].  \r\n\r\nDuring a plane ride to California, I watched [the making-of videos][makingof] on my iPod Touch.  I bought an [SR1 hat][sr1hat] when I got back home.  \r\n\r\nI have done these things before for favorite movies, but only rarely for games.\r\n\r\n### What I liked in ME2\r\n\r\nSo... that brings me to [Mass Effect 2][me2], and the large shoes it had to fill.\r\n\r\nAs a game, [ME2][me2] is much improved over [ME1][me1] in many ways.  They've streamlined a lot of fiddly tedium in the gameplay; amped up the combat to compete with other cover-based shooters; backed away from the cookie-cutter procedural environments to hand-craft all missions.\r\n\r\nThat last part, hand-crafting every mission, is easily the biggest improvement.  In [ME1][me1], nearly every mission was a [Mad Libs][madlibs] mashup of some pre-fab warehouse / mine / space station; an assortment of cloned enemies; some loot lockers; and maybe a unique objective or two.  I still liked it: dungeon-crawlers like [Diablo][diablo] and [Torchlight][torchlight] and [Nethack][nethack] are fun, and I have an even softer spot for space opera than fantasy.  \r\n\r\nBut, [ME2][] clearly shows more effort in mission design.  It's obvious that a human being spent many, many hours building every environment rather than just filling out a few data structures with object IDs and sketching out simple maps.  I'm sure [ME1][] was more involved than I make it out to be, but the fact that [ME2][] spans two discs alone is a testament to the extra effort.\r\n\r\nOh, and the new \"circuit bypass\" and \"code hacking\" mini-games? They're a *huge* improvement over the all-purpose \"Simon\" game from [ME1][].  I miss having the cheating option to just throw some omnigel at a locked door, but I don't have the overstuffed inventory to constantly recycle into wonderstuff any more either.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the story, well, it has a very brief main arc accompanied by a [Canterbury Tales][chaucer] parade of side-stories for everyone you need to recruit to go up against the [Collectors][].  The [Collectors][] are very definitely bad—but, all told, you rarely see them in the act of doing bad things.  They're less of a constant nemesis, and more of a looming threat that will nonetheless wait until you're done puttering around with your sniper's family problems.\r\n\r\nReally, the [Collectors][] felt like a blatant [MacGuffin][] for getting Shepard involved in the lives of some interesting characters.  I *did* find most of those characters interesting, so I was able to go with it.\r\n\r\n[chaucer]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales\r\n[macguffin]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macguffin\r\n[collectors]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Collectors\r\n\r\n### It's a small world\r\n\r\nWhat I missed in the story, though, was a real sense of exploration and worldbuilding.  I guess maybe they figured they got it all out of the way in the previous season and just wanted to plow through with action in the second.\r\n\r\nI *was* expecting Omega to be the \"anti-Citadel\", though, so I was a bit disappointed to find that the area was so sparse and small. Instead of a load of nooks and crannies to wander through, I got a few bare floors of grunge leading straight to objectives.  I really wanted to spend some time digging into the place in the talk-to-every-villager style of most RPGs.  Instead, I got a seedy nightclub, some shops, and an apartment—that's it.\r\n\r\nIn fact, although the Citadel returned and the Asari world Ilium was introduced in [ME2][], I felt like they were mere shadows of what [ME1][] offered.  I guess the flip side of having the hand-crafted environments throughout the rest of the game's missions means that the hub worlds suffer.  \r\n\r\nAnother weird thing were the news reports on various terminals, mentioning things happening throughout the galaxy.  In [ME1][], hearing about trouble and raids on colonies were the starting points for side missions.  In [ME2][], they were just random fluff and color.  I'm not sure why they bothered with the content, to be honest.\r\n\r\n### Mediocre art and music\r\n\r\nStyle-wise, [ME2][] stripped out a lot of what I adored about [ME1][], coming very close to making it *just another game* rather than *a work of art*.  You can call me nuts—and probably already have, though strangely you're still reading—but yes: I thought [ME1][] was special.\r\n\r\nThe music in [ME2][] is largely forgettable. There's an orchestra with horns and strings, and occasionally a chorus chants.  Sometimes, there are bells and triangles.  There were no themes that stuck with me, other than maybe the end-of-mission report jingle.  It's just like every other modern video game with a big budget.\r\n\r\nAt least they kept something like [Uncharted Worlds][uncharted] from [ME1][] for the Galaxy Map.\r\n\r\n[uncharted]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMyu9kehCVY&feature=related\r\n\r\nThe art direction in [ME2][] also strays toward mediocrity.  [ME1][] was *stylized*, all clean surfaces and sleek angles.  It was nostalgic and [optimistic][optimisticscifi], something refreshing.  (See also: [The New Star Trek][newstartrek].)\r\n\r\n[ME2][] introduces more grime & dirt—it's \"grittier\" and more \"realistic\". Just like every other modern video game with a big budget.\r\n\r\nBut, you know what? \"Realism\" and \"grit\" are so last-decade—I'm sick of it. If I'd wanted to play [Gears of War][gow], I'd play it.  I didn't. I watched [Battlestar Galactica][bsg]—it was good; it's over now. \r\n\r\n### R.I.P. M35 Mako\r\n\r\nThey also killed the [M35 Mako][mako], replacing it with a tedious planet-scanning mini-game.  No more endless alien skies over suited-up away teams, unless you're on a mission and don't have time to look up anyway.\r\n\r\n[mako]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M35_Mako\r\n\r\nSure, there were pain-in-the-ass 89.999º inclines to navigate with the I-think-I-can moon patrol buggy and its annoying jump-jets that would throw you right off a mile-high mountain peak with a slipped button press.  But, I'd take all of those flaws versus painstakingly dragging a pokey reticule across a textured sphere hoping for a spiky waveform and bit of vibration in my lap.  \r\n\r\nIf there's an away team to be assembled for scouring a planetary surface in-person, I'm your man.

No hand-crafting needed here, just give me some bug hunts and make the Collectors seem like a serious and constant threat.  Hell, give me a scoreboard of Collector versus Colonist body count for extra fun.\r\n\r\n### Dragon Age got my hopes up\r\n\r\nIn another [BioWare][] game, [Dragon Age][], [I got sucked in despite my so-so attraction to fantasy stories][dragonage].  The main thing came down to dialog and character interactions, and a departure from the general [Paragon / Renegade system][me-morality] of [ME1][].  \r\n\r\nIn [Dragon Age][], you get [*per-character* approval meters][approval].  This means that what endears one character may repulse another.  So, if you want to try to please or at least gain respect from everyone you recruit, you need to be careful about who you bring on which quests and what you do in the course of accomplishing goals.  The occasional deep conversation or gift helps, too.  It makes the game surprisingly rich.\r\n\r\n[approval]: http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Approval\r\n\r\nAssuming that [BioWare][] has a set of technologies and notions they carry from game to game, I expected to see this sort of thing pop up in [ME2][].\r\n\r\nNo such luck.\r\n\r\nInstead, you get the same [Paragon / Renegade system][me-morality] that opens up special options in dialog as before, and [a simple binary not-loyal / loyal state][me2-loyalty] for each of your squaddies depending on whether you completed their respective special-attention missions.  Makes for fun additional missions, but is relatively boring overall.\r\n\r\n### I'd play it again, and I'll play Mass Effect 3\r\n\r\nI grouse, but it's out of love.\r\n\r\n[Mass Effect 1][me1] hit all the right spots for me as a sci-fi adventure and a storytelling experience in general. There's no way I wouldn't play [Mass Effect 2][me2], and I'll be right in line for Mass Effect 3.

I&#39;ve got a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/ffa/lmorchard\">local archive of my activity</a>, and have been meaning to make a self-hosted lifestream more front-and-center, but I&#39;ve been too busy to bother.</p>\n<h2 id=\"publishing-tools\">Publishing tools</h2>\n<p>In fact, I&#39;ve been thinking about killing my WordPress installation here altogether, and switching the blog over to a static fossil snapshot.  Since I rarely post, there&#39;s rarely a comment inbound here these days that&#39;s not trying to slip through an ad for pills or fake handbags. Thus, most of the CPU cycles on my web host are spent on busy work processing requests that will never amount to anything real. So, why bother having an actual PHP application running here?</p>\n<p>The one thing that I haven&#39;t done a lot of lately—and would like to carve out time to get back to—is some real long-form writing. You would think that that&#39;s where this WordPress thing would come in handy, but oddly it seems not to. I hate writing in textareas in browsers, haven&#39;t found a desktop blog client that I liked in years.</p>\n<p>So, because of the little things that annoy me, I stop writing before I start because the anticipated process to publish seems like a chore. I&#39;d much rather be writing in MacVim and checking text files into a git repository. Then, I could throw <a href=\"http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a> or something yak-shavingly homebrewed on top of post-receive hooks to do indexing magic and such in static HTML. You know, the stuff that took forever in MovableType back in the day, but decoupled from my actual writing process. </p>\n<p>Huh, now that I describe it, the above sounds like a chore too—but it would be a shiny new toy!  At that point, I wouldn&#39;t be blogging so much as publishing an archive of essays on the web.  But, at least I&#39;d know the format would be future-proof, the platform exploit-resistant, and the overall maintenance less worrisome.  If I had comments, I could even outsource them to another service and run periodic backups to be safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"audience\">Audience</h2>\n<p>But, beyond the mechanisms, there&#39;s who I imagine might be reading this stuff. I hold off on writing a lot of things that could be posted here because they&#39;re maybe not tech-nerdy enough. If it doesn&#39;t have at least one code example, I hesitate to share it here—and if I don&#39;t share it here, I probably don&#39;t share it anywhere.</p>\n<p>And then there&#39;s the thought that whatever I write here, no one will read it if it&#39;s too long.  This entry is mostly written to myself, and I expect a single-digit comment count—most likely zero.  I get the most feedback on the shortest things, which has ultimately lead to Twitter and its 140 character limit yielding some of my most rewarding interactions on the web in years. I post an essay here, and it&#39;s all crickets.</p>\n<p>The exceptions are where I post something really useful, like that article about <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2009/07/15/html5-drag-and-drop\">HTML 5 Drag &amp; Drop</a> or a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/09/01/writing-a-delicious-command-for-ubiquity\">Delicious command for Ubiquity</a>.  That is, of course, a clue if comments and feedback are what I&#39;m after.</p>\n<h2 id=\"writing-topics\">Writing topics</h2>\n<p>So, what could I be writing about these days? Let&#39;s see, I could write about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what I&#39;ve been up to at Mozilla since I started;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/homebrewing/\">brewing beer</a> and roasting coffee at home;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/4389264445/\">retro computing on my C64 and Amiga</a>;</li>\n<li>developing for Palm webOS;</li>\n<li>random thoughts on life;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Huh. That all sounds like a blog, and one I would read myself—though that last one sounds like <a href=\"http://deus-x.livejournal.com/\">my LiveJournal</a>, long neglected since I started dating my wife and got much less emo in general. We probably don&#39;t need to go there so much, but I could probably bore with more even-tempered philosophical expositions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-the-problem\">What&#39;s the problem?</h2>\n<p>I wonder what my real problem is, then? Is it really just a matter of <a href=\"http://www.dawsbrothers.com/2010/03/09/butt-in-the-seat-a-writers-technique/\">butt in the seat</a> that I&#39;m missing?  I write every day—in a paper journal, in wiki pages, in emails, to myself—I just don&#39;t write much here. Maybe all the above is just a collection of excuses.</p>\n<p>Lately, I&#39;ve had this notion that I should try writing and publishing for an earlier version of myself. That is: all these things I end up searching for and researching on the web, I should write them up in a way that I wish had been the first search result in Google. Whatever the topic, if a younger version of me wanted to find it, I should put it out there to be found. Never mind who else I think might read it or (not) comment on it.</p>\n<p>Write for myself, write what I&#39;d want to read—sounds pretty obvious when I put it out there like that. So, is that the deal? Who knows; we&#39;ll see if a change in perspective results in more happenings here.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090129\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ciarang.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=18910207650685d4592d9a6a71528180&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ciarang.com/\">CiaranG</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090129\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:04:04\">2010-03-10T19:04:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I write about stuff (including beer brewing, Amigas and less archaic techy stuff) mostly for the pleasure of my current self, and the amusement of my future self.</p>\n<p>I never considered writing for an earlier version of myself, but then I know for a fact he didn't have a time machine.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090132\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5441ca4708065da7e0467e1470c49653&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\">Carter Rabasa</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090132\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:19:19\">2010-03-10T19:19:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I long ago gave up on the idea of regular blogging.

I don't know how I ended up here, but it looks like last month was the seventh anniversary of my first comment:</p>\n<p>http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/02/20/ooodae</p>\n<p>\"Newly Digital in 1983\" is still one of my favorite stories ever.  You also got me interested in ifiction and flash fiction. (I ended up publishing a few stories on 365tomorrows and Ficlets.)  And this month I'm joining the Mozilla Corporation, partly because I want to work with you and other hackers whose work has influenced me over the years.  Your audience may be small, but we're devoted!  :)</p>\n<p>I moved my own technical blogging to Jekyll recently.  There's a bit less guilt about slow update schedules when I think of it more like a static collection of articles than an online journal.  (And yeah, using a real editor and version control makes it much easier to get longer pieces done.)  I use Planet Venus for my personally-hosted lifestream, though these days most of my friends get my aggregated data via Facebook or Buzz.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090136\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/danmactough.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">danmactough</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090136\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:27:53\">2010-03-10T19:27:53</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I've never used my blog as much as you've used yours -- I've never really been a blogger at all, honestly.</p>\n<p>I like posting code snippets. Maybe I'll check out github at some point, but I've got a 2-year-old now. He's way more fun and interesting than Python or whatever. (I guess that could be interpreted as implying that my wife is NOT more fun and interesting than those things. Rather than explain why that is not the case, I'll just say that we've been together forever, and I love her very much.)</p>\n<p>At any rate, I thought your post merited at least one comment pondering why the commenter does not blog (anymore).</p>\n<p>For my part, it has a lot to do with privacy, I think. I knew before I ever installed blosxom that I didn't want to be a \"blogger.\" I had no interest in sharing my deep thoughts about life, politics, or anything else. I enjoy talking with people; it's not an antisocial thing. It's just that I don't know what long-term ramifications there may be to such free expression. Likewise, you won't see pictures of me and my family generally available on Flickr or Picasa (there may be a handful). Facebook is nothing to me except somewhere to echo my Twitter stream, such as it is (and I've stopped doing that). Brightkite -- forget it! My last.fm profile is about as intimate as I get online.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking about shutting down my WP installation. I really don't use it. The only thing I really use my VPS for is my web-based feed reader.</p>\n<p>All of these blogging, microblogging, and social networking services -- especially the social networking services -- are really interesting to me, though. I will keep hanging around the periphery of them, dipping in a toe here and there.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090137\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://wambatech.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3ba9f5af09024586154461580b546479&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://wambatech.com\">bud</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:44:56\">2010-03-10T19:44:56</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Les I've followed this for a while.

I always wondered if it got many reads, but it was one of my own favorites to write since it was the sort of thing I liked to see on others' blogs.</p>\n<p>Oh, and welcome to Mozilla! I'm back out to Mountain View pretty regularly, so we'll have to hang out sometime.  Might have to pick your brain about Jekyll and how you like mobile hacking.</p>\n<p>@Dan: I'm a bit weird, since most of my friends since the age of 8 have been behind computers, modems, or the internet. And now, my job is almost entirely on the net since I'm telecommuting from my basement 3000 miles away from HQ. So, it's pretty natural for me to live online.</p><p>Still, I have gotten more and more private. My LiveJournal has some entries that I'd never write now, and I'll probably never post religious / political stuff here because it's not worth the debate or potential life / career damage.</p>\n<p>So... yeah, I'll probably never again be a blogger, per se. I don't feel like having a diary online so much as a place where I publish interesting things.</p>\n<p>I think really my thing here is I call myself a writer, so I should probably be doing more of it. :)</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090139\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/danmactough.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">danmactough</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090139\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T20:17:10\">2010-03-10T20:17:10</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Regarding publishing interesting things -- I'm totally with you there.

    "body": "It's plain to see that I've not been a blogger for a long time.\r\n\r\nThis place is a long-neglected ghost town that sees a begrudged entry every few months, when I happen to remember it still exists and I feel guilty for not feeding it with content. What I've yet to figure out is if the cause is a matter of motivation, publishing tools, audience, or writing topics.\r\n\r\nBehold as I ramble on for many tens of words pondering the cobwebs here at 0xDECAFBAD.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nOther outlets have absorbed nearly all of my motivations that once prompted casual blogging. And those other outlets, in most cases, provide better rewards:\r\n\r\n* For quick top-of-the-head thoughts and quips, [Twitter](http://twitter.com/lmorchard) works best for the brain-spew and gets me feedback from interesting people faster than my spam-embattled comments here ever did.\r\n* For sharing things I find on the web, [Delicious](http://delicious.com/deusx) took that job over years ago and [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/l.m.orchard) has been angling for the job as well.\r\n* For sharing code and projects, I've started doing more and more over at [my GitHub account](http://github.com/lmorchard/).\r\n\r\nQuite awhile ago, I even went so far as to redirect the front page of my decafbad.com domain straight to a page that's nothing more than  [a shell for a FriendFeed widget that aggregates my output from elsewhere](http://decafbad.com/blog/lifestream). It's kind of a cop-out, but if you want to see what I'm really up to, that's a much better page than my stagnant blog index anyway.  I've got a [local archive of my activity](http://decafbad.com/ffa/lmorchard), and have been meaning to make a self-hosted lifestream more front-and-center, but I've been too busy to bother.\r\n\r\n## Publishing tools\r\n\r\nIn fact, I've been thinking about killing my WordPress installation here altogether, and switching the blog over to a static fossil snapshot.  Since I rarely post, there's rarely a comment inbound here these days that's not trying to slip through an ad for pills or fake handbags. Thus, most of the CPU cycles on my web host are spent on busy work processing requests that will never amount to anything real. So, why bother having an actual PHP application running here?\r\n\r\nThe one thing that I haven't done a lot of lately—and would like to carve out time to get back to—is some real long-form writing. You would think that that's where this WordPress thing would come in handy, but oddly it seems not to. I hate writing in textareas in browsers, haven't found a desktop blog client that I liked in years.\r\n\r\nSo, because of the little things that annoy me, I stop writing before I start because the anticipated process to publish seems like a chore. I'd much rather be writing in MacVim and checking text files into a git repository. Then, I could throw [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) or something yak-shavingly homebrewed on top of post-receive hooks to do indexing magic and such in static HTML. You know, the stuff that took forever in MovableType back in the day, but decoupled from my actual writing process. \r\n\r\nHuh, now that I describe it, the above sounds like a chore too—but it would be a shiny new toy!  At that point, I wouldn't be blogging so much as publishing an archive of essays on the web.  But, at least I'd know the format would be future-proof, the platform exploit-resistant, and the overall maintenance less worrisome.  If I had comments, I could even outsource them to another service and run periodic backups to be safe.\r\n\r\n## Audience\r\n\r\nBut, beyond the mechanisms, there's who I imagine might be reading this stuff. I hold off on writing a lot of things that could be posted here because they're maybe not tech-nerdy enough. If it doesn't have at least one code example, I hesitate to share it here—and if I don't share it here, I probably don't share it anywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the thought that whatever I write here, no one will read it if it's too long.  This entry is mostly written to myself, and I expect a single-digit comment count—most likely zero.  I get the most feedback on the shortest things, which has ultimately lead to Twitter and its 140 character limit yielding some of my most rewarding interactions on the web in years. I post an essay here, and it's all crickets.\r\n\r\nThe exceptions are where I post something really useful, like that article about [HTML 5 Drag & Drop](http://decafbad.com/blog/2009/07/15/html5-drag-and-drop) or a [Delicious command for Ubiquity](http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/09/01/writing-a-delicious-command-for-ubiquity).  That is, of course, a clue if comments and feedback are what I'm after.\r\n\r\n## Writing topics\r\n\r\nSo, what could I be writing about these days? Let's see, I could write about:\r\n\r\n* what I've been up to at Mozilla since I started;\r\n* [brewing beer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/homebrewing/) and roasting coffee at home;\r\n* [retro computing on my C64 and Amiga](http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/4389264445/);\r\n* developing for Palm webOS;\r\n* random thoughts on life;\r\n\r\nHuh. That all sounds like a blog, and one I would read myself—though that last one sounds like [my LiveJournal](http://deus-x.livejournal.com/), long neglected since I started dating my wife and got much less emo in general. We probably don't need to go there so much, but I could probably bore with more even-tempered philosophical expositions.\r\n\r\n## What's the problem?\r\n\r\nI wonder what my real problem is, then? Is it really just a matter of [butt in the seat](http://www.dawsbrothers.com/2010/03/09/butt-in-the-seat-a-writers-technique/) that I'm missing?  I write every day—in a paper journal, in wiki pages, in emails, to myself—I just don't write much here. Maybe all the above is just a collection of excuses.\r\n\r\nLately, I've had this notion that I should try writing and publishing for an earlier version of myself. That is: all these things I end up searching for and researching on the web, I should write them up in a way that I wish had been the first search result in Google. Whatever the topic, if a younger version of me wanted to find it, I should put it out there to be found. Never mind who else I think might read it or (not) comment on it.\r\n\r\nWrite for myself, write what I'd want to read—sounds pretty obvious when I put it out there like that. So, is that the deal? Who knows; we'll see if a change in perspective results in more happenings here.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090129\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ciarang.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=18910207650685d4592d9a6a71528180&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ciarang.com/\">CiaranG</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090129\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:04:04\">2010-03-10T19:04:04</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I write about stuff (including beer brewing, Amigas and less archaic techy stuff) mostly for the pleasure of my current self, and the amusement of my future self.</p>\n\n<p>I never considered writing for an earlier version of myself, but then I know for a fact he didn't have a time machine.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090132\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5441ca4708065da7e0467e1470c49653&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\">Carter Rabasa</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090132\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:19:19\">2010-03-10T19:19:19</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I long ago gave up on the idea of regular blogging.

I enjoy talking with people; it's not an antisocial thing. It's just that I don't know what long-term ramifications there may be to such free expression. Likewise, you won't see pictures of me and my family generally available on Flickr or Picasa (there may be a handful). Facebook is nothing to me except somewhere to echo my Twitter stream, such as it is (and I've stopped doing that). Brightkite -- forget it! My last.fm profile is about as intimate as I get online.</p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking about shutting down my WP installation. I really don't use it.

I don't feel like having a diary online so much as a place where I publish interesting things.</p>\n\n<p>I think really my thing here is I call myself a writer, so I should probably be doing more of it. :)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090139\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/danmactough.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">danmactough</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090139\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T20:17:10\">2010-03-10T20:17:10</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Regarding publishing interesting things -- I'm totally with you there.
