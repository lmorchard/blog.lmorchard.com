  "html": "<p>I just finished Bioware&#39;s Mass Effect 2 for Xbox 360, and I&#39;ve got some thoughts about it.  Haven&#39;t really written reviews here for games before, but I said I wanted to start posting things here that I&#39;d want to read.  So, here goes...</p>\n<p>In a nutshell: I loved it, will play it again—but it could have been so much better.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3 id=\"mass-effect-1-the-obsession\">Mass Effect 1: The Obsession</h3>\n<p>After having had a blast playing through <a href=\"http://sc2.sourceforge.net/\">Star Control 2 / The Ur-Quan Masters</a> and loving the classic (albeit pulpy) sci-fi storyline, someone suggested <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect 1</a> would feel like a modern remake.  I forget who it was, but they were right.  Galactic exploration, negotiation between alien races, even taking a moon patrol buggy (a.k.a. the Mako) down to planets for resource gathering—it all matched up pretty well and compared very favorably.</p>\n<p>So, I was set up to be impressed.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect 1</a> was <em>cinematic</em>—even down to the film grain simulation in graphics options.  It was also the first major next-gen console game I spent any time with on a nice, big HDTV.  </p>\n<p>The storyline gave me a nice <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder\">sensawunda</a>, like a season of a well-made sci-fi series like <a href=\"http://www.henson.com/fantasy_scifi.php?content=farscape\">Farscape</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1\">Stargate SG-1</a>.  I actually cared about what happened in the dialog sequences, and I wanted to explore those bits equally alongside combat and planetary exploration.  I actually said &quot;Whoa,&quot; when I first saw the inside of the Citadel, with its massive cylindrical interior dotted with neighborhoods and landscaping.  I read all the Codex entries and planet descriptions to soak in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding\">worldbuilding</a>.</p>\n<p>And then there were the art and music direction of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect 1</a>, both of which were note-perfect for me.  </p>\n<p>The art was like the future <a href=\"http://www.atarimuseum.com/otherprojects/bionics/proto/index.html\">Atari computer designers had envisioned</a>, all clean surfaces and angles.  </p>\n<p>The music was like a modern Vangelis soundtrack for an alternate reality Blade Runner.  The transition from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhN4CUG4ek\">Eden Prime</a> to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdfc4GVPsRk\">Battle at Eden Prime</a> was a great build-up of suspense in the opening mission.  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9SiMTmCqvI&amp;feature=related\">The Citadel</a> was a big <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder\">sensawunda</a> moment—in fact, the whole soundtrack had a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder\">sensawunda</a> thread throughout. You might be on a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph6XcHu9ZB8&amp;feature=related\">dangerous safari</a>, but damn if it ain&#39;t an awesome universe to do it in.</p>\n<p>At the end—spoiler alert—they surprised me by carrying through the total feel of an 80&#39;s movie with a <em>real band</em> playing out the closing credits. It was a total &quot;the end&quot; kind of song that you&#39;d walk out of a theater listening to, all jazzed about the show you&#39;d just seen.  The first things I did after the game ended was to look up that song (<a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M4_Part_II\">M4 Part II</a> by <a href=\"http://www.faunts.com/\">Faunts</a>), buy that band&#39;s albums, and then buy the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XXWKAW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000XXWKAW\" title=\"Mass Effect Original Game Soundtrack\">game soundtrack</a>.  </p>\n<p>During a plane ride to California, I watched <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lPsGxJhyq4\">the making-of videos</a> on my iPod Touch.  I bought an <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/3501486581/\">SR1 hat</a> when I got back home.  </p>\n<p>I have done these things before for favorite movies, but only rarely for games.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-i-liked-in-me2\">What I liked in ME2</h3>\n<p>So... that brings me to <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">Mass Effect 2</a>, and the large shoes it had to fill.</p>\n<p>As a game, <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> is much improved over <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> in many ways.  They&#39;ve streamlined a lot of fiddly tedium in the gameplay; amped up the combat to compete with other cover-based shooters; backed away from the cookie-cutter procedural environments to hand-craft all missions.</p>\n<p>That last part, hand-crafting every mission, is easily the biggest improvement.  In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>, nearly every mission was a <a href=\"http://www.madlibs.com/\">Mad Libs</a> mashup of some pre-fab warehouse / mine / space station; an assortment of cloned enemies; some loot lockers; and maybe a unique objective or two.  I still liked it: dungeon-crawlers like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_%28video_game%29\">Diablo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.torchlightgame.com/\">Torchlight</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nethack.org/\">Nethack</a> are fun, and I have an even softer spot for space opera than fantasy.  </p>\n<p>But, <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> clearly shows more effort in mission design.  It&#39;s obvious that a human being spent many, many hours building every environment rather than just filling out a few data structures with object IDs and sketching out simple maps.  I&#39;m sure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> was more involved than I make it out to be, but the fact that <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> spans two discs alone is a testament to the extra effort.</p>\n<p>Oh, and the new &quot;circuit bypass&quot; and &quot;code hacking&quot; mini-games? They&#39;re a <em>huge</em> improvement over the all-purpose &quot;Simon&quot; game from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>.  I miss having the cheating option to just throw some omnigel at a locked door, but I don&#39;t have the overstuffed inventory to constantly recycle into wonderstuff any more either.</p>\n<p>In terms of the story, well, it has a very brief main arc accompanied by a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales\">Canterbury Tales</a> parade of side-stories for everyone you need to recruit to go up against the <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Collectors\">Collectors</a>.  The <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Collectors\">Collectors</a> are very definitely bad—but, all told, you rarely see them in the act of doing bad things.  They&#39;re less of a constant nemesis, and more of a looming threat that will nonetheless wait until you&#39;re done puttering around with your sniper&#39;s family problems.</p>\n<p>Really, the <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Collectors\">Collectors</a> felt like a blatant <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macguffin\">MacGuffin</a> for getting Shepard involved in the lives of some interesting characters.  I <em>did</em> find most of those characters interesting, so I was able to go with it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"its-a-small-world\">It&#39;s a small world</h3>\n<p>What I missed in the story, though, was a real sense of exploration and worldbuilding.  I guess maybe they figured they got it all out of the way in the previous season and just wanted to plow through with action in the second.</p>\n<p>I <em>was</em> expecting Omega to be the &quot;anti-Citadel&quot;, though, so I was a bit disappointed to find that the area was so sparse and small. Instead of a load of nooks and crannies to wander through, I got a few bare floors of grunge leading straight to objectives.  I really wanted to spend some time digging into the place in the talk-to-every-villager style of most RPGs.  Instead, I got a seedy nightclub, some shops, and an apartment—that&#39;s it.</p>\n<p>In fact, although the Citadel returned and the Asari world Ilium was introduced in <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a>, I felt like they were mere shadows of what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> offered.  I guess the flip side of having the hand-crafted environments throughout the rest of the game&#39;s missions means that the hub worlds suffer.  </p>\n<p>Another weird thing were the news reports on various terminals, mentioning things happening throughout the galaxy.  In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>, hearing about trouble and raids on colonies were the starting points for side missions.  In <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a>, they were just random fluff and color.  I&#39;m not sure why they bothered with the content, to be honest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mediocre-art-and-music\">Mediocre art and music</h3>\n<p>Style-wise, <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> stripped out a lot of what I adored about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>, coming very close to making it <em>just another game</em> rather than <em>a work of art</em>.  You can call me nuts—and probably already have, though strangely you&#39;re still reading—but yes: I thought <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> was special.</p>\n<p>The music in <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> is largely forgettable. There&#39;s an orchestra with horns and strings, and occasionally a chorus chants.  Sometimes, there are bells and triangles.  There were no themes that stuck with me, other than maybe the end-of-mission report jingle.  It&#39;s just like every other modern video game with a big budget.</p>\n<p>At least they kept something like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMyu9kehCVY&amp;feature=related\">Uncharted Worlds</a> from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> for the Galaxy Map.</p>\n<p>The art direction in <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> also strays toward mediocrity.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> was <em>stylized</em>, all clean surfaces and sleek angles.  It was nostalgic and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2010/apr/01/science-fiction\">optimistic</a>, something refreshing.  (See also: <a href=\"http://io9.com/5064844/new-star-trek-movie-is-intentionally-cheesy\">The New Star Trek</a>.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> introduces more grime &amp; dirt—it&#39;s &quot;grittier&quot; and more &quot;realistic&quot;. Just like every other modern video game with a big budget.</p>\n<p>But, you know what? &quot;Realism&quot; and &quot;grit&quot; are so last-decade—I&#39;m sick of it. If I&#39;d wanted to play <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_of_War\">Gears of War</a>, I&#39;d play it.  I didn&#39;t. I watched <a href=\"http://www.syfy.com/battlestar/\">Battlestar Galactica</a>—it was good; it&#39;s over now. </p>\n<h3 id=\"rip-m35-mako\">R.I.P. M35 Mako</h3>\n<p>They also killed the <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M35_Mako\">M35 Mako</a>, replacing it with a tedious planet-scanning mini-game.  No more endless alien skies over suited-up away teams, unless you&#39;re on a mission and don&#39;t have time to look up anyway.</p>\n<p>Sure, there were pain-in-the-ass 89.999º inclines to navigate with the I-think-I-can moon patrol buggy and its annoying jump-jets that would throw you right off a mile-high mountain peak with a slipped button press.  But, I&#39;d take all of those flaws versus painstakingly dragging a pokey reticule across a textured sphere hoping for a spiky waveform and bit of vibration in my lap.  </p>\n<p>If there&#39;s an away team to be assembled for scouring a planetary surface in-person, I&#39;m your man.  But, screw this scanning grind.  Half my recruited shipmates spent all their time meditating or staring at the walls. Couldn&#39;t I have delegated some reticule-dragging duty to them, rather than wasting my precious galaxy-saving time?</p>\n<p>Oh, but I <em>do</em> get to fly the little model Normandy around on the galaxy map now.  Whoosh, vroom, whoop-de-doo!  Remember to keep the gas tank full.  Wait, isn&#39;t that Joker&#39;s job? Christ, do I have to do <em>everything</em> around here?  While I was really hoping they&#39;d include some sort of space vehicles alongside the Mako, tooling around with a toy was not what I had in mind.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">BioWare</a> missed an opportunity:  Of the several dozen missions in the game, there were only around four main arc missions involving the big-baddies—the digressions out-massed the central story.</p>\n<p>I would have loved some random / procedurally-generated levels on planets—ala every mission in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>, only more unapologetically dungeon-crawley—fighting constant waves of Collectors, saving forgettable-yet-grateful human colonies as I scooped up the resources I needed to get the next sniper rifle upgrade.  No hand-crafting needed here, just give me some bug hunts and make the Collectors seem like a serious and constant threat.  Hell, give me a scoreboard of Collector versus Colonist body count for extra fun.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dragon-age-got-my-hopes-up\">Dragon Age got my hopes up</h3>\n<p>In another <a href=\"http://www.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">BioWare</a> game, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonAge\">Dragon Age</a>, <a href=\"http://random.lmorchard.com/dragon-age-origins-is-an-interactive-fantasy\">I got sucked in despite my so-so attraction to fantasy stories</a>.  The main thing came down to dialog and character interactions, and a departure from the general <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Morality\">Paragon / Renegade system</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>.  </p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonAge\">Dragon Age</a>, you get <a href=\"http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Approval\"><em>per-character</em> approval meters</a>.  This means that what endears one character may repulse another.  So, if you want to try to please or at least gain respect from everyone you recruit, you need to be careful about who you bring on which quests and what you do in the course of accomplishing goals.  The occasional deep conversation or gift helps, too.  It makes the game surprisingly rich.</p>\n<p>Assuming that <a href=\"http://www.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">BioWare</a> has a set of technologies and notions they carry from game to game, I expected to see this sort of thing pop up in <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a>.</p>\n<p>No such luck.</p>\n<p>Instead, you get the same <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Morality\">Paragon / Renegade system</a> that opens up special options in dialog as before, and <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Loyalty\">a simple binary not-loyal / loyal state</a> for each of your squaddies depending on whether you completed their respective special-attention missions.  Makes for fun additional missions, but is relatively boring overall.</p>\n<h3 id=\"id-play-it-again-and-ill-play-mass-effect-3\">I&#39;d play it again, and I&#39;ll play Mass Effect 3</h3>\n<p>I grouse, but it&#39;s out of love.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect 1</a> hit all the right spots for me as a sci-fi adventure and a storytelling experience in general. There&#39;s no way I wouldn&#39;t play <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">Mass Effect 2</a>, and I&#39;ll be right in line for Mass Effect 3.  I&#39;ll probably even start over again from the beginning and replay #1 &amp; #2 before #3 comes out.</p>\n<p>But, <a href=\"http://www.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">BioWare</a>? I&#39;d really love it if you pulled back from fully making Mass Effect 3 <em>just another video game</em> and recaptured a bit of what made the first one so great.</p>\n",
  "body": "I just finished Bioware's Mass Effect 2 for Xbox 360, and I've got some thoughts about it.  Haven't really written reviews here for games before, but I said I wanted to start posting things here that I'd want to read.  So, here goes...\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell: I loved it, will play it again—but it could have been so much better.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n### Mass Effect 1: The Obsession\r\n\r\nAfter having had a blast playing through [Star Control 2 / The Ur-Quan Masters][urquan] and loving the classic (albeit pulpy) sci-fi storyline, someone suggested [Mass Effect 1][me1] would feel like a modern remake.  I forget who it was, but they were right.

[Mass Effect 1][me1] was *cinematic*—even down to the film grain simulation in graphics options.  It was also the first major next-gen console game I spent any time with on a nice, big HDTV.  \r\n\r\nThe storyline gave me a nice [sensawunda][sensawunda], like a season of a well-made sci-fi series like [Farscape][farscape] or [Stargate SG-1][sg1].  I actually cared about what happened in the dialog sequences, and I wanted to explore those bits equally alongside combat and planetary exploration.  I actually said \"Whoa,\" when I first saw the inside of the Citadel, with its massive cylindrical interior dotted with neighborhoods and landscaping.  I read all the Codex entries and planet descriptions to soak in the [worldbuilding][].\r\n\r\n[worldbuilding]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding\r\n\r\nAnd then there were the art and music direction of [Mass Effect 1][me1], both of which were note-perfect for me.  \r\n\r\nThe art was like the future [Atari computer designers had envisioned][ataridesign], all clean surfaces and angles.  \r\n\r\nThe music was like a modern Vangelis soundtrack for an alternate reality Blade Runner.  The transition from [Eden Prime][eden-prime] to [Battle at Eden Prime][edenbattle] was a great build-up of suspense in the opening mission.  [The Citadel][citadel] was a big [sensawunda][] moment—in fact, the whole soundtrack had a [sensawunda][] thread throughout. You might be on a [dangerous safari][virmire], but damn if it ain't an awesome universe to do it in.\r\n\r\n[eden-prime]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhN4CUG4ek\r\n[edenbattle]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdfc4GVPsRk\r\n[virmire]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph6XcHu9ZB8&feature=related\r\n[citadel]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9SiMTmCqvI&feature=related\r\n[presidium]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7V6P8MUwKw&feature=related\r\n\r\nAt the end—spoiler alert—they surprised me by carrying through the total feel of an 80's movie with a *real band* playing out the closing credits. It was a total \"the end\" kind of song that you'd walk out of a theater listening to, all jazzed about the show you'd just seen.  The first things I did after the game ended was to look up that song ([M4 Part II][m4] by [Faunts][faunts]), buy that band's albums, and then buy the [game soundtrack][me1soundtrack].  \r\n\r\nDuring a plane ride to California, I watched [the making-of videos][makingof] on my iPod Touch.  I bought an [SR1 hat][sr1hat] when I got back home.  \r\n\r\nI have done these things before for favorite movies, but only rarely for games.\r\n\r\n### What I liked in ME2\r\n\r\nSo... that brings me to [Mass Effect 2][me2], and the large shoes it had to fill.\r\n\r\nAs a game, [ME2][me2] is much improved over [ME1][me1] in many ways.  They've streamlined a lot of fiddly tedium in the gameplay; amped up the combat to compete with other cover-based shooters; backed away from the cookie-cutter procedural environments to hand-craft all missions.\r\n\r\nThat last part, hand-crafting every mission, is easily the biggest improvement.  In [ME1][me1], nearly every mission was a [Mad Libs][madlibs] mashup of some pre-fab warehouse / mine / space station; an assortment of cloned enemies; some loot lockers; and maybe a unique objective or two.  I still liked it: dungeon-crawlers like [Diablo][diablo] and [Torchlight][torchlight] and [Nethack][nethack] are fun, and I have an even softer spot for space opera than fantasy.  \r\n\r\nBut, [ME2][] clearly shows more effort in mission design.  It's obvious that a human being spent many, many hours building every environment rather than just filling out a few data structures with object IDs and sketching out simple maps.  I'm sure [ME1][] was more involved than I make it out to be, but the fact that [ME2][] spans two discs alone is a testament to the extra effort.\r\n\r\nOh, and the new \"circuit bypass\" and \"code hacking\" mini-games? They're a *huge* improvement over the all-purpose \"Simon\" game from [ME1][].  I miss having the cheating option to just throw some omnigel at a locked door, but I don't have the overstuffed inventory to constantly recycle into wonderstuff any more either.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the story, well, it has a very brief main arc accompanied by a [Canterbury Tales][chaucer] parade of side-stories for everyone you need to recruit to go up against the [Collectors][].  The [Collectors][] are very definitely bad—but, all told, you rarely see them in the act of doing bad things.  They're less of a constant nemesis, and more of a looming threat that will nonetheless wait until you're done puttering around with your sniper's family problems.\r\n\r\nReally, the [Collectors][] felt like a blatant [MacGuffin][] for getting Shepard involved in the lives of some interesting characters.  I *did* find most of those characters interesting, so I was able to go with it.\r\n\r\n[chaucer]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales\r\n[macguffin]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macguffin\r\n[collectors]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Collectors\r\n\r\n### It's a small world\r\n\r\nWhat I missed in the story, though, was a real sense of exploration and worldbuilding.  I guess maybe they figured they got it all out of the way in the previous season and just wanted to plow through with action in the second.\r\n\r\nI *was* expecting Omega to be the \"anti-Citadel\", though, so I was a bit disappointed to find that the area was so sparse and small. Instead of a load of nooks and crannies to wander through, I got a few bare floors of grunge leading straight to objectives.  I really wanted to spend some time digging into the place in the talk-to-every-villager style of most RPGs.  Instead, I got a seedy nightclub, some shops, and an apartment—that's it.\r\n\r\nIn fact, although the Citadel returned and the Asari world Ilium was introduced in [ME2][], I felt like they were mere shadows of what [ME1][] offered.  I guess the flip side of having the hand-crafted environments throughout the rest of the game's missions means that the hub worlds suffer.  \r\n\r\nAnother weird thing were the news reports on various terminals, mentioning things happening throughout the galaxy.  In [ME1][], hearing about trouble and raids on colonies were the starting points for side missions.  In [ME2][], they were just random fluff and color.  I'm not sure why they bothered with the content, to be honest.\r\n\r\n### Mediocre art and music\r\n\r\nStyle-wise, [ME2][] stripped out a lot of what I adored about [ME1][], coming very close to making it *just another game* rather than *a work of art*.  You can call me nuts—and probably already have, though strangely you're still reading—but yes: I thought [ME1][] was special.\r\n\r\nThe music in [ME2][] is largely forgettable. There's an orchestra with horns and strings, and occasionally a chorus chants.  Sometimes, there are bells and triangles.  There were no themes that stuck with me, other than maybe the end-of-mission report jingle.  It's just like every other modern video game with a big budget.\r\n\r\nAt least they kept something like [Uncharted Worlds][uncharted] from [ME1][] for the Galaxy Map.\r\n\r\n[uncharted]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMyu9kehCVY&feature=related\r\n\r\nThe art direction in [ME2][] also strays toward mediocrity.  [ME1][] was *stylized*, all clean surfaces and sleek angles.  It was nostalgic and [optimistic][optimisticscifi], something refreshing.  (See also: [The New Star Trek][newstartrek].)\r\n\r\n[ME2][] introduces more grime & dirt—it's \"grittier\" and more \"realistic\". Just like every other modern video game with a big budget.\r\n\r\nBut, you know what? \"Realism\" and \"grit\" are so last-decade—I'm sick of it. If I'd wanted to play [Gears of War][gow], I'd play it.  I didn't. I watched [Battlestar Galactica][bsg]—it was good; it's over now. \r\n\r\n### R.I.P. M35 Mako\r\n\r\nThey also killed the [M35 Mako][mako], replacing it with a tedious planet-scanning mini-game.  No more endless alien skies over suited-up away teams, unless you're on a mission and don't have time to look up anyway.\r\n\r\n[mako]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M35_Mako\r\n\r\nSure, there were pain-in-the-ass 89.999º inclines to navigate with the I-think-I-can moon patrol buggy and its annoying jump-jets that would throw you right off a mile-high mountain peak with a slipped button press.  But, I'd take all of those flaws versus painstakingly dragging a pokey reticule across a textured sphere hoping for a spiky waveform and bit of vibration in my lap.  \r\n\r\nIf there's an away team to be assembled for scouring a planetary surface in-person, I'm your man.  But, screw this scanning grind.  Half my recruited shipmates spent all their time meditating or staring at the walls. Couldn't I have delegated some reticule-dragging duty to them, rather than wasting my precious galaxy-saving time?\r\n\r\nOh, but I *do* get to fly the little model Normandy around on the galaxy map now.  Whoosh, vroom, whoop-de-doo!  Remember to keep the gas tank full.  Wait, isn't that Joker's job? Christ, do I have to do *everything* around here?  While I was really hoping they'd include some sort of space vehicles alongside the Mako, tooling around with a toy was not what I had in mind.\r\n\r\n[BioWare][] missed an opportunity:  Of the several dozen missions in the game, there were only around four main arc missions involving the big-baddies—the digressions out-massed the central story.\r\n\r\nI would have loved some random / procedurally-generated levels on planets—ala every mission in [ME1][], only more unapologetically dungeon-crawley—fighting constant waves of Collectors, saving forgettable-yet-grateful human colonies as I scooped up the resources I needed to get the next sniper rifle upgrade.  No hand-crafting needed here, just give me some bug hunts and make the Collectors seem like a serious and constant threat.  Hell, give me a scoreboard of Collector versus Colonist body count for extra fun.\r\n\r\n### Dragon Age got my hopes up\r\n\r\nIn another [BioWare][] game, [Dragon Age][], [I got sucked in despite my so-so attraction to fantasy stories][dragonage].  The main thing came down to dialog and character interactions, and a departure from the general [Paragon / Renegade system][me-morality] of [ME1][].  \r\n\r\nIn [Dragon Age][], you get [*per-character* approval meters][approval].  This means that what endears one character may repulse another.  So, if you want to try to please or at least gain respect from everyone you recruit, you need to be careful about who you bring on which quests and what you do in the course of accomplishing goals.  The occasional deep conversation or gift helps, too.  It makes the game surprisingly rich.\r\n\r\n[approval]: http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Approval\r\n\r\nAssuming that [BioWare][] has a set of technologies and notions they carry from game to game, I expected to see this sort of thing pop up in [ME2][].\r\n\r\nNo such luck.\r\n\r\nInstead, you get the same [Paragon / Renegade system][me-morality] that opens up special options in dialog as before, and [a simple binary not-loyal / loyal state][me2-loyalty] for each of your squaddies depending on whether you completed their respective special-attention missions.  Makes for fun additional missions, but is relatively boring overall.\r\n\r\n### I'd play it again, and I'll play Mass Effect 3\r\n\r\nI grouse, but it's out of love.\r\n\r\n[Mass Effect 1][me1] hit all the right spots for me as a sci-fi adventure and a storytelling experience in general. There's no way I wouldn't play [Mass Effect 2][me2], and I'll be right in line for Mass Effect 3.  I'll probably even start over again from the beginning and replay #1 & #2 before #3 comes out.\r\n\r\nBut, [BioWare][]? I'd really love it if you pulled back from fully making Mass Effect 3 *just another video game* and recaptured a bit of what made the first one so great.\r\n\r\n[makingof]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lPsGxJhyq4\r\n[optimisticscifi]: http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2010/apr/01/science-fiction\r\n[newstartrek]: http://io9.com/5064844/new-star-trek-movie-is-intentionally-cheesy\r\n[urquan]: http://sc2.sourceforge.net/\r\n[me1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\r\n[me-morality]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Morality\r\n[me2-loyalty]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Loyalty\r\n[me1soundtrack]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XXWKAW?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000XXWKAW \"Mass Effect Original Game Soundtrack\"\r\n[m4]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M4_Part_II\r\n[faunts]: http://www.faunts.com/\r\n[sr1hat]: http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/3501486581/\r\n[me2]: http://masseffect.[BioWare][].com/\r\n[sensawunda]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder\r\n[farscape]: http://www.henson.com/fantasy_scifi.php?content=farscape\r\n[sg1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1\r\n[ataridesign]: http://www.atarimuseum.com/otherprojects/bionics/proto/index.html\r\n[madlibs]: http://www.madlibs.com/\r\n[diablo]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_%28video_game%29\r\n[nethack]: http://www.nethack.org/\r\n[torchlight]: http://www.torchlightgame.com/\r\n[gow]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_of_War\r\n[bsg]: http://www.syfy.com/battlestar/\r\n[dragonage]: http://random.lmorchard.com/dragon-age-origins-is-an-interactive-fantasy\r\n[bioware]: http://www.[BioWare][].com/\r\n[Dragon Age]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonAge\r\n",
