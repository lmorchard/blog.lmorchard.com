But, I like to write at length and have finally decided that life&#39;s too short to write in browser <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>&#39;s, no matter how cleverly augmented.</p>\n<p>I did buy <a href=\"http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/\">MarsEdit 3</a>, which is a fine app for dashing off short entries. But, for longer things, I found myself doing the actual writing elsewhere and pasting the text into MarsEdit for posting later. I even wrote and posted <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/skein/2010/03/11/alpha-vs-delta/\">a whole fanfic novella</a> this way, and it was a silly way to do things.</p>\n<p>Well, one of the places where writing actually happens for me over the past few years is within <a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/\">Tinderbox</a> documents. And, as it turns out, <a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/\">Tinderbox</a> has some powerful HTML export facilities that I&#39;ve left underused until some things finally clicked for me.</p>\n<p>So, I thought I&#39;d try turning that experience back upon itself to produce something worth writing. Without further ado, here&#39;s the <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/tinderbox-article-tutorial\">source in GitHub</a>, and the <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2010/06/tinderbox-article-tutorial/article.html\">article exported to HTML for easy reading</a>.</p>\n<p>The funny thing is, I started working on this tutorial in the middle of writing another article. So, this post is a particularly advanced form of <a href=\"http://catb.org/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html\">Yak Shaving</a>. I hope it ends up handy for someone, and I hope it leads to the <em>real</em> articles I&#39;m hoping to produce.</p>\n"}
