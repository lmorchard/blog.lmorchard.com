I&#39;d mentioned that it was a digression from another, different article. </p>\n<p>Well, I just finished a first draft of that article: </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2010/06/byob-bookmarks-ui/\">It&#39;s a case study about building a bookmark management feature for Mozilla&#39;s BYOB</a>.</p>\n<p>Light on code but heavy on narration, it&#39;s about what I did and what I was thinking while I did it. There are links to the end product for reference, but it isn&#39;t a demonstration of some new trick. Rather, it&#39;s a look at my process as a whole.</p>\n<p>I wrote this, in part, for myself: The writing has helped me review things. But, I&#39;m hoping someone else reads it, and then picks up something new or can offer some interesting critique in return.</p>\n<p>And, because I&#39;m curious and like looking behind the scenes, I&#39;d love to see this kind of write-up from more webdevs. There don&#39;t seem to be a lot of detailed case studies versus quick one-shot tutorials on isolated techniques. It&#39;s probably because the writing is time-consuming, as is the reading. It&#39;s not in the genre of bite-sized attractions optimized for promoting blog traffic, but I&#39;d like to see more of them all the same.</p>\n"}
