What I&#39;ve yet to figure out is if the cause is a matter of motivation, publishing tools, audience, or writing topics.</p>\n<p>Behold as I ramble on for many tens of words pondering the cobwebs here at 0xDECAFBAD.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2 id=\"motivation\">Motivation</h2>\n<p>Other outlets have absorbed nearly all of my motivations that once prompted casual blogging. And those other outlets, in most cases, provide better rewards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For quick top-of-the-head thoughts and quips, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard\">Twitter</a> works best for the brain-spew and gets me feedback from interesting people faster than my spam-embattled comments here ever did.</li>\n<li>For sharing things I find on the web, <a href=\"http://delicious.com/deusx\">Delicious</a> took that job over years ago and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/shared/l.m.orchard\">Google Reader</a> has been angling for the job as well.</li>\n<li>For sharing code and projects, I&#39;ve started doing more and more over at <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/\">my GitHub account</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Quite awhile ago, I even went so far as to redirect the front page of my decafbad.com domain straight to a page that&#39;s nothing more than  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/lifestream\">a shell for a FriendFeed widget that aggregates my output from elsewhere</a>. It&#39;s kind of a cop-out, but if you want to see what I&#39;m really up to, that&#39;s a much better page than my stagnant blog index anyway.  I&#39;ve got a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/ffa/lmorchard\">local archive of my activity</a>, and have been meaning to make a self-hosted lifestream more front-and-center, but I&#39;ve been too busy to bother.</p>\n<h2 id=\"publishing-tools\">Publishing tools</h2>\n<p>In fact, I&#39;ve been thinking about killing my WordPress installation here altogether, and switching the blog over to a static fossil snapshot.  Since I rarely post, there&#39;s rarely a comment inbound here these days that&#39;s not trying to slip through an ad for pills or fake handbags. Thus, most of the CPU cycles on my web host are spent on busy work processing requests that will never amount to anything real. So, why bother having an actual PHP application running here?</p>\n<p>The one thing that I haven&#39;t done a lot of lately—and would like to carve out time to get back to—is some real long-form writing. You would think that that&#39;s where this WordPress thing would come in handy, but oddly it seems not to. I hate writing in textareas in browsers, haven&#39;t found a desktop blog client that I liked in years.</p>\n<p>So, because of the little things that annoy me, I stop writing before I start because the anticipated process to publish seems like a chore. I&#39;d much rather be writing in MacVim and checking text files into a git repository. Then, I could throw <a href=\"http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a> or something yak-shavingly homebrewed on top of post-receive hooks to do indexing magic and such in static HTML. You know, the stuff that took forever in MovableType back in the day, but decoupled from my actual writing process. </p>\n<p>Huh, now that I describe it, the above sounds like a chore too—but it would be a shiny new toy!  At that point, I wouldn&#39;t be blogging so much as publishing an archive of essays on the web.  But, at least I&#39;d know the format would be future-proof, the platform exploit-resistant, and the overall maintenance less worrisome.  If I had comments, I could even outsource them to another service and run periodic backups to be safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"audience\">Audience</h2>\n<p>But, beyond the mechanisms, there&#39;s who I imagine might be reading this stuff. I hold off on writing a lot of things that could be posted here because they&#39;re maybe not tech-nerdy enough. If it doesn&#39;t have at least one code example, I hesitate to share it here—and if I don&#39;t share it here, I probably don&#39;t share it anywhere.</p>\n<p>And then there&#39;s the thought that whatever I write here, no one will read it if it&#39;s too long.  This entry is mostly written to myself, and I expect a single-digit comment count—most likely zero.  I get the most feedback on the shortest things, which has ultimately lead to Twitter and its 140 character limit yielding some of my most rewarding interactions on the web in years. I post an essay here, and it&#39;s all crickets.</p>\n<p>The exceptions are where I post something really useful, like that article about <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2009/07/15/html5-drag-and-drop\">HTML 5 Drag &amp; Drop</a> or a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/09/01/writing-a-delicious-command-for-ubiquity\">Delicious command for Ubiquity</a>.  That is, of course, a clue if comments and feedback are what I&#39;m after.</p>\n<h2 id=\"writing-topics\">Writing topics</h2>\n<p>So, what could I be writing about these days? Let&#39;s see, I could write about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what I&#39;ve been up to at Mozilla since I started;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/homebrewing/\">brewing beer</a> and roasting coffee at home;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/4389264445/\">retro computing on my C64 and Amiga</a>;</li>\n<li>developing for Palm webOS;</li>\n<li>random thoughts on life;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Huh. That all sounds like a blog, and one I would read myself—though that last one sounds like <a href=\"http://deus-x.livejournal.com/\">my LiveJournal</a>, long neglected since I started dating my wife and got much less emo in general. We probably don&#39;t need to go there so much, but I could probably bore with more even-tempered philosophical expositions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-the-problem-\">What&#39;s the problem?</h2>\n<p>I wonder what my real problem is, then? Is it really just a matter of <a href=\"http://www.dawsbrothers.com/2010/03/09/butt-in-the-seat-a-writers-technique/\">butt in the seat</a> that I&#39;m missing?  I write every day—in a paper journal, in wiki pages, in emails, to myself—I just don&#39;t write much here. Maybe all the above is just a collection of excuses.</p>\n<p>Lately, I&#39;ve had this notion that I should try writing and publishing for an earlier version of myself. That is: all these things I end up searching for and researching on the web, I should write them up in a way that I wish had been the first search result in Google. Whatever the topic, if a younger version of me wanted to find it, I should put it out there to be found. Never mind who else I think might read it or (not) comment on it.</p>\n<p>Write for myself, write what I&#39;d want to read—sounds pretty obvious when I put it out there like that. So, is that the deal? Who knows; we&#39;ll see if a change in perspective results in more happenings here.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090129\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ciarang.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=18910207650685d4592d9a6a71528180&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ciarang.com/\">CiaranG</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090129\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:04:04\">2010-03-10T19:04:04</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I write about stuff (including beer brewing, Amigas and less archaic techy stuff) mostly for the pleasure of my current self, and the amusement of my future self.</p>\n\n<p>I never considered writing for an earlier version of myself, but then I know for a fact he didn&#39;t have a time machine.</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221090132&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://cubanlinks.org/blog&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5441ca4708065da7e0467e1470c49653&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://cubanlinks.org/blog&quot;&gt;Carter Rabasa&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221090132&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2010-03-10T19:19:19&quot;&gt;2010-03-10T19:19:19&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I long ago gave up on the idea of regular blogging.

You also got me interested in ifiction and flash fiction. (I ended up publishing a few stories on 365tomorrows and Ficlets.)  And this month I&#39;m joining the Mozilla Corporation, partly because I want to work with you and other hackers whose work has influenced me over the years.  Your audience may be small, but we&#39;re devoted!  :)</p>\n\n<p>I moved my own technical blogging to Jekyll recently.  There&#39;s a bit less guilt about slow update schedules when I think of it more like a static collection of articles than an online journal.  (And yeah, using a real editor and version control makes it much easier to get longer pieces done.)  I use Planet Venus for my personally-hosted lifestream, though these days most of my friends get my aggregated data via Facebook or Buzz.</p></div>\n\n        </li>\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090136\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/danmactough.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">danmactough</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090136\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:27:53\">2010-03-10T19:27:53</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I&#39;ve never used my blog as much as you&#39;ve used yours -- I&#39;ve never really been a blogger at all, honestly.</p>\n\n<p>I like posting code snippets. Maybe I&#39;ll check out github at some point, but I&#39;ve got a 2-year-old now. He&#39;s way more fun and interesting than Python or whatever. (I guess that could be interpreted as implying that my wife is NOT more fun and interesting than those things. Rather than explain why that is not the case, I&#39;ll just say that we&#39;ve been together forever, and I love her very much.)</p>\n\n<p>At any rate, I thought your post merited at least one comment pondering why the commenter does not blog (anymore).</p>\n\n<p>For my part, it has a lot to do with privacy, I think. I knew before I ever installed blosxom that I didn&#39;t want to be a &quot;blogger.&quot; I had no interest in sharing my deep thoughts about life, politics, or anything else. I enjoy talking with people; it&#39;s not an antisocial thing. It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t know what long-term ramifications there may be to such free expression. Likewise, you won&#39;t see pictures of me and my family generally available on Flickr or Picasa (there may be a handful). Facebook is nothing to me except somewhere to echo my Twitter stream, such as it is (and I&#39;ve stopped doing that). Brightkite -- forget it! My last.fm profile is about as intimate as I get online.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m thinking about shutting down my WP installation. I really don&#39;t use it. The only thing I really use my VPS for is my web-based feed reader.</p>\n\n<p>All of these blogging, microblogging, and social networking services -- especially the social networking services -- are really interesting to me, though. I will keep hanging around the periphery of them, dipping in a toe here and there.</p></div>\n\n        </li>\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090137\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://wambatech.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3ba9f5af09024586154461580b546479&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://wambatech.com\">bud</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:44:56\">2010-03-10T19:44:56</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Les I&#39;ve followed this for a while.

I always wondered if it got many reads, but it was one of my own favorites to write since it was the sort of thing I liked to see on others&#39; blogs.</p></p>\n<p>Oh, and welcome to Mozilla! I&#39;m back out to Mountain View pretty regularly, so we&#39;ll have to hang out sometime.  Might have to pick your brain about Jekyll and how you like mobile hacking.</p>\n\n<p><p>@Dan: I&#39;m a bit weird, since most of my friends since the age of 8 have been behind computers, modems, or the internet. And now, my job is almost entirely on the net since I&#39;m telecommuting from my basement 3000 miles away from HQ. So, it&#39;s pretty natural for me to live online.</p><p>Still, I have gotten more and more private. My LiveJournal has some entries that I&#39;d never write now, and I&#39;ll probably never post religious / political stuff here because it&#39;s not worth the debate or potential life / career damage.</p></p>\n<p>So... yeah, I&#39;ll probably never again be a blogger, per se. I don&#39;t feel like having a diary online so much as a place where I publish interesting things.</p>\n\n<p>I think really my thing here is I call myself a writer, so I should probably be doing more of it. :)</p></div>\n\n        </li>\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090139\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/danmactough.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">danmactough</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090139\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T20:17:10\">2010-03-10T20:17:10</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Regarding publishing interesting things -- I&#39;m totally with you there. And like you said, delicious, Google Reader, etc. are much better suited than WP to most of that activity.</p>\n\n<p>As far as being a writer goes, not everyone can do all their writing (drafts, edits, rewrites, etc.) in public view. Writing is intensely personal. Even if you&#39;re writing about Dojo or hacking delicious, you&#39;re exposing your imperfect innards while you do your best to create something really difficult. Hell, I write for a living -- I&#39;m a corporate and securities lawyer. When I&#39;ve finalized a document, all of my drafts get shredded!</p></div>\n\n        </li>\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090140\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rhymeswithtoaster.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=6f28f52e014beb5bee8cb8e04d94ea79&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rhymeswithtoaster.com\">ejk</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090140\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T20:42:12\">2010-03-10T20:42:12</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Sounds so familiar on so many fronts.

I had started to write my own, but then I started wondering why I had to have my own.  It turned out Jekyll gets most of what I want done with a minimum of yak shaving.  I think the only weakness is the lack of categories/tags and the requisite feeds.  It&#39;s nice to write something up with markdown, build the site, and push it out.  Jekyll feels natural for people like us.</p></div>\n\n        </li>\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090147\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://friendfeed.com/lenlynch\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d3bbd90851fa3a038bd8ca7560428412&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://friendfeed.com/lenlynch\">Len Lynch</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090147\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-11T04:51:08\">2010-03-11T04:51:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Community is funny.
