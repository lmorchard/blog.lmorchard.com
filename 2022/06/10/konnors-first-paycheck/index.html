<p>Konnor had never seen so many zeroes in his bank balance before. At least, not with a positive number in front of them. He could make rent. He could fill the fridge. He could even pay off a few bills outright.</p>
<p>He triple checked the transactions to be sure it wasn&#39;t a mistake. As far as he could tell, it was legitimate. The deposits were his signing bonus and a first paycheck, both landing at once in his account. The numbers shouldn&#39;t have been a surprise—they&#39;d been in his offer letter when he accepted, after all—but he kind of hadn&#39;t expected it to become real. He almost found himself crying at his laptop. He managed to take a shaky deep breath and let it out slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;You okay over there?&quot; They weren&#39;t quite sitting shoulder to shoulder on the long table that served as a communal desk. But, the open office arrangement put him uncomfortably close to his co-worker Bjarni. It was hard to have much privacy.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Konnor, &quot;I&#39;m good.&quot;</p>
<p>Bjarni shrugged. &quot;You looked shook for a sec there, bud. You should cheer up: it&#39;s payday!&quot; He kind of yawped that last bit and clapped Konnor on the shoulder for punctuation.</p>
<p>&quot;Hell yeah it is,&quot; shouted Anwar, from the other side of Bjarni. &quot;We should celebrate!&quot;</p>
<p>Then, Anwar rolled back from the table in his chair to look at Konnor. </p>
<p>&quot;Oh hey,&quot; he said, &quot;newbie buys lunch, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Bjarni chuckled, adding, &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s company tradition. Picks up the bar tab, too.&quot;</p>
<p>Konnor sighed and just kind of looked down at his keyboard. &quot;Guys, I can&#39;t really do that—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure you can,&quot; said Anwar. &quot;Have a little team spirit, huh? You just got paid!&quot;</p>
<p>A sigh from across the table, Ricarda looked up and rolled her eyes. &quot;Anwar, you&#39;re a dick,&quot; she said. &quot;If anything it should be our treat. That is, if Konnor wants much to do with you shady assholes after this foolishness.&quot;</p>
<p>Bjarni rolled his eyes back. &quot;You call him a dick, both of us assholes—and then the harshest word you can come up with is &#39;foolishness&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m working on my level of professionalism,&quot; said Ricarda. &quot;Fuck you very much.&quot;</p>
<p>Konnor had developed a kind of baffled expression. He wanted to shrink and vanish from existence.</p>
<p>&quot;Seriously, they&#39;re assholes,&quot; said Ricarda, meeting Konnor&#39;s eyes. &quot;Don&#39;t ever give them money.&quot;</p>
<p>Anwar clutched at his chest. &quot;I&#39;m hurt!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And broke,&quot; said Ricarda, &quot;you owe me fifty dollars. How about lunch is on you, Anwar?&quot;</p>
<p>Bjarni leaned over to Konnor and whispered, &quot;They were dating before she got him get hired on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ricarda, &quot;and I still haven&#39;t seen that referral bonus.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is inappropriate workplace harassment,&quot; cried Anwar.</p>
<p>&quot;It kind of is,&quot; said Bjarni, nodding.</p>
<p>Konnor just looked back and forth between the three of them, blinking and out of his depth.</p>
<p>&quot;If it puts an end to all this abuse,&quot; said Anwar, &quot;then, yes, I will be so magnanimous as to buy us lunch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So magnanimous,&quot; echoed Ricarda.</p>
<p>Bjarni leaned over to Konnor again and asked, &quot;So, what do you like to eat, bud?&quot;</p>
