You give the opening talk.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;You mean, like, the very first talk?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yup, that&#39;s a keynote: the first talk everybody goes to.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Holy crap, that&#39;s so much worse! I thought maybe I could sneak off to some time slot on the last day when everyone&#39;s already running off the airport!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;You could say no.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s kind of a big deal though.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;And they might not ever invite me back.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s true.&quot;</p>\n<p>Kelan looked miserable. &quot;You&#39;re not helping.&quot;</p>\n<p>Thyra laughed. &quot;No, I guess I&#39;m not.

I&#39;m going to have a panic attack behind the podium and pass out in front of everyone.&quot;</p>\n<p>Thyra sighed. &quot;Okay, listen, I&#39;ve got one word for you: kombucha.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What, that gross tea crap from the co-op?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;No, yeah, that stuff is gross. I make my own.&quot; Thyra frowned for a second. &quot;Okay, honestly, mine&#39;s gross too.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re not selling me on this.&quot;</p>\n<p>Thyra rolled her eyes. &quot;No, listen listen listen: it doesn&#39;t matter how it tastes. It&#39;s all about the SCOBY.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;From the cartoon?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Not Scooby, SCOBY: a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;That sounds like my compost bin.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Your gut is like a compost bin.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s a novel insult.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Okay, so, your gut is full of bacteria—&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Gross.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Stay with me. The bacteria is your microbiome. It&#39;s about as important as all your other organs.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What does this have to do with me literally dying on stage?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Your microbiome does all kinds of stuff for you. It plays with hormones in your blood.

Anyway, the bacteria, they affect how you feel. They can even effect how you think.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;So creepy gross bugs in my compost guts can give me indigestion.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Sure, they can do that. They can give you anxiety and panic attacks.

Look, you remember my last job before this was in biotech?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah. Wait, is this like GMO kombucha?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Actually, yes! I absconded with some cultures when I quit.
