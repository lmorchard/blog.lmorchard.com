<img title="Is it a guy or bacteria giving a presentation?" src="./cover.png" class="fullwidth" />

<p>&quot;No, you don&#39;t understand,&quot; said Kelan. &quot;They want me to give a talk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; said Thyra, &quot;that&#39;s what a keynote speaker does. You give the opening talk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean, like, the very first talk?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yup, that&#39;s a keynote: the first talk everybody goes to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Holy crap, that&#39;s so much worse! I thought maybe I could sneak off to some time slot on the last day when everyone&#39;s already running off the airport!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You could say no.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s kind of a big deal though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And they might not ever invite me back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s true.&quot;</p>
<p>Kelan looked miserable. &quot;You&#39;re not helping.&quot;</p>
<p>Thyra laughed. &quot;No, I guess I&#39;m not. You&#39;re too easy to mess with, though!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh,&quot; said Kelan. &quot;This is serious. I&#39;m going to have a panic attack behind the podium and pass out in front of everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>Thyra sighed. &quot;Okay, listen, I&#39;ve got one word for you: kombucha.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, that gross tea crap from the co-op?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, yeah, that stuff is gross. I make my own.&quot; Thyra frowned for a second. &quot;Okay, honestly, mine&#39;s gross too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re not selling me on this.&quot;</p>
<p>Thyra rolled her eyes. &quot;No, listen listen listen: it doesn&#39;t matter how it tastes. It&#39;s all about the SCOBY.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From the cartoon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not Scooby, SCOBY: a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds like my compost bin.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your gut is like a compost bin.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s a novel insult.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, so, your gut is full of bacteria—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gross.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stay with me. The bacteria is your microbiome. It&#39;s about as important as all your other organs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What does this have to do with me literally dying on stage?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your microbiome does all kinds of stuff for you. It plays with hormones in your blood. It can even talk to your brain over your vagus nerve.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that like when you&#39;ve got the nerve to say &#39;hit me&#39; at the blackjack table?&quot;</p>
<p>Thyra groaned. &quot;Vagus, not Vegas. Anyway, the bacteria, they affect how you feel. They can even effect how you think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So creepy gross bugs in my compost guts can give me indigestion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, they can do that. They can give you anxiety and panic attacks. They can also do the opposite.&quot;</p>
<p>Kelan&#39;s brow furrowed. &quot;Wait, do you like get high on kombucha?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no—well, sort of maybe you could—but no. Look, you remember my last job before this was in biotech?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. Wait, is this like GMO kombucha?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, yes! I absconded with some cultures when I quit. I&#39;ve been tinkering with some bacteria that a bunch of studies say could be used to treat performance anxiety and social sensitivity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you&#39;re going to brew me up a nasty potion and I won&#39;t die on stage after I drink it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn&#39;t put it like—oh, hmm, I guess I could put it like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I don&#39;t believe you. But, I&#39;m desperate. When can you have this all mixed up in your cauldron? I&#39;d like to give it a trial run before I commit to my doom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think I got some already bottled in my fridge at home. Want to swing by and pick some up after work?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, what have I got to lose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Excellent. I promise not to turn you into a newt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Promise me you will, if this doesn&#39;t work. That way, I&#39;ll have a good excuse to skip this keynote thing.&quot;</p>
