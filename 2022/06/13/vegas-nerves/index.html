</figure>

<p>"No, you don't understand," said Kelan. "They want me to give a talk."</p>
<p>"Well, yeah," said Thyra, "that's what a keynote speaker does. You give the opening talk."</p>
<p>"You mean, like, the very first talk?"</p>
<p>"Yup, that's a keynote: the first talk everybody goes to."</p>
<p>"Holy crap, that's so much worse! I thought maybe I could sneak off to some time slot on the last day when everyone's already running off the airport!"</p>
<p>"You could say no."</p>
<p>"It's kind of a big deal though."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"And they might not ever invite me back."</p>
<p>"That's true."</p>
<p>Kelan looked miserable. "You're not helping."</p>
<p>Thyra laughed. "No, I guess I'm not. You're too easy to mess with, though!"</p>
<p>"Ugh," said Kelan. "This is serious. I'm going to have a panic attack behind the podium and pass out in front of everyone."</p>
<p>Thyra sighed. "Okay, listen, I've got one word for you: kombucha."</p>
<p>"What, that gross tea crap from the co-op?"</p>
<p>"No, yeah, that stuff is gross. I make my own." Thyra frowned for a second. "Okay, honestly, mine's gross too."</p>
<p>"You're not selling me on this."</p>
<p>Thyra rolled her eyes. "No, listen listen listen: it doesn't matter how it tastes. It's all about the SCOBY."</p>
<p>"From the cartoon?"</p>
<p>"Not Scooby, SCOBY: a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast."</p>
<p>"That sounds like my compost bin."</p>
<p>"Your gut is like a compost bin."</p>
<p>"That's a novel insult."</p>
<p>"Okay, so, your gut is full of bacteria—"</p>
<p>"Gross."</p>
<p>"Stay with me. The bacteria is your microbiome. It's about as important as all your other organs."</p>
<p>"What does this have to do with me literally dying on stage?"</p>
<p>"Your microbiome does all kinds of stuff for you. It plays with hormones in your blood. It can even talk to your brain over your vagus nerve."</p>
<p>"Is that like when you've got the nerve to say 'hit me' at the blackjack table?"</p>
<p>Thyra groaned. "Vagus, not Vegas. Anyway, the bacteria, they affect how you feel. They can even effect how you think."</p>
<p>"So creepy gross bugs in my compost guts can give me indigestion."</p>
<p>"Sure, they can do that. They can give you anxiety and panic attacks. They can also do the opposite."</p>
<p>Kelan's brow furrowed. "Wait, do you like get high on kombucha?"</p>
<p>"No, no—well, sort of maybe you could—but no. Look, you remember my last job before this was in biotech?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Wait, is this like GMO kombucha?"</p>
<p>"Actually, yes! I absconded with some cultures when I quit. I've been tinkering with some bacteria that a bunch of studies say could be used to treat performance anxiety and social sensitivity."</p>
<p>"So you're going to brew me up a nasty potion and I won't die on stage after I drink it."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't put it like—oh, hmm, I guess I could put it like that."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't believe you. But, I'm desperate. When can you have this all mixed up in your cauldron? I'd like to give it a trial run before I commit to my doom."</p>
<p>"I think I got some already bottled in my fridge at home. Want to swing by and pick some up after work?"</p>
<p>"Sure, what have I got to lose."</p>
<p>"Excellent. I promise not to turn you into a newt."</p>
<p>"Promise me you will, if this doesn't work. That way, I'll have a good excuse to skip this keynote thing."</p>
