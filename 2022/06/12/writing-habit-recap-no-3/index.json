It&#39;s neither the story I started with, nor the story I expected to end up with. But, it&#39;s a finished story, and that&#39;s more than I&#39;ve managed in years.</p>\n<p>In short, it&#39;s the story of a human named Finley and an asteroid terraforming AI named Charley. There are also humans named Quinn and Wren who make things complicated.</p>\n<p>Hopefully it&#39;s a decent story. I also have half a hope to write more about these folks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dall·e-mini\">DALL·E Mini</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini\"><img src=\"dalle-logo.png\" class=\"inset right\" /></a></p>\n<p>Next thing is that—along with what seems like the rest of the internet—I&#39;ve started playing with <a href=\"https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini\">DALL·E Mini</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s turning out very handy to generate cover images for my writing exercises. It also feels like it could work for story prompts, where I generate the image first before diving into the writing exercise proper.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/1534952790698577920\">Initially, I felt squicky about it possibly ripping off images from the internet</a>. But, as I&#39;ve played with it and read about it more, the squick factor is fading a bit. </p>\n<p>A few things I&#39;m doing that make me feel better about the process so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I&#39;m running the image generation on my own hardware. I&#39;d like to train my own model at some point, but personal understanding of the process and insufficient hardware blocks that for now.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I generate a dozen or so images for each story from a handful of varied phrases before picking one image to run with. I&#39;m not sure this makes the process any more creative? But, I guess at least I&#39;m not just running off with the first thing it spits out?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/main/script/tweak-covers.sh\">run the images through ImageMagick</a> to pixelate and reduce the color palette.

I think that better matches the vague, half-baked nature of these writing exercises.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Maybe I&#39;m just filing the serial numbers off pirated clip art?
