<h2 id="finley-and-charley-a-short-story">Finley and Charley, a short story</h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/06/07/finley-and-charley/"><img src="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/06/07/finley-and-charley/cover.png" width="150" class="inset left" /></a></p>
<p>It took me about two weeks, but I took a break from daily writing exercises and finished a 5,359 word short story called &quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/06/07/finley-and-charley/">Finley and Charley</a>&quot;. It&#39;s neither the story I started with, nor the story I expected to end up with. But, it&#39;s a finished story, and that&#39;s more than I&#39;ve managed in years.</p>
<p>In short, it&#39;s the story of a human named Finley and an asteroid terraforming AI named Charley. There are also humans named Quinn and Wren who make things complicated.</p>
<p>Hopefully it&#39;s a decent story. I also have half a hope to write more about these folks.</p>
<h2 id="dall·e-mini">DALL·E Mini</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini"><img src="dalle-logo.png" class="inset right" /></a></p>
<p>Next thing is that—along with what seems like the rest of the internet—I&#39;ve started playing with <a href="https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini">DALL·E Mini</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s turning out very handy to generate cover images for my writing exercises. It also feels like it could work for story prompts, where I generate the image first before diving into the writing exercise proper.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/1534952790698577920">Initially, I felt squicky about it possibly ripping off images from the internet</a>. But, as I&#39;ve played with it and read about it more, the squick factor is fading a bit. </p>
<p>A few things I&#39;m doing that make me feel better about the process so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I&#39;m running the image generation on my own hardware. I&#39;d like to train my own model at some point, but personal understanding of the process and insufficient hardware blocks that for now.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I generate a dozen or so images for each story from a handful of varied phrases before picking one image to run with. I&#39;m not sure this makes the process any more creative? But, I guess at least I&#39;m not just running off with the first thing it spits out?</p>
</li>
<li><p>I <a href="https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/main/script/tweak-covers.sh">run the images through ImageMagick</a> to pixelate and reduce the color palette. That applies a kind of lofi 90s web grunge to the images. I think that better matches the vague, half-baked nature of these writing exercises.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m just filing the serial numbers off pirated clip art? Maybe I&#39;ll delete all the cover images in another week or two and feel bad about the whole thing again.</p>
<h2 id="moar-writing-exercises">Moar writing exercises</h2>
<p>I also managed to get through a few more writing exercises. Some of these feel like they could grow into parts of longer stories, which is definitely a goal of doing these.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><img src="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/16/pressure/cover.png" width="64" /> — &quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/16/pressure/">Pressure</a>&quot;</p>
<p>Beer, witchcraft, trepanation - more writing toward toward the <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/tag/marekandkorrine/">Marek and Korrine</a> story, which I have a notion to continue into something bigger</p>
</li>
<li><p><img src="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/17/exchange/cover.png" width="64" /> — &quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/17/exchange/">Exchange</a>&quot;</p>
<p>This is a quick follow-on to &quot;Pressure&quot; to follow some more story threads.</p>
</li>
<li><p><img src="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/18/vinge-and-vonda/cover.png" width="64" /> — &quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/18/vinge-and-vonda/">Vinge and Vonda</a>&quot;</p>
<p>Fanfic in <a href="https://adapalmer.com/series/terra-ignota/">Ada Palmer&#39;s Terra Ignota universe</a>, because I was thinking about <a href="https://terra-ignota.fandom.com/wiki/Utopia">the Utopian Hive</a> and burnout.</p>
</li>
<li><p><img src="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/19/making-friends-with-peanuts/cover.png" width="64" /> — &quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/19/making-friends-with-peanuts/">Making Friends with Peanuts&quot;</a></p>
<p>I keep wanting to make friends with the crows in my yard with peanuts. Progress is slow, although I have already made inroads with the squirrels and a blue jay.</p>
</li>
<li><p><img src="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/06/07/kyleigh-and-helenka/cover.png" width="64" /> — &quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/06/07/kyleigh-and-helenka/">Kyleigh and Helenka</a>&quot;</p>
<p>More witches in the forest, maybe in the same world as <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/tag/marekandkorrine/">Marek and Korrine</a>? </p>
</li>
<li><p><img src="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/06/08/judge-rhisart/cover.png" width="64" /> — &quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/06/08/judge-rhisart/">Judge Rhisart</a>&quot;</p>
<p>A judge spends a few hours in other folks&#39; shoes</p>
</li>
<li><p><img src="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/06/09/radmilo-and-dominik/cover.png" width="64" /> — &quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/06/09/radmilo-and-dominik/">Radmilo and Dominik</a>&quot;</p>
<p>Talking to fireflies and an angry dad, possibly also <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/tag/marekandkorrine/">Marek and Korrine</a> adjacent.</p>
</li>
<li><p><img src="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/06/10/konnors-first-paycheck/cover.png" width="64" /> — &quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/06/10/konnors-first-paycheck/">Konnor&#39;s First Paycheck</a>&quot;</p>
<p>I just kind of wandered around with bantering open office dialogue in this one.</p>
</li>
<li><p><img src="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/06/12/jays-machine-friends/cover.png" width="64" /> — &quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/06/12/jays-machine-friends/">Jay&#39;s Machine Friends</a>&quot;</p>
<p>Be nice to machines and they might reciprocate?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#39;s all for now for this recap. Hopefully I&#39;ll be back sooner with a few more exercises to talk about. Aiming to take another swing at a short story in the next few weeks.</p>
