<p>"Hey, asshole," a man shouted, "eat this!"</p>
<p>I felt something soft but weighty whack against my face and gently roll off to the ground. I'd been dozing under a tree, so it took awhile for my eyes to open and focus. I pushed myself up to sit and picked the thing up. It was a turkey sandwich on sourdough, neatly packaged in plastic wrap.</p>
<p>Against my better judgement, I said, "What the hell, man?"</p>
<p>"You're looking all ragged and hungry," he barked, "and I'm sick of seeing it."</p>
<p>The guy had to be in his 70s. He was spry but had a deep-lined face, all framed by a grey beard and close-cropped silver hair. He towered over me, but didn't really seem all that imposing in his sandals and jorts and floral short-sleeved button-up. Still, I'd had my ass kicked by less likely contenders before.</p>
<p>"You heard me," he said, brandishing a stubby calloused finger at me. "I walk through this park every other day. I see you here all the time, just wasting away. Eat that damn sandwich."</p>
<p>I sniffed at the sandwich. "You put shit in this?"</p>
<p>"Fuck you, did I put shit in that," he said. "What kind of question is that?"</p>
<p>He stepped closer toward me and I couldn't help but shrink away. He plonked down next to me against the tree. This close, he smelled of caffeine and nicotene, both comforting and a threat to my broken brain. He pulled another sandwich out of a fanny pack around his waist. I just kind of stared as he unwrapped it halfway and took a big bite out of it.</p>
<p>"Here, trade you," he said, offering his sandwich to me.</p>
<p>"That's okay," I said.</p>
<p>"I don't have cooties," he said.</p>
<p>"I believe you," I said. I started unwrapping the sandwich he gave me.</p>
<p>"Alright, that's good," he said. "You eat that whole thing."</p>
<p>"You know, man," I said, taking a bite, "you're being pretty fuckin' aggressive."</p>
<p>"It's because I'm scared of you," he said. He sighed and leaned back against the tree. "But I'm also tired of being scared. And I really do feel sick just watching you turn all skin and bones."</p>
<p>I didn't know what to say to that. I stared off and ate some more sandwich. He ate some of his and stared off, too. Looking like he just remembered something, he pulled out a little bottle of water from his pack and handed it to me. I took it, opened it, drank, and stared some more.</p>
<p>"When you're done eating that," he said, after awhile, "I want to hear your story, if that's okay." </p>
<p>"Yeah," I said, "okay."</p>
