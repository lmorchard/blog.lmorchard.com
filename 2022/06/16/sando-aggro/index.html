<p>&quot;Hey, asshole,&quot; a man shouted, &quot;eat this!&quot;</p>
<p>I felt something soft but weighty whack against my face and gently roll off to the ground. I&#39;d been dozing under a tree, so it took awhile for my eyes to open and focus. I pushed myself up to sit and picked the thing up. It was a turkey sandwich on sourdough, neatly packaged in plastic wrap.</p>
<p>Against my better judgement, I said, &quot;What the hell, man?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re looking all ragged and hungry,&quot; he barked, &quot;and I&#39;m sick of seeing it.&quot;</p>
<p>The guy had to be in his 70s. He was spry but had a deep-lined face, all framed by a grey beard and close-cropped silver hair. He towered over me, but didn&#39;t really seem all that imposing in his sandals and jorts and floral short-sleeved button-up. Still, I&#39;d had my ass kicked by less likely contenders before.</p>
<p>&quot;You heard me,&quot; he said, brandishing a stubby calloused finger at me. &quot;I walk through this park every other day. I see you here all the time, just wasting away. Eat that damn sandwich.&quot;</p>
<p>I sniffed at the sandwich. &quot;You put shit in this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck you, did I put shit in that,&quot; he said. &quot;What kind of question is that?&quot;</p>
<p>He stepped closer toward me and I couldn&#39;t help but shrink away. He plonked down next to me against the tree. This close, he smelled of caffeine and nicotene, both comforting and a threat to my broken brain. He pulled another sandwich out of a fanny pack around his waist. I just kind of stared as he unwrapped it halfway and took a big bite out of it.</p>
<p>&quot;Here, trade you,&quot; he said, offering his sandwich to me.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t have cooties,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe you,&quot; I said. I started unwrapping the sandwich he gave me.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, that&#39;s good,&quot; he said. &quot;You eat that whole thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know, man,&quot; I said, taking a bite, &quot;you&#39;re being pretty fuckin&#39; aggressive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s because I&#39;m scared of you,&quot; he said. He sighed and leaned back against the tree. &quot;But I&#39;m also tired of being scared. And I really do feel sick just watching you turn all skin and bones.&quot;</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t know what to say to that. I stared off and ate some more sandwich. He ate some of his and stared off, too. Looking like he just remembered something, he pulled out a little bottle of water from his pack and handed it to me. I took it, opened it, drank, and stared some more.</p>
<p>&quot;When you&#39;re done eating that,&quot; he said, after awhile, &quot;I want to hear your story, if that&#39;s okay.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said, &quot;okay.&quot;</p>
