<p>Miriam watched how Goibniu moved into the room. Ey trundled in, turned around, carefully watched the room&#39;s door as ey closed it behind em. Ey painstakingly navigated the tables and chairs placed throughout the nearly-deserted break room.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Goibniu,&quot; she said. &quot;Come hang out with me.&quot;</p>
<p>The upper two of four uncannily humanoid eyes tracked her in return, while the lower two fixated on the carpet. </p>
<p>Eir body plan was centaur-adjacent: There were four jointed locomotive limbs in contact with the ground, sprouting from a pelvis elongated parallel to gravity. A torso rose from one end, itself hosting four segmented arms subdivided into a quartet of smaller fingers at the ends. A bulbous octopoid sensory cluster emerged from the top like a head, though Miriam knew eir neural infrastructure was more widely distributed than a human&#39;s singular brain.</p>
<p>Miriam reached over and scooted a couple of chairs out of the way. Goibniu sidled up to Miriam&#39;s table and settled down, folding eir legs neatly under to settle into a feline loaf. Ey sighed and brought eir arms down to rest on the table, interlacing all sixteen of eir fingers in a habitual braid.</p>
<p>Goibniu fluted a greeting from the vocal orifice atop eir sensory bulb. Miriam&#39;s implant translated this to a contralto voice: &quot;How&#39;s it go?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It goes well,&quot; said Miriam. &quot;And with you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Also going well with me,&quot; ey said. </p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s funny,&quot; she said, &quot;the way you walked in here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You laugh at my walking,&quot; ey said, tilting eir head back quarrelously. &quot;Two legs fall over so easily, you should talk.&quot;</p>
<p>Miriam laughed. &quot;No, friend,&quot; she said, &quot;you just reminded me of something. Did you have pets, growing up?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pets?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Smaller animals, adopted as family.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes, I see. We had several such critters in our home. In fact, I had three &#39;pets&#39; before I came here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you miss them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes yes. But, you suffice.&quot;</p>
<p>Miriam laughed again. &quot;Good one!&quot;</p>
<p>Goibniu shook in silent amusement.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway,&quot; she said, &quot;I remember watching doorways to make sure the cats wouldn&#39;t get out. And I remember watching my feet to make sure I didn&#39;t step on one of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Goibniu nodded, an affectation ey&#39;d acquired from her. &quot;I see,&quot; ey said, &quot;yes, same. Always looking. Careful around the critters. Easy to trample and blunder and regret. Better to take care.&quot;</p>
<p>Miriam nodded. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;all of that was the same for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Different but same we are,&quot; said Goibniu. &quot;You enjoy collecting these intersections.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess I do,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Goibniu unlaced a set of fingers to reach over and pat Miriam on the head.</p>
