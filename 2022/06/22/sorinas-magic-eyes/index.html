<p>Sorina thought it was a brilliant idea. Those Magic Eye posters were selling out like mad at the mall. She knew just how to improve them: put them on a computer screen and <em>make them move</em>. Better yet, <em>make them interactive</em> as computer games.</p>
<p>It was also just the excuse she needed to upgrade her old 286 to a brand new 386SX with a CD-ROM and brand new sound card. She hit the mall on the way home from work and left with the new machine and a trunk full of posters.</p>
<p>She had enough download credits on a zone-call BBS to grab a pirated C++ IDE from the files section. While ZModem did it&#39;s thing, she spread all the posters out on every flat surface in her apartment. Weird nautical scenes, kaleidoscopic stained glass, psychedelic swirls, nonsensical cartoon collagesâ€”a visual cacophony she strained to force into meaning.</p>
<p>Once she got the knack, though, it was like she&#39;d always seen hearts and eagles and planets and sailboats condensing out of the patterns of noise. Something had rewired her brain and thereafter she couldn&#39;t not see it. It was kind of creepy, really. But, she could understand why people were buying these things.</p>
<p>She needed to do more than just see the shapes, though. She needed to work out how to <em>make</em> them. Staring and staring, she experimented with her eyes until she understood it was about staring <em>through</em> the image until repeating segments of the pattern overlapped. Except, the segments didn&#39;t <em>perfectly</em> repeat: little parts here and there were subtly shifted with respect to each other.</p>
<p>She checked the file transfer: about 47% done, another hour to go at least. She hoped she&#39;d remembered to turn off call waiting.</p>
<p>She started doodling in pencil: just some simple outlines, repeated side-by-side. She played with the separation and got a feel for its relationship to the simulation of depth. She didn&#39;t really have the math down, but she could stumble her way toward that once she started programming some graphics.</p>
<p>Her new PC beeped: the file transfer was done. Time to try unpacking and installing it, then she could get to work. </p>
