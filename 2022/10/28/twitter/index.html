          <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I&#39;m navel gazing about Twitter over here.</p>
<!--more-->

<p><img src="IMG_0759.png" alt="&quot;Crows on a wire&quot;"></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been on Twitter since October 2006 - 16 years, as of this month. It replaced the social writing I used to do here, to my great shame as a proponent of the DIY web.</p>
<p>In the beginning, it was a watercooler for Silicon Valley folks. Being <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2006/06/24/go-west-young-man/">a Silicon Valley transplant at the time</a>, this was handy for me. When <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2008/05/14/go-midwest-young-man/">we replanted to the midwest</a>, it helped me stay in touch with distant acquaintances. Since then, it&#39;s become a place where I eavesdrop on interesting strangers and occasionally try to say something amusing. For a while, <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2016/11/11/heartbroken/">it turned into a rage room</a> to vent about the world&#39;s manifold fuckery. But, with the exception of occasional relapses, <a href="https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/1508492761690869760">I&#39;ve tried to lighten up</a>.</p>
<p><img src="twitter-hot-takes.png" alt="Let the hot take float away"></p>
<p>I often consider ditching Twitter. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation">Of course</a>, I&#39;m considering it again. Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHZGqBVBCRw">Dread Pirate Roberts</a>, I say &quot;Good night, Twitter. Good work. Sleep well. I&#39;ll most likely quit you in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>For lack of a better description, Twitter is a comfy place for me to be a social coward. I can launch missives into the ether and retreat. Sometimes, when I come back, responses have arrived.</p>
<p>It&#39;s all very indirect and deferred, like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/multiplayer-gaming-envelopes-stamps-play-by-mail-history/">a play-by-mail game</a>. Or like the discussion forums of single-line <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/category/computers/bbs-history">dial-up BBSes</a> from when I was a pre-teen. I don&#39;t have to address anyone in particular or engage with <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2017/02/02/operation-anxiety/">the exhausting phenomenon</a> of having drawn immediate, in-the-moment attention. (It bears saying, of course, that this is a description of my experience from a position of privilege and luck. Mileage varies dramatically for others.)</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have any particularly strong bonds via Twitter. How could I, considering my nebula of <a href="https://twitter.com/lmorchard/followers">~4,500 followers</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lmorchard/following">~4,900 followed</a>? This is not an achievement, it&#39;s just impulsive accumulation from over a decade-and-a-half on the site.</p>
<p>What are all these accounts? How many are piloted by genuine people? How many care or know who I am? If pressed to perform an inventory, I could recall some details. In any case, it&#39;d be absurd to say that I&#39;m friends with 5000 people. There might be a few who&#39;d show up for a party, even fewer who&#39;d help me move a couch or pick me up at the airport. (<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2021/09/14/in-volvation/">Not that I&#39;ve thrown a party or been to an airport in years</a>, but I&#39;ve heard that these are defining features of friendship.)</p>
<p>So, what am I doing on Twitter? Social cowardice as a service sounds like a disservice. Rather than daily social junk food, should I reconsider my habits of social outreach with greater mindful intent?</p>
<p>I mean, sure. But, that sounds like a lot of fraught work. I prefer to avoid it. I also don&#39;t know how to be social. Do I just:</p>
<ul>
<li>go doomscroll <a href="https://hackers.town/@lmorchard">on Mastodon</a>?</li>
<li>return here to blog into the silent void?</li>
<li>jump around a bunch of Discords and say hello before immediately ghosting?</li>
<li>review my contacts and embark on an old-school personal correspondence habit that I will also abandon with haste?</li>
</ul>
<p>If I knew how to be an effective social human, I wouldn&#39;t need to lean on Twitter. My social life has been mediated by computers since I first used a modem in the 80s. I don&#39;t think that, for me, making friends in the offline world is an atrophied skill. Rather, I think it&#39;s that <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2005/03/22/online-social-skills/">I&#39;ve never really had the knack</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have no conclusions. I just wanted to write into a different part of the ether for a change. Comment, if you like. I&#39;ll be here brooding over whether I feel like <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2020/05/24/easy-blog-oven/">rewriting my blog build system from scratch</a> yet again.</p>
