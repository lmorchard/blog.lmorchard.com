<p>This prompt is a little too real right now. Not sure how much unbridled ambition I had, but the parts about burnout and disillusionment are too true a story. Hard to get my head into a place where I might write some fiction about it.</p>
<p>Very tired now, going to bed soon. Played Vampire Survivors all day rather than write to this prompt, or do much of anything else. I guess it&#39;s Easter, but that just makes me anxious and sad about a lot of things.</p>
<p>Maybe I could turn this prompt into a story someday soon. They say to write what you know. And I know this. But touching this set of ideas right now is like draining my power to ground.</p>
<p>I want to write about different things, right now. Exciting things. Adventurous things. Weird things.</p>
<p>Though, to be honest, I&#39;m maybe trying too hard to write those things and be clever. Maybe I need to spend some time writing some simple, mundane scenes. Not try to make everything a space opera or a fantasy epic in progress. Hard to come up with something cool every day, whether or not the thing I come up with actually ends up being cool.</p>
<p>So, this isn&#39;t fiction. I feel like I&#39;m cheating. But I guess it could count as a creative writing exercise. I&#39;m writing. I&#39;m thinking about creativity. I&#39;m thinking about stories. It&#39;s more journalistic than the other days so far, but maybe that&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t tend to share my journal entries with anyone.</p>
<p>But anyway, as for making this count for my goal: I&#39;m the one who&#39;s making me do this. I can decide this counts. It&#39;s thinking about writing stories. This is doing the work. Or doing some kind of work, anyway.</p>
<p>Not sure whether I&#39;ll post this one to my blog or not - though I guess it does make for a decent meta post about this writing exercise habit I&#39;ve been trying to establish.</p>
