Yes, thank you, I think,&quot; replied Asceline out loud. &quot;I do try to keep it polished.&quot;</p>\n<p>Chemryth gave a gentle chuff. &quot;You don&#39;t need to make sound for me to understand, if you&#39;re worried about the others finding you.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; thought Asceline in reply, &quot;thank you again. I am worried about that.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I would imagine so. Now, why have you come? Despite your terror, you don&#39;t seem inclined to attack.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Oh, no, never. That would be altogether foolish. No, I just hoped I could ask you some questions?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;You may ask. It&#39;s even possible that I might answer.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Oh. Okay. So, first question: Why do you pay the men who live here?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Because they hunt for me and bring me things.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Couldn&#39;t you go hunt for yourself and get your own things?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes, but that would require me to leave my hoard unguarded.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Why do you even have this hoard?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;So I can pay men to hunt for me and bring me things.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be better not to be bound to this hoard?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Perhaps. But I also think it&#39;s pretty and the metal makes for a soft bed.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Soft? Oh, I suppose gold might be soft for someone like you.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Indeed. You have more questions, no?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes. Is there anything I could do to convince you to stop paying these men?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;These men in particular?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Perhaps you could convince different men to attend to me? I don&#39;t care about these in particular. I suspect that&#39;s why they&#39;re so quarrelsome toward others who come to visit me.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;You&#39;d pay anyone who hunted for you?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;And brought me things, yes.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;So, just hypothetically: If those men were all killed, would that anger you?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;No. They haven&#39;t especially endeared themselves to me. I would be annoyed by missing meals and gifts, though.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Ah. So, if the hunting and the gifting continues - but these particular men all died - you wouldn&#39;t leave here and ravage the countryside?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;No. That sounds like a great deal of effort and not very interesting.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;One last question.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Please ask.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What does strike you as endearing?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Conversation and entertainment, my dear.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Has this conversation been entertaining?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Mildly so, yes.
