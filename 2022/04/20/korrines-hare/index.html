<p>Without thinking, Korrine made her father&#39;s bones whole. Only after did it occur to her that she might have made a mistake. </p>
<p>She&#39;d spent long hours alone, out in the woods, where she thought Marek couldn&#39;t see. When she sat still and closed her eyes, she could feel the life all around her. Flitting and leaping and sprinting and creeping and hiding - and often, when she opened her eyes, she was surrounded by calm, quiet animals.</p>
<p>Once, a hare had crawled into her lap. Docile and trusting but very ill. She stroked the hare&#39;s ears and looked inside. Life&#39;s pattern within was tangled. Sluggish and blocked. </p>
<p>Korrine teased the snags apart like brushing a horse&#39;s mane. The hare&#39;s pulse quickened. Life bloomed within the little creature - the doe&#39;s own and seven more sparks all brightening. When the girl opened her eyes, the pregnant doe sprang into the air and scampered around Korrine in a circle before sprinting off into the trees. </p>
<p>She felt an urge to hide what she could do. She barely understood it. She couldn&#39;t have imagined that stern Marek would look upon it kindly.</p>
<p>And yet, his arm healed, Marek smiled. He laughed. He even began to cry. That scared her more that anything.</p>
<p>&quot;You would have brought your mother joy,&quot; said Marek. &quot;You bring me great joy.&quot;</p>
<p>Then, it was Korrine&#39;s turn to cry. </p>
