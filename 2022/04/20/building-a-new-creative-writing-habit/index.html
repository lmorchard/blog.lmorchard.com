        <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I'm trying to build a new creative writing habit. The immediate form that this has taken is a goal of writing <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/tag/fiction/">300 words of fiction per day</a> that I post to my blog. I've been using 3-card spreads from a Tarot deck to supply writing prompts. I'm hoping I keep it up.</p>

<p>As far back as elementary school, I've wanted to tell stories. In sprints of hyperfocus and occasional attempts at habit formation, I <em>have</em> written stories over the years. But, I've never done it with regularity. I've rarely finished anything big. And, I've very rarely shared it with anyone.</p>
<p>I'd like to change all of that. Why? Call it a mid-life crisis, I guess. <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2021/09/14/in-volvation/">The manifold fuckery</a> of the last few years, paired my own temporal proximity to a half-century of existence has enhanced the urgency of attending to things that I've wanted but haven't quite managed to do.</p>
<p>What's different this time? I don't know. I have an intention and I'd like to follow through on it. This is not one of my strengths as a <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast/">serial enthusiast</a>. But, nonetheless, I want to try.</p>
<p>Regularity is the first hurdle, I think. But, I'm encouraged by the fact that <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2017/01/31/pages-and-pens/">since 2016</a> I've been able to maintain a habit of 3 handwritten journal pages nearly every weekday. Just 3 pages daily doesn't sound like much. But, I've filled almost 3,800 pages. I wouldn't assert that they're good words or that anyone should ever read them, but I <em>have</em> been writing. </p>
<p><img src="366BC739-E5C3-4ED6-B424-BEE08336110F.jpeg" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>So, that's why I'm trying to establish a habit with a daily goal of at least 300 words. Something small, but repeated. Something that I <em>should</em> be able to fit into every single day. Maybe I'll write more some days, but the important thing is that I get the engine to turn over.</p>
<p>And, speaking of finishing something big: If I keep it up for 6 months, I'll have accumulated enough words for a novel. Of course, to be fair, a lot of those words are going to be throwaway garbage. But, what if just through sheer volume and writing practice, I could extract sufficient good-enough words to produce a few short stories or novellas? That would be more than I've managed to achieve in literally decades.</p>
<p>In closing, I don't really know if it's going to work. However, I <em>do</em> know that nothing else <em>has</em> worked. This habit thing seems like a new angle on the problem. If it doesn't work out, well I guess I tried. If it does work, well I guess that'll be pretty cool.</p>
