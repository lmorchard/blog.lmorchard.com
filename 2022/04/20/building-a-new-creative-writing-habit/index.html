          <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I&#39;m trying to build a new creative writing habit. The immediate form that this has taken is a goal of writing <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/tag/fiction/">300 words of fiction per day</a> that I post to my blog. I&#39;ve been using 3-card spreads from a Tarot deck to supply writing prompts. I&#39;m hoping I keep it up.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>As far back as elementary school, I&#39;ve wanted to tell stories. In sprints of hyperfocus and occasional attempts at habit formation, I <em>have</em> written stories over the years. But, I&#39;ve never done it with regularity. I&#39;ve rarely finished anything big. And, I&#39;ve very rarely shared it with anyone.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to change all of that. Why? Call it a mid-life crisis, I guess. <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2021/09/14/in-volvation/">The manifold fuckery</a> of the last few years, paired my own temporal proximity to a half-century of existence has enhanced the urgency of attending to things that I&#39;ve wanted but haven&#39;t quite managed to do.</p>
<p>What&#39;s different this time? I don&#39;t know. I have an intention and I&#39;d like to follow through on it. This is not one of my strengths as a <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast/">serial enthusiast</a>. But, nonetheless, I want to try.</p>
<p>Regularity is the first hurdle, I think. But, I&#39;m encouraged by the fact that <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2017/01/31/pages-and-pens/">since 2016</a> I&#39;ve been able to maintain a habit of 3 handwritten journal pages nearly every weekday. Just 3 pages daily doesn&#39;t sound like much. But, I&#39;ve filled almost 3,800 pages. I wouldn&#39;t assert that they&#39;re good words or that anyone should ever read them, but I <em>have</em> been writing. </p>
<p><img src="366BC739-E5C3-4ED6-B424-BEE08336110F.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>So, that&#39;s why I&#39;m trying to establish a habit with a daily goal of at least 300 words. Something small, but repeated. Something that I <em>should</em> be able to fit into every single day. Maybe I&#39;ll write more some days, but the important thing is that I get the engine to turn over.</p>
<p>And, speaking of finishing something big: If I keep it up for 6 months, I&#39;ll have accumulated enough words for a novel. Of course, to be fair, a lot of those words are going to be throwaway garbage. But, what if just through sheer volume and writing practice, I could extract sufficient good-enough words to produce a few short stories or novellas? That would be more than I&#39;ve managed to achieve in literally decades.</p>
<p>In closing, I don&#39;t really know if it&#39;s going to work. However, I <em>do</em> know that nothing else <em>has</em> worked. This habit thing seems like a new angle on the problem. If it doesn&#39;t work out, well I guess I tried. If it does work, well I guess that&#39;ll be pretty cool.</p>
