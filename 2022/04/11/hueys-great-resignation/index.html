<p>Huey clomped along the open grid floor of the narrow utility corridor, tool-laden bags dangling from his well-worn belt. He muttered at a hand terminal, alternating between prodding the screen and sweeping its sensor stalk at the walls. </p>
<p>He cursed at the readout and came to a halt. He scratched thoughtfully at his scraggly greying beard. He tapped out a sequence with calloused fingers moving more nimbly than one might expect. The terminal chimed decisively.</p>
<p>"Hey there," he said to the floor. </p>
<p>"Hey yourself," said an upturned face, just barely visible in the dim space below. Huey could also see the glint of a weapon aimed steadily at his crotch.</p>
<p>A few seconds passed. The only sound was the gentle thrumming of the ship's engines.</p>
<p>Huey coughed. "You wouldn't happen to be a faulty network router, would you?"</p>
<p>"Would you believe me if I said yes?"</p>
<p>"Would you shoot me in the back if I kept walking?"</p>
<p>"Honestly? Maybe. Though, I'd prefer not to."</p>
<p>Huey sighed and shifted on his feet. "Mind if I take a load off?"</p>
<p>The gun gave a magnanimous gesture and lowered. "Be my guest."</p>
<p>With a groan, Huey carefully lowered himself down to the floor and sat. "Well, that's refreshing. The honesty, I mean."</p>
<p>"I notice you're alone and there aren't any alarms sounding."</p>
<p>"I bet you've also noticed that this interstellar trash heap is grossly understaffed and running on the cheap."</p>
<p>"I had noticed that."</p>
<p>"In fact, the only thing of real value onboard is an encrypted data cache."</p>
<p>Huey's companion chuckled. "Full disclosure: I was aware of that too."</p>
<p>"I figured. Otherwise you wouldn't be up to your virtual elbows trying to liberate it from my systems."</p>
<p>The face below sighed and the gun came back up. "So, there are alarms going off and I just can't hear them."</p>
<p>Huey took a deep breath, let it out. "I'm the only one who can hear them. The boss got tired of getting paged in the middle of the night."</p>
<p>The face said nothing, but at least the gun didn't fire.</p>
<p>"You want to hear something you might not know?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure I can handle any more surprises."</p>
<p>"I'll tell you anyway: I can extract and decrypt that cache."</p>
<p>The gun lowered. "Why are you telling me this?"</p>
<p>"How many seats on your shuttle?"</p>
<p>"Two."</p>
<p>"Good. Fifty-fifty split."</p>
<p>"Eighty-twenty."</p>
<p>"Seventy-thirty. Extraction now, decryption later—after you've holstered that weapon and we're both far away."</p>
<p>"Sold. Now what?"</p>
<p>Huey rattled off some commands on the terminal. It chimed. "Cache extracted. I've also locked everyone in their cabins and shut off the comms. Let's get out of here."</p>
<p>The face laughed and hands reached up to push the floor panel aside. "A little help?"</p>
<p>"Sure," said Huey, reaching down to clasp a delicate hand and pull. Up came a lithe man with a dancer's body clad in a skin-tight vacsuit. The gun was stowed in a hip pouch. Huey whistled appreciatively.</p>
<p>"That awful here, huh?"</p>
<p>"I would have sold these assholes out for a ride, let alone cash."</p>
<p>"I should have haggled more. You need to grab anything on the way out?"</p>
<p>"Nah," said Huey, patting his belt pouches. "Anything worth anything is already on me."</p>
<p>"Sounds good," said the man, grinning. He gestured down the corridor. They started walking.</p>
