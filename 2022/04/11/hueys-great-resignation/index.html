<p>Huey clomped along the open grid floor of the narrow utility corridor, tool-laden bags dangling from his well-worn belt. He muttered at a hand terminal, alternating between prodding the screen and sweeping its sensor stalk at the walls. </p>
<p>He cursed at the readout and came to a halt. He scratched thoughtfully at his scraggly greying beard. He tapped out a sequence with calloused fingers moving more nimbly than one might expect. The terminal chimed decisively.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey there,&quot; he said to the floor. </p>
<p>&quot;Hey yourself,&quot; said an upturned face, just barely visible in the dim space below. Huey could also see the glint of a weapon aimed steadily at his crotch.</p>
<p>A few seconds passed. The only sound was the gentle thrumming of the ship&#39;s engines.</p>
<p>Huey coughed. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t happen to be a faulty network router, would you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would you believe me if I said yes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would you shoot me in the back if I kept walking?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Honestly? Maybe. Though, I&#39;d prefer not to.&quot;</p>
<p>Huey sighed and shifted on his feet. &quot;Mind if I take a load off?&quot;</p>
<p>The gun gave a magnanimous gesture and lowered. &quot;Be my guest.&quot;</p>
<p>With a groan, Huey carefully lowered himself down to the floor and sat. &quot;Well, that&#39;s refreshing. The honesty, I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I notice you&#39;re alone and there aren&#39;t any alarms sounding.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I bet you&#39;ve also noticed that this interstellar trash heap is grossly understaffed and running on the cheap.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I had noticed that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, the only thing of real value onboard is an encrypted data cache.&quot;</p>
<p>Huey&#39;s companion chuckled. &quot;Full disclosure: I was aware of that too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I figured. Otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be up to your virtual elbows trying to liberate it from my systems.&quot;</p>
<p>The face below sighed and the gun came back up. &quot;So, there are alarms going off and I just can&#39;t hear them.&quot;</p>
<p>Huey took a deep breath, let it out. &quot;I&#39;m the only one who can hear them. The boss got tired of getting paged in the middle of the night.&quot;</p>
<p>The face said nothing, but at least the gun didn&#39;t fire.</p>
<p>&quot;You want to hear something you might not know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not sure I can handle any more surprises.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll tell you anyway: I can extract and decrypt that cache.&quot;</p>
<p>The gun lowered. &quot;Why are you telling me this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How many seats on your shuttle?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Two.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good. Fifty-fifty split.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eighty-twenty.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Seventy-thirty. Extraction now, decryption laterâ€”after you&#39;ve holstered that weapon and we&#39;re both far away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sold. Now what?&quot;</p>
<p>Huey rattled off some commands on the terminal. It chimed. &quot;Cache extracted. I&#39;ve also locked everyone in their cabins and shut off the comms. Let&#39;s get out of here.&quot;</p>
<p>The face laughed and hands reached up to push the floor panel aside. &quot;A little help?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; said Huey, reaching down to clasp a delicate hand and pull. Up came a lithe man with a dancer&#39;s body clad in a skin-tight vacsuit. The gun was stowed in a hip pouch. Huey whistled appreciatively.</p>
<p>&quot;That awful here, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would have sold these assholes out for a ride, let alone cash.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should have haggled more. You need to grab anything on the way out?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nah,&quot; said Huey, patting his belt pouches. &quot;Anything worth anything is already on me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds good,&quot; said the man, grinning. He gestured down the corridor. They started walking.</p>
