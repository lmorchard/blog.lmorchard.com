<p>&quot;You were right, we don&#39;t know each other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, that&#39;s not what I meant,&quot; he said. &quot;I just said we could stand to get to know each other better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="https://curve.bandcamp.com/track/perish-3">We&#39;re staying together for the sake of our memories</a>,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>He sighed. &quot;Yeah, we&#39;ve had a lot of good times together. We&#39;re still good. Together.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s a ghost in my house,&quot; she said. &quot;I realize it&#39;s you, but I see through you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are you even talking about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look,&quot; she said. &quot;You moved in with me here and it&#39;s like you faded away. You don&#39;t work on music anymore. You quit the band.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The new job has has been busy. You know that. And besides, it&#39;s not like you&#39;ve been writing much yourself, either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; she said. &quot;And that&#39;s my point, really. It&#39;s like we think our souls will perish if we&#39;re apart, but it feels like that&#39;s happening the longer we&#39;re together.&quot;</p>
<p>He scoffed. &quot;I guess you have been writing. That&#39;s so dramatic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This shouldn&#39;t be a misery contest,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m not trying to let you down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not trying to let you down either!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know. And yet, we&#39;re doing it anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So let&#39;s stop doing it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think we can.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m doing!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Neither do I. But, you know we&#39;re doing it, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I know.&quot; He put his head in his hands. &quot;What happened? We didn&#39;t fight, we didn&#39;t cheat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It just kind of ran out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can make it work again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How? What&#39;ll be different?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me either.&quot;</p>
<p>They were both silent for a few minutes. Each staring at a different wall. </p>
<p>He cleared his throat. &quot;Do you remember the last time it was actually good?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not really. A long time ago.&quot;</p>
<p>He nodded and stood. &quot;I should pack a bag.&quot;</p>
