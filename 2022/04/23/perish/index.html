<p>"You were right, we don't know each other."</p>
<p>"No, that's not what I meant," he said. "I just said we could stand to get to know each other better."</p>
<p>"<a href="https://curve.bandcamp.com/track/perish-3">We're staying together for the sake of our memories</a>," she said.</p>
<p>He sighed. "Yeah, we've had a lot of good times together. We're still good. Together."</p>
<p>"There's a ghost in my house," she said. "I realize it's you, but I see through you."</p>
<p>"What are you even talking about?"</p>
<p>"Look," she said. "You moved in with me here and it's like you faded away. You don't work on music anymore. You quit the band."</p>
<p>"The new job has has been busy. You know that. And besides, it's not like you've been writing much yourself, either."</p>
<p>"I know," she said. "And that's my point, really. It's like we think our souls will perish if we're apart, but it feels like that's happening the longer we're together."</p>
<p>He scoffed. "I guess you have been writing. That's so dramatic."</p>
<p>"This shouldn't be a misery contest," she said. "I'm not trying to let you down."</p>
<p>"I'm not trying to let you down either!"</p>
<p>"I know. And yet, we're doing it anyway."</p>
<p>"So let's stop doing it!"</p>
<p>"I don't think we can."</p>
<p>"I don't even know what I'm doing!"</p>
<p>"Neither do I. But, you know we're doing it, right?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know." He put his head in his hands. "What happened? We didn't fight, we didn't cheat."</p>
<p>"It just kind of ran out."</p>
<p>"We can make it work again."</p>
<p>"How? What'll be different?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"Me either."</p>
<p>They were both silent for a few minutes. Each staring at a different wall. </p>
<p>He cleared his throat. "Do you remember the last time it was actually good?"</p>
<p>"Not really. A long time ago."</p>
<p>He nodded and stood. "I should pack a bag."</p>
