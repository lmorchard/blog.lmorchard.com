<p>&quot;So,&quot; said the magician&#39;s assistant, &quot;do you ever do, like, <em>real</em> magic on stage?&quot;</p>
<p>The old magician sighed. &quot;Not really,&quot; they said. They picked up a pack of cigarettes from the dressing room counter and started whacking it against their palm.</p>
<p>&quot;How come?&quot;</p>
<p>The magician shook a cigarette from the pack and returned it to the counter. They flicked the nail of their index finger against the pad of their thumb and a small orange flame sprouted from their fingertip.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the magician, &quot;there&#39;s two kinds of magic.&quot; They paused to light the cigarette and take a drag. They shook out the flame and exhaled through pursed lips. The smoke swirled out into a tight tendril that spiraled directly into a ceiling vent.</p>
<p>&quot;Two kinds of magic,&quot; the assistant repeated. They pulled out a little notebook &amp; pen and jotted that down. </p>
<p>The magician chuckled. &quot;Yeah, so, the first kind is subtle: If you blink, you&#39;ll miss it.&quot; They absentmindedly tapped the cigarette off to the side and the ash fell away from the cherry to drift into the mouth of an open beer can on the counter.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; said the assistant, &quot;and what about the other kind?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The other kind,&quot; said the magician, &quot;is so over the top that folks can&#39;t accept it when it happens.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When most folks see magic happen - real, epic, legendary magic - it&#39;s traumatic. It so thoroughly disagrees with their expectations that they&#39;ll never remember what happened. That, or they&#39;ll swear up and down that something else happened instead.&quot;</p>
<p>The assistant nodded. &quot;I think I get it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lay it on me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So, what we do on stage - we want folks to notice it, not be too shocked by it, and remember that we&#39;re the ones who did it.&quot;</p>
<p>The magician nodded and smiled. &quot;Yup. And hopefully they like what they see, so we get paid. I guess you really have been paying attention.&quot; The assistant beamed.</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door. One of the stage crew slipped into the room.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re on in five.&quot; They furrowed their brow and crinkled their nose. &quot;And there&#39;s no smoking in here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who&#39;s smoking?&quot; The magician twiddled their fingers and the cigarette was never there. </p>
<p>The crew member rolled their eyes and retreated from the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, kid,&quot; said the magician, &quot;let&#39;s get out there and try not to knock &#39;em dead.&quot;</p>
