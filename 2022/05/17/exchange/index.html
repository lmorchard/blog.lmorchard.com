<p>The man broke eye contact with Korrine and snapped his gaze to Marek as that man&#39;s fingers brushed the handles of concealed knives.  </p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve been rude,&quot; he said. &quot;In all the excitement, none of us have introduced ourselves. My name is Anton. I&#39;m studying to be a physician. And you are?&quot; He smiled and extended an open hand up to Marek from where he crouched.</p>
<p>&quot;I am Marek,&quot; he said, relaxing just a degree. His hands came forward to grasp Anton&#39;s arm. He hoisted the younger man to his feet. &quot;She is my <em>daughter</em> Korrine.&quot; She flushed slightly at the tone in his voice. </p>
<p>&quot;And I am Danijel,&quot; said the booming voice of an older man to Marek&#39;s left. He&#39;d been grimly watching it all. &quot;Anton is my son. The boy is little Sebastijan, son of my other son Petar.&quot; A man to Danijel&#39;s left nodded. &quot;Jelena is my wife and Laura is Petar&#39;s wife. Laura is the boy&#39;s mother.&quot; He gestured to a pair of women, the older of the two comforting the younger weeping one.</p>
<p>Marek noticed Danijel&#39;s hands had eased from behind his back as he spoke, mirroring his own gesture. Both men smiled and nodded in understanding. A tension eased.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased to meet you all,&quot; said Marek, &quot;and to have been of aid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hate to ask more of you,&quot; said Anton, &quot;but the sooner we can get Sebastijan to a clean bed back at the house, the better I can ensure he heals well. You have an intact wagon—is there any way you could lend us a ride?&quot;</p>
<p>Marek stroked his beard. &quot;I&#39;d gladly offer,&quot; he said, gesturing to their wagon, &quot;but as you can see we&#39;re heavy with cargo bound for the market and we&#39;ve no room for passengers.&quot;</p>
<p>Korrine gave her father a sharp glance, but Danijel just laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;I see barrels,&quot; said Danijel. &quot;What do you carry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wheat and rye beer, best you&#39;ll ever taste.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll buy it all right now. And your wagon outright. Name a price.&quot;</p>
<p>Marek&#39;s brows shot up. &quot;And the wagon? I couldn&#39;t part with it all it for less than—&quot; He paused to gaze upward, muttering some calculation to himself. &quot;—at least 25 aureus.&quot; Korrine&#39;s glance turned to a stormy glare. </p>
<p>Danijel shook his head and sadly said, &quot;Not good enough, my friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I built that wagon with my own hands—&quot;</p>
<p>Danijel cut Marek off with a gesture. &quot;You misunderstand me: you&#39;ve asked for too little. I will pay no less than 100 aureus for all this.&quot;</p>
<p>Korrine gaped. Anton smiled. Marek blinked and held out a hand to Danijel. &quot;I&#39;d be a fool to argue. For that price, I&#39;ll build you a new wagon from scratch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t take you for a fool,&quot; said Danijel, grasping Marek&#39;s hand. &quot;Some help fixing our old wagon would be appreciated, though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One more thing,&quot; said Anton, sheepishly. &quot;I&#39;d very much appreciate it if Miss Korrine could accompany us to help keep Sebastijan stable on the trip.&quot;</p>
<p>Marek darkened. &quot;Absolutely not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Father!&quot; Korrine hissed.</p>
<p>&quot;Daughter,&quot; said Marek.</p>
<p>&quot;These are good people,&quot; she said, &quot;and this boy still needs help.&quot;</p>
<p>Marek drew a breath to speak, but Danijel interrupted: &quot;How about this—10 aureus in wages for Korrine&#39;s service to us today and 10 more to you, Marek, for your service while they&#39;re on their way. We will join them when we&#39;ve finished here. I&#39;ll feed you both and make sure you get back home safely afterward.&quot;</p>
<p>Marek sighed. &quot;That&#39;s more than fair and I don&#39;t think I could hold her back anyway.&quot; </p>
<p>He reached under his jacket and unbuckled one of his knives. Korrine&#39;s face displayed a measure of horror as he handed it to her. Somehow she hadn&#39;t realized it was there.</p>
<p>&quot;Take it,&quot; said Marek. &quot;While we are apart, use this if you find yourself not among good people.&quot; Korrine took the sheath and buckled it across her back.</p>
<p>&quot;Very good,&quot; said Danijel, with a clap. &quot;Men, let&#39;s get to work unloading my beer so we can get my grandson home before sunset.&quot;</p>
