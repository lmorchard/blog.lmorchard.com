          <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>:  I&#39;ve gotten through over a month of writing posted here. I thought it might be worth reflecting and recapping again.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>I&#39;ve been working on this writing habit for just over a month. It seems to be a thing, now. I&#39;m starting to think about what I want to do next. These exercises are like marathon training—and at some point, I want to try a proper marathon.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also occurred to me that doing fresh characters &amp; settings every day—even if they&#39;re just over 300 words—might be harder than building momentum with an established story. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking about sustainability. Over a decade ago, I did the 4am wake-up and butt-in-chair thing. That let me crank out a few thousand words before the day job on a regular basis. But, while I did finish a few books that way, I feel like I&#39;ve fully burnt out that mechanism. The notion of writing a book that way again just seems like a nonstarter. </p>
<p>This drumbeat of a small habit feels more reliable than expecting to browbeat myself into a writing flow by sheer willpower.</p>
<p>Apropos of that, I&#39;m finding it rewarding to review what I&#39;ve managed to write lately:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/02/kogas-cauldron/">Koga&#39;s Cauldron</a>&quot; - the lemurs are back, but this time they cross over with the demigod AI setting that I&#39;ve been toying with.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/03/averys-deployment/">Avery&#39;s Deployment</a>&quot; - another scene in the demigod AI setting, which I want to expand into at least a short story</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/04/yasirs-getaway/">Yasir&#39;s Getaway</a>&quot; - I was thinking, what if a space ship is just a nicer place to live and not necessarily a means of travel?</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/05/ivos-act/">Ivo&#39;s Act</a>&quot; - the prompt summoned up an on stage performance for me, so I ran with it</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/08/vincents-voyage/">Vincent&#39;s Voyage</a>&quot; - the prompt suggested a misguided hoarder of needed wisdom, not sure I got there though</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/09/familiar-strangers/">Familiar Strangers</a>&quot; - the prompt got me thinking about someone shying away from asking someone on a date, but pandemic times got to me.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/10/megachurch-of-the-shattered/">Megachurch of the Shattered</a>&quot; - this one was about a religion I dreamed about a few weeks ago, which I might build into a longer story</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/11/roxys-faceroll/">Roxy&#39;s Faceroll</a>&quot; - the prompt made me think about being productive despite burnout because they paycheck still needs to roll in</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/12/left-on-read/">Left on Read</a>&quot; - I want to work on writing more imperfect characters and their relationships, so this one kinda does that.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;<a href="http://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/13/unheeded/">Unheeded</a>&quot; - the prompt brought to mind a smug elder unwilling to hear new perspectives, which often leads to a disaster trope, so I went with it</p>
</li>
</ul>
