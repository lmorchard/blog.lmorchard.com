          <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: I&#39;ve gotten through twenty days of writing posted here. I thought it might be worth recapping the last few things I managed to post.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Last month, I started <a href="/2022/04/20/building-a-new-creative-writing-habit/">trying to build a daily creative writing habit</a>.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, I&#39;ve gotten through twenty days of writing here. After that, I decided to take a couple of days off. And rather than jumping right back into it, I figured I might write a little status report.</p>
<p>When I first started, I wanted to establish this as a <em>Thing I Do</em> - just a regular, everyday fixture. I figured that I really needed to make it happen <em>every single day</em> in order to lay down the grooves of the habit. But, I&#39;ve started feeling a little crispy around the edges trying to muster daily motivation without fail.</p>
<p>By now, I&#39;m very familiar with the signs of burning out <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast/">an enthusiasm</a>. So, some regular breaks sound good for the sake of sustainability. I&#39;m just going to have to trust myself - which is a hard thing - to start the habit back up next week. That said, the other regular writing habit I&#39;ve managed to establish - i.e. morning journal pages - only happens 5 days a week. Maybe I should take the hint from that?</p>
<p>With that reflection out of the way, I also thought it might be worth recapping the last few things I posted here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/24/malas-daring/">Mala&#39;s Daring</a>&quot;</p>
<p>I had a dream about these clever lemurs who are about as smart as humans, but haven&#39;t quite developed advanced technology yet. Here&#39;s a little sketch in that setting. üêí</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/25/jacobs-drive/">Jacob&#39;s Drive</a>&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about burnout lately, and <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/25/jacobs-drive/2022-04-25-prompt.png">the Tarot prompt</a> pointed me at thinking about wanting something better. I haven&#39;t had a job nearly as bad as Jacob&#39;s and I&#39;ve never really wanted to be a trucker, but that&#39;s the magic of fiction! üåà‚≠ê</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/26/cyrils-wisdom/">Cyril&#39;s Wisdom</a>&quot;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/26/cyrils-wisdom/2022-04-26-prompt.png">Tarot prompt</a> seemed to point me toward a self-help guru or a cult leader who got too high on their own supply. I settled on an author who might have actually written something worthwhile but couldn&#39;t handle the success. üç∏</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/27/garths-acquisition/">Garth&#39;s Acquisition</a>&quot;</p>
<p>A shoplifter seemed suggested by <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/27/garths-acquisition/2022-04-27-prompt.png">the Tarot prompt</a>, but I wanted to write about a character who wasn&#39;t entirely a villain but also not at all justified in the act. (It&#39;s not like he stole a loaf of bread.) üí∏</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;<a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/28/finleys-overtime/">Finley&#39;s Overtime</a>&quot;</p>
<p>This one is a continuation of the story between <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/tag/finleyandcharley/">a human / AI couple</a> that I&#39;ve had in mind for most of a year. I&#39;ve got a much longer story written around them, but I&#39;m starting to think I might tear most of that up and rewrite it in pieces like this. ü§ñ</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, that&#39;s enough for this recap. Let&#39;s see how next week goes!</p>
