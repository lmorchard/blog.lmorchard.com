<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t even know we were dating anymore,&quot; said Allyn. &quot;I just thought you ghosted me.&quot;</p>
<p>Michael sighed. &quot;I told you this was going to be a busy week at work.&quot;</p>
<p>Allyn sighed back, rather mockingly. &quot;You were so busy you couldn&#39;t even spare a moment to return a text? It&#39;s been eight days since I last heard from you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#39;t understand! It&#39;s been nothing but all-nighters and I&#39;ve barely even slept.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Allyn. &quot;You know what I understand? You don&#39;t have time for this right now. And neither do I.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Allyn, wait—&quot; Michael&#39;s phone beeped in his ear: the call disconnected. He looked at the screen for a few minutes, finger hovering over the redial button. </p>
<p>He&#39;d gotten Allyn&#39;s text—well, <em>texts</em> to be fair: six of them over a few days, a few days ago. The texts had come in during meetings and client calls. At the time, he&#39;d been a annoyed and put off responding. Then, he just kind of got busy and forgot altogether. </p>
<p>Granted, in local time, those meetings were as late as 8pm. But he&#39;d told Allyn all about the time zone differences, he thought he&#39;d understood. But, obviously not. Still, Michael could kind of see how Allyn might have felt a bit neglected. If the shoe were on the other foot, and all that.</p>
<p><em>No,</em> thought Michael, <em>you know what? He&#39;s right. I don&#39;t have time for his crap.</em> </p>
<p>He opened up a dating app and started swiping. </p>
