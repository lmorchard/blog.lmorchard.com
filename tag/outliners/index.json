It's another blog post—and this one\n<a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/html5-drag-and-drop/\">is cross-posted on hacks.mozilla.com</a>.\nI won't say this is the start of a renewed blogging habit, but let's see what happens.\n</i></p>\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\ndl { margin-left: 2em; }\ndd { margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.25em; }\n</style>\n<div id=\"introduction\">\n    <p>\n        Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions\n        afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it\n        allows users to pair the selection of an object with the\n        execution of an action, often including a second object in the\n        operation.  It's a simple yet powerful UI concept used to\n        support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),\n        and even the creation of link relationships.\n    </p><p>\n        Since it's so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web\n        applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first\n        offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although\n        <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, and\n        <code>mouseup</code> made it possible, the implementation has been\n        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,\n        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,\n        there's a challenge to find the subject of the drop when\n        the interaction is completed.\n    </p><p>\n\n<pre><code>    Of course, that doesn&#39;t prevent most modern JavaScript\n    frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and\n    throwing in some flourishes while they&#39;re at it.  But, wouldn&#39;t\n    it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and\n    drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd&quot;&gt;section on new drag-and-drop events&lt;/a&gt;, and \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop&quot;&gt;Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation&lt;/a&gt; of those events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    If you want to jump straight to the code, I&#39;ve put together \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html&quot;&gt;some simple demos&lt;/a&gt; \n    of the new events.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n    I&#39;ve even scratched an itch of my own and\n    built &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html&quot;&gt;the beginnings of an outline editor&lt;/a&gt;,\n    where every draggable element is also a drop target—of which\n    there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something\n    that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past\n    while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from \n    &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop&quot;&gt;a GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;\n    I&#39;ve created especially for this article—which continues after the jump.\n&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<div id=\"events\">\n\n<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;The New Drag and Drop Events&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    So, with no further ado, here are the new drag and drop events,\n    in roughly the order you might expect to see them fired:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;dl&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        A drag has been initiated, with the dragged element as the\n        event target.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;drag&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        The mouse has moved, with the dragged element as the event target.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;dragenter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        The dragged element has been moved into a drop listener,\n        with the drop listener element as the event target.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;dragover&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        The dragged element has been moved over a drop listener,\n        with the drop listener element as the event target.  Since\n        the default behavior is to cancel drops, returning\n        &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; or calling &lt;code&gt;preventDefault()&lt;/code&gt; in\n        the event handler indicates that a drop is allowed here.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;dragleave&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        The dragged element has been moved out of a drop listener,\n        with the drop listener element as the event target.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        The dragged element has been successfully dropped on a drop\n        listener, with the drop listener element as the event\n        target.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;dragend&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        A drag has been ended, successfully or not, with the\n        dragged element as the event target.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;/dl&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n    Like the mouse events of yore, listeners can be attached to\n    elements using &lt;code&gt;addEventListener()&lt;/code&gt; \n    directly or by way of your favorite JS library.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    Consider the following example using jQuery, \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#newschool&quot;&gt;also available as a live demo&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot; line=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<div id=\"newschool\">\n    <div class=\"dragme\">Drag me!</div>\n    <div class=\"drophere\">Drop here!</div>\n</div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    $(document).ready(function() {\n        $('#newschool .dragme')\n            .attr('draggable', 'true')\n            .bind('dragstart', function(ev) {\n                var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;\n                dt.setData(\"Text\", \"Dropped in zone!\");\n                return true;\n            })\n            .bind('dragend', function(ev) {\n                return false;\n            });\n        $('#newschool .drophere')\n            .bind('dragenter', function(ev) {\n                $(ev.target).addClass('dragover');\n                return false;\n            })\n            .bind('dragleave', function(ev) {\n                $(ev.target).removeClass('dragover');\n                return false;\n            })\n            .bind('dragover', function(ev) {\n                return false;\n            })\n            .bind('drop', function(ev) {\n                var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;\n                alert(dt.getData('Text'));\n                return false;\n            });\n    });\n</script>\n<pre><code>&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    Thanks to the new events and jQuery, this example is both short\n    and simple—but it packs in a lot of functionality, as the rest\n    of this article will explain.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    Before moving on, there are at least three things about the above\n    code that are worth mentioning:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n            Drop targets are enabled by virtue of having\n            listeners for drop events.  But, \n            &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#drag-and-drop-processing-model&quot;&gt;per the HTML 5 spec&lt;/a&gt;,\n            draggable elements need an\n            attribute of &lt;code&gt;draggable=&quot;true&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, set either in\n            markup or in JavaScript.  \n        &lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n            Thus, &lt;code&gt;$(&#39;#newschool&amp;nbsp;.dragme&#39;).attr(&#39;draggable&#39;, &#39;true&#39;)&lt;/code&gt;.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n            The original DOM event (as opposed to jQuery&#39;s event\n            wrapper) offers a property called &lt;code&gt;dataTransfer&lt;/code&gt;.\n            Beyond just manipulating elements, the new drag and drop\n            events accomodate the transmission of user-definable data\n            during the course of the interaction.  \n        &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n\n            Since these are first-class events, you can apply \n            &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://icant.co.uk/sandbox/eventdelegation/&quot;&gt;the technique of Event Delegation&lt;/a&gt;.\n        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n            What&#39;s that?  Well, imagine you have a list of 1000\n            list items—as part of a deeply-nested outline document,\n            for instance.  Rather than needing to attach listeners\n            or otherwise fiddle with all 1000 items, simply attach\n            a listener to the parent node (eg. the\n            &lt;code&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element) and all events from\n            the children will propagate up to the single parent listener.\n            As a bonus, all new child elements added after page\n            load will enjoy the same benefits.\n        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n            &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#delegated&quot;&gt;Check out this demo&lt;/a&gt;, \n            and \n            &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-delegated.js&quot;&gt;the associated JS code&lt;/a&gt; \n            to see more about these events and Event Delegation.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"datatransfer\">\n    <h2>Using dataTransfer</h2>\n    <p>\n        As mentioned in the last section, the new drag and drop events\n        let you send data along with a dragged element.  But, it's even\n        better than that:  Your drop targets can receive data\n        transferred by content objects dragged into the window from \n        other browser windows, and even <i>other applications</i>.\n    </p><p>\n\n<pre><code>    Since the example is a bit longer,  \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#data_transfer&quot;&gt;check out the live demo&lt;/a&gt;\n    and \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-datatransfer.js&quot;&gt;associated code&lt;/a&gt;\n    to get an idea of what&#39;s possible with &lt;code&gt;dataTransfer&lt;/code&gt;.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    In a nutshell, the stars of this show are the\n    &lt;code&gt;setData()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getData()&lt;/code&gt; methods of\n    the &lt;code&gt;dataTransfer&lt;/code&gt; property exposed by the Event object.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n    The &lt;code&gt;setData()&lt;/code&gt; method is typically called in the \n    &lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt; listener, loading &lt;code&gt;dataTransfer&lt;/code&gt;\n    up with one or more strings of content with associated\n    &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Recommended_Drag_Types#link&quot;&gt;recommended content types&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n    For illustration, here&#39;s a quick snippet from the example code:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot; line=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;<br>dt.setData(&#39;text/plain&#39;, $(&#39;#logo&#39;).parent().text());\ndt.setData(&#39;text/html&#39;, $(&#39;#logo&#39;).parent().html());\ndt.setData(&#39;text/uri-list&#39;, $(&#39;#logo&#39;)[0].src);\n    </pre>\n    </p><p>\n        On the other end, <code>getData()</code> allows you to query\n        for content by type (eg. <code>text/html</code> followed by\n        <code>text/plain</code>).  This, in turn, allows you to decide\n        on acceptable content types at the time of the\n        <code>drop</code> event or even during <code>dragover</code></p>\n<pre><code>    to offer feedback for unacceptable types during the drag.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    Here&#39;s another example from the receiving end of the example code:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot; line=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;<br>$(&#39;.content_url .content&#39;).text(dt.getData(&#39;text/uri-list&#39;));\n$(&#39;.content_text .content&#39;).text(dt.getData(&#39;text/plain&#39;));\n$(&#39;.content_html .content&#39;).html(dt.getData(&#39;text/html&#39;));\n    </pre>\n    <p>\n        Where <code>dataTransfer</code> really shines, though, is that\n        it allows your drop targets to receive content from \n        sources outside your defined draggable elements and even from\n        outside the browser altogether.  Firefox accepts such drags, \n        and attempts to populate <code>dataTransfer</code> with\n        appropriate content types extracted from the external object.\n    </p><p></p>\n<pre><code>    Thus, you could select some text in a word processor window and\n    drop it into one of your elements, and at least expect to find\n    it available as &lt;code&gt;text/plain&lt;/code&gt; content.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    You can also select content in \n    another browser window, and expect to see &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt;\n    appear in your events.

By default in\n       Firefox, this is a \"ghost\" image of the dragged element itself.  But,\n       the <code>dataTransfer</code> property of the original Event\n       object exposes the method <code>setDragImage()</code> for use\n       in customizing this representation.\n    </p><p>\n\n<pre><code>    There&#39;s\n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#feedback_image&quot;&gt;a live demo&lt;/a&gt; of this feature, as well as\n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-feedback-images.js&quot;&gt;associated JS code&lt;/a&gt; \n    available.

For dragging from external applications (such as the Desktop) is a normal webpage able to get the data from the drop?

However, the documentation seems to state that on drop that data should be made available to the page.  Likewise, in the same way an image can be dragged off the page onto the desktop, can an arbitrary element be dragged onto the desktop with whatever file content to be saved?

I don't work on the browser itself, but I noticed that unexpected behavior on drag &amp; drop.  The window really should scroll when you get toward the top or bottom while dragging - and, in fact, most pre-HTML5 JS frameworks do that in their own drag &amp; drop abstractions.  </p>\n<p>Until / unless Firefox gets this fixed, the same sort of auto-scrolling could be hacked in to HTML5 drag and drop.  Not perfect, but it's doable.  That is, in the drag event, you can check if the mouse is near the upper or lower edge of the viewport - and if so, start scrolling appropriately. That's pretty much how the JS frameworks do it with old-school D&D</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090975\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.copperbot.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=df48b2c2a3a2be51b1e15f10c5fb05da&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.copperbot.net\">CopperBot</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090975\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-07-23T21:41:07\">2009-07-23T21:41:07</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Very cool article!

It's another blog post—and this one\r\n<a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/html5-drag-and-drop/\">is cross-posted on hacks.mozilla.com</a>.\r\nI won't say this is the start of a renewed blogging habit, but let's see what happens.\r\n</i></p>\r\n\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\ndl { margin-left: 2em; }\r\ndd { margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.25em; }\r\n</style>\r\n<div id=\"introduction\">\r\n    <p>\r\n        Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions\r\n        afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it\r\n        allows users to pair the selection of an object with the\r\n        execution of an action, often including a second object in the\r\n        operation.  It's a simple yet powerful UI concept used to\r\n        support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),\r\n        and even the creation of link relationships.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        Since it's so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web\r\n        applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first\r\n        offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although\r\n        <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, and\r\n        <code>mouseup</code> made it possible, the implementation has been\r\n        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,\r\n        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,\r\n        there's a challenge to find the subject of the drop when\r\n        the interaction is completed.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        Of course, that doesn't prevent most modern JavaScript\r\n        frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and\r\n        throwing in some flourishes while they're at it.  But, wouldn't\r\n        it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and\r\n        drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd\">section on new drag-and-drop events</a>, and \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop\">Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation</a> of those events.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        If you want to jump straight to the code, I've put together \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html\">some simple demos</a> \r\n        of the new events.  \r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        I've even scratched an itch of my own and\r\n        built <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html\">the beginnings of an outline editor</a>,\r\n        where every draggable element is also a drop target—of which\r\n        there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something\r\n        that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past\r\n        while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from \r\n        <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop\">a GitHub repository</a>\r\n        I've created especially for this article—which continues after the jump.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"events\">\r\n\r\n    <h2>The New Drag and Drop Events</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        So, with no further ado, here are the new drag and drop events,\r\n        in roughly the order you might expect to see them fired:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <dl>\r\n        <dt><code>dragstart</code></dt>\r\n        <dd>\r\n            A drag has been initiated, with the dragged element as the\r\n            event target.\r\n        </dd>\r\n\r\n        <dt><code>drag</code></dt>\r\n        <dd>\r\n            The mouse has moved, with the dragged element as the event target.\r\n        </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>dragenter</code></dt>\r\n        <dd>\r\n            The dragged element has been moved into a drop listener,\r\n            with the drop listener element as the event target.\r\n        </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>dragover</code></dt>\r\n\r\n        <dd>\r\n            The dragged element has been moved over a drop listener,\r\n            with the drop listener element as the event target.

But, \r\n                <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#drag-and-drop-processing-model\">per the HTML 5 spec</a>,\r\n                draggable elements need an\r\n                attribute of <code>draggable=\"true\"</code>, set either in\r\n                markup or in JavaScript.  \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Thus, <code>$('#newschool&nbsp;.dragme').attr('draggable', 'true')</code>.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The original DOM event (as opposed to jQuery's event\r\n                wrapper) offers a property called <code>dataTransfer</code>.\r\n                Beyond just manipulating elements, the new drag and drop\r\n                events accomodate the transmission of user-definable data\r\n                during the course of the interaction.  \r\n            </p>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <p>\r\n\r\n                Since these are first-class events, you can apply \r\n                <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://icant.co.uk/sandbox/eventdelegation/\">the technique of Event Delegation</a>.\r\n            </p><p>\r\n                What's that?

But, it's even\r\n        better than that:  Your drop targets can receive data\r\n        transferred by content objects dragged into the window from \r\n        other browser windows, and even <i>other applications</i>.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        Since the example is a bit longer,  \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#data_transfer\">check out the live demo</a>\r\n        and \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-datatransfer.js\">associated code</a>\r\n        to get an idea of what's possible with <code>dataTransfer</code>.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        In a nutshell, the stars of this show are the\r\n        <code>setData()</code> and <code>getData()</code> methods of\r\n        the <code>dataTransfer</code> property exposed by the Event object.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        The <code>setData()</code> method is typically called in the \r\n        <code>dragstart</code> listener, loading <code>dataTransfer</code>\r\n        up with one or more strings of content with associated\r\n        <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Recommended_Drag_Types#link\">recommended content types</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        For illustration, here's a quick snippet from the example code:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    \r\ndt.setData('text/plain', $('#logo').parent().text());\r\ndt.setData('text/html', $('#logo').parent().html());\r\ndt.setData('text/uri-list', $('#logo')[0].src);\r\n    </pre>\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        On the other end, <code>getData()</code> allows you to query\r\n        for content by type (eg. <code>text/html</code> followed by\r\n        <code>text/plain</code>).  This, in turn, allows you to decide\r\n        on acceptable content types at the time of the\r\n        <code>drop</code> event or even during <code>dragover</code>\r\n\r\n        to offer feedback for unacceptable types during the drag.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        Here's another example from the receiving end of the example code:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    \r\n$('.content_url .content').text(dt.getData('text/uri-list'));\r\n$('.content_text .content').text(dt.getData('text/plain'));\r\n$('.content_html .content').html(dt.getData('text/html'));\r\n    </pre>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Where <code>dataTransfer</code> really shines, though, is that\r\n        it allows your drop targets to receive content from \r\n        sources outside your defined draggable elements and even from\r\n        outside the browser altogether.  Firefox accepts such drags, \r\n        and attempts to populate <code>dataTransfer</code> with\r\n        appropriate content types extracted from the external object.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        Thus, you could select some text in a word processor window and\r\n        drop it into one of your elements, and at least expect to find\r\n        it available as <code>text/plain</code> content.  \r\n    </p><p>\r\n        You can also select content in \r\n        another browser window, and expect to see <code>text/html</code>\r\n        appear in your events.

By default in\r\n       Firefox, this is a \"ghost\" image of the dragged element itself.  But,\r\n       the <code>dataTransfer</code> property of the original Event\r\n       object exposes the method <code>setDragImage()</code> for use\r\n       in customizing this representation.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        There's\r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#feedback_image\">a live demo</a> of this feature, as well as\r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-feedback-images.js\">associated JS code</a> \r\n        available.  The gist, however, is sketched out in these code snippets:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    \r\n\r\ndt.setDragImage( $('#feedback_image h2')[0], 0, 0);\r\n\r\ndt.setDragImage( $('#logo')[0], 32, 32); \r\n\r\nvar canvas = document.createElement(\"canvas\");\r\ncanvas.width = canvas.height = 50;\r\n\r\nvar ctx = canvas.getContext(\"2d\");\r\nctx.lineWidth = 8;\r\nctx.moveTo(25,0);\r\nctx.lineTo(50, 50);\r\nctx.lineTo(0, 50);\r\nctx.lineTo(25, 0);\r\nctx.stroke();\r\n\r\ndt.setDragImage(canvas, 25, 25);\r\n    </pre>\r\n    <p>\r\n        You can supply a DOM node as the first parameter to \r\n        <code>setDragImage()</code>, which includes everything from\r\n        text to images to <code>canvas</code> elements.  The\r\n        second two parameters indicate at what left and top offset\r\n        the mouse should appear in the image while dragging.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        For example, since the <code>#logo</code> image is 64x64,\r\n        the parameters in the second <code>setDragImage()</code>\r\n        method places the mouse right in the center of the image.\r\n        On the other hand, the first call positions the feedback\r\n        image such that the mouse rests in the upper left corner.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"dragfeedback\">\r\n\r\n    <h2>Using Drop Effects</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        As mentioned at the start of this article, the drag and drop\r\n        interaction has been used to support actions such as copying,\r\n        moving, and linking.  Accordingly, the HTML 5 specification \r\n        accomodates these operations in the form of the \r\n        <code>effectAllowed</code> and <code>dropEffect</code>\r\n        properties exposed by the Event object.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n        For a quick fix, check out the\r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#drag_effects\">a live demo</a> \r\n        of this feature, as well as the\r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-effects.js\">associated JS code</a>.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        The basic idea is that the <code>dragstart</code> event\r\n        listener can set a value for <code>effectAllowed</code> like so:\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;\r\nswitch (ev.target.id) {\r\n    case 'effectdrag0': dt.effectAllowed = 'copy'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrag1': dt.effectAllowed = 'move'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrag2': dt.effectAllowed = 'link'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrag3': dt.effectAllowed = 'all'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrag4': dt.effectAllowed = 'none'; break;\r\n}\r\n    </pre>\r\n    <p>The choices available for this property include the following:</p>\r\n    <dl> \r\n        <dt><code>none</code></dt><dd>no operation is permitted </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>copy</code></dt><dd>copy only </dd>\r\n\r\n        <dt><code>move</code></dt><dd>move only </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>link</code></dt><dd>link only </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>copyMove</code></dt><dd>copy or move only </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>copyLink</code></dt><dd>copy or link only </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>linkMove</code></dt><dd>link or move only </dd>\r\n\r\n        <dt><code>all</code></dt><dd>copy, move, or link </dd>\r\n    </dl>\r\n    <p>\r\n        On the other end, the <code>dragover</code> event listener \r\n        can set the value of the\r\n        <code>dropEffect</code> property to indicate the expected effect\r\n        invoked on a successful drop.  If the value does\r\n        not match up with <code>effectAllowed</code>, the drop will\r\n        be considered cancelled on completion.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        In the \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#drag_effects\">a live demo</a>,\r\n        you should be able to see that only elements with matching\r\n        effects can be dropped into the appropriate drop zones.  This\r\n        is accomplished with code like the following:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;\r\nswitch (ev.target.id) {\r\n    case 'effectdrop0': dt.dropEffect = 'copy'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop1': dt.dropEffect = 'move'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop2': dt.dropEffect = 'link'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop3': dt.dropEffect = 'all'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop4': dt.dropEffect = 'none'; break;\r\n}\r\n    </pre>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Although the OS itself can provide some feedback, you \r\n        can also use these properties to update your own visible \r\n        feedback, both on the dragged element and on the drop zone\r\n        itself.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"conclusion\">\r\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        The new first-class drag and drop events in HTML5 and Firefox\r\n        make supporting this form of UI interaction simple, concise,\r\n        and powerful in the browser.

For dragging from external applications (such as the Desktop) is a normal webpage able to get the data from the drop?

However, the documentation seems to state that on drop that data should be made available to the page.  Likewise, in the same way an image can be dragged off the page onto the desktop, can an arbitrary element be dragged onto the desktop with whatever file content to be saved?

I don't work on the browser itself, but I noticed that unexpected behavior on drag &amp; drop.  The window really should scroll when you get toward the top or bottom while dragging - and, in fact, most pre-HTML5 JS frameworks do that in their own drag &amp; drop abstractions.  </p>\n\n<p>Until / unless Firefox gets this fixed, the same sort of auto-scrolling could be hacked in to HTML5 drag and drop.  Not perfect, but it's doable.  That is, in the drag event, you can check if the mouse is near the upper or lower edge of the viewport - and if so, start scrolling appropriately. That's pretty much how the JS frameworks do it with old-school D&D</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090975\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.copperbot.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=df48b2c2a3a2be51b1e15f10c5fb05da&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.copperbot.net\">CopperBot</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090975\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-07-23T21:41:07\">2009-07-23T21:41:07</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Very cool article!

It&apos;s another blog post&#x2014;and this one\n<a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/html5-drag-and-drop/\">is cross-posted on hacks.mozilla.com</a>.\nI won&apos;t say this is the start of a renewed blogging habit, but let&apos;s see what happens.\n</i></p>\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\ndl { margin-left: 2em; }\ndd { margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.25em; }\n</style>\n<div id=\"introduction\">\n    <p>\n        Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions\n        afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it\n        allows users to pair the selection of an object with the\n        execution of an action, often including a second object in the\n        operation.  It&apos;s a simple yet powerful UI concept used to\n        support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),\n        and even the creation of link relationships.\n    </p><p>\n        Since it&apos;s so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web\n        applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first\n        offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although\n        <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, and\n        <code>mouseup</code> made it possible, the implementation has been\n        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,\n        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,\n        there&apos;s a challenge to find the subject of the drop when\n        the interaction is completed.\n    </p><p>\n\n</p><pre><code>    Of course, that doesn&apos;t prevent most modern JavaScript\n    frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and\n    throwing in some flourishes while they&apos;re at it.  But, wouldn&apos;t\n    it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and\n    drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd&quot;&gt;section on new drag-and-drop events&lt;/a&gt;, and \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop&quot;&gt;Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation&lt;/a&gt; of those events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    If you want to jump straight to the code, I&apos;ve put together \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html&quot;&gt;some simple demos&lt;/a&gt; \n    of the new events.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n    I&apos;ve even scratched an itch of my own and\n    built &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html&quot;&gt;the beginnings of an outline editor&lt;/a&gt;,\n    where every draggable element is also a drop target&#x2014;of which\n    there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something\n    that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past\n    while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from \n    &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop&quot;&gt;a GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;\n    I&apos;ve created especially for this article&#x2014;which continues after the jump.\n&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n"

I can't wait to try to hook it up to HyperScope and play with it some more. It's the best open source DHTMLly outliner out there.</p>\n<p>Two things that might help you; for local storage, I just checked in a new storage provider for Dojo Storage that will use the native storage abilities in Firefox 2 if they are available, in an automagic way; if they aren't there, then it will revert to hidden Flash like it's worked in the past. This might be useful for you; don't know what you were thinking about for local storage. There's a page up with better docs on Dojo Storage now at http://manual.dojotoolkit.org/WikiHome/DojoDotBook/Book50</p>\n<p>The second thing is I just finished an HTML to OPML outline transformer; right now it adds in the line for the HyperScope XSLT stylesheet, but it can be used by any OPML hackers who want to play with bringing HTML into the OPML world, including for things like experimenting with the kind of OPath, deep linking, and inclusion work you've hinted about in other blog entries. A blog post on it is here: http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2006/11/html-transformer-for-hyperscope-apply.html . Might be fun for you to use in your hacking.</p>\n<p>We still need to grab drinks some time! How is your leg healing up? Hope you had a great thanksgiving.</p>\n<p>Best,\nBrad</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

I can't wait to try to hook it up to HyperScope and play with it some more. It's the best open source DHTMLly outliner out there.</p>\n\n<p>Two things that might help you; for local storage, I just checked in a new storage provider for Dojo Storage that will use the native storage abilities in Firefox 2 if they are available, in an automagic way; if they aren't there, then it will revert to hidden Flash like it's worked in the past. This might be useful for you; don't know what you were thinking about for local storage. There's a page up with better docs on Dojo Storage now at http://manual.dojotoolkit.org/WikiHome/DojoDotBook/Book50</p>\n\n<p>The second thing is I just finished an HTML to OPML outline transformer; right now it adds in the line for the HyperScope XSLT stylesheet, but it can be used by any OPML hackers who want to play with bringing HTML into the OPML world, including for things like experimenting with the kind of OPath, deep linking, and inclusion work you've hinted about in other blog entries. A blog post on it is here: http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2006/11/html-transformer-for-hyperscope-apply.html . Might be fun for you to use in your hacking.</p>\n\n<p>We still need to grab drinks some time! How is your leg healing up? Hope you had a great thanksgiving.</p>\n\n<p>Best,\n  Brad</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

You want your mouse to hit the droppable areas.</p>\n<p>Once a droppable is moused over by dragging a drag to it, it creates a transparent element in the exact same position as the Droppable.  It also lowers the droppable z-Index.  This gives the appearance that the draggable is over the droppable.</p>\n<p>To simulate movement, the transparent droppable's mouseovers are sent to the draggable.</p>\n<p>On mousing out of the transparent Droppable, it sets everything back to normal.</p>\n<p>I haven't tried this yet.  The biggest issue I see is that when you grab a draggable in the middle, half of it will be behind the droppable until the mouseover happens.

But, to anyone who understands what I just spewed:  Any ideas?\r\n\r\n[yui]: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/\r\n[xoxooutliner]: http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\r\n[ed]: http://icant.co.uk/sandbox/eventdelegation/\r\n[edy]: http://yuiblog.com/sandbox/yui/v0114/examples/event/delegation.php\r\n[yuidd]: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dragdrop/\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083066\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2d870e8df3af0d62fa636b336b17cd60&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Nick</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083066\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-01T00:19:27\">2006-11-01T00:19:27</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>You know, Marty and I were talking tonight about how some of your posts make NO sense to us.

If you haven't seen JavaScriptMVC, check out its trunk.  In the controller2 plugin, you'll find a really nice event delegation library.</p>\n\n<p>I've only thought of 1 way to do event delegation drops.  It's crazy, but it might work.</p>\n\n<p>First, style Drags so their z-Index is LOWER than the Drops.  You want your mouse to hit the droppable areas.</p>\n\n<p>Once a droppable is moused over by dragging a drag to it, it creates a transparent element in the exact same position as the Droppable.  It also lowers the droppable z-Index.  This gives the appearance that the draggable is over the droppable.</p>\n\n<p>To simulate movement, the transparent droppable's mouseovers are sent to the draggable.</p>\n\n<p>On mousing out of the transparent Droppable, it sets everything back to normal.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't tried this yet.  The biggest issue I see is that when you grab a draggable in the middle, half of it will be behind the droppable until the mouseover happens.  This isn't ideal, but maybe there is something that can be done about that.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083088\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8f18d2579d5c8f2fb2a79c09a9234e6e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Batiste</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083088\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-20T10:06:54\">2009-01-20T10:06:54</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>A jQuery solution for Drag and Drop with event delegation :</p>\n\n<p>http://batiste.dosimple.ch/blog/posts/2008-05-18-1/jquery-drag-and-drop-and-resize-event-delegation.html</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

Does anyone really want to return to a command-line interface to manipulate documents? It’s designing for a past that never happened, one where we all became computer scientists and enjoyed manipulating documents via arcane commands.<br />...<br />A better, more productive, use of time would have been to say, what inspiration can still be gained from Engelbart’s ideas? There’s still a lot to be gleaned from his 1962 (!) paper [Augmenting Human Intellect](http://www.bootstrap.org/augdocs/friedewald030402/augmentinghumanintellect/ahi62index.html). How might some of his thoughts on collaborative intelligence be implemented in our world now, in 2006, within the technology we have now? That’s the question waiting to be solved.</blockquote><div class=\"quotesource\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.adaptivepath.com/blog/2006/09/05/the-futility-of-designing-for-an-alternate-past/\">adaptive path » blog » blog archive » The Futility of Designing for an Alternate Past</a></div>\n\n<p>Allow me to engage in some Devil&#39;s Advocacy here - although I really am an Engelbart sympathizer:  </p>\n<p>Consider a program like Microsoft Word, with all its ribbons and toolbars and menus and animated assistance.  When you first started working with it, you probably spent time navigating these visual and guided parts of the user interface to get your job done.  But, after awhile, you probably discovered keyboard shortcuts and accellerators - CTRL-s to save, for instance.  These have likely been invaluable in speeding up your work and helping the application get out of your way.  So, having reached this point, do you ever really have a use for the &quot;user friendly&quot; bits anymore?  Or, have you graduated to &quot;manipulating documents via arcane commands&quot;?</p>\n<p>What if this application had never sugar-coated things and had instead optimized for efficiency and ergonomics in daily expert operation, trading an &quot;intuitive interface&quot; for an offer to incrementally train on its necessarily complex functionality?  After awhile, you&#39;ll have it all down, and be ready to shed the training wheels.</p>\n<p>What if - instead of a maze of menus and toolbar icons - your mouse just had dozens of easily-accessible buttons?  You&#39;re used to only having a left and a right click from which to choose.  If you&#39;ve splurged, you might have the more expansive choices offered by a fancier pointing device.  But, what if you had a chording keyboard under your off-mouse hand, offering an order of magnitude more mouse pointer actions?  </p>\n<p>For example, how about a &quot;delete word&quot; mouse button?  Or a &quot;copy sentence&quot; button?  Or maybe even a &quot;jump to the selected link with a custom view filter&quot; button?  The important part is that these commands act <strong>immediately</strong>, <em>just like a mouse button</em>, upon whatever&#39;s under the pointer.  There&#39;s no left-click then CTRL-x to Cut - no, you just point at a word, and say &quot;cut that&quot;.  There&#39;s a lot of power and efficiency here.</p>\n<p>These &quot;what if&quot; scenarios are not just wishful thinking, though.  They&#39;re what Doug Engelbart and crew implemented.  These are things I picked up after being invited to try a hands-on self-guided tour of <a href=\"http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2006/03/new-screencast-of-douglas-engelbarts.html\">Augment</a>.  I only wish I&#39;d had a chording keyboard to get the full experience.  The interface was like a mouse-heavy <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/\">VIM</a>, with verb-object command patterns and structured document interactions.  (Or, rather, <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/\">VIM</a> is like a mouse- and outline-deficient derivation of Augment.)  </p>\n<p>The basic core of this facet of <a href=\"http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2006/03/new-screencast-of-douglas-engelbarts.html\">Augment</a> is this:  Computers are powerful tools with great potential to augment human intellect.  As such, they offer a lot of complex functionality.  But, human beings are trainable, and can assimilate this functionality.  Once assimilated, it&#39;s best to squeeze out all the performance you can.  You don&#39;t see today&#39;s degree of computer &quot;user friendliness&quot; in chainsaws, tanks, jack-hammers, semi-trucks, or fighter jets.  These things are necessarily complex and require training.  Why should the most powerful of intelligence enhancement tools offered by computers be any different?  Of course, you generally won&#39;t lose a limb to a computer, but you might be mentally impaired or lose valuable work in the process.</p>\n<p>This is, I think, one of the still-relevant central facets of Doug Engelbart&#39;s ideas that could use some re-examination today.  It could just be because I&#39;m an übernerd who thinks it&#39;s fun to self-train on things like <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/\">VIM</a> and <a href=\"http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2006/03/new-screencast-of-douglas-engelbarts.html\">Augment</a>, but I also think that there&#39;s a lot of potential to be unlocked once you clear away expectations of &quot;intuitive interfaces&quot; that are <a href=\"http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/2002/08/nipple.html\">decidedly not nipples</a>.  </p>\n<p>And, since I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/06/world-of-warcraft-is-my-world-of-warcraft\">admitted my recently acquired semi-addiction</a>, consider World of Warcraft as an expert application.  Advanced players could never succeed by navigating a complex yet &quot;friendly&quot; UI to invoke various spells and skills and in-game actions.  Just take a look at some of the customizations and UI revisions being offered at <a href=\"http://ui.worldofwar.net/\">this site</a>.  Some configurations of this game smack me as eerily similar to the principles of Augment.  In fact, just this weekend, I was considering blowing the dust off <a href=\"http://www.avault.com/hardware/getreview.asp?review=msstratcom\">this keyset controller</a> I used to use with Everquest, years ago.</p>\n<p>Then again, maybe it&#39;s a matter of intensity.  Coordinating with a 40-player guild to slay something from the molten bowels of the earth is a slightly different activity than composing a memo or even a few-dozen-page report.

Sonic boom. The key in that situation was that I had a large number of unique tasks and a small very number of tasks carrying a huge workload (MILSPEC change management). So it was ideal for hot-keyed macros: like shooting fish in a barrel.</p>\n<p>For one thing, unless I'm reading passively or doing some flavour of CAD my hands are nowhere near the mouse. Or, to invert that, when I'm keyboarding I have to routinely suppress my resentment with reach, swivel, click, drag, select, click, select ... interminable menus and options bla-bla-blah, and nowhere muscle memory comes into play. But even with that aside, to have to right click and then select Delete from a menu /after/ having dragged to select a block ... I can outshoot that action stream using keystrokes anyday, if the app allowed me to.</p>\n<p>I don't disagree with the fundamental insight ... far from it. But we've just barely begun to implement the foundational cognitive ergonomics. (I was gratified to see in one thread that Brad explicated his having moved Help to the upper right ... cuz that's where it is most often. When it works it works cuz it works. Tradition is sometimes/often arbitrary; life's like that and we should sometimes just suck it up.)</p>\n<p>Harold's point about expert users is, I think, key. It's merely foolish to impose a system that makes good use of habituation onto a newly arrived visitor. I'm quite sure that attentive study shows a clustering or quantum of user intention and expertise ... until and unless we contrive some seamless continuum (a terrible distraction inspired by naive perfectionism) we should focus on differentiating expters from n00bs (no diss) and serve both well. \"Intermediate level\" sounds quite appropriate ... so long as this isn't just a maelstrum of fish/foul goat/sheep confounds.</p>\n<p>Alternatively we can always fall back on the old TRW concept of making people think more like machines. There might be funding for that.\n;-P</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085208\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://mozdawg.blogspot.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2c2c2c8f9e42a145f54f257111c6e84d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://mozdawg.blogspot.com\">Ben Tremblay</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085208\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-12T20:39:47\">2006-09-12T20:39:47</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Muscle memory just jumped up and reminded me of this: in a situation where I was doing Print Preview a gazillion times a day Shift-F7 6 was as effortless as breathing. <em>snap</em></p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085209\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e377f3e2140297d32460ae9a4b38ff98&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085209\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-10-18T06:00:17\">2006-10-18T06:00:17</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I can speak as a former Emacs user and coder that the only reason I gave it up for vi was that it hurt my hands too much to make all of those funky keyboard chords, and it started to hurt my head to remember all of the time-saving things I had built.</p>\n<p>Classically there's a tradeoff between the ease of typing something and the amount of think time you have to put into remembering what to type.</p>\n<p>One thing I am annoyed by on too many blogs is the inability to tab from the comment field to the \"submit\" button, which forces a mouse event and a scroll event.</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

It’s designing for a past that never happened, one where we all became computer scientists and enjoyed manipulating documents via arcane commands.<br />...<br />A better, more productive, use of time would have been to say, what inspiration can still be gained from Engelbart’s ideas? There’s still a lot to be gleaned from his 1962 (!) paper [Augmenting Human Intellect](http://www.bootstrap.org/augdocs/friedewald030402/augmentinghumanintellect/ahi62index.html). How might some of his thoughts on collaborative intelligence be implemented in our world now, in 2006, within the technology we have now? That’s the question waiting to be solved.</blockquote><div class=\"quotesource\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.adaptivepath.com/blog/2006/09/05/the-futility-of-designing-for-an-alternate-past/\">adaptive path » blog » blog archive » The Futility of Designing for an Alternate Past</a></div>\r\n\r\nAllow me to engage in some Devil's Advocacy here - although I really am an Engelbart sympathizer:  \r\n\r\nConsider a program like Microsoft Word, with all its ribbons and toolbars and menus and animated assistance.  When you first started working with it, you probably spent time navigating these visual and guided parts of the user interface to get your job done.  But, after awhile, you probably discovered keyboard shortcuts and accellerators - CTRL-s to save, for instance.  These have likely been invaluable in speeding up your work and helping the application get out of your way.  So, having reached this point, do you ever really have a use for the \"user friendly\" bits anymore?  Or, have you graduated to \"manipulating documents via arcane commands\"?\r\n\r\nWhat if this application had never sugar-coated things and had instead optimized for efficiency and ergonomics in daily expert operation, trading an \"intuitive interface\" for an offer to incrementally train on its necessarily complex functionality?  After awhile, you'll have it all down, and be ready to shed the training wheels.\r\n\r\nWhat if - instead of a maze of menus and toolbar icons - your mouse just had dozens of easily-accessible buttons?  You're used to only having a left and a right click from which to choose.  If you've splurged, you might have the more expansive choices offered by a fancier pointing device.  But, what if you had a chording keyboard under your off-mouse hand, offering an order of magnitude more mouse pointer actions?  \r\n\r\nFor example, how about a \"delete word\" mouse button?  Or a \"copy sentence\" button?  Or maybe even a \"jump to the selected link with a custom view filter\" button?  The important part is that these commands act **immediately**, *just like a mouse button*, upon whatever's under the pointer.  There's no left-click then CTRL-x to Cut - no, you just point at a word, and say \"cut that\".  There's a lot of power and efficiency here.\r\n\r\nThese \"what if\" scenarios are not just wishful thinking, though.  They're what Doug Engelbart and crew implemented.  These are things I picked up after being invited to try a hands-on self-guided tour of [Augment][].  I only wish I'd had a chording keyboard to get the full experience.  The interface was like a mouse-heavy [VIM][], with verb-object command patterns and structured document interactions.  (Or, rather, [VIM][] is like a mouse- and outline-deficient derivation of Augment.)  \r\n\r\nThe basic core of this facet of [Augment][] is this:  Computers are powerful tools with great potential to augment human intellect.  As such, they offer a lot of complex functionality.  But, human beings are trainable, and can assimilate this functionality.  Once assimilated, it's best to squeeze out all the performance you can.  You don't see today's degree of computer \"user friendliness\" in chainsaws, tanks, jack-hammers, semi-trucks, or fighter jets.  These things are necessarily complex and require training.  Why should the most powerful of intelligence enhancement tools offered by computers be any different?  Of course, you generally won't lose a limb to a computer, but you might be mentally impaired or lose valuable work in the process.\r\n\r\nThis is, I think, one of the still-relevant central facets of Doug Engelbart's ideas that could use some re-examination today.  It could just be because I'm an übernerd who thinks it's fun to self-train on things like [VIM][] and [Augment][], but I also think that there's a lot of potential to be unlocked once you clear away expectations of \"intuitive interfaces\" that are [decidedly not nipples][nip].  \r\n\r\nAnd, since I've [admitted my recently acquired semi-addiction][wow], consider World of Warcraft as an expert application.  Advanced players could never succeed by navigating a complex yet \"friendly\" UI to invoke various spells and skills and in-game actions.  Just take a look at some of the customizations and UI revisions being offered at [this site][wowui].  Some configurations of this game smack me as eerily similar to the principles of Augment.  In fact, just this weekend, I was considering blowing the dust off [this keyset controller](http://www.avault.com/hardware/getreview.asp?review=msstratcom) I used to use with Everquest, years ago.\r\n\r\nThen again, maybe it's a matter of intensity.  Coordinating with a 40-player guild to slay something from the molten bowels of the earth is a slightly different activity than composing a memo or even a few-dozen-page report.  On the other hand, I really would've liked to strip away most of the Word interface while writing my [two books](#text-2).  And someday, who's to say that online interpersonal collaboration in the general case won't more closely resemble a World of Warcraft raid?  Having [just read][read] [Vernor Vinge's latest book Rainbows End][re], he makes a lot of intelligence augmentation and collaboration tasks look just like WoW.\r\n\r\n[re]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312856849/0xdecafbad01-20\r\n[read]: http://decafbad.vox.com/library/post/reading-vernor-vinges-new-novel.html\r\n[wowui]: http://ui.worldofwar.net/\r\n[wow]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/06/world-of-warcraft-is-my-world-of-warcraft\r\n[nip]: http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/2002/08/nipple.html\r\n[vim]: http://www.vim.org/\r\n[augment]: http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2006/03/new-screencast-of-douglas-engelbarts.html\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085202\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8157a5907b244071cda98ba5aa7a9635&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085202\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-06T21:58:26\">2006-09-06T21:58:26</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>The fighter-jet metaphor is interesting.

Google and others have started introducing intermediate level UI features in web apps (like shortcut keys), but try building a site that looks and feels like WoW...</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085206\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mozdawg.blogspot.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2c2c2c8f9e42a145f54f257111c6e84d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mozdawg.blogspot.com\">Ben Tremblay</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085206\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-12T20:35:09\">2006-09-12T20:35:09</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>What still catches me with systems like Augment (I would call Neuberg's new incarnation \"hyperScope\".) is precisely the mousing.</p>\n\n<p>The war is long lost but I recall with fond pleasure how I blew a Word user away by using WP5.2 ... ^F6-P <em>boom</em> And when I rolled out the functions I'd cobbled together with WP's lovely macro language? Sonic boom. The key in that situation was that I had a large number of unique tasks and a small very number of tasks carrying a huge workload (MILSPEC change management). So it was ideal for hot-keyed macros: like shooting fish in a barrel.</p>\n\n<p>For one thing, unless I'm reading passively or doing some flavour of CAD my hands are nowhere near the mouse. Or, to invert that, when I'm keyboarding I have to routinely suppress my resentment with reach, swivel, click, drag, select, click, select ... interminable menus and options bla-bla-blah, and nowhere muscle memory comes into play. But even with that aside, to have to right click and then select Delete from a menu /after/ having dragged to select a block ... I can outshoot that action stream using keystrokes anyday, if the app allowed me to.</p>\n\n<p>I don't disagree with the fundamental insight ... far from it. But we've just barely begun to implement the foundational cognitive ergonomics. (I was gratified to see in one thread that Brad explicated his having moved Help to the upper right ... cuz that's where it is most often. When it works it works cuz it works. Tradition is sometimes/often arbitrary; life's like that and we should sometimes just suck it up.)</p>\n\n<p>Harold's point about expert users is, I think, key. It's merely foolish to impose a system that makes good use of habituation onto a newly arrived visitor. I'm quite sure that attentive study shows a clustering or quantum of user intention and expertise ... until and unless we contrive some seamless continuum (a terrible distraction inspired by naive perfectionism) we should focus on differentiating expters from n00bs (no diss) and serve both well. \"Intermediate level\" sounds quite appropriate ... so long as this isn't just a maelstrum of fish/foul goat/sheep confounds.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively we can always fall back on the old TRW concept of making people think more like machines. There might be funding for that.\n;-P</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085208\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mozdawg.blogspot.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2c2c2c8f9e42a145f54f257111c6e84d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mozdawg.blogspot.com\">Ben Tremblay</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085208\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-12T20:39:47\">2006-09-12T20:39:47</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Muscle memory just jumped up and reminded me of this: in a situation where I was doing Print Preview a gazillion times a day Shift-F7 6 was as effortless as breathing. <em>snap</em></p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085209\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e377f3e2140297d32460ae9a4b38ff98&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085209\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-10-18T06:00:17\">2006-10-18T06:00:17</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I can speak as a former Emacs user and coder that the only reason I gave it up for vi was that it hurt my hands too much to make all of those funky keyboard chords, and it started to hurt my head to remember all of the time-saving things I had built.</p>\n\n<p>Classically there's a tradeoff between the ease of typing something and the amount of think time you have to put into remembering what to type.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I am annoyed by on too many blogs is the inability to tab from the comment field to the \"submit\" button, which forces a mouse event and a scroll event.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",
