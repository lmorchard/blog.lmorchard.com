Mouse &amp; keyboard &amp; headphones are also easy—USB cables come in long lengths and Bluetooth is a thing.</p>\n<p>No, the hard part was the monitor. I had been gaming on a 2012 15&quot; MacBook Pro—which was physically convenient but lacking in performance. A gaming PC solves the latter, but no one seems to sell 15&quot; standalone monitors equivalent to my laptop screen. That was when I discovered <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Laptop-to-Desktop-Conversion/\">an Instructable article</a> about how to turn an old laptop into a desktop panel. <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch/#Laptop_decapitation\">That gave me ideas</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-10---artisanal-acrylic\">Version 1.0 - Artisanal Acrylic</h2>\n<p>Turns out, there are <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/usr/chinatobby2011\">vendors on eBay</a> who offer complete kits for hooking a laptop display panel up to a PC. They just don&#39;t come with any kind of enclosure like your typical computer monitor. So, <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/02/10/building-my-couch-computing-station/\">I ordered one of those kits and tried handcrafting a case</a>. It turned out crude yet functional:</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8439217201/in/photolist-5m6a-dRKcfR-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRk8-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"First fully assembled power-on of my DIY monitor\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/8439217201_6eea54c3e5_z.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"First fully assembled power-on of my DIY monitor\"></a></p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8447859933/in/photolist-5m6a-dRKcfR-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRk8-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"Rear view #2 of DIY monitor and IKEA DAVE\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/8447859933_c1bf2c05aa_z.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Rear view #2 of DIY monitor and IKEA DAVE\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"version-11---custom-picture-frame\">Version 1.1 - Custom Picture Frame</h2>\n<p>I used that first version for a year in my living room. It was ugly &amp; heavy &amp; awkward. Happily, I fell upon <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Raspberry-Pi-Media-Panel-fka-Digita/?ALLSTEPS\">this Instructables article</a> that pointed me to <a href=\"http://www.americanframe.com/\">American Frame</a>. They&#39;ll produce a rectangular picture frame in just about any custom size you&#39;d like—height, width, <em>and</em> depth.</p>\n<p>So, I ordered a nice matte black metal frame close to the size of my display panel. I ended up with this:</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/12222356524/in/photolist-dRKcfR-7aTRk8-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-5m6a-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"Updated Couch PC monitor\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/12222356524_fcbd4cf0b4_z.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"Updated Couch PC monitor\"></a></p>\n<p>Sleeker and lighter. The back of the picture frame was just <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foamcore\">foamcore</a> and I used double-sided tape on the monitor arm and all the electronics. Luckily, the panel and all were light enough for these hacks. But, it kind of fell apart across two house moves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-12---mic-stands--laser-cutters-ftw\">Version 1.2 - Mic Stands &amp; Laser Cutters FTW</h2>\n<p>I decided I wanted to minimize things. The Ikea Dave laptop stand seemed a bit much, especially when I needed to move it around—or hide it when company came over.</p>\n<p>Last year, I (finally) got a membership at <a href=\"https://www.i3detroit.org/\">i3Detroit</a>. I skilled up on laser cutters and <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/2016/08/29/gamechord/\">made a DIY keypad that I showed off at the Detroit Maker Faire</a>. Things that, you know, <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/topic/i3detroit-public/Qv1P91ySqWo/discussion\">I should have done years ago at the start of this whole DIY monitor project</a>—rather than cutting things by hand and with a Dremel.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I discovered that there&#39;s a such thing as <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2jccG5D\">a VESA mount</a> for <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2jcc93M\">microphone stands</a>. I bought those and threw in an <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2j1YpeM\">adapter</a> &amp; a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2j1VYZq\">gooseneck</a>—all of which let me strip my rig down like so:</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/32182700386/in/datetaken/\" title=\"20170109_221645\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/32182700386_4320d2a1d0_z.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"800\" alt=\"20170109_221645\"></a></p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/31845156280/in/datetaken/\" title=\"20170109_221722\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/31845156280_d16551c8df_z.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"800\" alt=\"20170109_221722\"></a></p>\n<p>By this point, the double-sided tape and the foamcore just weren&#39;t up to the task.

This layout has places to bolt in all of the electronic components of the monitor—driver board, button panel, and power supply. It&#39;s also got a proper 75/100 VESA mount that accepts <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2iYwbAU\">10mm thumbscrew bolts</a> through the mic stand plate.</p>\n<p>The main thing that worked out better than I expected is this: <img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/nuts.png\" style=\"width: 1.5em\"></p>\n<p>The two 1.5mm layers have rectangular cut-outs. Each of those trap a 3mm thick hexogonal M4 nut and act as wrenches. The 2.5mm layers have holes for bolts.

The side-to-side angle doesn&#8217;t want to support any weight in an up-and-down tilt, but the rest of the arm tightens down, so it&#8217;s good enough.</p>\n<h3 style=\"clear: both;\">\n  <span id=\"Building_the_enclosure\">Building the enclosure</span>\n</h3>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t have a 3D printer or a laser cutter. Though there is <a href=\"http://www.i3detroit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a friendly hackerspace</a> suitably equipped nearby, I wanted to see what I could prototype by hand. So, I went to Home Depot and bought <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100542281/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=acrylic&storeId=10051#.URcEEZykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">4 polystyrene panels</a>, <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-203040434/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=dremel&storeId=10051#.URcW75ykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">a Dremel tool</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202519358/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=acrylic+cutter&storeId=10051#.URcXIJykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">an acrylic cutter</a>.</p>\n<p>With lots of trial and error, and truly awful manufacturing tolerances, I came up with a crude design consisting of 6 stacked layers bolted together with machine screws:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Back layer with VESA mounting holes and an exit for the LVDS cable.</li>\n<li>Layer with VESA mounting holes and a pocket to route the LVDS cable.</li>\n<li>Layer behind the LCD with pocket for LVDS cable and heads of VESA mount bolts.</li>\n<li>Strips across the top and sides to hold the LCD panel.</li>\n<li>More strips across the top and sides to hold the LCD panel.</li>\n<li>Strips across the top and sides, covering the bezel area of the LCD panel.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I made a ton of measurements and little indecipherable sketches in my grid-lined Moleskine, but those were mostly crap. No battle plan survives contact with the enemy, and all that. In the end, I just flew by the seat of my pants and hacked away.</p>\n<p>This process taught me that a Dremel (in my hands, at least) is absolutely no substitute for a laser cutter. I <em>really</em> didn&#8217;t anticipate just how horrible I&#8217;d be at cutting this stuff. Trying to cut just-right shapes out of the polystyrene turned into a dismal, stinky mess. But luckily, all the material I thought I&#8217;d wasted turned out to be perfect for cutting out as strips for the bezel and sides.</p>\n<p>So, in lieu of a diagram, how about some pictures?</p>\n<div style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.29.331.jpg\"><img title=\"Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench\" alt=\"Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.29.331-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a little trick I worked out in this construction process: I used squares of electrical tape to retain the machine screws, so that I could flip the thing around while I was assembling layers on top before threading on the nuts. And speaking of that, here are the rest of the pieces in place:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_850\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-00.36.29.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-850\" title=\"Further layers bolted into the stack\" alt=\"Further layers bolted into the stack\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-00.36.29-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Further layers bolted into the stack\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The middle two layers cradling the sides of the LCD panel alternate between long sides / short top and long top / short sides, providing a bit more stability in the way they overlap. The top layer is long sides / short top, with a bit more width to cover the 5mm or so of the LCD panel&#8217;s bezel area.</p>\n<p>Immediately behind the LCD panel is a layer with a cut-out to provide space for machine screws for the VESA mount, and a pocket through which to route the LVDS cable to the control board. And the final two layers form the actual VESA mount and complete the exit route for the LVDS cable.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.44.09.jpg\"><img title=\"Video control board bolted onto the back\" alt=\"Video control board bolted onto the back\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.44.09-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Video control board bolted onto the back\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>And finally, here&#8217;s the video control board on the back. Rather than make a full box for the board, I just sandwiched it with machine screws between acrylic layers and nylon spacers. Then, I bolted that whole mess onto the back layers.</p>\n<p>Midway through this process, I switched from Home Depot to <a href=\"http://frentzandsons.com/content/default.htm\">a family-owned hardware store</a> a few blocks from my house. I think they recognize me as a regular now after repeat visits for Dremel bits, screws, and a pile of other miscellanea.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mounting-the-mess-to-the-dave\"><span id=\"Mounting_the_mess_to_the_DAVE\">Mounting the mess to the DAVE</span></h3>\n<p>The VideoSecu VESA mount went onto the IKEA DAVE rather crudely with a pair of long wood screws. It feels pretty solid, but the screws stab treacherously out through the bottom. I&#8217;ll need to address that someday, probably after they stab me in the kneecaps.</p>\n<p>And, as it turns out, the control board placement was a mistake. Once I got the VESA arm screwed onto the IKEA DAVE, there wasn&#8217;t enough room to connect the power and an HDMI cable to the board. Or rather, there was just enough room to do so and inadvertently destroy an HDMI cable after a few hours of the monitor&#8217;s weight resting on it. I guess the good news is that the cable went before the solder joints on the jack failed. Herp, derp.</p>\n<p>So, I bought a new HDMI cable, unbolted the board, and stuck it onto the back with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Z4A8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00004Z4A8&linkCode=as2&tag=0xdecafbad01-20\" target=\"_blank\">double sided tape</a>. Here&#8217;s what the back looks like now:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_826\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-05-00.28.14.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-826\" title=\"LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE\" alt=\"LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-05-00.28.14-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE, featuring bonus <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/cheddars/\" target=\"_blank\">Cheddars</a> appearance\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>I also used the same tape to attach the button board to the front of the enclosure.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_853\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.20.43.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-853\" alt=\"Button board on front\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.20.43-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Button board on front\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Overall, this thing works pretty much exactly as I&#8217;d imagined it. I <a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/p/z3mE\" target=\"_blank\">built a PC</a> in a <a href=\"http://icrontic.com/article/fractal-design-node-304-case-review\" target=\"_blank\">Fractal Node 304</a> mini-ITX case, and hid that under the coffee table. I bundled the cables together and used velcro wraps to bind them to the DAVE, and <a href=\"http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/rabbit-proofing.html#cords\" target=\"_blank\">some spiral wraps to bunny-proof</a> them as much as possible.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_855\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.38.29.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-855\" alt=\"Cheddars just loves my new couch PC\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.38.29-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/cheddars/\" target=\"_blank\">Cheddars</a> just loves my new couch PC. Or, maybe she wants dinner.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"whats-next\"><span id=\"What8217s_next\">What&#8217;s next?</span></h3>\n<p>This monitor is ugly if you look at it too closely. I slipped a bit with the acrylic cutter and left some obvious gouges, and the layers have a grubby patina of scratches just from clumsy handling throughout the process. Basically, it&#8217;s very, very obviously hand-made by a guy who writes software for a living and hasn&#8217;t touched a power tool for more than 5 minutes since high school shop class.</p>\n<p>But, I think some really valuable things came out of this first attempt: It took me a bit to work through how to mount the LCD panel and route the cable out the back in a way that didn&#8217;t put stress on the wires or the connectors. There was a lot of fudge factor in getting the VESA mount alignment just right. And, there was also that HDMI cable I wrecked by botching the control board placement. Beyond all that, though, the basic idea worked.</p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;m already thinking about v2.0 and making friends over at <a href=\"http://www.i3detroit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">i3Detroit</a> who can drive <a href=\"http://i3detroit.com/wi/index.php?title=Laser_Cutting_and_Etching\" target=\"_blank\">a laser cutter</a>. I&#8217;m checking out <a href=\"http://www.ponoko.com/starter-kits/inkscape\" target=\"_blank\">Inkscape and Ponoko</a>. I&#8217;d also like to find some better materials &#8211; maybe aluminum for the front bezel and back panel, and maybe drop a layer from the stack. It would be really nice to get a much cleaner look and drop some weight. Also, an upgrade to this cheap VESA mount would be keen &#8211; I can&#8217;t <em>quite</em> get all the adjustments I&#8217;d like.</p>\n<p>Overall, this thing works, and that makes me pretty happy. In the beginning, I had really hoped to just find someone else had made this exact thing &#8211; maybe on Thingiverse. But, no such luck. This <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Laptop-to-Desktop-Conversion/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Laptop-to-Desktop&#8221; Instructable</a> is pretty close, but not entirely what I needed. I guess DIY high-res LCD monitors are just not a thing. But, maybe this post and a possible v2.0 post in the future might come in handy for someone else.</p>\n",

What I needed now was an enclosure, and a way to mount the enclosure to my IKEA DAVE.\r\n\r\n### <span id=\"Mounting_hardware\">Mounting hardware</span>\r\n\r\nAs it happened, I had [a cheap VESA mount with an articulated arm laying][5]<img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=0xdecafbad01-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B000ID7QNI\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" /> around. We never got around to using it to stick a TV on the wall, so it seemed worth a shot to see if it would work on the IKEA DAVE.\r\n\r\n[<img border=\"0\" src=\"http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&#038;ASIN=B000ID7QNI&#038;Format=_SL110_&#038;ID=AsinImage&#038;MarketPlace=US&#038;ServiceVersion=20070822&#038;WS=1&#038;tag=0xdecafbad01-20\" />][6]<img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=0xdecafbad01-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B000ID7QNI\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\r\n\r\nFor around $15, it&#8217;s just about right: I had to mount it sideways, and it doesn&#8217;t *quite* fully work that way. The side-to-side angle doesn&#8217;t want to support any weight in an up-and-down tilt, but the rest of the arm tightens down, so it&#8217;s good enough.\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"clear: both;\">\r\n  <span id=\"Building_the_enclosure\">Building the enclosure</span>\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\nI don&#8217;t have a 3D printer or a laser cutter. Though there is <a href=\"http://www.i3detroit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a friendly hackerspace</a> suitably equipped nearby, I wanted to see what I could prototype by hand. So, I went to Home Depot and bought <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100542281/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=acrylic&storeId=10051#.URcEEZykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">4 polystyrene panels</a>, <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-203040434/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=dremel&storeId=10051#.URcW75ykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">a Dremel tool</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202519358/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=acrylic+cutter&storeId=10051#.URcXIJykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">an acrylic cutter</a>.\r\n\r\nWith lots of trial and error, and truly awful manufacturing tolerances, I came up with a crude design consisting of 6 stacked layers bolted together with machine screws:\r\n\r\n1.  Back layer with VESA mounting holes and an exit for the LVDS cable.\r\n2.  Layer with VESA mounting holes and a pocket to route the LVDS cable.\r\n3.  Layer behind the LCD with pocket for LVDS cable and heads of VESA mount bolts.\r\n4.  Strips across the top and sides to hold the LCD panel.\r\n5.  More strips across the top and sides to hold the LCD panel.\r\n6.  Strips across the top and sides, covering the bezel area of the LCD panel.\r\n\r\nI made a ton of measurements and little indecipherable sketches in my grid-lined Moleskine, but those were mostly crap. No battle plan survives contact with the enemy, and all that. In the end, I just flew by the seat of my pants and hacked away.\r\n\r\nThis process taught me that a Dremel (in my hands, at least) is absolutely no substitute for a laser cutter. I *really* didn&#8217;t anticipate just how horrible I&#8217;d be at cutting this stuff. Trying to cut just-right shapes out of the polystyrene turned into a dismal, stinky mess. But luckily, all the material I thought I&#8217;d wasted turned out to be perfect for cutting out as strips for the bezel and sides.\r\n\r\nSo, in lieu of a diagram, how about some pictures?\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.29.331.jpg\"><img title=\"Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench\" alt=\"Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.29.331-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench.\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nHere&#8217;s a little trick I worked out in this construction process: I used squares of electrical tape to retain the machine screws, so that I could flip the thing around while I was assembling layers on top before threading on the nuts. And speaking of that, here are the rest of the pieces in place:\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_850\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-00.36.29.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-850\" title=\"Further layers bolted into the stack\" alt=\"Further layers bolted into the stack\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-00.36.29-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    Further layers bolted into the stack\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThe middle two layers cradling the sides of the LCD panel alternate between long sides / short top and long top / short sides, providing a bit more stability in the way they overlap. The top layer is long sides / short top, with a bit more width to cover the 5mm or so of the LCD panel&#8217;s bezel area.\r\n\r\nImmediately behind the LCD panel is a layer with a cut-out to provide space for machine screws for the VESA mount, and a pocket through which to route the LVDS cable to the control board. And the final two layers form the actual VESA mount and complete the exit route for the LVDS cable.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.44.09.jpg\"><img title=\"Video control board bolted onto the back\" alt=\"Video control board bolted onto the back\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.44.09-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    Video control board bolted onto the back\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nAnd finally, here&#8217;s the video control board on the back. Rather than make a full box for the board, I just sandwiched it with machine screws between acrylic layers and nylon spacers. Then, I bolted that whole mess onto the back layers.\r\n\r\nMidway through this process, I switched from Home Depot to [a family-owned hardware store][7] a few blocks from my house. I think they recognize me as a regular now after repeat visits for Dremel bits, screws, and a pile of other miscellanea.\r\n\r\n### <span id=\"Mounting_the_mess_to_the_DAVE\">Mounting the mess to the DAVE</span>\r\n\r\nThe VideoSecu VESA mount went onto the IKEA DAVE rather crudely with a pair of long wood screws. It feels pretty solid, but the screws stab treacherously out through the bottom. I&#8217;ll need to address that someday, probably after they stab me in the kneecaps.\r\n\r\nAnd, as it turns out, the control board placement was a mistake. Once I got the VESA arm screwed onto the IKEA DAVE, there wasn&#8217;t enough room to connect the power and an HDMI cable to the board. Or rather, there was just enough room to do so and inadvertently destroy an HDMI cable after a few hours of the monitor&#8217;s weight resting on it. I guess the good news is that the cable went before the solder joints on the jack failed. Herp, derp.\r\n\r\nSo, I bought a new HDMI cable, unbolted the board, and stuck it onto the back with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Z4A8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00004Z4A8&linkCode=as2&tag=0xdecafbad01-20\" target=\"_blank\">double sided tape</a>. Here&#8217;s what the back looks like now:\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_826\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-05-00.28.14.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-826\" title=\"LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE\" alt=\"LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-05-00.28.14-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE, featuring bonus <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/cheddars/\" target=\"_blank\">Cheddars</a> appearance\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nI also used the same tape to attach the button board to the front of the enclosure.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_853\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.20.43.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-853\" alt=\"Button board on front\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.20.43-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    Button board on front\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nOverall, this thing works pretty much exactly as I&#8217;d imagined it. I <a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/p/z3mE\" target=\"_blank\">built a PC</a> in a <a href=\"http://icrontic.com/article/fractal-design-node-304-case-review\" target=\"_blank\">Fractal Node 304</a> mini-ITX case, and hid that under the coffee table. I bundled the cables together and used velcro wraps to bind them to the DAVE, and <a href=\"http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/rabbit-proofing.html#cords\" target=\"_blank\">some spiral wraps to bunny-proof</a> them as much as possible.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_855\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.38.29.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-855\" alt=\"Cheddars just loves my new couch PC\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.38.29-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/cheddars/\" target=\"_blank\">Cheddars</a> just loves my new couch PC. Or, maybe she wants dinner.\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n### <span id=\"What8217s_next\">What&#8217;s next?</span>\r\n\r\nThis monitor is ugly if you look at it too closely. I slipped a bit with the acrylic cutter and left some obvious gouges, and the layers have a grubby patina of scratches just from clumsy handling throughout the process. Basically, it&#8217;s very, very obviously hand-made by a guy who writes software for a living and hasn&#8217;t touched a power tool for more than 5 minutes since high school shop class.\r\n\r\nBut, I think some really valuable things came out of this first attempt: It took me a bit to work through how to mount the LCD panel and route the cable out the back in a way that didn&#8217;t put stress on the wires or the connectors. There was a lot of fudge factor in getting the VESA mount alignment just right. And, there was also that HDMI cable I wrecked by botching the control board placement. Beyond all that, though, the basic idea worked.\r\n\r\nSo, I&#8217;m already thinking about v2.0 and making friends over at <a href=\"http://www.i3detroit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">i3Detroit</a> who can drive <a href=\"http://i3detroit.com/wi/index.php?title=Laser_Cutting_and_Etching\" target=\"_blank\">a laser cutter</a>. I&#8217;m checking out <a href=\"http://www.ponoko.com/starter-kits/inkscape\" target=\"_blank\">Inkscape and Ponoko</a>. I&#8217;d also like to find some better materials &#8211; maybe aluminum for the front bezel and back panel, and maybe drop a layer from the stack. It would be really nice to get a much cleaner look and drop some weight. Also, an upgrade to this cheap VESA mount would be keen &#8211; I can&#8217;t *quite* get all the adjustments I&#8217;d like.\r\n\r\nOverall, this thing works, and that makes me pretty happy. In the beginning, I had really hoped to just find someone else had made this exact thing &#8211; maybe on Thingiverse. But, no such luck. This <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Laptop-to-Desktop-Conversion/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Laptop-to-Desktop&#8221; Instructable</a> is pretty close, but not entirely what I needed. I guess DIY high-res LCD monitors are just not a thing. But, maybe this post and a possible v2.0 post in the future might come in handy for someone else.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch\r\n [2]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch#Laptop_decapitation\r\n [3]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2a-pc.png\r\n [4]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-23.33.12.jpg\r\n [5]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ID7QNI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000ID7QNI&linkCode=as2&tag=0xdecafbad01-20 \"VideoSecu Articulating TV Wall Mount Bracket for VESA 100 LCD LED Flat Screen Monitor TV 1E9\"\r\n [6]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ID7QNI/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000ID7QNI&linkCode=as2&tag=0xdecafbad01-20\r\n [7]: http://frentzandsons.com/content/default.htm",

Alex and I like to spend nights making fun of crappy TV, piddling around on our laptops, and attracting household pets. (Yeah, I had a little too much fun playing around in [SketchUp][1] tonight.)\r\n\r\nSo, when I play video games, I don&#8217;t usually take over the TV &#8211; at least, not until later in the evening, when the girl succumbs to napping and I feel like firing up the Xbox. What I&#8217;ve ended up with for most nights, then, is running games from Steam (I&#8217;m [lmorchard][2]) on Windows 7 running on a 2010 MacBook Pro 15&#8243; via Boot Camp.\r\n\r\nThis is less than optimal, but it works tolerably for many fun things.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"My_current_gaming_rig\">My current gaming rig</span>\r\n\r\n<a style=\"display: block; float: left; margin: 0 0.75em 0.75em 0\" href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-1a-laptop.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-1a-laptop-175x300.png\" alt=\"couch-gaming-1a-laptop\" width=\"175\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-669\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLet&#8217;s zoom and enhance, because I can do that in SketchUp. On the right, you can see a model of my gaming rig. It consists mainly of the aforementioned [Apple MacBook Pro][3], an [Ikea DAVE laptop table][4], and a [Logitech Trackman Marble Mouse][5].\r\n\r\nI really like the DAVE table &#8211; we&#8217;ve accumulated 4 of these things at last count. They&#8217;re cheap &#8211; easily had from Ikea for around $20 &#8211; and go together in 2 minutes. I&#8217;ve used them instead of buying [$400 ergonomic keyboard trays][6] for my desk. (I really missed those, when I left Yahoo!)\r\n\r\nI even took one outside to make [working on the deck][7] easier on my wrists. And, of course, I&#8217;ve been gradually evolving one into a couch computing station.\r\n\r\n<a style=\"display: block; float: right; margin: 0 0 0.75em 0.75em\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8269329367/\" title=\"My couch computing rig by lmorchard, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/coughrigphoto.png\" alt=\"coughrigphoto\" width=\"261\" height=\"266\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-716\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere on the right is a picture of my couch-side DAVE, sans MacBook pro. The big thing is a [Cooler Master NotePal X-Slim Cooling Pad][8], because my laptop has a habit of overheating and shutting itself down in the middle of Windows games, especially in the middle of summer.\r\n\r\nI&#8217;ve also been cycling through different pairs of headphones, and am currently trying out a pair of [Logitech H800][9] wireless headphones. (The [Plantronics 355&#8217;s][10] in the picture had been turned wireless when the bunny hopped by and gave it a nip. So, I took the hint.)\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Thoughts_on_a_new_gaming_rig\">Thoughts on a new gaming rig</span>\r\n\r\nLike I wrote earlier, many fun games can be played tolerably well on this 2010 MacBook Pro in Boot Camp. But, this is suboptimal and a dead end for upgrades where it matters. I could get an updated laptop, but that&#8217;s just kicking the can down the road. And besides, this machine is intended more as a productivity machine for me than gaming.\r\n\r\nI could also buy a real gaming laptop, but those things are expensive &#8211; and also less than great for upgrades.\r\n\r\n<a style=\"display: block; float: left; margin: 0 0.75em 0.75em 0\" href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2-pc.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2-pc-300x248.png\" alt=\"couch-gaming-2-pc\" width=\"300\" height=\"248\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-672\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhat about a desktop gaming PC?
