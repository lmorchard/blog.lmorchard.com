The best way I can\nthink to explain is that the old way was item-centric and the new way\nis people-centric.  In other words, <em>people</em> seem to be the dominant\n<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/jyri/microblogging-tiny-social-objects-on-the-future-of-participatory-media\">social objects</a> in Google+, whereas Google Reader used to treat\n<em>items</em> that way.</p>\n<p>Before, we all gathered around the news. The headline and summary were\nprimary, and our comments were collected after the item. The result\nwas a de-duped stream of great news filtered through smart brains.\nEven if the people I followed never said a word, the fact that they&#39;d\nclicked &quot;share&quot; was value enough. In fact, it was better that\nway most of the time, because we all got out of the way of each other\nand the news.</p>\n<p>This, by the way, is what I loved about del.icio.us and now\n<a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">pinboard.in</a>: It&#39;s anti-social networking. We can provide\nlow-effort, intelligent inputs to build something useful for each\nother, but we&#39;re not there to assert a presence or distract each other\nfrom the things we each came to see.</p>\n<p>But now, that filtered news stream is gone. In its place, on a\ndifferent site entirely, removed from the flow of feeding on news, is\na highly-engaging flood of people babbling away, which occasionally\nincludes repeated shares of things that have bubbled up during the\nday.</p>\n<p>What&#39;s wrong with that, for me?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I don&#39;t want to wade through a heavily-padded, user-friendly flood\nof duplicated, echoed items.</li>\n<li>I don&#39;t want to engage with the people—at least, not when I&#39;m in a\nmood to feed on news.

Engagement in general puts a drag on the task—which\nfor me is like a <a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd\">GTD</a>, <a href=\"http://inboxzero.com/\">Inbox Zero</a>, headline skimming, pattern\nrecognition zen thing that might not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea.</p>\n<p>But, for all I know, avowed weirdo and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/10/11/allgrowedup\">info freako</a> that I am,\nthese changes may drive Google Reader growth through the roof for\nmainstream users.  But, it&#39;s no longer a product for me. The changes\nin sharing have removed most of the value for me, because I no longer\nhave the warp speed cruise through news that other people used to\npower for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"circles-point-the-wrong-way\">Circles point the wrong way</h2>\n<p>One of the things <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/100535338638690515335/posts/95ZsWiCG3xS\">Louis Gray touted about the new sharing\nfeatures</a> reads like so:</p>\n<blockquote>In Reader’s previous sharing model, as a follower of your\nitems, I would see every single item you shared, no matter what it was\nabout. Obviously, as I have different interests than you do, not\neverything you shared was something I cared about, which often led to\nreduced sharing of off-topic content. Now, you are more in control, so\nyou can share sports items to your sports circles, great recipes with\nyour foodies circle, or local news to family and friends. You can keep\nsharing, like you always have, but now, you can better select who sees\nwhat.</blockquote>\n\n<p>But, for this purpose, Circles point the wrong way.</p>\n<p>Circles on Google+ are lists of people controlled by me. They&#39;re not\ntopics—again, people-centric and not item-centric. Circles are a\ntargeting mechanism for sharing to people, and a filtering mechanism\nfor items from people.  That is, I can use a circle to set who sees\nsomething and I can decide who&#39;s stuff I see and when.</p>\n<p>But, things that Circles don&#39;t do include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Letting me follow Circles without the Circle-owner needing to manage\nmembership - eg. Don&#39;t make me send a message saying &quot;I am\ninterested in your ideas and would like to subscribe to your\nnewsletter&quot;. RSS doesn&#39;t work that way and it&#39;s better for it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Letting me and others filter for what gets sent to specific Circles -\neg. I&#39;m in both your &quot;scifi&quot; and &quot;politics&quot; circles, but just show\nme what you sent to your &quot;scifi&quot; circle.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Google Reader didn&#39;t have this to begin with, but what I&#39;m looking for\nis an equivalent to tagging on <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">pinboard.in</a>. For example, if you\nlike my taste in <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/t:scifi\">scifi</a> but could care less about my views in\n<a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/t:politics\">politics</a>, you can subscribe to just the tag feeds you want.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m happy to tag my shares with topics; that&#39;s beneficial to me for\nsearch later, and helps interested people besides. But, the last thing\nI want to do is manage subscriber lists. That doesn&#39;t scale. There&#39;s\nno way for you to even know I have &quot;scifi&quot; or &quot;politics&quot; Circles, and\nyou have no way to join either of them without asking for an add.</p>\n<p>Too much coordination, not enough benefit. I just can&#39;t see the value\nin people-centric Circles here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-things-broke-too\">Other things broke, too.</h2>\n<p>And beyond the fundamental shift in sharing and reading, these things\nhave broken for me now too:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The bookmarklet is dead, so there goes my off-site sharing.</li>\n<li>No sharing at all from the <a href=\"http://google.com/reader/i/\">mobile web version</a>, so there goes at\nleast half of my sharing on-site.</li>\n<li>Android apps like my favorite <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.noinnion.android.greader.readerpro&amp;hl=en\">gReader Pro</a> still think sharing\nworks, but they&#39;re just deluded and use an unsupported API anyway</li>\n<li>No more feed to Facebook, so there goes most of <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/lmorchard\">my Facebook\noutput</a>.

And the Mozilla community acts a lot like an ecosystem, which can be visualized <a href=\"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2008/07/29/the-mozilla-tree/\">as a kind of living tree</a>—not to confused with the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/mozilla-central\">mozilla-central tree</a>.  Oh yeah, and Mozilla is the name of <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/reorganization/\">both a Foundation and a Corporation</a>.</p>\n<p>Confused yet?  If not, then we should talk so you can explain it to me, because it all looks pretty tangly and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity\">intertwingled</a> to me.  Nonetheless, it seems to work, and produces a good chunk of my favorite software and technologies.</p>\n<p>There are many efforts to track what&#39;s going on—including <a href=\"http://planet.mozilla.org/\">planets</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/about_mozilla/\">newsletters</a> and <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/\">bugzillas</a> and <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/WeeklyUpdates/2009-01-05\">wikis</a> and <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/\">repositories</a> and <a href=\"http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=Firefox\">tinderboxen</a>.  Some of these resources report on, or are driven by, the activity occurring in the others.  Some are automated, and others are carefully stitched together by hand.  None offer a full picture of what&#39;s going on in the <a href=\"http://ascher.ca/blog/2008/06/19/whats-mozillas-scope-what-should-it-be/\">Mozilla galaxy</a> in a way that&#39;s casually comprehensible by a sane human being.</p>\n<p>Of course, that&#39;s not a slight against any of these sites or the people maintaining them—extracting an overview from such an organic phenomenon is neither easy nor straightforward.  But, it might be fun to try.</p>\n<p>As an infovore and avid practitioner of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/23/the-zen-of-firehose-drinking\">continuous partial attention</a>, my first impulse is to reach for a firehose and stick my head into the stream.  Relax, defocus, and try to let my pattern recognizers do their thing—sometimes those pattern recognizers are in my head, and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/hgwebdir.cgi/hacking_rss_and_atom/file/f7a85b9fd48a/ch15_popular_links.py\">sometimes they&#39;re written in Python</a>.</p>\n<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_1585&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; caption=&quot;Firefox Victory!&quot;]<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/intothefuzz/2571283860/in/set-72157605179678562/\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/robo-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Firefox Victory Robot\" title=\"firefox-victory\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1585\" /></a>[/caption]</p>\n<p>But, for Mozilla, I couldn&#39;t find a stream of sufficient volume or completeness to satisfy me or <a href=\"http://www.digitpress.com/dpsoundz/destroyhimrobots.wav\">my robots</a>.  Happily, though, my feeding urge found itself aligned with a project to discover the patterns of contribution in the Mozilla community and to find a way to thank the contributors responsible.</p>\n<p>So, while we&#39;re still working on the thank-you angle, allow me to introduce you to <a href=\"http://feeds.mozilla.com/\">the Lizardfeeder</a>.  The <a href=\"http://feeds.mozilla.com/\">LizardFeeder</a> is a feed aggregator, <a href=\"https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/lizardfeeder/trunk/\">whose source code</a> is built atop <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/code/venus/\">Sam Ruby&#39;s Planet Venus</a>. The <a href=\"http://feeds.mozilla.com/\">LizardFeeder</a> pulls together and archives activity streams from a wide variety of Mozilla community sources.  Beyond the usual human-readable pages produced by a <a href=\"http://planet.mozilla.org/\">blog-gathering Planet</a>, the <a href=\"http://feeds.mozilla.com/\">LizardFeeder</a> accumulates <a href=\"http://feeds.mozilla.com/archives/index.json\">statistical and historical data</a> meant for consumption and analysis by robots.</p>\n<p>At present, the only robot navigating the <a href=\"http://feeds.mozilla.com/\">LizardFeeder</a> archives is an AJAX-ified user interface that animates the firehose as a near real-time or time-lapsed stream of events scrolling by.  </p>\n<p>This is just meant as a conversation starter, though.  I&#39;m hoping to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=469838\">gather feedback and find more sources</a>, as well as to entice creative community members to come up with more sophisticated visualizations of this data.  </p>\n<p>So, take a look, <a href=\"http://feeds.mozilla.com/\">check it out</a>, and let me know what you think!</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083355\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb4ef8f72f933b04a27b118070ac538e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">dria</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083355\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-06T01:26:18\">2009-01-06T01:26:18</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Is there a list of what sources are already being read by the LizardFeeder anywhere?

    "body": "[caption id=\"attachment_1582\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"247\" caption=\"The Mozilla Tree\"]<a href=\"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2008/07/29/the-mozilla-tree/\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/moz-tree.jpg\" alt=\"The Mozilla Tree\" title=\"moz-tree\" width=\"247\" height=\"191\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1582\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nBehind Firefox is Mozilla, and behind Mozilla is a community.  And the Mozilla community acts a lot like an ecosystem, which can be visualized [as a kind of living tree][tree]—not to confused with the [mozilla-central tree][mctree].  Oh yeah, and Mozilla is the name of [both a Foundation and a Corporation][mocofo].\r\n\r\nConfused yet?  If not, then we should talk so you can explain it to me, because it all looks pretty tangly and [intertwingled][inter] to me.  Nonetheless, it seems to work, and produces a good chunk of my favorite software and technologies.\r\n\r\nThere are many efforts to track what's going on—including [planets][planet] and [newsletters][about] and [bugzillas][bugzilla] and [wikis][wikis] and [repositories][repos] and [tinderboxen][tinderbox].  Some of these resources report on, or are driven by, the activity occurring in the others.  Some are automated, and others are carefully stitched together by hand.  None offer a full picture of what's going on in the [Mozilla galaxy][galaxy] in a way that's casually comprehensible by a sane human being.\r\n\r\nOf course, that's not a slight against any of these sites or the people maintaining them—extracting an overview from such an organic phenomenon is neither easy nor straightforward.  But, it might be fun to try.\r\n\r\nAs an infovore and avid practitioner of [continuous partial attention][firehose], my first impulse is to reach for a firehose and stick my head into the stream.  Relax, defocus, and try to let my pattern recognizers do their thing—sometimes those pattern recognizers are in my head, and [sometimes they're written in Python][popularlinks].\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1585\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"225\" caption=\"Firefox Victory!\"]<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/intothefuzz/2571283860/in/set-72157605179678562/\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/robo-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Firefox Victory Robot\" title=\"firefox-victory\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1585\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nBut, for Mozilla, I couldn't find a stream of sufficient volume or completeness to satisfy me or [my robots][myrobots].  Happily, though, my feeding urge found itself aligned with a project to discover the patterns of contribution in the Mozilla community and to find a way to thank the contributors responsible.\r\n\r\nSo, while we're still working on the thank-you angle, allow me to introduce you to [the Lizardfeeder][lizardfeeder].  The [LizardFeeder][lizardfeeder] is a feed aggregator, [whose source code][lizardcode] is built atop [Sam Ruby's Planet Venus][venus]. The [LizardFeeder][lizardfeeder] pulls together and archives activity streams from a wide variety of Mozilla community sources.  Beyond the usual human-readable pages produced by a [blog-gathering Planet][planet], the [LizardFeeder][lizardfeeder] accumulates [statistical and historical data][jsondata] meant for consumption and analysis by robots.\r\n\r\nAt present, the only robot navigating the [LizardFeeder][lizardfeeder] archives is an AJAX-ified user interface that animates the firehose as a near real-time or time-lapsed stream of events scrolling by.  \r\n\r\nThis is just meant as a conversation starter, though.  I'm hoping to [gather feedback and find more sources][requests], as well as to entice creative community members to come up with more sophisticated visualizations of this data.  \r\n\r\nSo, take a look, [check it out][lizardfeeder], and let me know what you think!\r\n\r\n[myrobots]: http://www.digitpress.com/dpsoundz/destroyhimrobots.wav\r\n[inter]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity\r\n[mocofo]: http://www.mozilla.org/reorganization/\r\n[mctree]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/mozilla-central\r\n[galaxy]: http://ascher.ca/blog/2008/06/19/whats-mozillas-scope-what-should-it-be/\r\n[popularlinks]: http://decafbad.com/hgwebdir.cgi/hacking_rss_and_atom/file/f7a85b9fd48a/ch15_popular_links.py\r\n[jsondata]: http://feeds.mozilla.com/archives/index.json\r\n[lizardcode]: https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/lizardfeeder/trunk/\r\n[venus]: http://www.intertwingly.net/code/venus/\r\n[lizardfeeder]: http://feeds.mozilla.com/\r\n[firehose]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/23/the-zen-of-firehose-drinking\r\n[tinderbox]: http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=Firefox\r\n[repos]: http://hg.mozilla.org/\r\n[wikis]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/WeeklyUpdates/2009-01-05\r\n[bugzilla]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/\r\n[planet]: http://planet.mozilla.org/\r\n[about]: http://blog.mozilla.com/about_mozilla/\r\n[tree]: http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2008/07/29/the-mozilla-tree/\r\n[requests]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=469838\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083355\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb4ef8f72f933b04a27b118070ac538e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">dria</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083355\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-06T01:26:18\">2009-01-06T01:26:18</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Is there a list of what sources are already being read by the LizardFeeder anywhere?

Apropos of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2007/02/15/thoughts-on-pipes-on-the-web-part-ii\">pipes-via-web ramblings</a> back in February, I&#39;m trying out a few different approaches to pipelining feed content through processor modules.  My original FeedMagick relied on feeding URLs to URLs as parameters.  That, unfortunately, can be mighty cumbersome and inefficient.  So, FeedMagick2 explores a few more approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The first and obvious approach is to chain them together in a single script.  So, I&#39;ve got objects instances that pass content from one to the next.  The thing is, the pipe works in reverse:  The driver script asks the last module in the pipe for content, which then asks the one before it for content, and so on.  At any point along the way, modules can cache the output of previous modules, and refrain from calling up the chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The second way to chain pipelines together is just like the first FeedMagick:  Some pipelines start with fetching a URL.  That can be an original feed, or a URL leading to the output of an antecedent pipeline.  And, oh yeah, most pipelines are run via parameterized URLs, so there&#39;s that bit of handy recursion.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The third way to chain pipelines together is with HTTP POST:  A pipeline can accept feed data via the request body of an HTTP POST, thus allowing antecedent pipelines (or even cURL scripts) to <em>push</em> data into the pipeline rather than getting <em>pulled</em> via URL.  This is kind of like my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/?s=xmlrpc+pipe\">years-old jiggery pokery</a> with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">pipelines via XML-RPC</a>, only much <em>much</em> simpler.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#39;m also poking around at making all of the above available at the command line via PHP-CLI, and I&#39;m having gratuitous fun exploring PEAR to roll my own stripped-down web framework.  I still hate PHP, but I&#39;m at least finding ways to entertain myself while I&#39;m holding my nose.  Of course, I find weird things entertaining.</p>\n<p>And, as a side note, the only reason I&#39;m using PHP is because I&#39;d like to play around with the idea of the de facto WordPress installation requirements standard.  That is:  If you can run WordPress, you can run this.  In reality, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m there, but I&#39;m hoping to get close.  For one, I&#39;m refusing to play with anything older than PHP 5.</p>\n<p>Anyway, play with it, tell me what you think and give me a reason to keep hacking at it.  :)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082761\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jamesv.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c82c72ca4f9eab33a80a7bd839c1ae0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jamesv.org\">jamesv</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082761\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-04-30T11:39:15\">2007-04-30T11:39:15</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Aw man, now I've got to port all the code you wrote while you were here over to this new hotness ;) I really like (and appreciate) the single script approach.</p>\n<p>Is caching at a module level done automatically, or is that something I need to flag in my original call?

    "html": "<p>I&#39;ve been trying to get myself serious about writing and even set up a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/skein/\">personal slush pile for my output</a>.  Then, I found <a href=\"http://ficlets.com/authors/l_m_orchard\">Ficlets</a>, and spewed a few quick starter stories there.  And then... I stopped.  I&#39;m hoping to pick it up again very soon, but I guess that&#39;s the nature of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiasm</a>—it doesn&#39;t just apply to hacking.</p>\n<p>So, here&#39;s something ironic:  I just spent a few hours tonight throwing together a hack for <a href=\"http://ficlets.com/authors/l_m_orchard\">Ficlets</a>.  See, <a href=\"http://ficlets.com/authors/l_m_orchard\">Ficlets</a> runs on original stories, comments, ratings, and sequels and prequels to stories.  You can get an Atom feed of an author&#39;s stories and a feed of comments—but it seems like there&#39;s no way to get notified of prequels and sequels, which are a very gratifying part of the whole shebang.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, check out this RSS feed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/www-bin/ficlets.php?author=l_m_orchard\"><code>http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/www-bin/ficlets.php?author=l_m_orchard</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#39;s a blend of all my stories, comments on my stories, as well as prequels and sequels found for my stories.  Subscribing to that feed will give me updates whenever there&#39;s anything new in all the above.  It&#39;s thrown together using a semi-crazy mix of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick\">FeedMagick</a> package for caching, and some XSL for scraping.  If you&#39;d like a feed like this of your own, just replace <code>l_m_orchard</code> for your own author name in the <code>author</code> parameter.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note, however, that this little service is hosted on my site and may go away at any time for any reason.</strong></p>\n<p>In case you&#39;re interested in what&#39;s under the hood, here&#39;s the quick and dirty XSL that&#39;s behind it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/ficlets.xsl\"><code>http://decafbad.com/2007/04/ficlets.xsl</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This thing&#39;s made possible because the <a href=\"http://ficlets.com/authors/l_m_orchard\">Ficlets</a> feeds are XML, <strong>and so are the XHTML pages happily infested with microformats</strong>.  If they ever go invalid, this scraper breaks.  But, that&#39;s the nature of scrapers, and it works for now.  Oh, and although they provide Atom, this feed is RSS 2.0.  Why?  Because it was easier that way.  I might put some more effort into an Atom feed, but my itch has so far been scratched.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084356\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rss-central.net/megalar\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1869681b309d36e59764f51c7f210406&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rss-central.net/megalar\">megalar</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084356\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-04-05T09:31:48\">2007-04-05T09:31:48</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I had already decided I was gonna grab your FeedMagick source and try to do something with it but this just gives me more incentive as a Ficlets lover.

    "body": "I've been trying to get myself serious about writing and even set up a [personal slush pile for my output](http://decafbad.com/skein/).  Then, I found [Ficlets][], and spewed a few quick starter stories there.  And then... I stopped.  I'm hoping to pick it up again very soon, but I guess that's the nature of my [serial enthusiasm](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast)—it doesn't just apply to hacking.\r\n\r\nSo, here's something ironic:  I just spent a few hours tonight throwing together a hack for [Ficlets][].  See, [Ficlets][] runs on original stories, comments, ratings, and sequels and prequels to stories.  You can get an Atom feed of an author's stories and a feed of comments—but it seems like there's no way to get notified of prequels and sequels, which are a very gratifying part of the whole shebang.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, check out this RSS feed:\r\n\r\n   * [`http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/www-bin/ficlets.php?author=l_m_orchard`](http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/www-bin/ficlets.php?author=l_m_orchard)\r\n\r\nThat's a blend of all my stories, comments on my stories, as well as prequels and sequels found for my stories.  Subscribing to that feed will give me updates whenever there's anything new in all the above.  It's thrown together using a semi-crazy mix of my [FeedMagick][] package for caching, and some XSL for scraping.  If you'd like a feed like this of your own, just replace `l_m_orchard` for your own author name in the `author` parameter.\r\n\r\n**Please note, however, that this little service is hosted on my site and may go away at any time for any reason.**\r\n\r\nIn case you're interested in what's under the hood, here's the quick and dirty XSL that's behind it:\r\n\r\n   * [`http://decafbad.com/2007/04/ficlets.xsl`](http://decafbad.com/2007/04/ficlets.xsl)\r\n\r\nThis thing's made possible because the [Ficlets][] feeds are XML, **and so are the XHTML pages happily infested with microformats**.  If they ever go invalid, this scraper breaks.  But, that's the nature of scrapers, and it works for now.  Oh, and although they provide Atom, this feed is RSS 2.0.  Why?  Because it was easier that way.  I might put some more effort into an Atom feed, but my itch has so far been scratched.\r\n\r\n[FeedMagick]: http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick\r\n[ficlets]: http://ficlets.com/authors/l_m_orchard\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084356\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rss-central.net/megalar\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1869681b309d36e59764f51c7f210406&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rss-central.net/megalar\">megalar</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084356\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-04-05T09:31:48\">2007-04-05T09:31:48</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I had already decided I was gonna grab your FeedMagick source and try to do something with it but this just gives me more incentive as a Ficlets lover.

Perhaps I should write a drupal module.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084471\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084471\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-12T19:01:45\">2007-03-12T19:01:45</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@ian: Hmm, yeah, that does sound like the least complicated way to get outside content pulled into a blog without releasing the blog's login details.

Well, <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo!

Consider an idempotent GET request as a pure function call with no side-effects.  Then, consider a GET request that accepts a URL as a parameter — it&#39;s a nested function call: the outer GET must make an inner GET to fetch the parameter-supplied URL.  Give the inner URL another URL as a parameter, and you&#39;ve got yet another nested function call.  </p>\n<p>But, if you like, ignore the theoretical <a href=\"http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html\">benefits of functional programming</a> — flip the nested function calls inside out and you&#39;ve got a pipe.

    "html": "<p>By way of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/hacking_rss_and_atom/ch15_popular_links.py\">meme tracker</a>, I found something like 15 entries linking to <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo! Pipes</a> from my feed subscriptions.  That&#39;s crazy — I&#39;ve usually never seen more than 3-5 feeds linking to anyone thing, maybe as many as 8 if it&#39;s something <em>really</em> hot.  I read about it over morning coffee and aggregator skimming; I heard about it on <a href=\"http://www.twit.tv/88\">TWiT</a> on the bus to work; I was told all about it in the hallway once I got to work.  <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo! Pipes</a> has been hard to miss. </p>\n<p>With that in mind, it seems weird to me that <em>I</em> didn&#39;t get as excited about the release of <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Pipes</a> as everyone else in my local blogosphere seems to have.  <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Pipes</a> has all the ingredients of something that should <em>really</em> set me off.  Pipes, filters, mashups, RSS, Atom, RDF — (singing) these are a few of my favorite things!  So, what gives?  I&#39;m genuinely worried that I&#39;m sick, depressed, losing it, or otherwise replaced by a pod alien.  Possibly all the above.</p>\n<p>I knew about <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Pipes</a> as an internal project at Yahoo! quite awhile ago — possibly even in my first week or two after <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/24/go-west-young-man\">having joined</a>.  I&#39;m fuzzy on the timing here, but it&#39;s not important.  Someone mentioned it to me at some point, I poked at it a bit from the internal network, and thought it was neat / keen.  My main impression at the time was, &quot;Cool, someone&#39;s doing <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick\">FeedMagick</a>, but done right and with a slick visual layout tool.&quot;  </p>\n<p>Then, I got really busy with del.icio.us and wandered off.  So, the release wasn&#39;t big surprising news to me — my reaction was something like, &quot;Huh, so they did a public release of that?  Nice.&quot;  Clearly I need more caffeine.</p>\n<p>The thing is that the idea of pipes on the web is not itself a new concept to me.  I think my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XmlRpcFilteringPipes</a> seems kinda silly in retrospect, and I&#39;m all about <a href=\"http://207.22.26.166/bytecols/2001-08-15.html\">the Power of the URL-line</a> nowadays — but suffice it to say that I&#39;ve been thinking about pipes on the web since as long ago as 2002 or so.  </p>\n<p>So, while I&#39;m all jaded and apparently incapable of feeling the wonder, this seems to be one of the biggest revelations to people playing with <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo!

    "body": "By way of my [meme tracker][mt], I found something like 15 entries linking to [Yahoo! Pipes][pipes] from my feed subscriptions.  That's crazy — I've usually never seen more than 3-5 feeds linking to anyone thing, maybe as many as 8 if it's something *really* hot.  I read about it over morning coffee and aggregator skimming; I heard about it on [TWiT][] on the bus to work; I was told all about it in the hallway once I got to work.  [Yahoo! Pipes][pipes] has been hard to miss. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, it seems weird to me that *I* didn't get as excited about the release of [Pipes][pipes] as everyone else in my local blogosphere seems to have.  [Pipes][pipes] has all the ingredients of something that should *really* set me off.  Pipes, filters, mashups, RSS, Atom, RDF — (singing) these are a few of my favorite things!  So, what gives?  I'm genuinely worried that I'm sick, depressed, losing it, or otherwise replaced by a pod alien.  Possibly all the above.\r\n\r\nI knew about [Pipes][pipes] as an internal project at Yahoo! quite awhile ago — possibly even in my first week or two after [having joined][joined].  I'm fuzzy on the timing here, but it's not important.  Someone mentioned it to me at some point, I poked at it a bit from the internal network, and thought it was neat / keen.  My main impression at the time was, \"Cool, someone's doing [FeedMagick][], but done right and with a slick visual layout tool.\"  \r\n\r\nThen, I got really busy with del.icio.us and wandered off.  So, the release wasn't big surprising news to me — my reaction was something like, \"Huh, so they did a public release of that?  Nice.\"  Clearly I need more caffeine.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that the idea of pipes on the web is not itself a new concept to me.  I think my [XmlRpcFilteringPipes][xrfp] seems kinda silly in retrospect, and I'm all about [the Power of the URL-line][urlline] nowadays — but suffice it to say that I've been thinking about pipes on the web since as long ago as 2002 or so.  \r\n\r\nSo, while I'm all jaded and apparently incapable of feeling the wonder, this seems to be one of the biggest revelations to people playing with [Yahoo! Pipes][pipes]:\r\n\r\n<i>Pipes?  On the web?  **BRILLIANT!**</i>\r\n\r\nSo, it's not you, it's me.  I think I've got a serious deficit of enthusiasm for what's really a pretty cool thing.  I want to think a bit more about why that is.\r\n\r\n[joined]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/24/go-west-young-man\r\n[twit]: http://www.twit.tv/88\r\n[feedmagick]: http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick\r\n[feedmagick-demo]: http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/\r\n[me]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/01/feedrolls-in-xoxo-from-opml-via-xslt-and-url-line-magic\r\n[urlline]: http://207.22.26.166/bytecols/2001-08-15.html\r\n[xrfp]: http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\r\n[pipes]: http://pipes.yahoo.com/\r\n[mt]: http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/hacking_rss_and_atom/ch15_popular_links.py\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086705\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=390bc3dca83aea14b31f821e51a4400b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Kenneth</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086705\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-02-15T14:06:37\">2007-02-15T14:06:37</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>http://yakubovich.blogspot.com/2007/01/visipipe-visual-version-of-core-utils.html</p>\n\n<p>Might have been buried in all the buzz about Yahoo, but this sounds like a neat idea.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://proessays.com\">Kenneth Writer</a></p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086707\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jeffdaly.wordpress.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f2e613837687c930227127a7b0267dd0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jeffdaly.wordpress.com/\">Jeff Daly</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086707\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-02-16T01:08:54\">2007-02-16T01:08:54</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>You're not alone.

The attention.xml thing... interesting but don't know how it would work with three-panel newsreaders like Bloglines. I'm not necessarily interested in a post just because I skimmed the latest articles in a certain feed. I didn't know before I clicked on the feed name whether I'd be interested in the latest stuff. Much of the time I'm not interested.</p>\n<p>What I'd like to see is some smart recommendation engine that watches how I read, how much time I spend on a certain article display, whether I click through the links it has, and even provides a \"boring\" button like some other commenter suggested so it could do some Bayesian filtering. That's getting far beyond what you've described here but what you're describing is a start on it. </p>\n<p>Another somewhat different issue is that Memeorandum works by limiting itself to a certain very popular and generic set of issues. Once you have one Memeorandum for politics or tech do you need another? Might individual quirks of attention (like the fact that you are interested in Detroit and I am interested in Maui) make sharing individual attention.xmls less useful? I've never really gotten the social sharing bug though so maybe I'm just showing a lack of imagination.</p>\n<p>But just because Memeorandum already exists doesn't mean there isn't a real opportunity. While it's easy to find the hot conversations on politics and tech in the blogosphere, other domains are poorly aggregated and filtered, if at all. I follow mom blogs and feminist blogs and nothing like Memeorandum or digg or reddit exists for those yet there are regularly hot topics that ripple through them. What you describe could be used to build something for those and other domains on the web but is there room for everyone to do it individually? Or will people gravitate to one or a few sites that do a good job of highlighting popular and important conversations in certain well-defined domains?</p>\n<p>These are just my raw thoughts on it... your ideas are inspiring.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085104\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://philwilson.org/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=abb5e982d97d7539860141b7904ba31a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://philwilson.org/blog/\">Phil Wilson</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085104\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-04T16:38:10\">2006-01-04T16:38:10</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Presumably your subscription list needs to be of a certain size before you can start extracting interesting URLs or you'll just have 20 URLs mentioned twice and 50 URLs mentioned once.</p>\n<p>If you were to just read the short head of your popular items list, would this actually be encouraging people to be infovores rather than normal information consumers (where you read or at least skim all of the items in your aggregator)? i.e. the data only starts working for you when you collect enough feeds.

The attention.xml thing... interesting but don't know how it would work with three-panel newsreaders like Bloglines. I'm not necessarily interested in a post just because I skimmed the latest articles in a certain feed. I didn't know before I clicked on the feed name whether I'd be interested in the latest stuff. Much of the time I'm not interested.</p>\n\n<p>What I'd like to see is some smart recommendation engine that watches how I read, how much time I spend on a certain article display, whether I click through the links it has, and even provides a \"boring\" button like some other commenter suggested so it could do some Bayesian filtering. That's getting far beyond what you've described here but what you're describing is a start on it. </p>\n\n<p>Another somewhat different issue is that Memeorandum works by limiting itself to a certain very popular and generic set of issues. Once you have one Memeorandum for politics or tech do you need another? Might individual quirks of attention (like the fact that you are interested in Detroit and I am interested in Maui) make sharing individual attention.xmls less useful? I've never really gotten the social sharing bug though so maybe I'm just showing a lack of imagination.</p>\n\n<p>But just because Memeorandum already exists doesn't mean there isn't a real opportunity. While it's easy to find the hot conversations on politics and tech in the blogosphere, other domains are poorly aggregated and filtered, if at all. I follow mom blogs and feminist blogs and nothing like Memeorandum or digg or reddit exists for those yet there are regularly hot topics that ripple through them. What you describe could be used to build something for those and other domains on the web but is there room for everyone to do it individually? Or will people gravitate to one or a few sites that do a good job of highlighting popular and important conversations in certain well-defined domains?</p>\n\n<p>These are just my raw thoughts on it... your ideas are inspiring.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085104\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://philwilson.org/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=abb5e982d97d7539860141b7904ba31a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://philwilson.org/blog/\">Phil Wilson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085104\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-04T16:38:10\">2006-01-04T16:38:10</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Presumably your subscription list needs to be of a certain size before you can start extracting interesting URLs or you'll just have 20 URLs mentioned twice and 50 URLs mentioned once.</p>\n\n<p>If you were to just read the short head of your popular items list, would this actually be encouraging people to be infovores rather than normal information consumers (where you read or at least skim all of the items in your aggregator)? i.e. the data only starts working for you when you collect enough feeds.

    "html": "<p>Part of the reason this whole <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/10/27/extend.html\">must ignore</a> thing with respect to feeds has me <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/13/feedmagick-the-feed-filter-that-doesnt-know-much-about-feeds\">a bit fired up</a> is because it seems like so few feed processing tools out there embrace this idea.  And because of that, these tools are unfortunately brittle and prone to future shock.</p>\n<p>For example, take <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb\"><code>Syndication.framework</code> on OS X</a>:  Amongst the monkeys and ninjas and pirates and robots, you&#39;ve got your standard <em>title-date-link-description</em> columns with a few other bits for good measure.  But, where&#39;s the data from <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/static/iTunesRSS.html\">iTunes RSS extensions</a>?  Nowhere, gone, lost.  If it was in the feed when <code>Syndication.framework</code> found it, it wasn&#39;t understood and so it wasn&#39;t retained after the parser finished chewing up and spitting the data into that DB table.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/building-a-proper-shared-syndication-feed-foundation\">I&#39;ve written about shared feed processing foundations before</a>, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve totally gotten the idea to gel in my head until now.  Here&#39;s the thing:  If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.  Rather than intrusively breaking apart and recasting feed data into a predetermined data structure, you&#39;ve got to remain hands-off as much as possible.</p>\n<p>This is what I did in <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a>.  This code can subscribe to feeds, poll feed data periodically, and even work out which items in a feed are new—but it punts on everything else by only caring about where a feed starts and ends, and where its individual entries start and end.  <em>The rest is left in its original XML form.</em>  So, if there was data in there for iTunes?  It&#39;s still there, because <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a> didn&#39;t know enough to do anything to it.</p>\n<p>This is the major difference in feed processing model.  <code>Syndication.framework</code> loses information when it encounters things it doesn&#39;t understand.  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a> retains the information, because it leaves things alone when it doesn&#39;t know any better.</p>\n<p>Now, this is not to pick on just <code>Syndication.framework</code>.  Despite the general-sounding name,  this framework is pretty much just around to power <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/\">Safari RSS</a> and not <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/\">iTunes</a> or anything else.  And as I said, pretty much every other feed processing framework and tool works in this manner.  Just about everybody uses a destructive process when they parse and marshal feed data into local-idiom structures.  </p>\n<p>And this destructive process is fine when all you want to do is satisfy a specific purpose—display a few headlines, for example.  But if you&#39;re trying to build general-case feed plumbing, this is unacceptable and untenable.  If most everything in a feed item gets lost as it goes through a pipeline, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/05/the-right-place-for-data-in-your-feed\">we might as well abandon feed extensions entirely in favor of microformats stuffed into the <code>description</code> tag</a>—an idea to which I&#39;m not <em>entirely</em> opposed.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, consider this:  This past summer, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/four-thoughts-on-ms-rss-so-far\">Microsoft released an architectural overview about an OS-wide RSS framework in the upcoming Vista</a>.  Unfortunately, like many RSS and Vista related things from this past summer, all links have evaporated into a redirect to a single developers portal.  I can&#39;t figure out why they didn&#39;t just <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/rss/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/rsssupportinlonghorn.asp\">redirect over to here</a>, which took me a search and a few clicks to rediscover.</p>\n<p>At any rate, there&#39;s one sentence in this overview that gives me hope for RSS as a general service in Windows Vista:  </p>\n<p>&quot;<em>It is also possible to access the item XML for applications that want to perform operations on the XML instead of using the item&#39;s properties.</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>So, dig that.  If it works the way I hope it does, RSS in Vista will take care of the subscriptions for you, poll the feed data, grab new stuff—but then it leaves the data intact for you to process whatever new and unanticipated feed payloads that may arrive.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s how it <em>should</em> work.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084486\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=622a34307765c2f7c1dfdc7345842418&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\">Darren Chamberlain</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-13T15:03:07\">2005-12-13T15:03:07</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n<p>If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.

    "body": "Part of the reason this whole [must ignore][mi] thing with respect to feeds has me [a bit fired up][fir] is because it seems like so few feed processing tools out there embrace this idea.  And because of that, these tools are unfortunately brittle and prone to future shock.\r\n\r\nFor example, take [`Syndication.framework` on OS X][sx]:  Amongst the monkeys and ninjas and pirates and robots, you've got your standard *title-date-link-description* columns with a few other bits for good measure.  But, where's the data from [iTunes RSS extensions][ir]?  Nowhere, gone, lost.  If it was in the feed when `Syndication.framework` found it, it wasn't understood and so it wasn't retained after the parser finished chewing up and spitting the data into that DB table.\r\n\r\n[I've written about shared feed processing foundations before][sf], but I don't think I've totally gotten the idea to gel in my head until now.  Here's the thing:  If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.  Rather than intrusively breaking apart and recasting feed data into a predetermined data structure, you've got to remain hands-off as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThis is what I did in [FeedSpool][fs].  This code can subscribe to feeds, poll feed data periodically, and even work out which items in a feed are new—but it punts on everything else by only caring about where a feed starts and ends, and where its individual entries start and end.  *The rest is left in its original XML form.*  So, if there was data in there for iTunes?  It's still there, because [FeedSpool][fs] didn't know enough to do anything to it.\r\n\r\nThis is the major difference in feed processing model.  `Syndication.framework` loses information when it encounters things it doesn't understand.  [FeedSpool][fs] retains the information, because it leaves things alone when it doesn't know any better.\r\n\r\nNow, this is not to pick on just `Syndication.framework`.  Despite the general-sounding name,  this framework is pretty much just around to power [Safari RSS][sr] and not [iTunes][itp] or anything else.  And as I said, pretty much every other feed processing framework and tool works in this manner.  Just about everybody uses a destructive process when they parse and marshal feed data into local-idiom structures.  \r\n\r\nAnd this destructive process is fine when all you want to do is satisfy a specific purpose—display a few headlines, for example.  But if you're trying to build general-case feed plumbing, this is unacceptable and untenable.  If most everything in a feed item gets lost as it goes through a pipeline, [we might as well abandon feed extensions entirely in favor of microformats stuffed into the `description` tag][fmf]—an idea to which I'm not *entirely* opposed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, consider this:  This past summer, [Microsoft released an architectural overview about an OS-wide RSS framework in the upcoming Vista][ao].  Unfortunately, like many RSS and Vista related things from this past summer, all links have evaporated into a redirect to a single developers portal.  I can't figure out why they didn't just [redirect over to here][he], which took me a search and a few clicks to rediscover.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, there's one sentence in this overview that gives me hope for RSS as a general service in Windows Vista:  \r\n\r\n\"*It is also possible to access the item XML for applications that want to perform operations on the XML instead of using the item's properties.*\"\r\n\r\nSo, dig that.  If it works the way I hope it does, RSS in Vista will take care of the subscriptions for you, poll the feed data, grab new stuff—but then it leaves the data intact for you to process whatever new and unanticipated feed payloads that may arrive.\r\n\r\nThat's how it *should* work.\r\n\r\n[fmf]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/05/the-right-place-for-data-in-your-feed\r\n[itp]: http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/\r\n[fir]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/13/feedmagick-the-feed-filter-that-doesnt-know-much-about-feeds\r\n[sr]: http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/\r\n[he]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/rss/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/rsssupportinlonghorn.asp\r\n[tc]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/integrated/\r\n[ao]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/four-thoughts-on-ms-rss-so-far\r\n[fs]: http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\r\n[ir]: http://phobos.apple.com/static/iTunesRSS.html\r\n[sx]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb\r\n[sf]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/building-a-proper-shared-syndication-feed-foundation\r\n[mi]: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/10/27/extend.html\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084486\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=622a34307765c2f7c1dfdc7345842418&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\">Darren Chamberlain</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-13T15:03:07\">2005-12-13T15:03:07</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n  <p>If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.

But, with respect to their filtering and conversion, check out these feeds:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>http://del.icio.us/rss/deusx</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/RSS0.91</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/RSS1.0</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/RSS2.0</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/ATOM0.3</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you compare these to each other, you'll find information loss and even just plain corruption.  The <code>dc:subject</code> elements encoding del.icio.us tags are gone, even in the RSS-1.0-to-RSS-1.0 transformation.  And somehow, in the Atom version, they managed to jumble up titles and authors.  Granted, my stuff doesn't do <em>conversion</em> yet, but I wouldn't want to do it like this.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't tried it yet, but I'd have to guess that a podcast feed with iTunes and/or Yahoo! Media elements would get mangled in a very nasty way.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084496\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://boston.conman.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bbb1c69b64019a3df907c3545186f907&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://boston.conman.org/\">Sean Conner</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084496\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-13T22:34:35\">2005-12-13T22:34:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Wow, is it <em>really</em> 1985 again?

On the one hand, producing something like XML using &quot;proper&quot; DOM invocations and handwavings seems like the &quot;correct&quot; thing to do.  Yet, on the other hand, using a templating system lets me get down to business much more quickly and with much more clarity and succinct code.  </p>\n<p>Yeah, templates provide a range of flexibility sufficient to aim the barrel at your own toes, while an API like the XML DOM keeps everything on the rails--but sometimes you know where you&#39;re going and don&#39;t need the rails to get you there.  Furthermore, isn&#39;t it possible to make a template system that Does The Right Thing?</p>\n<p>Anyway, it&#39;s rather apparent that I&#39;m solidly in favor of templates:  After all, a book of mine just hit the shelves which is just rife with template-based generation of RSS and Atom feeds.  </p>\n<p>My only issue, really, is that I feel vaguely guilty about it.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084924\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=821395fe70906c8290df7f18ac4ac6cf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">rick</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084924\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T02:27:37\">2005-09-26T02:27:37</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Ruby has the nice Builder module for this (http://builder.rubyforge.org/).

Don&#8217;t do that.\nCheck <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henri Sivonen</a>&#8217;s suggestions just published in his <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/producing-xml/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HOWTO Avoid Being Called a Bozo When Producing XML</a>. Instead of building a DOM, generate SAX events, using the program structure to ensure proper nesting &#8211; or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.\nThe emission of synthesised SAX events can be generalised by writing a datastructure-to-SAX serialiser, so that you can build your data within your language&#8217;s native datastructures prior to outputting it, for maximum comfort. (Of course you serialise piecemeal too, f.ex. by outputting the head of a feed manually, then for each item, building the data structure and immediately serialising it, then emitting the final events to complete the document.)\nDepending on the complexity of the output, you could directly emit the otuput format or feed the events into to an XSLT transform that generates the full-blown thing from an easy to generate document structure. In both cases this can be done with or without the involvement of a serialiser as middle man.\nThere are plenty of ways to make sure that the entire toolchain from one end to the other consists only of steps that conserve well-formedness, and they need not be any less convenient than using templates.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084926\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084926\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:16:35\">2005-09-26T04:16:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.</blockquote>\nAristotle:  Now here's where I think certain templating technologies get interesting, and may Do the Right Thing.  My so-far-favorite templating kit, ZPT, wants well-formed XML as templates--although I think that restriction is unfortunately relaxed as a nod to HTML.  On the other hand, my possibly-new-favorite templating kit, Kid, [demands well-formed XML as templates](http://lesscode.org/projects/kid/wiki/KidFaq#must-templates-be-well-formed-xml).\nIn case you haven't played with them, these two template languages center around the idea that certain attributes on elements define where content provided in a data structure should be inserted / swapped in by the template engine.  The engine handles character encodings and such to ensure that the well-formed template results in a well-formed document.\nDoes this match up with what you say up there?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084928\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084928\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:28:49\">2005-09-26T04:28:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I guess the other thing that bugs me about constructing documents via DOM or via generating SAX events—which I'd first discovered in <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/12/py-xml.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this XML.com article by Uche Ogbuji</a>—is how awkward and removed it is from the view-source XML I've gotten used to hacking around with.

I confess I actually kind of liked <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI.pm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CGI.pm</a> &#8211; because nesting is automatically taken care of without so much typing of end tags, and you can seamlessly weave <code>map</code>s into the code for output loops.\nI have to note though that I used it as a sort of template language in its own right &#8211; I never littered <code>print</code>s all over my code, I kept all the calls in a single place, in fact, usually a single expression. That is also why I find it strange that people create template languages for PHP, which was itself born as a template language. What matters is that the output generation is separate from the processing logic, whether or not the template and the code are in different languages.\nAnyway, I digress.\nWhat I wanted to say is, no, I hadn&#8217;t seen either ZPT or Kid. I had put off reading the lesscode.org article you quoted and went back to it after responding here. Now that I&#8217;ve read it, I admit I&#8217;m intrigued.

Logic and presentation in separate blocks / files / etc.  And then, my take is that if you're going to have your presentation/view separate from the logic/controller, you may as well code the presentation in a form as close to the goal as possible (ie. in XML or HTML, not in s-expressions or the logic implementation idiom)—especially since oftimes you've got separate people or teams working primarily on each.\nI suspect, however, that a templating system like Kid goes quite a ways toward solving the problem of \"gluing strings together\".

Problem is, I haven't gotten much closer now, but I figured I'd at least post a few thoughts and conjure up a vague sketch of the issue.\r\n\r\nYou see, I think it all goes back to [thoughts about which I posted almost three years ago][lazy].  On the one hand, producing something like XML using \"proper\" DOM invocations and handwavings seems like the \"correct\" thing to do.  Yet, on the other hand, using a templating system lets me get down to business much more quickly and with much more clarity and succinct code.  \r\n\r\nYeah, templates provide a range of flexibility sufficient to aim the barrel at your own toes, while an API like the XML DOM keeps everything on the rails--but sometimes you know where you're going and don't need the rails to get you there.  Furthermore, isn't it possible to make a template system that Does The Right Thing?\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's rather apparent that I'm solidly in favor of templates:  After all, a book of mine just hit the shelves which is just rife with template-based generation of RSS and Atom feeds.  \r\n\r\nMy only issue, really, is that I feel vaguely guilty about it.\r\n\r\n[lazy]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/12/13/oooced\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084924\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=821395fe70906c8290df7f18ac4ac6cf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">rick</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084924\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T02:27:37\">2005-09-26T02:27:37</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Ruby has the nice Builder module for this (http://builder.rubyforge.org/).

Don&#8217;t do that.\n\nCheck <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henri Sivonen</a>&#8217;s suggestions just published in his <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/producing-xml/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HOWTO Avoid Being Called a Bozo When Producing XML</a>. Instead of building a DOM, generate SAX events, using the program structure to ensure proper nesting &#8211; or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.\n\nThe emission of synthesised SAX events can be generalised by writing a datastructure-to-SAX serialiser, so that you can build your data within your language&#8217;s native datastructures prior to outputting it, for maximum comfort. (Of course you serialise piecemeal too, f.ex. by outputting the head of a feed manually, then for each item, building the data structure and immediately serialising it, then emitting the final events to complete the document.)\n\nDepending on the complexity of the output, you could directly emit the otuput format or feed the events into to an XSLT transform that generates the full-blown thing from an easy to generate document structure. In both cases this can be done with or without the involvement of a serialiser as middle man.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to make sure that the entire toolchain from one end to the other consists only of steps that conserve well-formedness, and they need not be any less convenient than using templates.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084926\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084926\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:16:35\">2005-09-26T04:16:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.</blockquote>\nAristotle:  Now here's where I think certain templating technologies get interesting, and may Do the Right Thing.  My so-far-favorite templating kit, ZPT, wants well-formed XML as templates--although I think that restriction is unfortunately relaxed as a nod to HTML.  On the other hand, my possibly-new-favorite templating kit, Kid, [demands well-formed XML as templates](http://lesscode.org/projects/kid/wiki/KidFaq#must-templates-be-well-formed-xml).\n\nIn case you haven't played with them, these two template languages center around the idea that certain attributes on elements define where content provided in a data structure should be inserted / swapped in by the template engine.  The engine handles character encodings and such to ensure that the well-formed template results in a well-formed document.\n\nDoes this match up with what you say up there?</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084928\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084928\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:28:49\">2005-09-26T04:28:49</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">I guess the other thing that bugs me about constructing documents via DOM or via generating SAX events—which I'd first discovered in <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/12/py-xml.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this XML.com article by Uche Ogbuji</a>—is how awkward and removed it is from the view-source XML I've gotten used to hacking around with.

Logic and presentation in separate blocks / files / etc.  And then, my take is that if you're going to have your presentation/view separate from the logic/controller, you may as well code the presentation in a form as close to the goal as possible (ie. in XML or HTML, not in s-expressions or the logic implementation idiom)—especially since oftimes you've got separate people or teams working primarily on each.\n\nI suspect, however, that a templating system like Kid goes quite a ways toward solving the problem of \"gluing strings together\".

Your MT installation permitted Markdown but no literal tags, which caught me off guard once or twice until I noticed. But thankfully it had a preview button, so I could figure it out.

Often people want me to switch to templates.

Somehow that strikes me as natural and easy, but many of my users seem to disagree, preferring to learn a templating system instead of learning to write Perl code.  I'm still undecided about the issue.  At the moment I'm still sticking to the \"write Perl code instead of templating\" because being able to write Perl code will make so many other task easy.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084938\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084938\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-27T11:31:23\">2005-09-27T11:31:23</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Alex:  Well, from my perspective, I've worked on a lot of teams where you've essentially got two roles—software engineer (SE) and interface engineer (IE).

But, you'd barely know it, because--for whatever reason--I started off pretty cagey about the whole thing, and then plunged headlong into the effort.  I did manage to make [a quick announcement of authorship][announce], but thereafter only managed to emerge for a few [quick thought dumps][quick].\r\n\r\nI think part of my silence about things stemmed from a reticence to talk about or promise anything before I'd written it--and also because this has been my first time doing anything like this and I didn't want to flub anything up along the way.  How I might've done that, who knows?  But, I got a bit too busy to really worry about superstitions as the deadlines rolled on.\r\n\r\nBut now, it's out!  And [you should buy it!][buy]  Lookee, lookee:  It's already got a 5-star review from someone I don't even know!\r\n\r\nFor the moment, I'm going to wrap up this post, finish my dinner, and go for a walk with the girl--but, when we get back, I think I might post a few more details on what you'll find in my book debut. \r\n\r\n[buy]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1\r\n[announce]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/07/belated-happy-new-year\r\n[quick]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/02/19/writing-no-things-of-epic-import\r\n[dec04]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/12/\r\n[book]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/04/25/hacking-rss-and-atom-is-a-real-book\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082500\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://monkey.org/~jose/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d74863ca9c7785cd396379766095036c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://monkey.org/~jose/\">jose</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082500\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-14T01:03:36\">2005-09-14T01:03:36</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">congrats, les, if anyone should have written that book it's you. i'm glad to see it's hit the shelves .. now to go find a copy and look it over :)</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082501\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://stingthebee.nu\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0c6c4240507baf594a95fd3b25b975d2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://stingthebee.nu\">Jim Renaud</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082501\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-14T01:54:39\">2005-09-14T01:54:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Congrats Les.
