But, the changes seem to have removed most of the\nvalue from the service for me, so I&#39;m moving on as I was invited to\ndo.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"display: block; float: right; text-decoration: none; border: none; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/images/2011/11/Newspaper_Feed_256x256.png\" style=\"width: 256px\" /></span></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-happened\">What happened?</h2>\n<p>Almost a year ago, I wrote about how my habits had gotten\n<a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2010/12/18/less-del-icio-us-than-ever-before\">less del.icio.us</a>. One of the main culprits that stole my sharing\nflow was <a href=\"http://reader.google.com\">Google Reader</a>: I went from using a quick bookmarklet to an\neven quicker icon-click in my feed reader. That meant I left most\nthings <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/untagged/\">untagged</a>, but I shared even more than before. Eventually,\nGoogle Reader released a bookmarklet for use off-site, which\nmeant I started sharing everything everywhere to Reader.</p>\n<p>I also found a replacement for my old del.icio.us network in Google\nReader&#39;s social features. I could follow people, and the stream of\nthings <em>they</em> shared and annotated turned into a great source of\nnews curated and pre-filtered by likeminded people.</p>\n<p>Well, as it turns out, Google&#39;s <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/new-in-reader-fresh-design-and-google.html\">recent changes</a> to Reader just\nremoved all of the above. In exchange, they added a couple of buttons\nto +1 and share items to Google+, which streamlines things for them\nand encourages more use of the new service.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/114487965928288927815/posts/fgscQet4kxh\">As I wrote</a> on Google+, the net result is nothing to stomp and\nshout about, but there&#39;s nothing there that makes me happier. As I\nplayed more, though, I came to realize that most of the value\nI derived from the service had evaporated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"item-centric-vs-people-centric-efficiency-vs-engagement\">Item-centric vs People-centric, Efficiency vs Engagement</h2>\n<p>There&#39;s a big difference between the way sharing happened on Google\nReader, and the way it happens now on Google+. The best way I can\nthink to explain is that the old way was item-centric and the new way\nis people-centric.  In other words, <em>people</em> seem to be the dominant\n<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/jyri/microblogging-tiny-social-objects-on-the-future-of-participatory-media\">social objects</a> in Google+, whereas Google Reader used to treat\n<em>items</em> that way.</p>\n<p>Before, we all gathered around the news. The headline and summary were\nprimary, and our comments were collected after the item. The result\nwas a de-duped stream of great news filtered through smart brains.\nEven if the people I followed never said a word, the fact that they&#39;d\nclicked &quot;share&quot; was value enough. In fact, it was better that\nway most of the time, because we all got out of the way of each other\nand the news.</p>\n<p>This, by the way, is what I loved about del.icio.us and now\n<a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">pinboard.in</a>: It&#39;s anti-social networking. We can provide\nlow-effort, intelligent inputs to build something useful for each\nother, but we&#39;re not there to assert a presence or distract each other\nfrom the things we each came to see.</p>\n<p>But now, that filtered news stream is gone. In its place, on a\ndifferent site entirely, removed from the flow of feeding on news, is\na highly-engaging flood of people babbling away, which occasionally\nincludes repeated shares of things that have bubbled up during the\nday.</p>\n<p>What&#39;s wrong with that, for me?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I don&#39;t want to wade through a heavily-padded, user-friendly flood\nof duplicated, echoed items.</li>\n<li>I don&#39;t want to engage with the people—at least, not when I&#39;m in a\nmood to feed on news. I want to catch up on what&#39;s been put out\ninto the infosphere already, and <em>then</em> start talking about it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The design of Google+—which has spilled over into the Google Reader\nface-lift—is about engagement and not fast &amp; efficient processing of\nthe day&#39;s news. Engagement in general puts a drag on the task—which\nfor me is like a <a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd\">GTD</a>, <a href=\"http://inboxzero.com/\">Inbox Zero</a>, headline skimming, pattern\nrecognition zen thing that might not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea.</p>\n<p>But, for all I know, avowed weirdo and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/10/11/allgrowedup\">info freako</a> that I am,\nthese changes may drive Google Reader growth through the roof for\nmainstream users.  But, it&#39;s no longer a product for me. The changes\nin sharing have removed most of the value for me, because I no longer\nhave the warp speed cruise through news that other people used to\npower for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"circles-point-the-wrong-way\">Circles point the wrong way</h2>\n<p>One of the things <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/100535338638690515335/posts/95ZsWiCG3xS\">Louis Gray touted about the new sharing\nfeatures</a> reads like so:</p>\n<blockquote>In Reader’s previous sharing model, as a follower of your\nitems, I would see every single item you shared, no matter what it was\nabout. Obviously, as I have different interests than you do, not\neverything you shared was something I cared about, which often led to\nreduced sharing of off-topic content. Now, you are more in control, so\nyou can share sports items to your sports circles, great recipes with\nyour foodies circle, or local news to family and friends.

But, the changes seem to have removed most of the\r\nvalue from the service for me, so I'm moving on as I was invited to\r\ndo.</em>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"display: block; float: right; text-decoration: none; border: none; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/images/2011/11/Newspaper_Feed_256x256.png\" style=\"width: 256px\" /></span>\r\n\r\n## What happened?\r\n\r\nAlmost a year ago, I wrote about how my habits had gotten\r\n[less del.icio.us][]. One of the main culprits that stole my sharing\r\nflow was [Google Reader][]: I went from using a quick bookmarklet to an\r\neven quicker icon-click in my feed reader. That meant I left most\r\nthings [untagged][], but I shared even more than before. Eventually,\r\nGoogle Reader released a bookmarklet for use off-site, which\r\nmeant I started sharing everything everywhere to Reader.\r\n\r\n[google reader]: http://reader.google.com\r\n\r\nI also found a replacement for my old del.icio.us network in Google\r\nReader's social features. I could follow people, and the stream of\r\nthings *they* shared and annotated turned into a great source of\r\nnews curated and pre-filtered by likeminded people.\r\n\r\nWell, as it turns out, Google's [recent changes][] to Reader just\r\nremoved all of the above. In exchange, they added a couple of buttons\r\nto +1 and share items to Google+, which streamlines things for them\r\nand encourages more use of the new service.\r\n\r\n[As I wrote][] on Google+, the net result is nothing to stomp and\r\nshout about, but there's nothing there that makes me happier. As I\r\nplayed more, though, I came to realize that most of the value\r\nI derived from the service had evaporated.\r\n\r\n[as i wrote]: https://plus.google.com/114487965928288927815/posts/fgscQet4kxh\r\n[recent changes]: http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/new-in-reader-fresh-design-and-google.html\r\n[less del.icio.us]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2010/12/18/less-del-icio-us-than-ever-before\r\n[untagged]: http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/untagged/\r\n\r\n## Item-centric vs People-centric, Efficiency vs Engagement\r\n\r\nThere's a big difference between the way sharing happened on Google\r\nReader, and the way it happens now on Google+. The best way I can\r\nthink to explain is that the old way was item-centric and the new way\r\nis people-centric.  In other words, *people* seem to be the dominant\r\n[social objects][] in Google+, whereas Google Reader used to treat\r\n*items* that way.\r\n\r\n[social objects]: http://www.slideshare.net/jyri/microblogging-tiny-social-objects-on-the-future-of-participatory-media\r\n\r\nBefore, we all gathered around the news. The headline and summary were\r\nprimary, and our comments were collected after the item. The result\r\nwas a de-duped stream of great news filtered through smart brains.\r\nEven if the people I followed never said a word, the fact that they'd\r\nclicked \"share\" was value enough. In fact, it was better that\r\nway most of the time, because we all got out of the way of each other\r\nand the news.\r\n\r\nThis, by the way, is what I loved about del.icio.us and now\r\n[pinboard.in][]: It's anti-social networking. We can provide\r\nlow-effort, intelligent inputs to build something useful for each\r\nother, but we're not there to assert a presence or distract each other\r\nfrom the things we each came to see.\r\n\r\n[pinboard.in]: http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\r\n\r\nBut now, that filtered news stream is gone. In its place, on a\r\ndifferent site entirely, removed from the flow of feeding on news, is\r\na highly-engaging flood of people babbling away, which occasionally\r\nincludes repeated shares of things that have bubbled up during the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWhat's wrong with that, for me?\r\n\r\n1. I don't want to wade through a heavily-padded, user-friendly flood\r\n   of duplicated, echoed items.\r\n1. I don't want to engage with the people—at least, not when I'm in a\r\n   mood to feed on news. I want to catch up on what's been put out\r\n   into the infosphere already, and *then* start talking about it.\r\n\r\nThe design of Google+—which has spilled over into the Google Reader\r\nface-lift—is about engagement and not fast & efficient processing of\r\nthe day's news. Engagement in general puts a drag on the task—which\r\nfor me is like a [GTD][], [Inbox Zero][], headline skimming, pattern\r\nrecognition zen thing that might not be everyone's cup of tea.\r\n\r\nBut, for all I know, avowed weirdo and [info freako][] that I am,\r\nthese changes may drive Google Reader growth through the roof for\r\nmainstream users.  But, it's no longer a product for me. The changes\r\nin sharing have removed most of the value for me, because I no longer\r\nhave the warp speed cruise through news that other people used to\r\npower for me.\r\n\r\n[gtd]: http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd\r\n[inbox zero]: http://inboxzero.com/\r\n[info freako]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/10/11/allgrowedup\r\n\r\n## Circles point the wrong way\r\n\r\nOne of the things [Louis Gray touted about the new sharing\r\nfeatures][touted] reads like so:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In Reader’s previous sharing model, as a follower of your\r\nitems, I would see every single item you shared, no matter what it was\r\nabout. Obviously, as I have different interests than you do, not\r\neverything you shared was something I cared about, which often led to\r\nreduced sharing of off-topic content. Now, you are more in control, so\r\nyou can share sports items to your sports circles, great recipes with\r\nyour foodies circle, or local news to family and friends. You can keep\r\nsharing, like you always have, but now, you can better select who sees\r\nwhat.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n[touted]: https://plus.google.com/100535338638690515335/posts/95ZsWiCG3xS\r\n\r\nBut, for this purpose, Circles point the wrong way.\r\n\r\nCircles on Google+ are lists of people controlled by me.

RSS doesn't work that way and it's better for it.\r\n\r\n* Letting me and others filter for what gets sent to specific Circles -\r\n  eg. I'm in both your \"scifi\" and \"politics\" circles, but just show\r\n  me what you sent to your \"scifi\" circle.\r\n\r\nGoogle Reader didn't have this to begin with, but what I'm looking for\r\nis an equivalent to tagging on [pinboard.in][].

No unread counts, no 3-pane view like an email client. Just paddle down the page with the space bar or your scroll wheel. \r\n\r\nOrganize the Live Bookmarks into folders to split things up into multiple rivers—which is not a strict River of News, per se. But, I like using them to focus on particular topics or priorities I happen to have time for.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-26-at-8.55.46-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen shot 2011-01-26 at 8.55.46 PM.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"475\" />\r\n\r\nIt also displays a more obvious notification when a site has a feed and lets you add a new Live Bookmark subscription to the Fireriver folder with one click. (I'm considering splitting this feature off into its own small add-on.)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/firefiver-notify.png\" alt=\"Fireriver notification\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"415\" />\r\n\r\nOf course, when I say **experimental**, I mean that *this is my first Firefox add-on ever*.

    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>Browsers need help doing a better job using feeds for discovery, aggregation, and publishing on the web to keep us from swimming into self-destructing lobster traps.</em></p>\n<p>Last week, I wrote <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967\">some blog posts</a> about <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967\">Bug 578967</a>, wherein the feed auto-discovery icon in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">Firefox 4</a> has been moved off the URL bar and hidden by default. I support that decision of <a href=\"http://planet.firefox.com/ux/\">the UX team</a>, because <a href=\"https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/\">that feed button is a slacker</a>. And even if it does get used, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/what-happened-to-feed-autodiscovery-in-firefox-4#serving\">I&#39;m not a fan of what it does anyway</a>.</p>\n<p>But, I&#39;ve got lots more rattling around in my head about this stuff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-the-point-of-feeds\">What&#39;s the point of feeds?</h3>\n<p>Feeds—that&#39;s RSS and Atom and maybe even JSON—let robots pull lots of stuff from a bunch of places and pile it all together in one spot for your perusal, analysis, and remixing pleasure. Feed readers and news aggregators do the surfing for you, so you don&#39;t have to.</p>\n<p>But, Twitter and Facebook and others have managed to make <em>the people themselves</em> all gather in one spot. So, to see what those people are saying and doing, you just have to go <em>there</em>—kind of like what feeds promised, right? Only, you go <em>there</em> rather than all that stuff coming <em>here</em>.</p>\n<p>The problem is, even if the logo says it <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dunstan/524137648/\">loves you</a>, the people who made it say that <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/\">won&#39;t always stay in charge</a>. And, someday, when whomever&#39;s left rides off into the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/\">sunset</a>, you&#39;ll learn how much <a href=\"http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Why_Back_Up%3F\">they didn&#39;t care about you</a> in the end.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/herzogbr/2261662706/\" title=\"Flickr Loves You by herzogbr, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2003/2261662706_db086ea4bb_m.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"64\" alt=\"Flickr Loves You\" /></a> <strong style=\"font-size: 200%; padding: 0.5em;\">vs</strong> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/en-us/flickr-yahoo-logo.png\" height=\"50\" style=\"padding: 7px; background: #fff\"></a></p>\n\n<p>For some people and some places, that&#39;s no big tragedy. It&#39;s just a party; you go home when it&#39;s over. You made memories, you hope to find some of those people again elsewhere. <a href=\"http://blog.pownce.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-hello-six-apart/\">Pownce croaked</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/09/six-apart-shuts-down-vox/\">so did Vox</a>, but who cares? There&#39;s always Twitter next door for the afterparty.</p>\n<p>But, what if a world you lived in <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2444\">evaporated while you were on vacation elsewhere for the holidays</a>? I guess you could say that was just a game and, again, who cares?</p>\n<p>What if <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a> went away just like that? People are not only partying there—they&#39;re leaving their visual memories at the coat check. Things are a little more real there, by some definitions thereof.</p>\n<p>What if you never swam into that <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848\">lobster trap</a>, though? What if your words and images and creations were borrowed and copied, but never wholly kept in someone else&#39;s bucket? What if <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a> were just like <a href=\"http://google.com\">Google Search</a>? That is, a collector and an index—but never the host—of photos and conversations?</p>\n<p>Feeds can help make that happen, but not by themselves.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-feeds-belong-in-the-browser\">Do feeds belong in the browser?</h3>\n<p>Well, yeah. Would sites like Twitter and Facebook have been as successful if feeds worked better in the browser? I think so. But, by working better, I don&#39;t just mean improvements to that funky blue thing that showed up in the location bar every now and then. No, I mean all of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Discovery</strong> — help me find and follow interesting people and things</li>\n<li><strong>Aggregation</strong> — give me one spot where what I find and follow is delivered to me</li>\n<li><strong>Publishing</strong> — enable me to post things where people (and their agents) can find and follow</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To me, this is where Twitter and Facebook are totally nailing it. But, much of this can happen in the browser, and I think more of it should. Projects like <a href=\"http://www.rockmelt.com/\">RockMelt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flock.com/\">Flock</a> have seemed promising to me in this context, but have yet to really thrill me. I don&#39;t think they go far enough.</p>\n<p>There is a point where the rubber (client) meets the road (server)—but that point can live <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/howToShareABucketOnS3.html\">so much farther down the stack than it does now</a>. Mind you, I don&#39;t want a revival of <a href=\"http://www.zisman.ca/netgold/\">Netscape Gold</a> as such—but recall that <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm\">&quot;the first browser was an editor, it was a writer as well as a reader&quot;</a>.</p>\n<p>We need some services and hosts out there as rendezvous points for our browsers and agents, but we really don&#39;t need any of those services to collapse into <a href=\"http://buddycloud.com/cms/content/we-are-aol-days-social-networking\">the next all-encompassing AOL-style singularity</a>. There&#39;s money to be made there, but most of us are the product.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whose-job-is-it-anyway\">Whose job is it anyway?</h3>\n<p>I&#39;d like to see my employer, Mozilla, do more with feeds in the browser—and I suspect we will. <a href=\"http://mozillalabs.com/blog/2010/03/online-identity-concept-series/\">Mozilla Labs has had some interesting Concept Series topics</a>, and I look forward to seeing some of those things get pursued further. If I can carve out the time, I wouldn&#39;t mind helping.</p>\n<p>Something I find interesting about feed auto-discovery—the thing that started this latest round of buzz—is that it didn&#39;t originate with browser makers. <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery\">RSS auto-discovery</a> was itself discovered <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/31/oooago\">by bloggers</a>, way back in 2002. It wasn&#39;t until we sussed out the details of that <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links\">HTML link tag</a> and shoved it into our pages that browsers like Firefox started looking for it.</p>\n<p>Hell, even though <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss#History\">RSS started with Netscape</a>, it took <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss.html\">Dave Winer and UserLand and friends running with it</a> to keep it alive and kicking. Now, Dave&#39;s <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/krocCamenProvesRssIsVeryMu.html\">suggested forking an open source browser</a> to show Mozilla how it&#39;s done. I support the sentiment, but there are easier ways to go about this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"making-it-your-job\">Making it your job</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply\">Christopher Blizzard</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>We created add-ons with the original Firefox as a way to be able to say “no” in a constructive manner. If you want something that you think is important to you, you can make an add-on.</blockquote>\n\n<p>That could be taken as a cop-out, but it&#39;s not. With the efforts behind <a href=\"https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/\">Jetpack</a>—now just <em>the</em> <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/12/09/announcing-add-on-sdk-1-0b1/\">Add-on SDK</a>—building add-ons for Firefox is being made easier. Rather than dealing with a morass of XUL and obscure APIs that I know has scared me personally away all these years, you can now do most everything you&#39;d like though <a href=\"https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/sdk/1.0b1/docs/#package/addon-kit\">much-simplified JavaScript APIs</a> and HTML/CSS.</p>\n<p>In other words, if you are a web developer—albeit a fairly advanced one—you can make an add-on for Firefox. Hopefully, as the Add-on SDK advances, the bar to participation will continue to drop.</p>\n<h3 id=\"to-be-continued\">To be continued</h3>\n<p>I&#39;m running out of steam and it&#39;s time for bed, so I think I&#39;ll just trail off for now. I do have a bit more in me, though. The next thing is about taking my own advice in that last section and making some of this <em>my</em> job to fix.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086137\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=52674e2ce2d7671878b26ed534b0c662&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Majken \"Lucy\" Connor</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T06:38:04\">2011-01-27T06:38:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Yay!</p>\n<p>Feeds are soo soo soooo great, but not as live bookmarks. Google Reader is the place to be in terms of functionality, but there's no reason I have to put everything through google.</p>\n<p>When I find a site I like, why should I have to go to it to check for new content? A feed reader brings it to <em>me</em> AND it remembers where I was. I've been trying to get my kids hooked on it, though they seem to forget about it.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the kids, their teachers are getting all technical and they post the homework online, but I've been pulling my hair out for 2 years trying to get them to do it in a way that enables feeds. Several nights it happened that they didn't write down what they had and then we had to remember to check periodically because the homework wasn't updated right away.  </p>\n<p>Right now they're sent home with books with it all written down and I'm supposed to sign that I saw it, but who remembers to look at a book all the time? It's such a complicated process - kids have to write it down in the first place, then one of us has to remember to show it to me. FEEDS!!! No one has to remember, it just shows up where I'm already looking!</p>\n<p>So glad you're on board.</p></div>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086159\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086159\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T20:54:22\">2011-01-27T20:54:22</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Not sure if the homework lists online are behind a login or not, but if it's in HTML we can hack a feed out of it :)</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086141\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=adfd6aa4efe2aa64f5e091abf07f2766&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Bee</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086141\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T08:13:46\">2011-01-27T08:13:46</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>\"Discovery — help me find and follow interesting people and things\nAggregation — give me one spot where what I find and follow is delivered to me\nPublishing — enable me to post things where people (and their agents) can find and follow\"\n..

Not every P is online at all times, so we need store-and-forward services. Some P's have multiple devices and agents, and most of those are behind firewalls and NAT.

Or, at least, finding someone to run it for you who cares about keeping it up, whether through direct payment or other direct incentive (ie. they're family or friends). Otherwise, you still have the problem where what they care about doesn't match what you care about (eg. ad supported services).\n</p><p>But, with the way the user agent picture is splitting up across devices (eg. the cloud, ambient computing), I don't think Firefox will ever be the server.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>Browsers need help doing a better job using feeds for discovery, aggregation, and publishing on the web to keep us from swimming into self-destructing lobster traps.</em>\r\n\r\nLast week, I wrote [some blog posts](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discovery icon in [Firefox 4](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been moved off the URL bar and hidden by default. I support that decision of [the UX team](http://planet.firefox.com/ux/), because [that feed button is a slacker](https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/). And even if it does get used, [I'm not a fan of what it does anyway](http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/what-happened-to-feed-autodiscovery-in-firefox-4#serving).\r\n\r\nBut, I've got lots more rattling around in my head about this stuff.\r\n\r\n### What's the point of feeds?\r\n\r\nFeeds—that's RSS and Atom and maybe even JSON—let robots pull lots of stuff from a bunch of places and pile it all together in one spot for your perusal, analysis, and remixing pleasure. Feed readers and news aggregators do the surfing for you, so you don't have to.\r\n\r\nBut, Twitter and Facebook and others have managed to make *the people themselves* all gather in one spot. So, to see what those people are saying and doing, you just have to go *there*—kind of like what feeds promised, right? Only, you go *there* rather than all that stuff coming *here*.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, even if the logo says it [loves you](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dunstan/524137648/), the people who made it say that [won't always stay in charge](http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/). And, someday, when whomever's left rides off into the [sunset](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/), you'll learn how much [they didn't care about you](http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Why_Back_Up%3F) in the end.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/herzogbr/2261662706/\" title=\"Flickr Loves You by herzogbr, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2003/2261662706_db086ea4bb_m.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"64\" alt=\"Flickr Loves You\" /></a> <strong style=\"font-size: 200%; padding: 0.5em;\">vs</strong> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/en-us/flickr-yahoo-logo.png\" height=\"50\" style=\"padding: 7px; background: #fff\"></a></p>\r\n\r\nFor some people and some places, that's no big tragedy. It's just a party; you go home when it's over. You made memories, you hope to find some of those people again elsewhere. [Pownce croaked](http://blog.pownce.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-hello-six-apart/), and [so did Vox](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/09/six-apart-shuts-down-vox/), but who cares? There's always Twitter next door for the afterparty.\r\n\r\nBut, what if a world you lived in [evaporated while you were on vacation elsewhere for the holidays](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2444)? I guess you could say that was just a game and, again, who cares?\r\n\r\nWhat if [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) went away just like that? People are not only partying there—they're leaving their visual memories at the coat check. Things are a little more real there, by some definitions thereof.\r\n\r\nWhat if you never swam into that [lobster trap](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848), though? What if your words and images and creations were borrowed and copied, but never wholly kept in someone else's bucket? What if [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) were just like [Google Search](http://google.com)? That is, a collector and an index—but never the host—of photos and conversations?\r\n\r\nFeeds can help make that happen, but not by themselves.\r\n\r\n### Do feeds belong in the browser?\r\n\r\nWell, yeah. Would sites like Twitter and Facebook have been as successful if feeds worked better in the browser? I think so. But, by working better, I don't just mean improvements to that funky blue thing that showed up in the location bar every now and then. No, I mean all of the following:\r\n\r\n* **Discovery** — help me find and follow interesting people and things\r\n* **Aggregation** — give me one spot where what I find and follow is delivered to me\r\n* **Publishing** — enable me to post things where people (and their agents) can find and follow\r\n\r\nTo me, this is where Twitter and Facebook are totally nailing it. But, much of this can happen in the browser, and I think more of it should. Projects like [RockMelt](http://www.rockmelt.com/) and [Flock](http://www.flock.com/) have seemed promising to me in this context, but have yet to really thrill me. I don't think they go far enough.\r\n\r\nThere is a point where the rubber (client) meets the road (server)—but that point can live [so much farther down the stack than it does now](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/howToShareABucketOnS3.html). Mind you, I don't want a revival of [Netscape Gold](http://www.zisman.ca/netgold/) as such—but recall that [\"the first browser was an editor, it was a writer as well as a reader\"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm).\r\n\r\nWe need some services and hosts out there as rendezvous points for our browsers and agents, but we really don't need any of those services to collapse into [the next all-encompassing AOL-style singularity](http://buddycloud.com/cms/content/we-are-aol-days-social-networking). There's money to be made there, but most of us are the product.\r\n\r\n### Whose job is it anyway?\r\n\r\nI'd like to see my employer, Mozilla, do more with feeds in the browser—and I suspect we will. [Mozilla Labs has had some interesting Concept Series topics](http://mozillalabs.com/blog/2010/03/online-identity-concept-series/), and I look forward to seeing some of those things get pursued further. If I can carve out the time, I wouldn't mind helping.\r\n\r\nSomething I find interesting about feed auto-discovery—the thing that started this latest round of buzz—is that it didn't originate with browser makers. [RSS auto-discovery](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery) was itself discovered [by bloggers](http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/31/oooago), way back in 2002. It wasn't until we sussed out the details of that [HTML link tag](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links) and shoved it into our pages that browsers like Firefox started looking for it.\r\n\r\nHell, even though [RSS started with Netscape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss#History), it took [Dave Winer and UserLand and friends running with it](http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss.html) to keep it alive and kicking. Now, Dave's [suggested forking an open source browser](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/krocCamenProvesRssIsVeryMu.html) to show Mozilla how it's done. I support the sentiment, but there are easier ways to go about this.\r\n\r\n### Making it your job\r\n\r\n[Christopher Blizzard](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply):\r\n<blockquote>We created add-ons with the original Firefox as a way to be able to say “no” in a constructive manner. If you want something that you think is important to you, you can make an add-on.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat could be taken as a cop-out, but it's not. With the efforts behind [Jetpack](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/)—now just *the* [Add-on SDK](http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/12/09/announcing-add-on-sdk-1-0b1/)—building add-ons for Firefox is being made easier. Rather than dealing with a morass of XUL and obscure APIs that I know has scared me personally away all these years, you can now do most everything you'd like though [much-simplified JavaScript APIs](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/sdk/1.0b1/docs/#package/addon-kit) and HTML/CSS.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if you are a web developer—albeit a fairly advanced one—you can make an add-on for Firefox. Hopefully, as the Add-on SDK advances, the bar to participation will continue to drop.\r\n\r\n### To be continued\r\n\r\nI'm running out of steam and it's time for bed, so I think I'll just trail off for now. I do have a bit more in me, though. The next thing is about taking my own advice in that last section and making some of this *my* job to fix.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086137\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=52674e2ce2d7671878b26ed534b0c662&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Majken \"Lucy\" Connor</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T06:38:04\">2011-01-27T06:38:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Yay!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feeds are soo soo soooo great, but not as live bookmarks.

Whats your opinion on FF (and other browsers) handling of the direct feed url?\r\nI've long wanted browsers to back off from forcing their own baked-in handling (stylesheets, functionality etc).\r\nI've just wanted the simple alert dialog (now standardized for all alerts like geolocation, passwords etc) to appear when necessary before the browser takes over (Like you include with Fireriver auto-discovery).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The obvious example is when a feed specifies its own XSL stylesheet but FF ignores this instruction and the sniffer only cares about the presence of the &lt;rss or &lt;feed element before treating this &#039;document&#039; differently than any other XML document.  This can be overcome with some hacks but that is a moot point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally, the browser will adhere to the content publisher&#039;s (or feed generator&#039;s) instructions on how to handle the presentation of the data.  That plus XSLT is a W3C standard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Definitely interested in your thoughts on this angle of the &quot;feeds in browser&quot; discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sull</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086158\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086158\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T20:52:52\">2011-01-27T20:52:52</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/02/firefox-20-breaks-client-side-xsl-for-rss-and-atom-feeds\" rel=\"nofollow\">I'm not a fan of the built-in stylesheet for feeds</a>.

You send a message to a server, which then sends it to their server, and eventually their mail client picks it up. There are intermediaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BitTorrent relies on trackers (ie. rendezvous points) before you can start transferring chunks, though the distributed hash stuff helps get away from that. But, if all that were easy (including discovery), it would have taken off long, long ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can't go P2P for everything, at least not easily. Not every P is online at all times, so we need store-and-forward services. Some P's have multiple devices and agents, and most of those are behind firewalls and NAT. So, we need servers out there as accessible fixed points that are (mostly) always available. We can try to build P2P meshes that do the same thing, but servers are simpler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, yeah, I do believe that running your own server is the ultimate solution. Or, at least, finding someone to run it for you who cares about keeping it up, whether through direct payment or other direct incentive (ie. they're family or friends). Otherwise, you still have the problem where what they care about doesn't match what you care about (eg. ad supported services).\r\n</p><p>But, with the way the user agent picture is splitting up across devices (eg. the cloud, ambient computing), I don't think Firefox will ever be the server. Even if you connect user agents together with something like Jabber/XMPP, you still need a server out there—though at least that's pushing things in the right direction, since an XMPP server can be agnostic about the messages that go through it</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do have another blog post rattling around in my head about hosting.

This post discusses how you can still use feed auto-discovery, even restoring the icon to the toolbar with a few clicks and a drag.</em></p>\n<p>There&#39;s <a href=\"http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply\">a brouhaha</a> about <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967\">Bug 578967</a>, wherein the feed auto-discover icon in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a> has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, <em>and</em> a Mozilla employee—I&#39;ve got at least a few opinions.</p>\n<p>This post is one of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967\">several on this subject</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feeds-are-too-ubiquitous-to-need-an-indicator\">Feeds are too ubiquitous to need an indicator</h3>\n<p>Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it&#39;s simpler to assume every site has one, rather than keeping an un-lit indicator around to tell you when one&#39;s missing. So, Firefox 4 has an option in the bookmark menu to subscribe to the current page:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-002.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-00.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\n\n<p>The only indicator of a missing feed is that the menu item greys out. Since feeds are everywhere, you should feel comfortable reaching for that subscription menu whenever you like. Of course, this assumes that subscribing to a page falls into the same thought process as bookmarking it—but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an unreasonable notion.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you didn&#39;t know that subscribing to a page was possible—or if you worry there might be people (ie. the potential readers of your feeds) who are in that position—this change may seem problematic. </p>\n<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an unreasonable notion, either. But, I&#39;ll get back to that in a future post.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-feed-icon-isnt-dead-its-just-hiding\">The feed icon isn&#39;t dead, it&#39;s just hiding</h3>\n<p>Even with the new bookmark menu item, the feed subscription button is still available and ready to return to your toolbar in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a>.</p>\n<p>First, right-click somewhere in the empty space of your Firefox 4 toolbar. Try somewhere after the tabs, or somewhere between the toolbar buttons. <a href=\"http://blog.fligtar.com/2011/01/16/how-to-customize-firefox-4s-ui/\">This is how it works on Windows</a>, and this is what it looks like on my Mac:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"220\" height=\"161\" />\n\n<p>Click Customize, and you&#39;ll get a panel like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-01.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\n\n<p>This lets you customize which buttons and controls appear on the toolbar. If you scroll down in the panel, you&#39;ll see a &quot;<strong>Subscribe</strong>&quot; button. Drag that from the panel to a position in the toolbar, and you&#39;ll get a result like this:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-02.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-02.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\n\n<p>Click &quot;<strong>Done</strong>&quot;, and your browser should end up like this:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-03.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-03.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"203\" />\n\n<p>I took my browser screenshots with <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/15/mozillaPleaseKeepTheRssIco.html\">Dave Winer&#39;s screenshot of the old Firefox feed icon</a> for comparison. The result is different, but not radically so. It even enables and darkens when you visit a site with a feed:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-04.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-04.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"271\" />\n\n<p>The main difference is that Dave&#39;s screenshot is the default in Firefox 3.6, whereas mine is the result of the last few screenshots of toolbar customization in Firefox 4 beta 9. That customization is easy, if you know it&#39;s possible—but the worry is, as they say: out of sight, out of mind. </p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082410\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e0ad94a966cfab0b02d938e4bf9cd1c1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\">Felix Pleșoianu</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082410\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T08:00:44\">2011-01-16T08:00:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I have to take issue with some of your points, based on my personal experience. :)</p>\n<p>\"Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it’s simpler to assume every site has one,\"</p>\n<p>Um, no. I follow a hundred webcomics, and while the situation has gotten better recently, many of them still don't have a feed. That's not unique to webcomics, either. Lack of a newsfeed is common enough that being able to tell at first glace is very useful. Heck, many people, even website owners, are ignorant of RSS. More about that in a moment.</p>\n<p>Besides, the feed button serves a second purpose, which is to allow easy access to the feed. Just as I don't want to hunt for an \"RSS\" or \"XML\" link inside the website, I don't want to hunt for it in the browser's interface.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, many people still don't know about RSS. That big prominent orange icon is a big auto-discovery feature, not just in the technical sense, but also because a newbie could see it and click it out of curiosity, and thus learn about feeds. I had to explain what RSS is to someone whose browser didn't have one, and that proved to be quite difficult.</p>\n<p>Of course, all this talk is for nothing as the decision has already been made but, you know.

This could make it a lot easier to work with semi-social sites like del.icio.us and Bloglines.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>The feed button is not dead; it's just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it's not pulling its weight up front. This post discusses how you can still use feed auto-discovery, even restoring the icon to the toolbar with a few clicks and a drag.</em>\r\n\r\nThere's [a brouhaha](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discover icon in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, *and* a Mozilla employee—I've got at least a few opinions.\r\n\r\nThis post is one of [several on this subject](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967).\r\n\r\n### Feeds are too ubiquitous to need an indicator\r\n\r\nFeeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it's simpler to assume every site has one, rather than keeping an un-lit indicator around to tell you when one's missing. So, Firefox 4 has an option in the bookmark menu to subscribe to the current page:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-002.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-00.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\r\n\r\nThe only indicator of a missing feed is that the menu item greys out. Since feeds are everywhere, you should feel comfortable reaching for that subscription menu whenever you like. Of course, this assumes that subscribing to a page falls into the same thought process as bookmarking it—but I don't think that's an unreasonable notion.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you didn't know that subscribing to a page was possible—or if you worry there might be people (ie. the potential readers of your feeds) who are in that position—this change may seem problematic. \r\n\r\nI don't think that's an unreasonable notion, either. But, I'll get back to that in a future post.\r\n\r\n### The feed icon isn't dead, it's just hiding\r\n\r\nEven with the new bookmark menu item, the feed subscription button is still available and ready to return to your toolbar in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/).\r\n\r\nFirst, right-click somewhere in the empty space of your Firefox 4 toolbar. Try somewhere after the tabs, or somewhere between the toolbar buttons. [This is how it works on Windows](http://blog.fligtar.com/2011/01/16/how-to-customize-firefox-4s-ui/), and this is what it looks like on my Mac:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"220\" height=\"161\" />\r\n\r\nClick Customize, and you'll get a panel like this:\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-01.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThis lets you customize which buttons and controls appear on the toolbar. If you scroll down in the panel, you'll see a \"**Subscribe**\" button. Drag that from the panel to a position in the toolbar, and you'll get a result like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-02.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-02.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\r\n\r\nClick \"**Done**\", and your browser should end up like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-03.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-03.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"203\" />\r\n\r\nI took my browser screenshots with [Dave Winer's screenshot of the old Firefox feed icon](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/15/mozillaPleaseKeepTheRssIco.html) for comparison. The result is different, but not radically so. It even enables and darkens when you visit a site with a feed:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-04.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-04.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"271\" />\r\n\r\nThe main difference is that Dave's screenshot is the default in Firefox 3.6, whereas mine is the result of the last few screenshots of toolbar customization in Firefox 4 beta 9. That customization is easy, if you know it's possible—but the worry is, as they say: out of sight, out of mind. \r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082410\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e0ad94a966cfab0b02d938e4bf9cd1c1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\">Felix Pleșoianu</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082410\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T08:00:44\">2011-01-16T08:00:44</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I have to take issue with some of your points, based on my personal experience. :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it’s simpler to assume every site has one,\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Um, no. I follow a hundred webcomics, and while the situation has gotten better recently, many of them still don't have a feed. That's not unique to webcomics, either. Lack of a newsfeed is common enough that being able to tell at first glace is very useful. Heck, many people, even website owners, are ignorant of RSS. More about that in a moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, the feed button serves a second purpose, which is to allow easy access to the feed. Just as I don't want to hunt for an \"RSS\" or \"XML\" link inside the website, I don't want to hunt for it in the browser's interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, many people still don't know about RSS. That big prominent orange icon is a big auto-discovery feature, not just in the technical sense, but also because a newbie could see it and click it out of curiosity, and thus learn about feeds. I had to explain what RSS is to someone whose browser didn't have one, and that proved to be quite difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, all this talk is for nothing as the decision has already been made but, you know.

A built-in HTTP server would be a good start (is there one yet?), plus support for (say) Atom protocol for shoving data out. This could make it a lot easier to work with semi-social sites like del.icio.us and Bloglines. It's notable that these kind of tools have traditionally been very server-driven, with browsers playing (limited) catch up with plugins.

    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>The feed button is not dead; it&#39;s just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it&#39;s not pulling its weight. This post talks about why things have changed.</em></p>\n<p>There&#39;s <a href=\"http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply\">a brouhaha</a> about <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967\">Bug 578967</a>, wherein the feed auto-discover icon in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a> has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, <em>and</em> a Mozilla employee—I&#39;ve got at least a few opinions.</p>\n<p>This post is one of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967\">several on this subject</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defaults-are-hard-to-pare-down\">Defaults are hard to pare down</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/how-to-use-feed-auto-discovery-in-firefox-4\">feed icon still lives</a> in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a>; it&#39;s just not there by default any more. But, if you look at the controls available in <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png\">the toolbar customization panel</a>, you&#39;ll notice a <em>lot</em> of things that don&#39;t show up by default—there are a lot of things in there, period.</p>\n<p>This is the dilemma for <a href=\"http://planet.firefox.com/ux/\">the Firefox User Experience team at Mozilla</a>: Like it or not, one of the main themes of this next generation of browsers is minimalism—faster, smaller, less browser to get in the way of what you&#39;re browsing. Yet, at the same time, Firefox 4 has the features of Firefox 3.6 and more.</p>\n<p>You can&#39;t just cram it all in there, so what gets prime real estate by default? People say it&#39;s just a few pixels, that feed button—but is it so much more important than anything else that could go there? And before you answer, consider that not just for your personal use, but for the 100&#39;s of millions of people using Firefox. How do you check your own biases and make a decision on that scale? You could make an educated guess, make a gut check. A lot of brilliant design happens that way.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/\">gather some telemetry from beta installs to see what people really use</a>. Looking at a heatmap of clicks, the feed button is an absolute stinker. This isn&#39;t a random whim of the UX team—seriously, it&#39;s an <strong>order of magnitude</strong> less used than anything else in the toolbar (notice the one black spot):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/heatmap.png\" alt=\"heatmap.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"75\" /></a></p>\n<p>There have been comments dismissing the validity of that heatmap study. But, as far as I can tell, none of them really stick. So, for the sake of argument and a shorter blog post, let&#39;s assume barely anyone is using the feed icon and that it&#39;s not pulling its weight in this new age of browser minimalism.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that Firefox isn&#39;t the only browser to deprioritize the feed button: <em>Google Chrome doesn&#39;t even have a feed button at all</em>, and for many people that&#39;s the gold standard for minimal browser UI:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-chrome.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-chrome.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\n\n<p><a name=\"serving\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"serving-the-users\">Serving the users</h3>\n<p>Let&#39;s hammer on the point of disuse some more—what&#39;s the payoff for clicking that thing, anyway?</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-styling.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-styling.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" />\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>+1 — You get an option to create a <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/livebookmarks.html\">Live Bookmark</a>, which is really handy for things like Bugzilla searches or light headline reading. (I like those so much that I tried building them on the server at Delicious once, but we never quite worked it out at scale.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>0 — You get a list of sites to which Firefox will delegate subscription, if you happen to have <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM:window.navigator.registerContentHandler\">installed a content handler</a>. Useful if you know what it&#39;s about; a mystery if you don&#39;t—not much more useful than a bookmarklet, to me.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>-1 — You get a plainly-styled version of what you were probably already looking at on a site, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/02/firefox-20-breaks-client-side-xsl-for-rss-and-atom-feeds\">something I criticized back in 2006</a>, like some are criticizing the feed icon change now.  (At the time, I was working for <a href=\"http://organic.com\">a marketing company</a>, and the change cost me days trying to incorporate branding in feeds on <a href=\"http://www.jeep.com/en/autoshow/feeds/jeep-all.xml\">a client&#39;s site</a>. I think we gave up after a bit, but I suspect that <a href=\"http://feedburner.com\">FeedBurner</a> built a nice business routing around that change.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#39;s been status quo for years, and it&#39;s less than compelling—I&#39;ve even had people ask me if they broke the page when the button was clicked on accident.</p>\n<p>So, given little reward for clicking that feed icon, <em>pushing it into the background in <strong>its current state</strong> is a service to the users of Firefox<em>. In other words, that feed button has to get a lot more interesting if it&#39;s going to serve alongside UI all-stars like <strong>Back</strong>, <strong>Reload</strong>, and **Location</em></em>. </p>\n<p>Hell, even with Firebug installed, I use <strong>View Source</strong> more than the feed button these days, and I&#39;ve never stuck <em>that</em> on the toolbar.</p>\n<h3 id=\"leading-the-web\">Leading the web</h3>\n<p>The most compelling response I&#39;ve seen to the &quot;removal&quot; of the feed auto-discovery button is the challenge that Mozilla and other browser makers should be <em>improving</em> feed-related features, rather than pushing them into the background. With this, I wholeheartedly agree—but I&#39;m not entirely sure what to do about it.</p>\n<p>So, there&#39;s a balance here: Make the <strong>experience of the web better</strong> by improving how Firefox handles what&#39;s already out there, and <strong>make the web itself better</strong> by building more powerful and enabling technologies into Firefox and other products. In the best of times, Mozilla can do and has done both at once. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL\">WebGL</a> and technologies associated with HTML5 represent great examples of this.</p>\n<p>But, alas, syndication feeds in the browser have stagnated. The feed button has been a weak feature <em>for years</em>. In the meantime, other things have taken priority in the Firefox project. The rise of Twitter and Facebook and more complex applications on the web have reduced the need for most people to interact directly with feeds, so demands for attention to the feed button haven&#39;t exactly topped the charts in comparison to things like <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/The%20Adobe%20Flash%20plugin%20has%20crashed\">making sure Flash doesn&#39;t crash the browser</a> and <a href=\"http://arewefastyet.com/\">getting super fast</a> for everything else. </p>\n<h3 id=\"ship-it\">Ship it!</h3>\n<p>In the end, Mozilla has a browser to ship. The decision on the feed button <em>has been made</em> and, believe it or not, with a great deal of thought behind it. </p>\n<p>I know that this is the first time many people have heard of this change, but many already have heard and have given the UX team a number of earsful. Coming in at this late stage and requesting—nay <strong>demanding</strong>—a reversal of that decision will do nothing but piss off all the people who&#39;ve been banging away at this and many other things up to now. They&#39;re people who&#39;ve worked hard, stayed up late—and the last thing anyone wants to do is rehash every conversation ever about the topic.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089393\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=478a310fc648c632ba1a3c120437289b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jacques</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089393\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T07:22:31\">2011-01-16T07:22:31</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I understand that we always try to enhance UI of any software and that it takes a lot of time and discussions to make decisions.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>The feed button is not dead; it's just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it's not pulling its weight. This post talks about why things have changed.</em>\r\n\r\nThere's [a brouhaha](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discover icon in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, *and* a Mozilla employee—I've got at least a few opinions.\r\n\r\nThis post is one of [several on this subject](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967).\r\n\r\n### Defaults are hard to pare down\r\n\r\nThe [feed icon still lives](http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/how-to-use-feed-auto-discovery-in-firefox-4) in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/); it's just not there by default any more. But, if you look at the controls available in [the toolbar customization panel](http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png), you'll notice a *lot* of things that don't show up by default—there are a lot of things in there, period.\r\n\r\nThis is the dilemma for [the Firefox User Experience team at Mozilla](http://planet.firefox.com/ux/): Like it or not, one of the main themes of this next generation of browsers is minimalism—faster, smaller, less browser to get in the way of what you're browsing. Yet, at the same time, Firefox 4 has the features of Firefox 3.6 and more.\r\n\r\nYou can't just cram it all in there, so what gets prime real estate by default? People say it's just a few pixels, that feed button—but is it so much more important than anything else that could go there? And before you answer, consider that not just for your personal use, but for the 100's of millions of people using Firefox. How do you check your own biases and make a decision on that scale? You could make an educated guess, make a gut check. A lot of brilliant design happens that way.\r\n\r\nYou can also [gather some telemetry from beta installs to see what people really use](https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/). Looking at a heatmap of clicks, the feed button is an absolute stinker. This isn't a random whim of the UX team—seriously, it's an **order of magnitude** less used than anything else in the toolbar (notice the one black spot):\r\n\r\n[<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/heatmap.png\" alt=\"heatmap.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"75\" />](https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/)\r\n\r\nThere have been comments dismissing the validity of that heatmap study. But, as far as I can tell, none of them really stick. So, for the sake of argument and a shorter blog post, let's assume barely anyone is using the feed icon and that it's not pulling its weight in this new age of browser minimalism.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that Firefox isn't the only browser to deprioritize the feed button: *Google Chrome doesn't even have a feed button at all*, and for many people that's the gold standard for minimal browser UI:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-chrome.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-chrome.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\r\n\r\n<a name=\"serving\"></a>\r\n### Serving the users\r\n\r\nLet's hammer on the point of disuse some more—what's the payoff for clicking that thing, anyway?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-styling.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-styling.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" />\r\n\r\n* +1 — You get an option to create a [Live Bookmark](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/livebookmarks.html), which is really handy for things like Bugzilla searches or light headline reading. (I like those so much that I tried building them on the server at Delicious once, but we never quite worked it out at scale.)\r\n\r\n* 0 — You get a list of sites to which Firefox will delegate subscription, if you happen to have [installed a content handler](https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM:window.navigator.registerContentHandler). Useful if you know what it's about; a mystery if you don't—not much more useful than a bookmarklet, to me.\r\n\r\n* -1 — You get a plainly-styled version of what you were probably already looking at on a site, [something I criticized back in 2006](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/02/firefox-20-breaks-client-side-xsl-for-rss-and-atom-feeds), like some are criticizing the feed icon change now.  (At the time, I was working for [a marketing company](http://organic.com), and the change cost me days trying to incorporate branding in feeds on [a client's site](http://www.jeep.com/en/autoshow/feeds/jeep-all.xml). I think we gave up after a bit, but I suspect that [FeedBurner](http://feedburner.com) built a nice business routing around that change.)\r\n\r\nThat's been status quo for years, and it's less than compelling—I've even had people ask me if they broke the page when the button was clicked on accident.\r\n\r\nSo, given little reward for clicking that feed icon, *pushing it into the background in **its current state** is a service to the users of Firefox*. In other words, that feed button has to get a lot more interesting if it's going to serve alongside UI all-stars like **Back**, **Reload**, and **Location**. \r\n\r\nHell, even with Firebug installed, I use **View Source** more than the feed button these days, and I've never stuck *that* on the toolbar.\r\n\r\n### Leading the web\r\n\r\nThe most compelling response I've seen to the \"removal\" of the feed auto-discovery button is the challenge that Mozilla and other browser makers should be *improving* feed-related features, rather than pushing them into the background. With this, I wholeheartedly agree—but I'm not entirely sure what to do about it.\r\n\r\nSo, there's a balance here: Make the **experience of the web better** by improving how Firefox handles what's already out there, and **make the web itself better** by building more powerful and enabling technologies into Firefox and other products. In the best of times, Mozilla can do and has done both at once. [WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) and technologies associated with HTML5 represent great examples of this.\r\n\r\nBut, alas, syndication feeds in the browser have stagnated. The feed button has been a weak feature *for years*. In the meantime, other things have taken priority in the Firefox project. The rise of Twitter and Facebook and more complex applications on the web have reduced the need for most people to interact directly with feeds, so demands for attention to the feed button haven't exactly topped the charts in comparison to things like [making sure Flash doesn't crash the browser](https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/The%20Adobe%20Flash%20plugin%20has%20crashed) and [getting super fast](http://arewefastyet.com/) for everything else. \r\n\r\n### Ship it!\r\n\r\nIn the end, Mozilla has a browser to ship. The decision on the feed button *has been made* and, believe it or not, with a great deal of thought behind it. \r\n\r\nI know that this is the first time many people have heard of this change, but many already have heard and have given the UX team a number of earsful. Coming in at this late stage and requesting—nay **demanding**—a reversal of that decision will do nothing but piss off all the people who've been banging away at this and many other things up to now. They're people who've worked hard, stayed up late—and the last thing anyone wants to do is rehash every conversation ever about the topic.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089393\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=478a310fc648c632ba1a3c120437289b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Jacques</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089393\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T07:22:31\">2011-01-16T07:22:31</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I understand that we always try to enhance UI of any software and that it takes a lot of time and discussions to make decisions.

    "html": "<p>Yeah, things have been basically silent around here thanks to post-work brain fryage and a general lack of things to say.  Really, everyone else around the blogosphere seems to be covering things satisfactorily.  However, I have been idly working on a new project over the past few weeks, namely a total rewrite and redesign of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/?s=feedmagick\">my format-ignorant feed filtering and munging kit dubbed FeedMagick</a>.</p>\n<p>You can find <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/\">a demo installation of FeedMagick2 here</a> and find it <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/FeedMagick2/\">ready for checkout from SVN over here</a>.  It&#39;s basically just a step away from being a proof of concept, but I&#39;m hoping to get around to fleshing out docs and battening down the hatches with tests.  In any case, if my serial enthusiasm holds out, this thing could eventually subsume everything else I&#39;ve done with feeds.</p>\n<p>For now, peek at some of these highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/masterfeed\">Master Personal Feed</a> - One big feed blended from 10 other personal metadata feeds pulled from various Web-2.0-ish sites.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/magpiejson\">Feed to JSON via Magpie</a> - Get feed data parsed by way of <a href=\"http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/\">Magpie</a> into JSON data structures</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/flickrfavorites\">Flickr Favorites Feed</a> - Feed of photos marked as favorites by a Flickr user, pulled via the API</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/jbox\">jbox.com scraper</a> - Pipeline composed of <a href=\"http://tidy.sourceforge.net/\">HTML Tidy</a> and XSL to scrape <a href=\"http://jbox.com/\">jbox.com</a> to build an RSS feed of new items for sale.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beyond practical examples, there are some things under the hood that seem keen to me.  Apropos of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2007/02/15/thoughts-on-pipes-on-the-web-part-ii\">pipes-via-web ramblings</a> back in February, I&#39;m trying out a few different approaches to pipelining feed content through processor modules.  My original FeedMagick relied on feeding URLs to URLs as parameters.  That, unfortunately, can be mighty cumbersome and inefficient.  So, FeedMagick2 explores a few more approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The first and obvious approach is to chain them together in a single script.  So, I&#39;ve got objects instances that pass content from one to the next.  The thing is, the pipe works in reverse:  The driver script asks the last module in the pipe for content, which then asks the one before it for content, and so on.  At any point along the way, modules can cache the output of previous modules, and refrain from calling up the chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The second way to chain pipelines together is just like the first FeedMagick:  Some pipelines start with fetching a URL.  That can be an original feed, or a URL leading to the output of an antecedent pipeline.  And, oh yeah, most pipelines are run via parameterized URLs, so there&#39;s that bit of handy recursion.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The third way to chain pipelines together is with HTTP POST:  A pipeline can accept feed data via the request body of an HTTP POST, thus allowing antecedent pipelines (or even cURL scripts) to <em>push</em> data into the pipeline rather than getting <em>pulled</em> via URL.  This is kind of like my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/?s=xmlrpc+pipe\">years-old jiggery pokery</a> with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">pipelines via XML-RPC</a>, only much <em>much</em> simpler.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#39;m also poking around at making all of the above available at the command line via PHP-CLI, and I&#39;m having gratuitous fun exploring PEAR to roll my own stripped-down web framework.  I still hate PHP, but I&#39;m at least finding ways to entertain myself while I&#39;m holding my nose.  Of course, I find weird things entertaining.</p>\n<p>And, as a side note, the only reason I&#39;m using PHP is because I&#39;d like to play around with the idea of the de facto WordPress installation requirements standard.  That is:  If you can run WordPress, you can run this.  In reality, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m there, but I&#39;m hoping to get close.  For one, I&#39;m refusing to play with anything older than PHP 5.</p>\n<p>Anyway, play with it, tell me what you think and give me a reason to keep hacking at it.  :)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082761\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jamesv.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c82c72ca4f9eab33a80a7bd839c1ae0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jamesv.org\">jamesv</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082761\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-04-30T11:39:15\">2007-04-30T11:39:15</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Aw man, now I've got to port all the code you wrote while you were here over to this new hotness ;) I really like (and appreciate) the single script approach.</p>\n<p>Is caching at a module level done automatically, or is that something I need to flag in my original call?

    "body": "Yeah, things have been basically silent around here thanks to post-work brain fryage and a general lack of things to say.  Really, everyone else around the blogosphere seems to be covering things satisfactorily.  However, I have been idly working on a new project over the past few weeks, namely a total rewrite and redesign of [my format-ignorant feed filtering and munging kit dubbed FeedMagick](http://decafbad.com/blog/?s=feedmagick).\r\n\r\nYou can find [a demo installation of FeedMagick2 here](http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/) and find it [ready for checkout from SVN over here](http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/FeedMagick2/).  It's basically just a step away from being a proof of concept, but I'm hoping to get around to fleshing out docs and battening down the hatches with tests.  In any case, if my serial enthusiasm holds out, this thing could eventually subsume everything else I've done with feeds.\r\n\r\nFor now, peek at some of these highlights:\r\n\r\n   * [Master Personal Feed](http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/masterfeed) - One big feed blended from 10 other personal metadata feeds pulled from various Web-2.0-ish sites.\r\n   * [Feed to JSON via Magpie](http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/magpiejson) - Get feed data parsed by way of [Magpie](http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/) into JSON data structures\r\n   * [Flickr Favorites Feed](http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/flickrfavorites) - Feed of photos marked as favorites by a Flickr user, pulled via the API\r\n   * [jbox.com scraper](http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/jbox) - Pipeline composed of [HTML Tidy](http://tidy.sourceforge.net/) and XSL to scrape [jbox.com](http://jbox.com/) to build an RSS feed of new items for sale.\r\n\r\nBeyond practical examples, there are some things under the hood that seem keen to me.  Apropos of my [pipes-via-web ramblings](http://decafbad.com/blog/2007/02/15/thoughts-on-pipes-on-the-web-part-ii) back in February, I'm trying out a few different approaches to pipelining feed content through processor modules.  My original FeedMagick relied on feeding URLs to URLs as parameters.  That, unfortunately, can be mighty cumbersome and inefficient.  So, FeedMagick2 explores a few more approaches:\r\n\r\n   * The first and obvious approach is to chain them together in a single script.  So, I've got objects instances that pass content from one to the next.  The thing is, the pipe works in reverse:  The driver script asks the last module in the pipe for content, which then asks the one before it for content, and so on.  At any point along the way, modules can cache the output of previous modules, and refrain from calling up the chain.\r\n\r\n   * The second way to chain pipelines together is just like the first FeedMagick:  Some pipelines start with fetching a URL.  That can be an original feed, or a URL leading to the output of an antecedent pipeline.  And, oh yeah, most pipelines are run via parameterized URLs, so there's that bit of handy recursion.\r\n\r\n   * The third way to chain pipelines together is with HTTP POST:  A pipeline can accept feed data via the request body of an HTTP POST, thus allowing antecedent pipelines (or even cURL scripts) to *push* data into the pipeline rather than getting *pulled* via URL.  This is kind of like my [years-old jiggery pokery](http://decafbad.com/blog/?s=xmlrpc+pipe) with [pipelines via XML-RPC](http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe), only much *much* simpler.\r\n\r\nI'm also poking around at making all of the above available at the command line via PHP-CLI, and I'm having gratuitous fun exploring PEAR to roll my own stripped-down web framework.  I still hate PHP, but I'm at least finding ways to entertain myself while I'm holding my nose.  Of course, I find weird things entertaining.\r\n\r\nAnd, as a side note, the only reason I'm using PHP is because I'd like to play around with the idea of the de facto WordPress installation requirements standard.  That is:  If you can run WordPress, you can run this.  In reality, I don't think I'm there, but I'm hoping to get close.  For one, I'm refusing to play with anything older than PHP 5.\r\n\r\nAnyway, play with it, tell me what you think and give me a reason to keep hacking at it.  :)\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082761\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jamesv.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c82c72ca4f9eab33a80a7bd839c1ae0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jamesv.org\">jamesv</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082761\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-04-30T11:39:15\">2007-04-30T11:39:15</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Aw man, now I've got to port all the code you wrote while you were here over to this new hotness ;) I really like (and appreciate) the single script approach.</p>\n\n<p>Is caching at a module level done automatically, or is that something I need to flag in my original call?

Consider an idempotent GET request as a pure function call with no side-effects.  Then, consider a GET request that accepts a URL as a parameter — it&#39;s a nested function call: the outer GET must make an inner GET to fetch the parameter-supplied URL.

The RSS feed would offer bookmarklets to append a new idea via quick pop-up to each of the top-level branches.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090498\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://stadik.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c28fdb5b196caeb5d37101b73b50ae26&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://stadik.net\">Scytrin dai Kinthra</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090498\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-03T23:30:42\">2007-01-03T23:30:42</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I used to do this from my home page once browsers started integrating rss into bookmark thingies.\r\nThese days I've been using the Firefox del.icio.us 1.3.x extention and store my bookmarklets and smart bookmarks (hello galeon) on my account.\r\nHowever, del.icio.us doesn't allow sharing of certain types of bookmarks and bookmarklets are one of them (being javascript and all), so sharing of them is not very well enabled.\r\nIt'd be nice being able to peruse a del.icio.us/tag/bookmarklet and pickout nifties.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090499\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://factoryjoe.com/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d187daa261d3472b7e07f38f8e5c010e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://factoryjoe.com/blog\">Chris Messina</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090499\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-03T23:32:42\">2007-01-03T23:32:42</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Not sure, but that's a great idea!

I need to try [NNW][NetNewsWire] a bit more and figure out if it's just my initial import of subscriptions that drags things down - but [Vienna][]'s got me now.  It's catching up mightily fast with the feature list of NNW.  And, nothing beats open source software for tossing in a few tweaks to things that are just *not quite* doing what I'd like.\r\n\r\nAgain, since I'm a [serial enthusiast][se], I have no idea if I'll be a regular contributor of patches to [Vienna][] or even offer any commitment to the project - but I'm definitely happy with it at the moment.\r\n\r\n[vpatch]: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=31310885&forum_id=48723\r\n[vt]: http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna_styles.php\r\n[vsvn]: http://vienna-rss.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vienna-rss/trunk/2.1.0/\r\n[vdb]: http://vienna-rss.sourceforge.net/public/DatabaseSchema.pdf\r\n[wk]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/02/12/colloquy-irc\r\n[Vienna]: http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\r\n[NetNewsWire]: http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire\r\n[l1]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/18/good-gregarius\r\n[l2]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/12/further-work-on-decafbadnewsriver\r\n[l3]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/05/feedspool-is-progressing-nicely\r\n[l4]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/05/introducing-dbagg3-an-atom-powered-clientserver-aggregator\r\n[se]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\r\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085597\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\">Craig</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085597\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-02T22:20:49\">2007-01-02T22:20:49</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Not sure if you care much for web-based aggregators, but ReBlog is my current favorite.

ReBlog i've used before, too, but actually as a sort of newsdesk for a team at work - they skimmed through news stories and flagged items for republishing, which our CMS then plucked out of the outgoing ReBlog RSS feed.  Nice aggregator.  But, for me, nothing beats a desktop aggregator for swift skimming speed.

It would be something different to memorize - not necessarily easier.  But, hmm, I never thought about anthrax.  I suppose that would be a job hazard to consider, beyond simple wasted time.</p>\n<p>Robert:  Admittedly, I'm frustrated.  This change breaks things I've invested hours into across several jobs, and into which I've been investing hours again.  At least I've been paid for those hours, and I'm glad I don't have to go back and explain / fix the stuff now broken at previous jobs.</p>\n<p>From my perspective, I'm seeing all the latest generation browsers now breaking something I thought was standard - but about that I guess was mistaken.  At least, it \"smelled\" like a fairly clean quasi-standard approach to me.  I really don't have standards all memorized or even well studied.</p>\n<p>But, in the new defacto standard, I get to stuff 512 random bytes into a feed to get the old behavior back.  That certainly doesn't \"smell\" like a clean standard to me, even if IE 7 does it and Firefox 2 now follows.  It still doesn't work in Safari.  It seems a defacto standard to me in the same way that exploiting CSS parser errors to filter by browser is a defacto standard.  Yet another weird edge case to memorize.</p>\n<p>From my perspective, the defacto standard has been what FeedBurner and others have been doing with client-side XSL for feeds.  And there've been some exciting things starting there - so there's some personal disappointment invoked.  And now, all those feeds are broken in that respect.  Retroactive wind-blown urine, at this point, I guess.</p>\n<p>Maybe all this was really just a neat geeky trick best now forgotten, and the decision really will be the right one in the end.  Nonetheless, I don't like it.  So, perhaps not \"IT IS OBJECTIVELY WRONG\".  But, from my perspective, it was an unexpected and unwanted surprise.</p>\n<p>As for being productive, the decision seems made and others have already registered the same or better objections than I would just rehash.  And I can't see with what collective character flaw I've painted the team - I'm perturbed, but I certainly don't think everyone involved is a villain.  My apologies if my frustration vents that way.  It's just that taking over feed styling from content providers strikes me as \"we can do user experience better\", and the explanations I've read don't seem to disagree with that notion.</p>\n<p>But, I disagree and I don't like it.  So, fine, from here on out I use the 512-byte-hack if I want custom XSL styling for feeds.  Another trick in the bag.  That's pretty much my last word on the subject, unless the capability disappears entirely.</p>\n<p>All I have left to say is that I hope the <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/07/30/xml-stylesheet-and-the-world-of-warcraft-home-page\" rel=\"nofollow\">client-side XSL-styled World of Warcraft home page</a> never switches to an Atom or RSS format - whether or not using a non-HTML format for a front page was a good idea in the first place.  I thought it was, but that could be my whole problem.  :)</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087108\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.net\">CraigM</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087108\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T02:42:06\">2006-11-08T02:42:06</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>My \"frustrated with technology\" catch-phrase has always been to become a Buddhist Monk.

That's not how the decision was made. And to be honest, it bothers me somewhat to read a rant on the subject that only focuses on Firefox. To me, it seems like taking advantage of an open product development process because you know we will listen, while other vendors won't. A rant that claims \"Firefox and IE and Safari suck\" would be different, because then it is an opinion on a behavior. Criticism of browser behavior is welcome, criticism of people based on tech religion is not so welcome.</p>\n<p>I understand that FeedBurner and others have a business interest here, but you have to understand that at least some of the things they do directly conflict with capabilities that are beneficial to browser users (that we can't deliver if it only works with half of the feeds out there). We want our users to have a coherent feed experience, with browser-specific preferences and minimal click-through screens. To that end, the screen that supplants the XSL was termed the \"feed preview\". It should show what's in the feed, and default to user-specified feed preferences. If the feed doesn't contain ads for aggregators and feed services (and wrong instructions), a preview that shows that stuff deceives our users. Not in an evil way, but in a \"bad usability\" way. When combined with authors who <em>want</em> a browser feed screen with a stylesheet for older browsers, and Safari/IE7 behavior, the scales tilted away from  using the XSL.</p>\n<p>I understand that people disagree here. But the fact that all browser vendors have done something that doesn't align with the way they used to do it should tell you that the issue is more complicated than \"author's intent\", for better or worse.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087111\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087111\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T04:38:57\">2006-11-08T04:38:57</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Robert:  You have a great point there - I do in fact think that Firefox, IE, and Safari all suck with this current change in feed handling.  And yeah, the only reason I ranted about Firefox is because I think it's the only one of the three there's much chance in affecting.  It's also the only browser I use, so it's the first one where the feed handling change really sunk in for me.  I really haven't cared about it until just now.</p>\n<p>Of course, I've been nowhere near participating in the newsgroups or code checkins or anything whatsoever related to actually contributing to Firefox - so this is all blog-chair quarterbacking from a syndication feeds enthusiast.</p>\n<p>As for the \"they think they know better than us\" issue, I think it can be found in <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_thread/thread/146f70eaf0e1686f/1daec246d79c7dbd#ccd0a66d6a204f49\" rel=\"nofollow\">a newsgroup response like Mike Shaver's</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... one significant motivation was that very many uses of XSLT-on-RSS was to create a page that said \"this is not <em>for</em> you browsers, go to the main site instead\", which is not what we wanted the user's experience to be.  Distinguishing those cases from the \"righteous use of XSLT for dual presentation\" ones is a publishable result, I submit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To this, the most vocal respondents say, \"But I <em>really want</em> my users to experience my righteous XSLT!\"  Even if it has flaming GIFs, dancing hamsters, and cat pictures.  It's <em>righteous</em>, damn it.  (Yeah, the quoted \"righteous\" is a little off-putting when you actually think the XSLT thing is kind of keen.)</p>\n<p>Why not apply the new-and-improved styling by default and bow out when there's a processing instruction?  Then, spread the word - \"Get rid of your cruddy not-for-you XSLT!\"  I'm sure you'd get lots of converts grateful to stop screwing with their feeds, which would leave the outlier nutters like me and FeedBurner to keep happily shooting themselves in the feet.  Instead, I see, \"style 'em all and let hacks sort 'em out,\" which totally rubs me the wrong way.</p>\n<p>At this point, I'm really just mildly disappointed, and feel like I've gotten a downgrade in an otherwise all-around great new browser.  I'm not <em>actually</em> looking to farm sheep over this.  There is a hack-around available for IE7 and FF2, so at least there's that.</p>\n<p>I guess what would make me feel like I'd gotten a decent consolation prize would be if that Feed Preview screen were significantly richer and easier on the eyes than the other browsers' offerings.  I'm assuming that's projected for the future.  Maybe what I need is to do a checkout and dig around.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087112\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ffe238ed68da35e8037df461552234&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087112\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T04:41:06\">2006-11-08T04:41:06</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>CraigM: You may want to reconsider.

Because Mozilla has chosen to ignore an Author's preferences when displaying a feed.  Period.  You can explain it all you want, your reasoning may even be right- but the bottom line is, Mozilla made a conscious decision to ignore styling instructions included by the feed's author.  The only reasons I can think of to do this is to be perverse (which I doubt), or because you think you know better (and from here on out, I use the collective you for Mozilla, because I'm tired of typing Mozilla).</p>\n<p>You claim it's better for users.  I say you think you know better what is good for your users than the feed author does.  This is the same feed author that created the feed's content, and the stylesheet, and decided to present the feed to users with the stylesheet.  I'm sorry, I just don't buy it.</p>\n<p>Another non-starter is the IE7/Safari argument.  I don't care what those browsers do; I chose Firefox because it decided to lead, not follow, when it comes to standards.  Whether you believe that displaying RSS feeds with stylesheets is a standards issue or not, you can't deny it was a de-facto standard until recently.</p>\n<p>And what about those authors who only want their stylesheets applied in older browsers that aren't as enlightened as IE7?  Not that I've seen a public outcry from these authors in any of the forums discussing this \"feature\", but let's assume they must exist.  They were smart enought to add the stylesheet to their feed, why not allow them to also add to their feed an indication that a browser's built in styling may trump the linked stylesheet (perhaps a PI)?  Wouldn't that allow both types of authors to get what they want without wasting bandwidth in 1/2 kb increments of sheer hack?  </p>\n<p>I've read the arguments, here, on the buglist, and in the newsgroups.  To me, and I suspect, to many others, Mozilla (or those who made this decision within Mozilla) has acted as though they think they know better than web site authors.  Explanations such as yours appear to me as an explanation of why you think that, not a refutation that you don't.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087115\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0a9ab4b71ce193e98b7284ca257e327&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\">Jason Clark</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087115\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T13:21:50\">2006-11-08T13:21:50</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Regarding the above:  Sorry about the extra \"conscious\" at the beginning....

It would be something different to memorize - not necessarily easier.  But, hmm, I never thought about anthrax.  I suppose that would be a job hazard to consider, beyond simple wasted time.</p>\n\n<p>Robert:  Admittedly, I'm frustrated.  This change breaks things I've invested hours into across several jobs, and into which I've been investing hours again.  At least I've been paid for those hours, and I'm glad I don't have to go back and explain / fix the stuff now broken at previous jobs.</p>\n\n<p>From my perspective, I'm seeing all the latest generation browsers now breaking something I thought was standard - but about that I guess was mistaken.  At least, it \"smelled\" like a fairly clean quasi-standard approach to me.  I really don't have standards all memorized or even well studied.</p>\n\n<p>But, in the new defacto standard, I get to stuff 512 random bytes into a feed to get the old behavior back.  That certainly doesn't \"smell\" like a clean standard to me, even if IE 7 does it and Firefox 2 now follows.  It still doesn't work in Safari.  It seems a defacto standard to me in the same way that exploiting CSS parser errors to filter by browser is a defacto standard.  Yet another weird edge case to memorize.</p>\n\n<p>From my perspective, the defacto standard has been what FeedBurner and others have been doing with client-side XSL for feeds.  And there've been some exciting things starting there - so there's some personal disappointment invoked.  And now, all those feeds are broken in that respect.  Retroactive wind-blown urine, at this point, I guess.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe all this was really just a neat geeky trick best now forgotten, and the decision really will be the right one in the end.  Nonetheless, I don't like it.  So, perhaps not \"IT IS OBJECTIVELY WRONG\".  But, from my perspective, it was an unexpected and unwanted surprise.</p>\n\n<p>As for being productive, the decision seems made and others have already registered the same or better objections than I would just rehash.  And I can't see with what collective character flaw I've painted the team - I'm perturbed, but I certainly don't think everyone involved is a villain.  My apologies if my frustration vents that way.  It's just that taking over feed styling from content providers strikes me as \"we can do user experience better\", and the explanations I've read don't seem to disagree with that notion.</p>\n\n<p>But, I disagree and I don't like it.  So, fine, from here on out I use the 512-byte-hack if I want custom XSL styling for feeds.  Another trick in the bag.  That's pretty much my last word on the subject, unless the capability disappears entirely.</p>\n\n<p>All I have left to say is that I hope the <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/07/30/xml-stylesheet-and-the-world-of-warcraft-home-page\" rel=\"nofollow\">client-side XSL-styled World of Warcraft home page</a> never switches to an Atom or RSS format - whether or not using a non-HTML format for a front page was a good idea in the first place.  I thought it was, but that could be my whole problem.  :)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087108\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\">CraigM</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087108\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T02:42:06\">2006-11-08T02:42:06</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>My \"frustrated with technology\" catch-phrase has always been to become a Buddhist Monk.

That's not how the decision was made. And to be honest, it bothers me somewhat to read a rant on the subject that only focuses on Firefox. To me, it seems like taking advantage of an open product development process because you know we will listen, while other vendors won't. A rant that claims \"Firefox and IE and Safari suck\" would be different, because then it is an opinion on a behavior. Criticism of browser behavior is welcome, criticism of people based on tech religion is not so welcome.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that FeedBurner and others have a business interest here, but you have to understand that at least some of the things they do directly conflict with capabilities that are beneficial to browser users (that we can't deliver if it only works with half of the feeds out there). We want our users to have a coherent feed experience, with browser-specific preferences and minimal click-through screens. To that end, the screen that supplants the XSL was termed the \"feed preview\". It should show what's in the feed, and default to user-specified feed preferences. If the feed doesn't contain ads for aggregators and feed services (and wrong instructions), a preview that shows that stuff deceives our users. Not in an evil way, but in a \"bad usability\" way. When combined with authors who <em>want</em> a browser feed screen with a stylesheet for older browsers, and Safari/IE7 behavior, the scales tilted away from  using the XSL.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that people disagree here. But the fact that all browser vendors have done something that doesn't align with the way they used to do it should tell you that the issue is more complicated than \"author's intent\", for better or worse.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087111\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087111\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T04:38:57\">2006-11-08T04:38:57</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Robert:  You have a great point there - I do in fact think that Firefox, IE, and Safari all suck with this current change in feed handling.  And yeah, the only reason I ranted about Firefox is because I think it's the only one of the three there's much chance in affecting.  It's also the only browser I use, so it's the first one where the feed handling change really sunk in for me.  I really haven't cared about it until just now.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I've been nowhere near participating in the newsgroups or code checkins or anything whatsoever related to actually contributing to Firefox - so this is all blog-chair quarterbacking from a syndication feeds enthusiast.</p>\n\n<p>As for the \"they think they know better than us\" issue, I think it can be found in <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_thread/thread/146f70eaf0e1686f/1daec246d79c7dbd#ccd0a66d6a204f49\" rel=\"nofollow\">a newsgroup response like Mike Shaver's</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... one significant motivation was that very many uses of XSLT-on-RSS was to create a page that said \"this is not <em>for</em> you browsers, go to the main site instead\", which is not what we wanted the user's experience to be.  Distinguishing those cases from the \"righteous use of XSLT for dual presentation\" ones is a publishable result, I submit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To this, the most vocal respondents say, \"But I <em>really want</em> my users to experience my righteous XSLT!\"  Even if it has flaming GIFs, dancing hamsters, and cat pictures.  It's <em>righteous</em>, damn it.  (Yeah, the quoted \"righteous\" is a little off-putting when you actually think the XSLT thing is kind of keen.)</p>\n\n<p>Why not apply the new-and-improved styling by default and bow out when there's a processing instruction?  Then, spread the word - \"Get rid of your cruddy not-for-you XSLT!\"  I'm sure you'd get lots of converts grateful to stop screwing with their feeds, which would leave the outlier nutters like me and FeedBurner to keep happily shooting themselves in the feet.  Instead, I see, \"style 'em all and let hacks sort 'em out,\" which totally rubs me the wrong way.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I'm really just mildly disappointed, and feel like I've gotten a downgrade in an otherwise all-around great new browser.  I'm not <em>actually</em> looking to farm sheep over this.  There is a hack-around available for IE7 and FF2, so at least there's that.</p>\n\n<p>I guess what would make me feel like I'd gotten a decent consolation prize would be if that Feed Preview screen were significantly richer and easier on the eyes than the other browsers' offerings.  I'm assuming that's projected for the future.  Maybe what I need is to do a checkout and dig around.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087112\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ffe238ed68da35e8037df461552234&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087112\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T04:41:06\">2006-11-08T04:41:06</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>CraigM: You may want to reconsider.

Because Mozilla has chosen to ignore an Author's preferences when displaying a feed.  Period.  You can explain it all you want, your reasoning may even be right- but the bottom line is, Mozilla made a conscious decision to ignore styling instructions included by the feed's author.  The only reasons I can think of to do this is to be perverse (which I doubt), or because you think you know better (and from here on out, I use the collective you for Mozilla, because I'm tired of typing Mozilla).</p>\n\n<p>You claim it's better for users.  I say you think you know better what is good for your users than the feed author does.  This is the same feed author that created the feed's content, and the stylesheet, and decided to present the feed to users with the stylesheet.  I'm sorry, I just don't buy it.</p>\n\n<p>Another non-starter is the IE7/Safari argument.  I don't care what those browsers do; I chose Firefox because it decided to lead, not follow, when it comes to standards.  Whether you believe that displaying RSS feeds with stylesheets is a standards issue or not, you can't deny it was a de-facto standard until recently.</p>\n\n<p>And what about those authors who only want their stylesheets applied in older browsers that aren't as enlightened as IE7?  Not that I've seen a public outcry from these authors in any of the forums discussing this \"feature\", but let's assume they must exist.  They were smart enought to add the stylesheet to their feed, why not allow them to also add to their feed an indication that a browser's built in styling may trump the linked stylesheet (perhaps a PI)?

It&#39;s also the first time I&#39;ve heard Danny Ayers&#39; voice, so that was pretty cool after having been a textual blog acquaintance for a few years now.  As for the rest of the guys on the call, I&#39;m not quite as familiar with all of them yet, but I&#39;ll be adding them to my Reading Lists shortly.</p>\n<p>Apropos of this podcast, I&#39;ve lately gotten a bit of a fresh take on the RSS/OPML versus XHTML versus Semantic Web tech merry-go-round.  Here&#39;s the basic gist:  Invest time into tools that solve problems first and formats that enable possibilities second, if you want to get any attention and subsequent help.</p>\n<p>And then I say &quot;tools&quot;, I don&#39;t mean a GraphViz construct that makes really cool charts for people willing to chase down and install the dependencies.  No, I mean something like the OPML Editor.  The OPML Editor comes in a single package, and you launch it from a single icon.  The OPML Editor is <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty piece of software</a> that&#39;s nonetheless helping me achieve some practical goals that I&#39;ve heretofore been vaguely stymied in reaching.  The OPML Editor is making me think more favorably about OPML, <i>despite</i> OPML being <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty format</a>.</p>\n<p>The utility of the OPML Editor is giving me the motivation to build filters and workarounds to transmute OPML into XOXO and RDF formats, but only when the need arises.  I could also see putting an OPML-to-triples bridge in front of a semweb crawler or tool.  And, there&#39;s no reason why outlines in the OPML Editor couldn&#39;t be rendered in XOXO and RDF formats by the tool itself, if there&#39;s something useful around to consume it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I&#39;ve done enough with RDF and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo_outliner_experiment\">XOXO</a> to see the clear potential in both.  With enough RDF data around, you can turn the whole wide web into a single massively networked database ripe for the querying thanks to a uniform data model and clear specs for representation of that model.  With XOXO and microformats, you get a <a href=\"http://www.sudoku.com/\">Sudoku-esque</a> solution to providing both human and machine readable data in the same format and file, while sterring close to the inherent design principles of the web.</p>\n<p>The problem with these formats, though, is that they open potential avenues but don&#39;t provide value until there&#39;s some foot traffic on the avenues.  This is just establishing a world in which there can exist both chickens and eggs, but not doing much with respect to concrete instantiations of poultry.\nNow, to be fair, there have been efforts to make practical usage of RDF (see: <a href=\"http://musicbrainz.org/\">MusicBrainz</a>) and these are early days for microformats.  But, I think a lot more effort needs to be given toward making useful, personally rewarding tools - and less effort given toward expressing awe toward the potentials given by formats and models.  You can have both, but you&#39;ve got to pick one to start with.</p>\n<p>And, the reason you need to make tools first that use formats second is attention.  (That&#39;s been a buzzword lately, hasn&#39;t it?)  You need attention if you want adoption and help.  And, you can get attention - and subsequent help - by scratching someone&#39;s itch.</p>\n<p>Now, some people&#39;s itches are scratched by the fun of abstract symbol manipulation and the perception of elegance.  Others&#39; itches are scratched by getting work done, like writing or organizing thoughts or expanding awareness of more information sources.  Personally, I&#39;ve got itches of both of these varieties.  The problem is that there are many fewer people with itches in that first category.  And, no offense to anyone, that seems to be the bulk of the RDF and XOXO fanbase at the moment.  For the second category, even if things are shitty, smoke a bit and catch on fire - as long as some work gets done at the end of the day, there&#39;s a lot of tolerance to go around and a lot of motivation to pitch in to improve the situation.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I firmly believe that ATOM, RDF, and XHTML-based microformats trounce OPML, RSS, and the like in terms of clear definition, affordance in manipulation, and technical elegance.  But, OPML and RSS are still winning in the world because the tools using these formats are scratching some damn annoying itches.  And, though towers built atop shitty tools and formats seem Jenga-shaky, somehow they never quite come crashing down.  Maybe they will come crashing down someday, but we seem to be getting work done in the meantime.</p>\n<p>So, to wrap up:  My take on this whole mess is that your format will gain adoption to the degree that the tools producing it help people get work done.  I can&#39;t find tools today for RDF and XOXO that are as rewardingly useful as the OPML Editor has become.  When that happens, the story may change.</p>\n<!-- tags: metablogging rdf semweb webdev opml rss syndication microformats xoxo podcasting -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086877\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e377f3e2140297d32460ae9a4b38ff98&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086877\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-14T02:32:49\">2006-02-14T02:32:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>There's a lot to be said for rough consensus and running code, and there's a lot more running code that speaks OPML than there is that speaks XOXO or RDF.

When that happens, the story may change.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: metablogging rdf semweb webdev opml rss syndication microformats xoxo podcasting -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086877\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e377f3e2140297d32460ae9a4b38ff98&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086877\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-14T02:32:49\">2006-02-14T02:32:49</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>There's a lot to be said for rough consensus and running code, and there's a lot more running code that speaks OPML than there is that speaks XOXO or RDF.

    "html": "<p>So, while working through some writing blockages last weekend, I started doing <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/21/a-bit-of-newsriver-hackery\">some hacking</a> on <a href=\"http://scripting.wordpress.com/2005/12/29/why-im-working-on-an-aggregator/\">Dave Winer&#39;s newsRiver</a> running on the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/\">OPML Editor</a> platform.  (Oh, and it <em>is</em> a platform, maybe more so than even emacs—don&#39;t let the moniker &#39;editor&#39; fool you.)</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s the thing:  It was a lot of addictive fun, and it takes me back to the <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/11/ooooho\">love/hate thing I had with Radio</a>, back toward the first days of this blog.  This Frontier / Radio / OPML Editor environment is undeniably satisfying for me to work in.  It&#39;s like potato chips:  Jump to an outline here, tweak some code there, mangle an outline node up there, reload a browser page, watch things go—lots of moments of instant gratification all building incrementally atop one another.</p>\n<p>In one package—which reminds me a lot of <a href=\"http://www.squeak.org/\">Squeak</a>—the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/\">OPML Editor</a> bundles a crazy amount of integrated machinery for both Windows and Mac OS X:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UserTalk, a very capable scripting language</li>\n<li>An IDE based on outlining, somewhat like Python&#39;s syntactic indentation</li>\n<li>Persistent on-disk hierarchical hashtables (aka the Object Database)</li>\n<li>Code and data all live in the same object database</li>\n<li>A web server and a host of other networking code—including Jabber messaging, although I can&#39;t attest to its freshness.</li>\n<li>Blog editing and no-effort external web hosting file synch</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/26/oooabf\">Hot patching</a> and easy upgrades that most other software packages dream of</li>\n<li>Years and years and years of (mostly) working code with datestamped change notes and living history.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the thing is?  This was the state of the art for Radio back in 2002—and earlier than that even for Frontier.  Fast forward from then till today, and you&#39;ll find that <a href=\"http://frontierkernel.sourceforge.net/\">Frontier is now Open Source</a>—with many of the same sorts of warts Mozilla&#39;s open source release helpfully revealed back in 1997.  (Some hero needs to come along and port this beast to Linux!  Good luck!)  And now, much of the guts of Radio are released as the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/\">OPML Editor</a>.  </p>\n<p>In a lot of ways, this whole family of apps built on this common ancestry of code is <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">really shitty software</a>.  Kind of like <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/02/24/ancient-software-and-programmer-archaeologists\">all that code on the <em>Qeng Ho</em> from Vernor Vinge&#39;s <em>A Deepness in the Sky</em></a>.  This stuff crashes and sets itself on fire a lot, but then again it&#39;s amazing to see just how many wheels have been reinvented and re-reinvented since 2002 (and before) when I fire up this code today.</p>\n<p>And now, it looks like the embers are stirring for this thing again.  There&#39;s been a lot of time for a lot of angst to fade from a lot of places, and it looks like there&#39;s a new crop of fresh people rediscovering this stuff.  </p>\n<p>So, anyway, I like these potato chips.  I think I want to start munching on them again, as time permits.

Ok, very IMHO but : swap US-ASCII for utf-8, XML-RPC for doc/literal XML, RSS 2.0 for Atom, Object Database for triplestore,  Python for UserTalk, outliner for modern IDE (although actually the outliner UI is probably one bit that might be worth preserving as-is) etc. </p>\n<p>Well, ok, maybe it is a bit much to expect.

(Well, more like 'strong distaste' than 'hate' anyway).</p>\n<p>And I've realized that, since drifting away from Radio/Frontier, I've been recapturing it in various forms using tech like Python, triple-stores, mini-HTTP servers, and the like.  And although these things have felt 'healtier' in a non-NIH, bigger community, more loosely coupled way... it's still a satisfying experience (like potato chips) to find it all buttoned up in one integrated package that works on most of the platforms I care about.</p>\n<p>It's still kind of a writing-with-my-wrong-hand kind of pain in the butt to get all the loose coupled stuff working sometimes.  And many times, there are very good reasons for thing being hard and lots of things need minding.  Like, XML-RPC style web services versus REST: </p>\n<p>REST is a cleaner, more web-natural approach—but sometimes it takes a lot of thoughtful meta-tinkering where that XML-RPC stuff would've had you on the road hours ago.  Of course, years from now, the XML-RPC stuff might smell a bit while the REST stuff will have stayed solid and revealed further unexpected benefits... but bah.  They both have their place.</p>\n<p>It's a lot like baked versus fried.

Oh, and while I'm talking about potato chips—I have to say, [don't pee in the potato chips][pee] and be nice to the guy holding the bag.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: winer rss syndication radio usertalk frontier vinge opml -->\r\n\r\n[pee]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/28/dont-pee-in-the-potato-chips\r\n[squeak]: http://www.squeak.org/\r\n[code]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/02/24/ancient-software-and-programmer-archaeologists\r\n[shitty]: http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\r\n[hp]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/26/oooabf\r\n[fso]: http://frontierkernel.sourceforge.net/\r\n[lh]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/11/ooooho\r\n[opml]: http://support.opml.org/\r\n[new]: http://scripting.wordpress.com/2005/12/29/why-im-working-on-an-aggregator/\r\n[hack]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/21/a-bit-of-newsriver-hackery\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084407\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=760b4002b07650d4ef654f9fc17e8154&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Robert Brook</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084407\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-28T15:03:50\">2006-01-28T15:03:50</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Serious question: why not use Squeak?</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084408\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084408\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-28T16:01:26\">2006-01-28T16:01:26</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Robert: Short answer is that I saw Radio first for the RSS aggregator and blogging support, started hacking on that, and got sucked into other aspects of it along the way.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Squeak, I saw some fun colorful things and kind of got the gist of the environment, but never got hooked on any daily uses of it after a weekend or two of playing.

(Well, more like 'strong distaste' than 'hate' anyway).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I've realized that, since drifting away from Radio/Frontier, I've been recapturing it in various forms using tech like Python, triple-stores, mini-HTTP servers, and the like.  And although these things have felt 'healtier' in a non-NIH, bigger community, more loosely coupled way... it's still a satisfying experience (like potato chips) to find it all buttoned up in one integrated package that works on most of the platforms I care about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's still kind of a writing-with-my-wrong-hand kind of pain in the butt to get all the loose coupled stuff working sometimes.  And many times, there are very good reasons for thing being hard and lots of things need minding.  Like, XML-RPC style web services versus REST: </p>\r\n\r\n<p>REST is a cleaner, more web-natural approach—but sometimes it takes a lot of thoughtful meta-tinkering where that XML-RPC stuff would've had you on the road hours ago.  Of course, years from now, the XML-RPC stuff might smell a bit while the REST stuff will have stayed solid and revealed further unexpected benefits... but bah.  They both have their place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's a lot like baked versus fried.

The attention.xml thing... interesting but don't know how it would work with three-panel newsreaders like Bloglines. I'm not necessarily interested in a post just because I skimmed the latest articles in a certain feed. I didn't know before I clicked on the feed name whether I'd be interested in the latest stuff. Much of the time I'm not interested.</p>\n<p>What I'd like to see is some smart recommendation engine that watches how I read, how much time I spend on a certain article display, whether I click through the links it has, and even provides a \"boring\" button like some other commenter suggested so it could do some Bayesian filtering. That's getting far beyond what you've described here but what you're describing is a start on it. </p>\n<p>Another somewhat different issue is that Memeorandum works by limiting itself to a certain very popular and generic set of issues. Once you have one Memeorandum for politics or tech do you need another? Might individual quirks of attention (like the fact that you are interested in Detroit and I am interested in Maui) make sharing individual attention.xmls less useful? I've never really gotten the social sharing bug though so maybe I'm just showing a lack of imagination.</p>\n<p>But just because Memeorandum already exists doesn't mean there isn't a real opportunity. While it's easy to find the hot conversations on politics and tech in the blogosphere, other domains are poorly aggregated and filtered, if at all. I follow mom blogs and feminist blogs and nothing like Memeorandum or digg or reddit exists for those yet there are regularly hot topics that ripple through them. What you describe could be used to build something for those and other domains on the web but is there room for everyone to do it individually? Or will people gravitate to one or a few sites that do a good job of highlighting popular and important conversations in certain well-defined domains?</p>\n<p>These are just my raw thoughts on it... your ideas are inspiring.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085104\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://philwilson.org/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=abb5e982d97d7539860141b7904ba31a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://philwilson.org/blog/\">Phil Wilson</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085104\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-04T16:38:10\">2006-01-04T16:38:10</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Presumably your subscription list needs to be of a certain size before you can start extracting interesting URLs or you'll just have 20 URLs mentioned twice and 50 URLs mentioned once.</p>\n<p>If you were to just read the short head of your popular items list, would this actually be encouraging people to be infovores rather than normal information consumers (where you read or at least skim all of the items in your aggregator)? i.e. the data only starts working for you when you collect enough feeds.

The attention.xml thing... interesting but don't know how it would work with three-panel newsreaders like Bloglines. I'm not necessarily interested in a post just because I skimmed the latest articles in a certain feed. I didn't know before I clicked on the feed name whether I'd be interested in the latest stuff. Much of the time I'm not interested.</p>\n\n<p>What I'd like to see is some smart recommendation engine that watches how I read, how much time I spend on a certain article display, whether I click through the links it has, and even provides a \"boring\" button like some other commenter suggested so it could do some Bayesian filtering. That's getting far beyond what you've described here but what you're describing is a start on it. </p>\n\n<p>Another somewhat different issue is that Memeorandum works by limiting itself to a certain very popular and generic set of issues. Once you have one Memeorandum for politics or tech do you need another? Might individual quirks of attention (like the fact that you are interested in Detroit and I am interested in Maui) make sharing individual attention.xmls less useful? I've never really gotten the social sharing bug though so maybe I'm just showing a lack of imagination.</p>\n\n<p>But just because Memeorandum already exists doesn't mean there isn't a real opportunity. While it's easy to find the hot conversations on politics and tech in the blogosphere, other domains are poorly aggregated and filtered, if at all. I follow mom blogs and feminist blogs and nothing like Memeorandum or digg or reddit exists for those yet there are regularly hot topics that ripple through them. What you describe could be used to build something for those and other domains on the web but is there room for everyone to do it individually? Or will people gravitate to one or a few sites that do a good job of highlighting popular and important conversations in certain well-defined domains?</p>\n\n<p>These are just my raw thoughts on it... your ideas are inspiring.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085104\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://philwilson.org/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=abb5e982d97d7539860141b7904ba31a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://philwilson.org/blog/\">Phil Wilson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085104\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-04T16:38:10\">2006-01-04T16:38:10</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Presumably your subscription list needs to be of a certain size before you can start extracting interesting URLs or you'll just have 20 URLs mentioned twice and 50 URLs mentioned once.</p>\n\n<p>If you were to just read the short head of your popular items list, would this actually be encouraging people to be infovores rather than normal information consumers (where you read or at least skim all of the items in your aggregator)? i.e. the data only starts working for you when you collect enough feeds.

    "html": "<p>Part of the reason this whole <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/10/27/extend.html\">must ignore</a> thing with respect to feeds has me <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/13/feedmagick-the-feed-filter-that-doesnt-know-much-about-feeds\">a bit fired up</a> is because it seems like so few feed processing tools out there embrace this idea.  And because of that, these tools are unfortunately brittle and prone to future shock.</p>\n<p>For example, take <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb\"><code>Syndication.framework</code> on OS X</a>:  Amongst the monkeys and ninjas and pirates and robots, you&#39;ve got your standard <em>title-date-link-description</em> columns with a few other bits for good measure.  But, where&#39;s the data from <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/static/iTunesRSS.html\">iTunes RSS extensions</a>?  Nowhere, gone, lost.  If it was in the feed when <code>Syndication.framework</code> found it, it wasn&#39;t understood and so it wasn&#39;t retained after the parser finished chewing up and spitting the data into that DB table.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/building-a-proper-shared-syndication-feed-foundation\">I&#39;ve written about shared feed processing foundations before</a>, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve totally gotten the idea to gel in my head until now.  Here&#39;s the thing:  If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.  Rather than intrusively breaking apart and recasting feed data into a predetermined data structure, you&#39;ve got to remain hands-off as much as possible.</p>\n<p>This is what I did in <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a>.  This code can subscribe to feeds, poll feed data periodically, and even work out which items in a feed are new—but it punts on everything else by only caring about where a feed starts and ends, and where its individual entries start and end.  <em>The rest is left in its original XML form.</em>  So, if there was data in there for iTunes?  It&#39;s still there, because <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a> didn&#39;t know enough to do anything to it.</p>\n<p>This is the major difference in feed processing model.  <code>Syndication.framework</code> loses information when it encounters things it doesn&#39;t understand.  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a> retains the information, because it leaves things alone when it doesn&#39;t know any better.</p>\n<p>Now, this is not to pick on just <code>Syndication.framework</code>.  Despite the general-sounding name,  this framework is pretty much just around to power <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/\">Safari RSS</a> and not <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/\">iTunes</a> or anything else.  And as I said, pretty much every other feed processing framework and tool works in this manner.  Just about everybody uses a destructive process when they parse and marshal feed data into local-idiom structures.  </p>\n<p>And this destructive process is fine when all you want to do is satisfy a specific purpose—display a few headlines, for example.  But if you&#39;re trying to build general-case feed plumbing, this is unacceptable and untenable.  If most everything in a feed item gets lost as it goes through a pipeline, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/05/the-right-place-for-data-in-your-feed\">we might as well abandon feed extensions entirely in favor of microformats stuffed into the <code>description</code> tag</a>—an idea to which I&#39;m not <em>entirely</em> opposed.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, consider this:  This past summer, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/four-thoughts-on-ms-rss-so-far\">Microsoft released an architectural overview about an OS-wide RSS framework in the upcoming Vista</a>.  Unfortunately, like many RSS and Vista related things from this past summer, all links have evaporated into a redirect to a single developers portal.  I can&#39;t figure out why they didn&#39;t just <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/rss/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/rsssupportinlonghorn.asp\">redirect over to here</a>, which took me a search and a few clicks to rediscover.</p>\n<p>At any rate, there&#39;s one sentence in this overview that gives me hope for RSS as a general service in Windows Vista:  </p>\n<p>&quot;<em>It is also possible to access the item XML for applications that want to perform operations on the XML instead of using the item&#39;s properties.</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>So, dig that.  If it works the way I hope it does, RSS in Vista will take care of the subscriptions for you, poll the feed data, grab new stuff—but then it leaves the data intact for you to process whatever new and unanticipated feed payloads that may arrive.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s how it <em>should</em> work.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084486\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=622a34307765c2f7c1dfdc7345842418&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\">Darren Chamberlain</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-13T15:03:07\">2005-12-13T15:03:07</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n<p>If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.

    "body": "Part of the reason this whole [must ignore][mi] thing with respect to feeds has me [a bit fired up][fir] is because it seems like so few feed processing tools out there embrace this idea.  And because of that, these tools are unfortunately brittle and prone to future shock.\r\n\r\nFor example, take [`Syndication.framework` on OS X][sx]:  Amongst the monkeys and ninjas and pirates and robots, you've got your standard *title-date-link-description* columns with a few other bits for good measure.  But, where's the data from [iTunes RSS extensions][ir]?  Nowhere, gone, lost.  If it was in the feed when `Syndication.framework` found it, it wasn't understood and so it wasn't retained after the parser finished chewing up and spitting the data into that DB table.\r\n\r\n[I've written about shared feed processing foundations before][sf], but I don't think I've totally gotten the idea to gel in my head until now.  Here's the thing:  If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.  Rather than intrusively breaking apart and recasting feed data into a predetermined data structure, you've got to remain hands-off as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThis is what I did in [FeedSpool][fs].  This code can subscribe to feeds, poll feed data periodically, and even work out which items in a feed are new—but it punts on everything else by only caring about where a feed starts and ends, and where its individual entries start and end.  *The rest is left in its original XML form.*  So, if there was data in there for iTunes?  It's still there, because [FeedSpool][fs] didn't know enough to do anything to it.\r\n\r\nThis is the major difference in feed processing model.  `Syndication.framework` loses information when it encounters things it doesn't understand.  [FeedSpool][fs] retains the information, because it leaves things alone when it doesn't know any better.\r\n\r\nNow, this is not to pick on just `Syndication.framework`.  Despite the general-sounding name,  this framework is pretty much just around to power [Safari RSS][sr] and not [iTunes][itp] or anything else.  And as I said, pretty much every other feed processing framework and tool works in this manner.  Just about everybody uses a destructive process when they parse and marshal feed data into local-idiom structures.  \r\n\r\nAnd this destructive process is fine when all you want to do is satisfy a specific purpose—display a few headlines, for example.  But if you're trying to build general-case feed plumbing, this is unacceptable and untenable.  If most everything in a feed item gets lost as it goes through a pipeline, [we might as well abandon feed extensions entirely in favor of microformats stuffed into the `description` tag][fmf]—an idea to which I'm not *entirely* opposed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, consider this:  This past summer, [Microsoft released an architectural overview about an OS-wide RSS framework in the upcoming Vista][ao].  Unfortunately, like many RSS and Vista related things from this past summer, all links have evaporated into a redirect to a single developers portal.  I can't figure out why they didn't just [redirect over to here][he], which took me a search and a few clicks to rediscover.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, there's one sentence in this overview that gives me hope for RSS as a general service in Windows Vista:  \r\n\r\n\"*It is also possible to access the item XML for applications that want to perform operations on the XML instead of using the item's properties.*\"\r\n\r\nSo, dig that.  If it works the way I hope it does, RSS in Vista will take care of the subscriptions for you, poll the feed data, grab new stuff—but then it leaves the data intact for you to process whatever new and unanticipated feed payloads that may arrive.\r\n\r\nThat's how it *should* work.\r\n\r\n[fmf]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/05/the-right-place-for-data-in-your-feed\r\n[itp]: http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/\r\n[fir]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/13/feedmagick-the-feed-filter-that-doesnt-know-much-about-feeds\r\n[sr]: http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/\r\n[he]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/rss/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/rsssupportinlonghorn.asp\r\n[tc]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/integrated/\r\n[ao]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/four-thoughts-on-ms-rss-so-far\r\n[fs]: http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\r\n[ir]: http://phobos.apple.com/static/iTunesRSS.html\r\n[sx]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb\r\n[sf]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/building-a-proper-shared-syndication-feed-foundation\r\n[mi]: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/10/27/extend.html\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084486\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=622a34307765c2f7c1dfdc7345842418&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\">Darren Chamberlain</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-13T15:03:07\">2005-12-13T15:03:07</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n  <p>If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.

But, with respect to their filtering and conversion, check out these feeds:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>http://del.icio.us/rss/deusx</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/RSS0.91</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/RSS1.0</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/RSS2.0</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/ATOM0.3</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you compare these to each other, you'll find information loss and even just plain corruption.  The <code>dc:subject</code> elements encoding del.icio.us tags are gone, even in the RSS-1.0-to-RSS-1.0 transformation.  And somehow, in the Atom version, they managed to jumble up titles and authors.  Granted, my stuff doesn't do <em>conversion</em> yet, but I wouldn't want to do it like this.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't tried it yet, but I'd have to guess that a podcast feed with iTunes and/or Yahoo! Media elements would get mangled in a very nasty way.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084496\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://boston.conman.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bbb1c69b64019a3df907c3545186f907&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://boston.conman.org/\">Sean Conner</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084496\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-13T22:34:35\">2005-12-13T22:34:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Wow, is it <em>really</em> 1985 again?

Now that there is a way to view video the same way ... that’s going to accelerate that new type of user generated content as well. I’m positive.

I&#39;ve also started hacking together feeds for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/13/internet-tv-wheres-the-feed\">great online video shows which lack feeds</a>.  And then, there&#39;s the occasional private hack I&#39;ve done to record shows with a capture card or help catch up on TV shows I find on Usenet.  </p>\n<p>To watch all of these things in the living room, I use <a href=\"http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/\">Xbox Media Center</a> on my modded Xbox, networked to a file server in the basement.  However, there are probably very few other people on the planet who&#39;d bother setting up a rig like mine.

You could even subscribe via WINKsite and get it all on your mobile phone…</blockquote>\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.surfarama.com/index.php?p=242\">Surfarama » RSS for serialized content</a></small>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been toying around with a few ideas for something like this for a few years, but have never bothered to finish any of them.  <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008220.html\">Russell Beattie</a> had an interesting implementation of this too.</p>\n<p>But, just in case I never actually <em>do</em> anything with this notion, here&#39;s a free idea—I wonder how many aggregators actually obey a <code>301 Moved Permanently</code> HTTP status code?  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/09/01/track\">Simon Willison wrote about this notion</a>: A reader subscribes using a clean and simple feed URL, but the aggregator receives a <code>301</code> redirect upon the first <code>GET</code>.  This redirect shifts the subscription over to a new feed URL with a unique ID for the reader, thereby uniquely tagging every new subscription to the feed.  The aggregator should then continue to use this tagged URL for all future requests.</p>\n<p>However, tagging a subscriber with an RSS radio collar implies that you&#39;ll have a database on the server maintaining notes tied to those IDs.  That might be cool if I&#39;m trying to gather some metrics, but for simple time-release syndication I don&#39;t really care about tracking a <em>person*.  I want to track a *start time</em>.  </p>\n<p>What if this post-redirect feed URL had the time of initial redirect in it, and the time release was just a function of the duration since that initial redirect?  Anonymous and no need for a database.  My notion is that I&#39;ll just need a PHP script and a fully-formed &quot;master feed&quot; on which the time-release feed will be a time-bounded &quot;viewport&quot; informed by a little date math.  </p>\n<p>Or, maybe I&#39;ll have a pile of pre-prepared content in a folder and munge that into a feed.  Imagine a podcast like <a href=\"http://www.project-daemon.net/\">Scott Sigler&#39;s Ancestor</a>, all queued up and ready on the server, but doled out automatically on a weekly basis from the beginning from the point you subscribed.

    "body": "<blockquote cite=\"http://www.surfarama.com/index.php?p=242\">Want to read Cory Doctorow’s new book, Someone comes to Town, Someone leaves Town, via RSS?<br /><br />This chicklet will let you do just that…doesn’t matter when you first subscribe, this feed will deliver the book to your feed reader in the right order, a couple of chapters a day, over the next month. You could even subscribe via WINKsite and get it all on your mobile phone…</blockquote>\r\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.surfarama.com/index.php?p=242\">Surfarama » RSS for serialized content</a></small>\r\n\r\nI've been toying around with a few ideas for something like this for a few years, but have never bothered to finish any of them.  [Russell Beattie][rb] had an interesting implementation of this too.\r\n\r\nBut, just in case I never actually *do* anything with this notion, here's a free idea—I wonder how many aggregators actually obey a `301 Moved Permanently` HTTP status code?  \r\n\r\n[Simon Willison wrote about this notion][sw]: A reader subscribes using a clean and simple feed URL, but the aggregator receives a `301` redirect upon the first `GET`.  This redirect shifts the subscription over to a new feed URL with a unique ID for the reader, thereby uniquely tagging every new subscription to the feed.  The aggregator should then continue to use this tagged URL for all future requests.\r\n\r\nHowever, tagging a subscriber with an RSS radio collar implies that you'll have a database on the server maintaining notes tied to those IDs.  That might be cool if I'm trying to gather some metrics, but for simple time-release syndication I don't really care about tracking a *person*.  I want to track a *start time*.  \r\n\r\nWhat if this post-redirect feed URL had the time of initial redirect in it, and the time release was just a function of the duration since that initial redirect?  Anonymous and no need for a database.  My notion is that I'll just need a PHP script and a fully-formed \"master feed\" on which the time-release feed will be a time-bounded \"viewport\" informed by a little date math.  \r\n\r\nOr, maybe I'll have a pile of pre-prepared content in a folder and munge that into a feed.  Imagine a podcast like [Scott Sigler's Ancestor][anc], all queued up and ready on the server, but doled out automatically on a weekly basis from the beginning from the point you subscribed.  I'll leave as exercises for the reader issues of \"obfuscating\" URLs so that people can't easily skip ahead through the story.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: rss atom syndication rest http podcasting -->\r\n\r\n[anc]: http://www.project-daemon.net/\r\n[sw]: http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/09/01/track\r\n[rb]: http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008220.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086694\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086694\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-21T04:16:34\">2005-10-21T04:16:34</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>My favorite example of this is Matt Webb's service which offers <a href=\"http://interconnected.org/home/more/lightcone/\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS feed of your personal light cone</a></p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086695\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a0b347907bfaf05694805210ec595d6c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Martin Atkins</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086695\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-21T07:06:00\">2005-10-21T07:06:00</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>This scheme falls down in two ways.

After an initial warm-up phase where I liked it, I decided it's not for me, and the app feels very, very beta to me. Not that it has errors, but it's doing very little to be actually helpful. Especially after an import I feel pretty much lost. Everything is new, no way to mark stuff as read. Upon revisiting everything is unmarked again. No way to scan snippets. That which is there maybe nice, but it's not useful enough to get me to switch.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085371\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.8dot3.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2d870e8df3af0d62fa636b336b17cd60&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.8dot3.com\">Nick</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085371\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-09T03:13:04\">2005-10-09T03:13:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Yeah, it's not quite perfect, but it's also a Google LABS project.

On the one hand, producing something like XML using &quot;proper&quot; DOM invocations and handwavings seems like the &quot;correct&quot; thing to do.  Yet, on the other hand, using a templating system lets me get down to business much more quickly and with much more clarity and succinct code.  </p>\n<p>Yeah, templates provide a range of flexibility sufficient to aim the barrel at your own toes, while an API like the XML DOM keeps everything on the rails--but sometimes you know where you&#39;re going and don&#39;t need the rails to get you there.  Furthermore, isn&#39;t it possible to make a template system that Does The Right Thing?</p>\n<p>Anyway, it&#39;s rather apparent that I&#39;m solidly in favor of templates:  After all, a book of mine just hit the shelves which is just rife with template-based generation of RSS and Atom feeds.  </p>\n<p>My only issue, really, is that I feel vaguely guilty about it.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084924\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=821395fe70906c8290df7f18ac4ac6cf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">rick</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084924\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T02:27:37\">2005-09-26T02:27:37</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Ruby has the nice Builder module for this (http://builder.rubyforge.org/).

Don&#8217;t do that.\nCheck <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henri Sivonen</a>&#8217;s suggestions just published in his <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/producing-xml/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HOWTO Avoid Being Called a Bozo When Producing XML</a>. Instead of building a DOM, generate SAX events, using the program structure to ensure proper nesting &#8211; or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.\nThe emission of synthesised SAX events can be generalised by writing a datastructure-to-SAX serialiser, so that you can build your data within your language&#8217;s native datastructures prior to outputting it, for maximum comfort. (Of course you serialise piecemeal too, f.ex. by outputting the head of a feed manually, then for each item, building the data structure and immediately serialising it, then emitting the final events to complete the document.)\nDepending on the complexity of the output, you could directly emit the otuput format or feed the events into to an XSLT transform that generates the full-blown thing from an easy to generate document structure. In both cases this can be done with or without the involvement of a serialiser as middle man.\nThere are plenty of ways to make sure that the entire toolchain from one end to the other consists only of steps that conserve well-formedness, and they need not be any less convenient than using templates.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084926\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084926\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:16:35\">2005-09-26T04:16:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.</blockquote>\nAristotle:  Now here's where I think certain templating technologies get interesting, and may Do the Right Thing.  My so-far-favorite templating kit, ZPT, wants well-formed XML as templates--although I think that restriction is unfortunately relaxed as a nod to HTML.  On the other hand, my possibly-new-favorite templating kit, Kid, [demands well-formed XML as templates](http://lesscode.org/projects/kid/wiki/KidFaq#must-templates-be-well-formed-xml).\nIn case you haven't played with them, these two template languages center around the idea that certain attributes on elements define where content provided in a data structure should be inserted / swapped in by the template engine.  The engine handles character encodings and such to ensure that the well-formed template results in a well-formed document.\nDoes this match up with what you say up there?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084928\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084928\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:28:49\">2005-09-26T04:28:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I guess the other thing that bugs me about constructing documents via DOM or via generating SAX events—which I'd first discovered in <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/12/py-xml.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this XML.com article by Uche Ogbuji</a>—is how awkward and removed it is from the view-source XML I've gotten used to hacking around with.

I confess I actually kind of liked <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI.pm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CGI.pm</a> &#8211; because nesting is automatically taken care of without so much typing of end tags, and you can seamlessly weave <code>map</code>s into the code for output loops.\nI have to note though that I used it as a sort of template language in its own right &#8211; I never littered <code>print</code>s all over my code, I kept all the calls in a single place, in fact, usually a single expression. That is also why I find it strange that people create template languages for PHP, which was itself born as a template language. What matters is that the output generation is separate from the processing logic, whether or not the template and the code are in different languages.\nAnyway, I digress.\nWhat I wanted to say is, no, I hadn&#8217;t seen either ZPT or Kid. I had put off reading the lesscode.org article you quoted and went back to it after responding here. Now that I&#8217;ve read it, I admit I&#8217;m intrigued.

Logic and presentation in separate blocks / files / etc.  And then, my take is that if you're going to have your presentation/view separate from the logic/controller, you may as well code the presentation in a form as close to the goal as possible (ie. in XML or HTML, not in s-expressions or the logic implementation idiom)—especially since oftimes you've got separate people or teams working primarily on each.\nI suspect, however, that a templating system like Kid goes quite a ways toward solving the problem of \"gluing strings together\".

Problem is, I haven't gotten much closer now, but I figured I'd at least post a few thoughts and conjure up a vague sketch of the issue.\r\n\r\nYou see, I think it all goes back to [thoughts about which I posted almost three years ago][lazy].  On the one hand, producing something like XML using \"proper\" DOM invocations and handwavings seems like the \"correct\" thing to do.  Yet, on the other hand, using a templating system lets me get down to business much more quickly and with much more clarity and succinct code.  \r\n\r\nYeah, templates provide a range of flexibility sufficient to aim the barrel at your own toes, while an API like the XML DOM keeps everything on the rails--but sometimes you know where you're going and don't need the rails to get you there.  Furthermore, isn't it possible to make a template system that Does The Right Thing?\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's rather apparent that I'm solidly in favor of templates:  After all, a book of mine just hit the shelves which is just rife with template-based generation of RSS and Atom feeds.  \r\n\r\nMy only issue, really, is that I feel vaguely guilty about it.\r\n\r\n[lazy]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/12/13/oooced\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084924\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=821395fe70906c8290df7f18ac4ac6cf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">rick</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084924\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T02:27:37\">2005-09-26T02:27:37</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Ruby has the nice Builder module for this (http://builder.rubyforge.org/).

Don&#8217;t do that.\n\nCheck <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henri Sivonen</a>&#8217;s suggestions just published in his <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/producing-xml/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HOWTO Avoid Being Called a Bozo When Producing XML</a>. Instead of building a DOM, generate SAX events, using the program structure to ensure proper nesting &#8211; or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.\n\nThe emission of synthesised SAX events can be generalised by writing a datastructure-to-SAX serialiser, so that you can build your data within your language&#8217;s native datastructures prior to outputting it, for maximum comfort. (Of course you serialise piecemeal too, f.ex. by outputting the head of a feed manually, then for each item, building the data structure and immediately serialising it, then emitting the final events to complete the document.)\n\nDepending on the complexity of the output, you could directly emit the otuput format or feed the events into to an XSLT transform that generates the full-blown thing from an easy to generate document structure. In both cases this can be done with or without the involvement of a serialiser as middle man.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to make sure that the entire toolchain from one end to the other consists only of steps that conserve well-formedness, and they need not be any less convenient than using templates.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084926\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084926\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:16:35\">2005-09-26T04:16:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.</blockquote>\nAristotle:  Now here's where I think certain templating technologies get interesting, and may Do the Right Thing.  My so-far-favorite templating kit, ZPT, wants well-formed XML as templates--although I think that restriction is unfortunately relaxed as a nod to HTML.  On the other hand, my possibly-new-favorite templating kit, Kid, [demands well-formed XML as templates](http://lesscode.org/projects/kid/wiki/KidFaq#must-templates-be-well-formed-xml).\n\nIn case you haven't played with them, these two template languages center around the idea that certain attributes on elements define where content provided in a data structure should be inserted / swapped in by the template engine.  The engine handles character encodings and such to ensure that the well-formed template results in a well-formed document.\n\nDoes this match up with what you say up there?</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084928\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084928\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:28:49\">2005-09-26T04:28:49</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">I guess the other thing that bugs me about constructing documents via DOM or via generating SAX events—which I'd first discovered in <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/12/py-xml.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this XML.com article by Uche Ogbuji</a>—is how awkward and removed it is from the view-source XML I've gotten used to hacking around with.

Logic and presentation in separate blocks / files / etc.  And then, my take is that if you're going to have your presentation/view separate from the logic/controller, you may as well code the presentation in a form as close to the goal as possible (ie. in XML or HTML, not in s-expressions or the logic implementation idiom)—especially since oftimes you've got separate people or teams working primarily on each.\n\nI suspect, however, that a templating system like Kid goes quite a ways toward solving the problem of \"gluing strings together\".

Your MT installation permitted Markdown but no literal tags, which caught me off guard once or twice until I noticed. But thankfully it had a preview button, so I could figure it out.

Often people want me to switch to templates.  At the moment, when you want to radically change the HTML for the stuff that is not the wiki content, ie. headers and footers, you need to override the Perl subs that I provide.  Somehow that strikes me as natural and easy, but many of my users seem to disagree, preferring to learn a templating system instead of learning to write Perl code.  I'm still undecided about the issue.  At the moment I'm still sticking to the \"write Perl code instead of templating\" because being able to write Perl code will make so many other task easy.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084938\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084938\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-27T11:31:23\">2005-09-27T11:31:23</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Alex:  Well, from my perspective, I've worked on a lot of teams where you've essentially got two roles—software engineer (SE) and interface engineer (IE).

I did manage to make [a quick announcement of authorship][announce], but thereafter only managed to emerge for a few [quick thought dumps][quick].\r\n\r\nI think part of my silence about things stemmed from a reticence to talk about or promise anything before I'd written it--and also because this has been my first time doing anything like this and I didn't want to flub anything up along the way.  How I might've done that, who knows?  But, I got a bit too busy to really worry about superstitions as the deadlines rolled on.\r\n\r\nBut now, it's out!  And [you should buy it!][buy]  Lookee, lookee:  It's already got a 5-star review from someone I don't even know!\r\n\r\nFor the moment, I'm going to wrap up this post, finish my dinner, and go for a walk with the girl--but, when we get back, I think I might post a few more details on what you'll find in my book debut. \r\n\r\n[buy]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1\r\n[announce]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/07/belated-happy-new-year\r\n[quick]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/02/19/writing-no-things-of-epic-import\r\n[dec04]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/12/\r\n[book]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/04/25/hacking-rss-and-atom-is-a-real-book\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082500\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://monkey.org/~jose/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d74863ca9c7785cd396379766095036c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://monkey.org/~jose/\">jose</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082500\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-14T01:03:36\">2005-09-14T01:03:36</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">congrats, les, if anyone should have written that book it's you. i'm glad to see it's hit the shelves .. now to go find a copy and look it over :)</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082501\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://stingthebee.nu\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0c6c4240507baf594a95fd3b25b975d2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://stingthebee.nu\">Jim Renaud</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082501\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-14T01:54:39\">2005-09-14T01:54:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Congrats Les.
