Well, I thought it was cool. :)\nI released the XmlRpcToWiki for two Wikis, TWiki and ?UseModWiki.  I'm aiming for MoinMoin next, and I might even be nutty and convert from TWiki to MoinMoin for usage here.\nStarted doing the dogfood thing and have been using MailToRSS (based on Caffinate) on a daily basis in my Radio UserLand feed.  Seems pretty useful.  Going to clean a few things up, upload some files, and bump those two projects up into the \"Available\" category and make a release.\nI ripped the Wiki's style-sheet off and went back to plain old, unadulterated default style.  I might try again with a few tweaks, but best to let wikis be.\nThinking I'm going to set aim on the WeblogMulticaster next.\nI'll have more to write soon.",

They should, at first, run just fine on my laptop Apache installation or out on the 0xDECAFBAD servers.  Eventually I might write the overarching DesktopWebAppServer that provides another shell within which they can reside, but I have to get away from my year-long hermitage arcs of development where I make really cool things and get 75% of the way done and then abandon them.\n\nOkay.  Nevermind work, it's time to go home.  Wheee!\n\n(Grr, and ?TextRouter keeps \"helpfully\" escaping all my HTML tags with entities.  Have to do more digging to work out how to stop that.)",
