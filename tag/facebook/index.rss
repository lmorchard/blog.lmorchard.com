          <title>Separating publishing from hosting on the web</title>
          <description>Social media like Twitter and Facebook combine web publishing and hosting. You can’t run different software, and you can’t move your stuff. So, if you’re unhappy, your choices are a) deal with it or b) abandon your stuff and your friends. Those are pretty rough options.
But, what if you could move your stuff? And what if you could switch apps?</description>

          <title>Microblogging like it&amp;#8217;s 2002</title>
          <description>Every year or so, I (re)join the ranks of hackers who decide they’d like to try building a microblogging tool. It’s sometimes after Twitter or Facebook does something cruddy to remind me that I’m the product. Sometimes, it’s when jerks have the run of the place and no one can do anything about it. Often these things are highly correlated.</description>

          <title>Privacy and Social Media</title>
          <description>Somewhat apropos of what I posted recently about freedoms, there’s been a kerfuffle about Facebook and privacy (again). A particular post I just read kind of set me off, so I decided to expand on a comment I left there.</description>

          <title>Half-formed thoughts about Twitter, social silos, web APIs, and mashups</title>
          <description>TL;DR: Turns out, the way to derive value from web APIs is to let your community run off and do free research and development. Harvest the results, and profit. We were never promised participation, but it felt like it was a 2-way street. Silly us. Where do we go from here?</description>
