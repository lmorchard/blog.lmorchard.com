    "html": "<p>From <a href=\"http://greenmonk.net/?p=111\">Greenmonk: The Blog - Cherish The AIR? Just because you can doesn’t mean you should</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...the core idea that should be upheld by companies like Apple should be about making things better and less often. Making things that will be able to evolve, be upgraded, be adaptable, hackable and more fun to use for longer so that as a customer I don’t think that I’m buying version 3.4 of something that will only be as good as it’s last press release. I want to buy “the” quintessential Apple product and cherish it for years, like people would cherish a vintage car.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://describe.blogspot.com/2008/10/upgrade-treadmill-is-wearing-us-out.html\">De-Scribed: The upgrade treadmill is wearing us out</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Replace &quot;quintessential Apple product&quot; with pretty much &quot;any product&quot; (use your imagination) and you start to get at a shift in both attitude and culture that would solve a lot of problems. Get off the upgrade treadmill. There are already too many others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When&#39;s the last time you upgraded your watch to one with a more reliable chronometer?  Bought a new pen with a better ink formulation or superior delivery mechanism?  You may, of course, <a href=\"http://delicious.com/deusx/pens\">be an exception</a>—but there are a lot of other personal artifacts that have reached similar plateaus for most, where the classic vintage version is every bit as useful as the modern iteration.</p>\n<p>I keep wondering when personal computers will hit a flat spot in Moore&#39;s Law.  Or, failing that, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Computer-Products-Information-Appliances/dp/0262640414/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1224345788&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20\">when the capabilities and usability of such a machine meet and surpass any reasonable owner&#39;s practical demands to the point where fashion and style become the selling features</a>.  I think we&#39;re almost there—actually, we&#39;re probably there now for most people who aren&#39;t me.</p>\n<p>Beyond the constantly growing demands of gaming, it seems like most personal computers now can do most of what anyone wants them to do.  Even for me, this last-gen MacBook Pro feels like the best computer I&#39;ve owned to date, and strangely enough I&#39;m hesitant to think about upgrades for awhile this time.

    "body": "From [Greenmonk: The Blog - Cherish The AIR? Just because you can doesn’t mean you should](http://greenmonk.net/?p=111):\r\n\r\n> ...the core idea that should be upheld by companies like Apple should be about making things better and less often. Making things that will be able to evolve, be upgraded, be adaptable, hackable and more fun to use for longer so that as a customer I don’t think that I’m buying version 3.4 of something that will only be as good as it’s last press release. I want to buy “the” quintessential Apple product and cherish it for years, like people would cherish a vintage car.\r\n\r\nFrom [De-Scribed: The upgrade treadmill is wearing us out](http://describe.blogspot.com/2008/10/upgrade-treadmill-is-wearing-us-out.html):\r\n\r\n> Replace \"quintessential Apple product\" with pretty much \"any product\" (use your imagination) and you start to get at a shift in both attitude and culture that would solve a lot of problems. Get off the upgrade treadmill. There are already too many others.\r\n\r\nWhen's the last time you upgraded your watch to one with a more reliable chronometer?  Bought a new pen with a better ink formulation or superior delivery mechanism?  You may, of course, [be an exception][pens]—but there are a lot of other personal artifacts that have reached similar plateaus for most, where the classic vintage version is every bit as useful as the modern iteration.\r\n\r\nI keep wondering when personal computers will hit a flat spot in Moore's Law.  Or, failing that, [when the capabilities and usability of such a machine meet and surpass any reasonable owner's practical demands to the point where fashion and style become the selling features][invis].  I think we're almost there—actually, we're probably there now for most people who aren't me.\r\n\r\nBeyond the constantly growing demands of gaming, it seems like most personal computers now can do most of what anyone wants them to do.  Even for me, this last-gen MacBook Pro feels like the best computer I've owned to date, and strangely enough I'm hesitant to think about upgrades for awhile this time.  I like the product design, performance is very good, and I've got the memory maxed out to the point where I can run several copies of Windows in Parallels—which, itself, I think is a very weird requirement, yet still satisfied by this machine.\r\n\r\nStorage media can hold amazing amounts of personal photos and video, and will reach near-incomprehensible levels pretty soon.  Screen resolution is just about at a point where most people don't care if it gets better, and the same goes for sound.  Barring any sort of Moore's Law for finding new uses for personal computers that require significantly more power, demands for functionality will likely be completely met by even the lowest end laptop soon.\r\n\r\nSo, how long until the first new personal computer arrives that turns out to be the old beater I still use 15 years from now, or sell to a kid down the block who just got his web learner's permit?\r\n\r\n[pens]: http://delicious.com/deusx/pens\r\n[invis]: http://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Computer-Products-Information-Appliances/dp/0262640414/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1224345788&sr=1-1&tag=0xdecafbad01-20\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087999\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ciarang.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=18910207650685d4592d9a6a71528180&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ciarang.com/\">CiaranG</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087999\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-10-19T18:15:41\">2008-10-19T18:15:41</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>For the most part, I'm already there.</p>\n\n<p>I have several PCs around the house in daily use that are at least 8 years old.

Or ratings from the iPod, for that matter.  I just changed that setting to &quot;all episodes&quot;, and podcasts seem to be showing up in my Recently Played smart playlist again.  Hopefully this gets me back to where I want to be.</i></p>\n<p><strong>Update (19 Mar 2007):</strong> <i>Hmm, nope.  Recently Played playlist seems to be updating now, but the iScrobbler-to-last.fm bit seems to be ignoring my iPod-played podcasts.  Bah.</i></p>\n<p>Is it just me, or has iTunes been gradually losing podcast tuner functionality with respect to the iPod?  </p>\n<p>I&#39;m seriously thinking of ditching it for <a href=\"http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php\">Juice</a> or something else.  Recently, the podcasts were completely segregated from the rest of the audio files, stuck into a much harder-to-manage interface.  Related to that, my main gripe at the moment is that I just can&#39;t seem to get my podcast listening behavior posted to <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/user/deusx/\">last.fm</a>.  Maybe I&#39;m weird, but I like to capture and publish that attention data from myself.  </p>\n<p>I listen to a <em>lot</em> of podcasts on the commute to and from work, which is part walking and part bus.  In fact, I probably listened to about a dozen episodes of various serials yesterday — but none of them show up in my iPod&#39;s Recently Played smart playlist.  So, subsequently, none made it to <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/user/deusx/\">last.fm</a>.  </p>\n<p>On the (increasingly rare) occasions I happened to listen to music on my iPod this week, those tracks showed up just fine.  And while at my desk, in iTunes itself, I don&#39;t seem to have these issues.  I seem to remember this working better in the past year or so.  For what it&#39;s worth, my podcasts are auto-synced with iTunes, but the rest of my library is manually managed — because I don&#39;t want 20GB of music on my iPod duplicated on my laptop.</p>\n<p>At one point, I remember that the &quot;Last Played&quot; criteria changed from just <em>starting</em> a podcast to <em>completely</em> playing it through.  This made clean up of old podcasts nicer, such that partially-played episodes didn&#39;t get clobbered when I still intended to finish them.  But lately, I&#39;ve stopped podcasts before they finish, because many have lengthy themes at the end or runs of promos I&#39;ve already heard during the day.  So, there go the &quot;Last Played&quot; and &quot;Play Count&quot; fields.</p>\n<p>But, I just tried manually fast-forwarding a few podcast episodes to the end on the iPod.  I tried playing the last few seconds in an attempt to force the play count to trip.  It seemed to work on the iPod itself - but when I reconnected to iTunes, no dice.  The &quot;Recently Played&quot; playlist shows nothing new, and the episode itself reflects no play counts in iTunes.  I&#39;m either very confused, or things are getting more broken.</p>\n<p>So, I thought, maybe I&#39;ll just rate the podcasts about which I want to publish my listening behavior.  Kind of like giving a &quot;digg&quot;.  Seems hackish and not as effortless as simply capturing my behavior - but, nope, I can&#39;t rate podcasts on the iPod.  There goes that idea, and another feature missing.</p>\n<p>Ugh.  So yeah, this is an semi-inarticulate rant about a problem whose issues and solution I don&#39;t quite yet have a handle on.  It&#39;s just frustrating that I don&#39;t seem to be able to easily track my own podcast listening behavior with iTunes and the iPod the way I <em>thought</em> I used to be able to do.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083477\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dschwarz.blogspot.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b6f94d1db720fcf70469e0d29029ff64&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dschwarz.blogspot.com\">dschwarz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083477\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-09T22:29:17\">2007-03-09T22:29:17</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>As long as you're ranting about iTunes' podcast management problems, let me mention one of my pet peeves:  I subscribe to a mix of time-sensitive podcasts (news programs) and other podcasts that are not time sensitive.

I'm not seeing features in Juice that will help in this instance.  I can't help with iSproggler, not a user.  I use the iTunes Agent to manage syncs of smart playlists to non-iPod devices.  So I'm no help on the iPod firmware issues either.</p>\n<p>If there is more to your comment on switching to Juice than emotion:\nI did switch from iTunes to Juice about 6 months ago for most of my podcasts.  I kept a couple of feeds behind so I could keep tabs on the changes in behavior.  Since I'm not an iPod owner, I switched to get per feed archive management and preprocessing before import into iTunes.  The default behavior of Juice is to import podcasts into the Music portion of the Library, not the Podcast portion.  That may or may not be a feature for you.  But most of this is likely no news to you.</p>\n<p>You're not alone at feeling like there are changes going on behind the scenes in iTunes/iPod.  Since we all know that Apple can/will change behavior regularly, and some of the behavior changes are subtle, we get spooked easier/more often?</p>\n<p>OT:  Over on the PlayListMag forums there are folks swearing that the changes in behavior for iTunes 7.1, in the CoverFlow viewing mode, that play-selection navigation is not consistent...</p>\n<p>Emotion is good, use the energy...</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083485\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jm3.net/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/jm3.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jm3.net/\">John Manoogian III (jm3)</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083485\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-27T05:49:40\">2007-03-27T05:49:40</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>i don't speak from experience, here, but would songbird help the podcast situation at all?</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083486\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rss-central.net/home/megalar\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1869681b309d36e59764f51c7f210406&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rss-central.net/home/megalar\">megalar</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-31T13:50:39\">2007-03-31T13:50:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I have had nothing but headaches from itunes, thats why i switched to juice for podcasts.

I'm not seeing features in Juice that will help in this instance.  I can't help with iSproggler, not a user.  I use the iTunes Agent to manage syncs of smart playlists to non-iPod devices.  So I'm no help on the iPod firmware issues either.</p>\n\n<p>If there is more to your comment on switching to Juice than emotion:\nI did switch from iTunes to Juice about 6 months ago for most of my podcasts.  I kept a couple of feeds behind so I could keep tabs on the changes in behavior.  Since I'm not an iPod owner, I switched to get per feed archive management and preprocessing before import into iTunes.  The default behavior of Juice is to import podcasts into the Music portion of the Library, not the Podcast portion.  That may or may not be a feature for you.  But most of this is likely no news to you.</p>\n\n<p>You're not alone at feeling like there are changes going on behind the scenes in iTunes/iPod.  Since we all know that Apple can/will change behavior regularly, and some of the behavior changes are subtle, we get spooked easier/more often?</p>\n\n<p>OT:  Over on the PlayListMag forums there are folks swearing that the changes in behavior for iTunes 7.1, in the CoverFlow viewing mode, that play-selection navigation is not consistent...</p>\n\n<p>Emotion is good, use the energy...</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083485\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.jm3.net/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/jm3.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.jm3.net/\">John Manoogian III (jm3)</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083485\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-27T05:49:40\">2007-03-27T05:49:40</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>i don't speak from experience, here, but would songbird help the podcast situation at all?</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083486\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rss-central.net/home/megalar\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1869681b309d36e59764f51c7f210406&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rss-central.net/home/megalar\">megalar</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-31T13:50:39\">2007-03-31T13:50:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I have had nothing but headaches from itunes, thats why i switched to juice for podcasts.

Iin fact the software of the phone is more like a platform (openmoko) that will in the long term hopefully run on all kinds of hardware, and it decidedly different than all the other platforms, because it is not restricted to a sandbox, but allows access to all the software and hardware.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090224\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bf1e672f5e54581db4e6d45b7030d286&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Steven</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090224\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-12T19:35:44\">2007-01-12T19:35:44</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I haven't heard of a major crisis being caused by user-installed software on (1) Symbian phones, (2) Palm phones, (3) Java phones, (4) Windows phones.

Presumably, if you use (say) a USB audio output device, you could also have separate volume and balance settings for that.</p>\n<p>It's cool that, while you retain explicit control over these settings via the System Preferences, the system just behaves in a sensible way so that you never need to think about it. That's Apple for you.</p>\n<p>I mentioned it to a long-time (15+ years) Mac user who is also a usability consultant, and even he was impressed. We agreed that, on Windows, the likely consequence of plugging in a set of headphones would be a notification balloon saying \"You have inserted an alternative Audio Signal Output Device.

Presumably, if you use (say) a USB audio output device, you could also have separate volume and balance settings for that.</p>\n\n<p>It's cool that, while you retain explicit control over these settings via the System Preferences, the system just behaves in a sensible way so that you never need to think about it. That's Apple for you.</p>\n\n<p>I mentioned it to a long-time (15+ years) Mac user who is also a usability consultant, and even he was impressed. We agreed that, on Windows, the likely consequence of plugging in a set of headphones would be a notification balloon saying \"You have inserted an alternative Audio Signal Output Device. Click here to open Control Panel and configure your new settings.\" :-)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088372\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=185074bcdbbc0edba064209ecc12cf0a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Ken Mills</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088372\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-02-10T01:25:31\">2008-02-10T01:25:31</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I hit my Apple (Command?) key with my cursor over the battery status icon on the system tray at the top of my new Macbook pro and it went \"poof\" complete with cloud and sound effects.

However, this is still under AppleCare for another year or so, and I doubt they&#39;d look kindly on me pawing around inside this thing yet.

I&#39;ve even started tinkering with tagging songs using things like <code>:dreamy</code>, <code>:goofy</code>, <code>:energy</code>, <code>:calm</code> in the comments field for use with Smart Playlists.  (Yeah, I know about <a href=\"http://www.danshockley.com/tunetags.php\">TuneTags</a>, but the psuedo-XML in song comments bugs me, as does the somewhat buggy behavior of the last version of the program I tried.)</p>\n<p>By this point, I&#39;ve managed to cram about 3400 songs from our CD collection into it.  (So much for the marketing!)  With my efforts so far, a &#8220;Good Music&#8221; Smart Playlist selecting for 3-stars and above gives me around 415 songs.  This doesn&#39;t count the songs I&#39;ve rated with 1-star, which get deleted from the iPod periodically.  Also, I&#39;ve yet to get a significant proportion tagged with special comments, so mood-based and concept-based playlists are far off until I get a better tool for letting me quickly and lazily tag songs.</p>\n<p>So, this morning on the way into work I fired up my &#8220;Good Music&#8221; playlist on random for the first time, and I was amazed at how good the selection was.  Yes, I rated these songs, so I should know they&#39;re good--but so far, I&#39;ve had all 3400 songs on shuffle and have been alternating between listening and rating, skipping songs I wasn&#39;t in the mood for, and canning songs right off the bat with a 1-star rating.  So up until now, my rotation has been an <em>okay</em> experience.</p>\n<p>However, hearing that mix of consistently high rated songs was an unexpectedly good experience.  What occurred to me as I rounded the last stretch of I-75 into Detroit this morning is that this metadata and these Smart Playlists on shuffle amount to an attempt to tickle myself.  Ever try that?  For the most part, it doesn&#39;t work.  Sure, you know where you&#39;re ticklish--but if it&#39;s your hand trying to do it, you&#39;re expecting it and the tickle doesn&#39;t happen.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;m probably stepping too far into breathless pretentiousness with this, but it makes me want to think further about machine learning and intelligence.  Yeah, Smart Playlists are a very, very rudimentary form of intelligence, but it&#39;s good enough to tickle me with a music mix--which is a very real bit of value added to my life.  </p>\n<p>I wonder how much further this tickling-myself metaphor can be taken?  That is: take a machine endowed with information I produced, apply some simple or slightly complex logic with a bit of random shuffle, and feed it back to me to see if it makes me experience it with some novelty.  Someone&#39;s got to already be on top of this as a research project.  That, or it&#39;s an idea obvious or dumb enough only to appeal to me.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ipodtickles</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085227\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://home.lucid.net/ac/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=53519627a2eef585cb2e07850b812bee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://home.lucid.net/ac/\">ac</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085227\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-27T18:52:33\">2004-10-27T18:52:33</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">a smart playlist i use is one where it shows me songs that have been played 3+ times and are unrated.  i look at it periodically and then quickly rate those tunes.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085228\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.flashesofpanic.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=90c809f53e4cc380876130343366f974&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.flashesofpanic.com\">pjm</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085228\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-27T19:23:18\">2004-10-27T19:23:18</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">You should see the elaborate, nested, weighted Active Playlist I built to keep the rotation fresh on my iPod... to summarize, every song gets \"rested\" after playing, but the rest is shorter if the rating is higher.

I never thought about the wishlist thing in those terms, but it fits!\nI'm actually starting to think this might be a good way to handle information overload.

(ie. 611 RSS feeds I've subscribed to)\nI couldn't possibly process everything from the firehose, so a jug or two from it is better than nothing-- and a swig fuzzily selected from the better parts is better still.  \nThe idea is not to even try to get everything, but make the best of what I can actually use in a particular context.

Wondering how hard it would be to come up with a little assistant that asked at each transition between songs, \"Was that a good transition?\"  You give a thumbs up / thumbs down, or maybe some stars, and after awhile the thing can start building playlists.\nUnfortunately for me, the Party Shuffle mode isn't available for use when playing songs off the iPod in iTunes.

Like, establish some rules or set up some learning (ie. bayes or whatnot), toss in a shuffle, and filter a firehose through it.   (ie. 611 RSS feeds I've subscribed to)\r\n\r\nI couldn't possibly process everything from the firehose, so a jug or two from it is better than nothing-- and a swig fuzzily selected from the better parts is better still.  \r\n\r\nThe idea is not to even try to get everything, but make the best of what I can actually use in a particular context.

    "summary": "<p>I&apos;ve had an iPod for a little over a week now, and I&apos;ve been working pretty diligently to rate every song I hear and trying to make sure all the metadata is correct.  I&apos;ve even started tinkering with tagging songs using things like <code>:dreamy</code>, <code>:goofy</code>, <code>:energy</code>, <code>:calm</code> in the comments field for use with Smart Playlists.  (Yeah, I know about <a href=\"http://www.danshockley.com/tunetags.php\">TuneTags</a>, but the psuedo-XML in song comments bugs me, as does the somewhat buggy behavior of the last version of the program I tried.)</p>\n<p>By this point, I&apos;ve managed to cram about 3400 songs from our CD collection into it.  (So much for the marketing!)  With my efforts so far, a &#x201C;Good Music&#x201D; Smart Playlist selecting for 3-stars and above gives me around 415 songs.  This doesn&apos;t count the songs I&apos;ve rated with 1-star, which get deleted from the iPod periodically.  Also, I&apos;ve yet to get a significant proportion tagged with special comments, so mood-based and concept-based playlists are far off until I get a better tool for letting me quickly and lazily tag songs.</p>\n<p>So, this morning on the way into work I fired up my &#x201C;Good Music&#x201D; playlist on random for the first time, and I was amazed at how good the selection was.  Yes, I rated these songs, so I should know they&apos;re good--but so far, I&apos;ve had all 3400 songs on shuffle and have been alternating between listening and rating, skipping songs I wasn&apos;t in the mood for, and canning songs right off the bat with a 1-star rating.  So up until now, my rotation has been an <em>okay</em> experience.</p>\n<p>However, hearing that mix of consistently high rated songs was an unexpectedly good experience.  What occurred to me as I rounded the last stretch of I-75 into Detroit this morning is that this metadata and these Smart Playlists on shuffle amount to an attempt to tickle myself.  Ever try that?  For the most part, it doesn&apos;t work.  Sure, you know where you&apos;re ticklish--but if it&apos;s your hand trying to do it, you&apos;re expecting it and the tickle doesn&apos;t happen.  </p>\n<p>I&apos;m probably stepping too far into breathless pretentiousness with this, but it makes me want to think further about machine learning and intelligence.  Yeah, Smart Playlists are a very, very rudimentary form of intelligence, but it&apos;s good enough to tickle me with a music mix--which is a very real bit of value added to my life.  </p>\n<p>I wonder how much further this tickling-myself metaphor can be taken?  That is: take a machine endowed with information I produced, apply some simple or slightly complex logic with a bit of random shuffle, and feed it back to me to see if it makes me experience it with some novelty.  Someone&apos;s got to already be on top of this as a research project.  That, or it&apos;s an idea obvious or dumb enough only to appeal to me.</p>\n",

    "html": "<p>So I finally got myself an iPod, thanks to <a href=\"http://missadroit.livejournal.com\">The Girl</a>.  </p>\n<p>Through various twists of replacement policy and iBook promotional antics, somehow she ended up with two 20GB 4G iPods, both of which she&#39;s been planning to sell off on eBay to end up with some cash and an iPod Mini.  Well, it finally occurred to me this weekend that I needed to buy one of those iPods.</p>\n<p>Lately, I&#39;ve been only been listening to streaming radio at work, since I don&#39;t really have the hard drive space on my PowerBook for music, and loading up the work PC with MP3s is pretty unpalatable.  I miss the days when I had a 40GB library at work, but between company policy where I am now and having lost that whole library in a hard drive crash back then, I&#39;m hesitant to go there again.</p>\n<p>Enter the iPod.  I was reminded of its presence in The Girl&#39;s office, still boxed up and shrink-wrapped, at a moment when I was thinking about podcasting and thinking about my lack of hard drive space.  So, I gave in and snapped it up.  </p>\n<p>Thus far, I&#39;m pretty happy.  Sure, I&#39;d been looking at the larger capacity models that came with a dock and remote, but this one was the right price at the right place and the right time.  I was also lucky that she had an iTrip she was selling that just happened to work satisfactorily for playing MP3s in my car - something that&#39;s been a bit of a quest of mine for years.  While it&#39;s true I do have an in-dash Blaupunkt MP3 CD player in my Ford Focus now, it&#39;s also true that 20GB certainly outweighs 700MB.</p>\n<p>The few snags I&#39;ve run into so far mostly have to do with the fact that it seems like my desired usage pattern of the iPod isn&#39;t <em>quite</em> supported.  See, I don&#39;t want to have a massive library on my PowerBook, to be synched in part onto my iPod.  I have a library on a file server at home, and I want to use the iPod alternately as a music store away from home for iTunes on my PowerBook and as an MP3 player while I&#39;m driving.  I don&#39;t want any music at all on my PowerBook.  Problem is, though, the iPod isn&#39;t <em>quite</em> a first-class citizen in iTunes.  Party Shuffle doesn&#39;t work, and I had a few problems with making sure metadata (like ratings and last played date) made it into iTunes.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and I wish they&#39;d turn down the wheel sensitivity <strong>way</strong> down when setting a song&#39;s rating.  At present, it&#39;s just a bare millimeter of a finger&#39;s twitch to leap from 1 to 5 stars.  Might just be me.</p>\n<p>But, for the most part, I&#39;m very happy to have my own music at work again, and the potential of tinkering with smart playlists and podcasts are exciting to me.  That, and the fourth-generation iPod is just an elegant, slick joy to hold.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ipodismine</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085752\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085752\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-19T16:34:59\">2004-10-19T16:34:59</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Congrats--if you'd like a free license for PodWorks (http://www.scifihifi.com/podworks), let me know :-).</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085753\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://anal-control-freak.blogspot.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=83a50ab0ae4f845bb1352b56c47e33fd&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://anal-control-freak.blogspot.com/\">C</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085753\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-19T21:35:43\">2004-10-19T21:35:43</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">No, its not just you.\nThe rating sensitivity is way too high, trying to set four stars, while half awake on the morning commute, is a near impossibility.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085755\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jarretthousenorth.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9b8a07841271125f202091afe761e510&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jarretthousenorth.com\">Tim Jarrett</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085755\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-20T09:33:47\">2004-10-20T09:33:47</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Agree about the sensitivity of the wheel in general. Regarding your usage, have you thought about moving your PowerBook's iTunes Library file to your file server? You could then manage the iPod from the file server's library. If you still want to be able to sync the iPod on the go, you might set up a separate account on your PowerBook whose iTunes Library is local and use fast user switching to go back and forth when you want to sync.

    "body": "So I finally got myself an iPod, thanks to [The Girl](http://missadroit.livejournal.com).  \r\n\r\nThrough various twists of replacement policy and iBook promotional antics, somehow she ended up with two 20GB 4G iPods, both of which she's been planning to sell off on eBay to end up with some cash and an iPod Mini.  Well, it finally occurred to me this weekend that I needed to buy one of those iPods.\r\n\r\nLately, I've been only been listening to streaming radio at work, since I don't really have the hard drive space on my PowerBook for music, and loading up the work PC with MP3s is pretty unpalatable.  I miss the days when I had a 40GB library at work, but between company policy where I am now and having lost that whole library in a hard drive crash back then, I'm hesitant to go there again.\r\n\r\nEnter the iPod.  I was reminded of its presence in The Girl's office, still boxed up and shrink-wrapped, at a moment when I was thinking about podcasting and thinking about my lack of hard drive space.  So, I gave in and snapped it up.  \r\n\r\nThus far, I'm pretty happy.  Sure, I'd been looking at the larger capacity models that came with a dock and remote, but this one was the right price at the right place and the right time.  I was also lucky that she had an iTrip she was selling that just happened to work satisfactorily for playing MP3s in my car - something that's been a bit of a quest of mine for years.  While it's true I do have an in-dash Blaupunkt MP3 CD player in my Ford Focus now, it's also true that 20GB certainly outweighs 700MB.\r\n\r\nThe few snags I've run into so far mostly have to do with the fact that it seems like my desired usage pattern of the iPod isn't *quite* supported.  See, I don't want to have a massive library on my PowerBook, to be synched in part onto my iPod.  I have a library on a file server at home, and I want to use the iPod alternately as a music store away from home for iTunes on my PowerBook and as an MP3 player while I'm driving.  I don't want any music at all on my PowerBook.  Problem is, though, the iPod isn't *quite* a first-class citizen in iTunes.  Party Shuffle doesn't work, and I had a few problems with making sure metadata (like ratings and last played date) made it into iTunes.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and I wish they'd turn down the wheel sensitivity **way** down when setting a song's rating.  At present, it's just a bare millimeter of a finger's twitch to leap from 1 to 5 stars.  Might just be me.\r\n\r\nBut, for the most part, I'm very happy to have my own music at work again, and the potential of tinkering with smart playlists and podcasts are exciting to me.

Regarding your usage, have you thought about moving your PowerBook's iTunes Library file to your file server? You could then manage the iPod from the file server's library. If you still want to be able to sync the iPod on the go, you might set up a separate account on your PowerBook whose iTunes Library is local and use fast user switching to go back and forth when you want to sync. Not seamless but it should work. At least I hope it does--that's how I want to go when I start converting all my CDs.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085756\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085756\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-20T10:05:30\">2004-10-20T10:05:30</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Tim:  I think I have some more playing to do, but moving my iTunes Library to the network server wasn't quite working.
