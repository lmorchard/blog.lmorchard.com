But, is there a difference between &quot;<strong>learn <em>to</em> code</strong>&quot; and\n&quot;<strong>learn <em>about</em> code</strong>&quot;? I don&#39;t think so. Like writing, code doesn&#39;t\nseem like a thing that&#39;s easy to learn <em>about</em> without <em>doing</em> it.</p>\n<p>When I write &quot;coder&quot;, I generally mean this: Someone who is capable of\nencoding his or her intent and decision process into a form that can\ndrive a CPU to perform tasks on his or her behalf.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s a very broad definition, but it implies a lot. First, you have\nto realize that <em>you</em> can make a CPU can do things on your\nbehalf--it&#39;s okay, you won&#39;t break it. It&#39;s a tool made by\nhumans and you as a human can understand it. Then, you need a notion\nof <a href=\"http://rwxweb.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/teaching-algorithmic-thinking/\">algorithmic thinking</a>, in order to formulate your\nintent and reasoning in a form that a CPU can execute. These are not\nnatural or intuitive things.</p>\n<p>I agree with that it&#39;s good to &quot;<a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html\">recognize what code is, and when code\nmight be an appropriate way to approach a problem</a>&quot;.  But,\nif you&#39;ve never made a CPU do your bidding, it&#39;s easy to see it as a\nmysterious black box with a will of its own--possibly malicious or\nat least capricious.</p>\n<p>And, if you&#39;ve never worked to force your thoughts into to the\nconfoundingly literal and common senseless constraints of computer\nprogramming, it&#39;s hard to even imagine how code works. If you can&#39;t\nimagine how it works, how do you work it into your mental toolkit for\ngetting things done?</p>\n<p>Learn to code, and a lot of other things get dragged into your head\nalong the way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-needs-all-these-coders\">Who needs all these coders?</h2>\n<p>And then, there were these bits from &quot;<a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html\">Please Don&#39;t Learn to\nCode</a>&quot;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It assumes that adding naive, novice,\nnot-even-sure-they-like-this-whole-programming-thing coders to the\nworkforce is a net positive for the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It implies that there&#39;s a thin, easily permeable membrane between\nlearning to program and getting paid to program professionally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is looking at work from the wrong angle. It isn&#39;t about <em>getting\npaid to program</em>, so much as <em>coding to <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/08/be-good-at-your-job.html\">be good at your\njob</a></em>.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m not talking about Java-heads who live all day in Eclipse.  I&#39;m\ntalking about the Excel-head who used to rock <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications\">VBA macros</a>, who\nmaybe just started playing with <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/apps-script/\">Google Apps Script</a>. I have no\nidea how popular Google Apps Script might or might not be, but I&#39;ve\nseen some crazy amazing things done in VBA by sales and account reps\nwho&#39;d punch you in the nose if you called them geeks.</p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, the future of work is heading toward more work\nwith greater volumes of information and data. Should <strong>professional\nprogramers</strong> be the only people in an organization who know how to\napply computational power to solve problems? Maybe the vendors will\nsweep in, clean up all <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib_/_Dream_Machines\">the cybercrud</a>, and get the real work\ndone for us.</p>\n<h2 id=\"programming-should-not-be-a-priesthood\">Programming should not be a priesthood</h2>\n<p>Consider writing: there&#39;s a lot to learn and it used to be a thing\ndone only by a few scribes. But, people today get a lot of mileage out\nof just sticky notes and email. Sure, improving your grammar and\nlearning how to structure an essay can help in many, many ways. But,\nyou don&#39;t need to be a <strong>professional writer</strong> to be a <strong>professional\nwho uses written language</strong>.</p>\n<p>The same can apply for coding. The problem, though, is that the\nsticky-notes-and-email level of competence barely exists or is near\nimpossible to access. So, not only do I think we need more coders--we\nalso need more tools that support coding and make coding more\naccessible. I think we should support <strong>professionals who use code</strong>.</p>\n<p>More than that, I think we should encourage and support <strong>humans who\ncode</strong>. I really do consider coding next to reading, writing, and\nmath. I don&#39;t think we can all rely on someone else to write the\nperfect app for the work we&#39;ll need to do in the future. I expect the\nsuccessful people will be those who can apply <a href=\"http://teddziuba.com/2010/10/taco-bell-programming.html\">Taco Bell\nprogramming</a> to reams of data and find answers. We&#39;ll need\nto ride <a href=\"http://www.dougengelbart.org/history/pix.html#6\">bicycles, not tricycles</a>.</p>\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=70: -->\n",

But,\r\nif you've never made a CPU do your bidding, it's easy to see it as a\r\nmysterious black box with a will of its own--possibly malicious or\r\nat least capricious.\r\n\r\nAnd, if you've never worked to force your thoughts into to the\r\nconfoundingly literal and common senseless constraints of computer\r\nprogramming, it's hard to even imagine how code works. If you can't\r\nimagine how it works, how do you work it into your mental toolkit for\r\ngetting things done?\r\n\r\nLearn to code, and a lot of other things get dragged into your head\r\nalong the way.\r\n\r\n## Who needs all these coders?\r\n\r\nAnd then, there were these bits from \"[Please Don't Learn to\r\nCode][dontcode]\":\r\n\r\n> It assumes that adding naive, novice,\r\n> not-even-sure-they-like-this-whole-programming-thing coders to the\r\n> workforce is a net positive for the world.\r\n\r\n> It implies that there's a thin, easily permeable membrane between\r\n> learning to program and getting paid to program professionally.\r\n\r\nThis is looking at work from the wrong angle. It isn't about *getting\r\npaid to program*, so much as *coding to [be good at your\r\njob][goodjob]*.\r\n\r\n[goodjob]: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/08/be-good-at-your-job.html\r\n\r\nI'm not talking about Java-heads who live all day in Eclipse.  I'm\r\ntalking about the Excel-head who used to rock [VBA macros][vba], who\r\nmaybe just started playing with [Google Apps Script][gas]. I have no\r\nidea how popular Google Apps Script might or might not be, but I've\r\nseen some crazy amazing things done in VBA by sales and account reps\r\nwho'd punch you in the nose if you called them geeks.\r\n\r\n[vba]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications\r\n[gas]: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the future of work is heading toward more work\r\nwith greater volumes of information and data. Should **professional\r\nprogramers** be the only people in an organization who know how to\r\napply computational power to solve problems? Maybe the vendors will\r\nsweep in, clean up all [the cybercrud][complib], and get the real work\r\ndone for us.\r\n\r\n[complib]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib_/_Dream_Machines\r\n\r\n## Programming should not be a priesthood\r\n\r\nConsider writing: there's a lot to learn and it used to be a thing\r\ndone only by a few scribes. But, people today get a lot of mileage out\r\nof just sticky notes and email. Sure, improving your grammar and\r\nlearning how to structure an essay can help in many, many ways. But,\r\nyou don't need to be a **professional writer** to be a **professional\r\nwho uses written language**.\r\n\r\nThe same can apply for coding. The problem, though, is that the\r\nsticky-notes-and-email level of competence barely exists or is near\r\nimpossible to access. So, not only do I think we need more coders--we\r\nalso need more tools that support coding and make coding more\r\naccessible. I think we should support **professionals who use code**.\r\n\r\nMore than that, I think we should encourage and support **humans who\r\ncode**. I really do consider coding next to reading, writing, and\r\nmath. I don't think we can all rely on someone else to write the\r\nperfect app for the work we'll need to do in the future. I expect the\r\nsuccessful people will be those who can apply [Taco Bell\r\nprogramming][tacobell] to reams of data and find answers. We'll need\r\nto ride [bicycles, not tricycles][dephotos].\r\n\r\n[dephotos]: http://www.dougengelbart.org/history/pix.html#6\r\n[tacobell]: http://teddziuba.com/2010/10/taco-bell-programming.html\r\n\r\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=70: -->\r\n",
