    "summary": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: A little over a year ago, one of my favorite radio DJs, Darren Revell, started up a new streaming radio station named <a href=\"https://www.bigsonicheaven.com/\">Big Sonic Heaven</a>. I got the idea to try building <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1xBbvEJrf5HycEZbwn04o1?si=NB3ytTzuQqqyIztLQf0odw\">a Spotify playlist collected from the music he plays</a>. My <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/bsh-now-playing-scraper/blob/master/scrape-now-playing-into-playlist.js\">quick &amp; dirty program</a> for doing that turned 1-year-old on April 24 and the playlist has collected over 2000 songs, so far.</p>\n",
