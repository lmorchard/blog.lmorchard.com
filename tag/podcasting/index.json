    "html": "<p><strong>Update (15 Mar 2007):</strong> <i>So, long rant, but I may have found my problem - I had set podcasts in iTunes to sync only &quot;unplayed episodes&quot; to the iPod, which also seems to imply that they never sync / record data about having been played.  Or ratings from the iPod, for that matter.  I just changed that setting to &quot;all episodes&quot;, and podcasts seem to be showing up in my Recently Played smart playlist again.  Hopefully this gets me back to where I want to be.</i></p>\n<p><strong>Update (19 Mar 2007):</strong> <i>Hmm, nope.  Recently Played playlist seems to be updating now, but the iScrobbler-to-last.fm bit seems to be ignoring my iPod-played podcasts.  Bah.</i></p>\n<p>Is it just me, or has iTunes been gradually losing podcast tuner functionality with respect to the iPod?  </p>\n<p>I&#39;m seriously thinking of ditching it for <a href=\"http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php\">Juice</a> or something else.  Recently, the podcasts were completely segregated from the rest of the audio files, stuck into a much harder-to-manage interface.  Related to that, my main gripe at the moment is that I just can&#39;t seem to get my podcast listening behavior posted to <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/user/deusx/\">last.fm</a>.  Maybe I&#39;m weird, but I like to capture and publish that attention data from myself.  </p>\n<p>I listen to a <em>lot</em> of podcasts on the commute to and from work, which is part walking and part bus.  In fact, I probably listened to about a dozen episodes of various serials yesterday — but none of them show up in my iPod&#39;s Recently Played smart playlist.  So, subsequently, none made it to <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/user/deusx/\">last.fm</a>.  </p>\n<p>On the (increasingly rare) occasions I happened to listen to music on my iPod this week, those tracks showed up just fine.  And while at my desk, in iTunes itself, I don&#39;t seem to have these issues.  I seem to remember this working better in the past year or so.  For what it&#39;s worth, my podcasts are auto-synced with iTunes, but the rest of my library is manually managed — because I don&#39;t want 20GB of music on my iPod duplicated on my laptop.</p>\n<p>At one point, I remember that the &quot;Last Played&quot; criteria changed from just <em>starting</em> a podcast to <em>completely</em> playing it through.  This made clean up of old podcasts nicer, such that partially-played episodes didn&#39;t get clobbered when I still intended to finish them.  But lately, I&#39;ve stopped podcasts before they finish, because many have lengthy themes at the end or runs of promos I&#39;ve already heard during the day.  So, there go the &quot;Last Played&quot; and &quot;Play Count&quot; fields.</p>\n<p>But, I just tried manually fast-forwarding a few podcast episodes to the end on the iPod.  I tried playing the last few seconds in an attempt to force the play count to trip.  It seemed to work on the iPod itself - but when I reconnected to iTunes, no dice.  The &quot;Recently Played&quot; playlist shows nothing new, and the episode itself reflects no play counts in iTunes.  I&#39;m either very confused, or things are getting more broken.</p>\n<p>So, I thought, maybe I&#39;ll just rate the podcasts about which I want to publish my listening behavior.  Kind of like giving a &quot;digg&quot;.  Seems hackish and not as effortless as simply capturing my behavior - but, nope, I can&#39;t rate podcasts on the iPod.  There goes that idea, and another feature missing.</p>\n<p>Ugh.  So yeah, this is an semi-inarticulate rant about a problem whose issues and solution I don&#39;t quite yet have a handle on.  It&#39;s just frustrating that I don&#39;t seem to be able to easily track my own podcast listening behavior with iTunes and the iPod the way I <em>thought</em> I used to be able to do.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083477\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dschwarz.blogspot.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b6f94d1db720fcf70469e0d29029ff64&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dschwarz.blogspot.com\">dschwarz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083477\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-09T22:29:17\">2007-03-09T22:29:17</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>As long as you're ranting about iTunes' podcast management problems, let me mention one of my pet peeves:  I subscribe to a mix of time-sensitive podcasts (news programs) and other podcasts that are not time sensitive.

I'm not seeing features in Juice that will help in this instance.  I can't help with iSproggler, not a user.  I use the iTunes Agent to manage syncs of smart playlists to non-iPod devices.  So I'm no help on the iPod firmware issues either.</p>\n<p>If there is more to your comment on switching to Juice than emotion:\nI did switch from iTunes to Juice about 6 months ago for most of my podcasts.  I kept a couple of feeds behind so I could keep tabs on the changes in behavior.  Since I'm not an iPod owner, I switched to get per feed archive management and preprocessing before import into iTunes.  The default behavior of Juice is to import podcasts into the Music portion of the Library, not the Podcast portion.  That may or may not be a feature for you.  But most of this is likely no news to you.</p>\n<p>You're not alone at feeling like there are changes going on behind the scenes in iTunes/iPod.  Since we all know that Apple can/will change behavior regularly, and some of the behavior changes are subtle, we get spooked easier/more often?</p>\n<p>OT:  Over on the PlayListMag forums there are folks swearing that the changes in behavior for iTunes 7.1, in the CoverFlow viewing mode, that play-selection navigation is not consistent...</p>\n<p>Emotion is good, use the energy...</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083485\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jm3.net/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/jm3.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jm3.net/\">John Manoogian III (jm3)</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083485\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-27T05:49:40\">2007-03-27T05:49:40</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>i don't speak from experience, here, but would songbird help the podcast situation at all?</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083486\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rss-central.net/home/megalar\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1869681b309d36e59764f51c7f210406&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rss-central.net/home/megalar\">megalar</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-31T13:50:39\">2007-03-31T13:50:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I have had nothing but headaches from itunes, thats why i switched to juice for podcasts.

I'm not seeing features in Juice that will help in this instance.  I can't help with iSproggler, not a user.  I use the iTunes Agent to manage syncs of smart playlists to non-iPod devices.  So I'm no help on the iPod firmware issues either.</p>\n\n<p>If there is more to your comment on switching to Juice than emotion:\nI did switch from iTunes to Juice about 6 months ago for most of my podcasts.  I kept a couple of feeds behind so I could keep tabs on the changes in behavior.  Since I'm not an iPod owner, I switched to get per feed archive management and preprocessing before import into iTunes.  The default behavior of Juice is to import podcasts into the Music portion of the Library, not the Podcast portion.  That may or may not be a feature for you.  But most of this is likely no news to you.</p>\n\n<p>You're not alone at feeling like there are changes going on behind the scenes in iTunes/iPod.

    "html": "<p>Listening to this <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2006/02/12/530652.aspx\">podcast about OPML and Reading Lists</a> and enjoying the various perspectives on RSS, OPML, and Semantic Web tech.  It&#39;s also the first time I&#39;ve heard Danny Ayers&#39; voice, so that was pretty cool after having been a textual blog acquaintance for a few years now.  As for the rest of the guys on the call, I&#39;m not quite as familiar with all of them yet, but I&#39;ll be adding them to my Reading Lists shortly.</p>\n<p>Apropos of this podcast, I&#39;ve lately gotten a bit of a fresh take on the RSS/OPML versus XHTML versus Semantic Web tech merry-go-round.  Here&#39;s the basic gist:  Invest time into tools that solve problems first and formats that enable possibilities second, if you want to get any attention and subsequent help.</p>\n<p>And then I say &quot;tools&quot;, I don&#39;t mean a GraphViz construct that makes really cool charts for people willing to chase down and install the dependencies.  No, I mean something like the OPML Editor.  The OPML Editor comes in a single package, and you launch it from a single icon.  The OPML Editor is <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty piece of software</a> that&#39;s nonetheless helping me achieve some practical goals that I&#39;ve heretofore been vaguely stymied in reaching.  The OPML Editor is making me think more favorably about OPML, <i>despite</i> OPML being <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty format</a>.</p>\n<p>The utility of the OPML Editor is giving me the motivation to build filters and workarounds to transmute OPML into XOXO and RDF formats, but only when the need arises.  I could also see putting an OPML-to-triples bridge in front of a semweb crawler or tool.  And, there&#39;s no reason why outlines in the OPML Editor couldn&#39;t be rendered in XOXO and RDF formats by the tool itself, if there&#39;s something useful around to consume it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I&#39;ve done enough with RDF and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo_outliner_experiment\">XOXO</a> to see the clear potential in both.  With enough RDF data around, you can turn the whole wide web into a single massively networked database ripe for the querying thanks to a uniform data model and clear specs for representation of that model.  With XOXO and microformats, you get a <a href=\"http://www.sudoku.com/\">Sudoku-esque</a> solution to providing both human and machine readable data in the same format and file, while sterring close to the inherent design principles of the web.</p>\n<p>The problem with these formats, though, is that they open potential avenues but don&#39;t provide value until there&#39;s some foot traffic on the avenues.  This is just establishing a world in which there can exist both chickens and eggs, but not doing much with respect to concrete instantiations of poultry.\nNow, to be fair, there have been efforts to make practical usage of RDF (see: <a href=\"http://musicbrainz.org/\">MusicBrainz</a>) and these are early days for microformats.  But, I think a lot more effort needs to be given toward making useful, personally rewarding tools - and less effort given toward expressing awe toward the potentials given by formats and models.  You can have both, but you&#39;ve got to pick one to start with.</p>\n<p>And, the reason you need to make tools first that use formats second is attention.  (That&#39;s been a buzzword lately, hasn&#39;t it?)  You need attention if you want adoption and help.  And, you can get attention - and subsequent help - by scratching someone&#39;s itch.</p>\n<p>Now, some people&#39;s itches are scratched by the fun of abstract symbol manipulation and the perception of elegance.  Others&#39; itches are scratched by getting work done, like writing or organizing thoughts or expanding awareness of more information sources.  Personally, I&#39;ve got itches of both of these varieties.  The problem is that there are many fewer people with itches in that first category.  And, no offense to anyone, that seems to be the bulk of the RDF and XOXO fanbase at the moment.  For the second category, even if things are shitty, smoke a bit and catch on fire - as long as some work gets done at the end of the day, there&#39;s a lot of tolerance to go around and a lot of motivation to pitch in to improve the situation.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I firmly believe that ATOM, RDF, and XHTML-based microformats trounce OPML, RSS, and the like in terms of clear definition, affordance in manipulation, and technical elegance.  But, OPML and RSS are still winning in the world because the tools using these formats are scratching some damn annoying itches.  And, though towers built atop shitty tools and formats seem Jenga-shaky, somehow they never quite come crashing down.  Maybe they will come crashing down someday, but we seem to be getting work done in the meantime.</p>\n<p>So, to wrap up:  My take on this whole mess is that your format will gain adoption to the degree that the tools producing it help people get work done.  I can&#39;t find tools today for RDF and XOXO that are as rewardingly useful as the OPML Editor has become.

    "body": "Listening to this <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2006/02/12/530652.aspx\">podcast about OPML and Reading Lists</a> and enjoying the various perspectives on RSS, OPML, and Semantic Web tech.  It's also the first time I've heard Danny Ayers' voice, so that was pretty cool after having been a textual blog acquaintance for a few years now.  As for the rest of the guys on the call, I'm not quite as familiar with all of them yet, but I'll be adding them to my Reading Lists shortly.\r\n\r\nApropos of this podcast, I've lately gotten a bit of a fresh take on the RSS/OPML versus XHTML versus Semantic Web tech merry-go-round.  Here's the basic gist:  Invest time into tools that solve problems first and formats that enable possibilities second, if you want to get any attention and subsequent help.\r\n\r\nAnd then I say \"tools\", I don't mean a GraphViz construct that makes really cool charts for people willing to chase down and install the dependencies.  No, I mean something like the OPML Editor.  The OPML Editor comes in a single package, and you launch it from a single icon.  The OPML Editor is <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty piece of software</a> that's nonetheless helping me achieve some practical goals that I've heretofore been vaguely stymied in reaching.  The OPML Editor is making me think more favorably about OPML, <i>despite</i> OPML being <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty format</a>.\r\n\r\nThe utility of the OPML Editor is giving me the motivation to build filters and workarounds to transmute OPML into XOXO and RDF formats, but only when the need arises.  I could also see putting an OPML-to-triples bridge in front of a semweb crawler or tool.  And, there's no reason why outlines in the OPML Editor couldn't be rendered in XOXO and RDF formats by the tool itself, if there's something useful around to consume it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I've done enough with RDF and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo_outliner_experiment\">XOXO</a> to see the clear potential in both.  With enough RDF data around, you can turn the whole wide web into a single massively networked database ripe for the querying thanks to a uniform data model and clear specs for representation of that model.  With XOXO and microformats, you get a <a href=\"http://www.sudoku.com/\">Sudoku-esque</a> solution to providing both human and machine readable data in the same format and file, while sterring close to the inherent design principles of the web.\r\n\r\nThe problem with these formats, though, is that they open potential avenues but don't provide value until there's some foot traffic on the avenues.  This is just establishing a world in which there can exist both chickens and eggs, but not doing much with respect to concrete instantiations of poultry.\r\nNow, to be fair, there have been efforts to make practical usage of RDF (see: <a href=\"http://musicbrainz.org/\">MusicBrainz</a>) and these are early days for microformats.  But, I think a lot more effort needs to be given toward making useful, personally rewarding tools - and less effort given toward expressing awe toward the potentials given by formats and models.  You can have both, but you've got to pick one to start with.\r\n\r\nAnd, the reason you need to make tools first that use formats second is attention.  (That's been a buzzword lately, hasn't it?)  You need attention if you want adoption and help.  And, you can get attention - and subsequent help - by scratching someone's itch.\r\n\r\nNow, some people's itches are scratched by the fun of abstract symbol manipulation and the perception of elegance.  Others' itches are scratched by getting work done, like writing or organizing thoughts or expanding awareness of more information sources.  Personally, I've got itches of both of these varieties.  The problem is that there are many fewer people with itches in that first category.  And, no offense to anyone, that seems to be the bulk of the RDF and XOXO fanbase at the moment.  For the second category, even if things are shitty, smoke a bit and catch on fire - as long as some work gets done at the end of the day, there's a lot of tolerance to go around and a lot of motivation to pitch in to improve the situation.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I firmly believe that ATOM, RDF, and XHTML-based microformats trounce OPML, RSS, and the like in terms of clear definition, affordance in manipulation, and technical elegance.  But, OPML and RSS are still winning in the world because the tools using these formats are scratching some damn annoying itches.  And, though towers built atop shitty tools and formats seem Jenga-shaky, somehow they never quite come crashing down.  Maybe they will come crashing down someday, but we seem to be getting work done in the meantime.\r\n\r\nSo, to wrap up:  My take on this whole mess is that your format will gain adoption to the degree that the tools producing it help people get work done.  I can't find tools today for RDF and XOXO that are as rewardingly useful as the OPML Editor has become.  When that happens, the story may change.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: metablogging rdf semweb webdev opml rss syndication microformats xoxo podcasting -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086877\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e377f3e2140297d32460ae9a4b38ff98&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086877\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-14T02:32:49\">2006-02-14T02:32:49</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>There's a lot to be said for rough consensus and running code, and there's a lot more running code that speaks OPML than there is that speaks XOXO or RDF.

    "html": "<p>(<em>Note: This is a long one.</em>)</p>\n<p>Reading <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060207-6133.html\">&quot;The slow decline of the blockbuster&quot; on Ars Technica</a> reminds me that <a href=\"http://www.thelongtail.com/about.html\">this Long Tail stuff</a> is something on which I&#39;ve been wanting to write something intelligent for a long time now.  This might all just be techno-hippy <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/2000/08/27/michegas\">michegas</a> in the end, but I&#39;m really excited about the possibility of living in a Long-Tailed age.</p>\n<p>You see, if I were to pick a lifelong war cry and embroider it on my own personal flag, that cry would be &quot;<a href=\"http://www.jcf.org/bliss.php\">Follow Your Bliss</a>!&quot;  And my bliss is found in the course of learning, in the act of creative work and making things, and in the continual effort of self-refinement as creativity recursively applied.</p>\n<p>Now, the thing about bliss is that it&#39;s not just some hedonistic easy road paved with whipped cream.  Bliss is a hard thing to follow—you&#39;ve got to keep your eyes on it, and there&#39;s quite often a lot of pain involved.  But, I believe that following bliss is the only way to get real, honest, unbounded joy out of life that builds in unfailing increment.</p>\n<p>What does my bliss have to do with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tail\">the Long Tail</a>?  Well, you see, it&#39;s easier to be creative and live creatively in the midst of a culture that is itself steeped in creativity—and I think that a Long-Tailed culture is the best bet for it.  I see a Long Tail as the hallmark of a living artisan culture, as opposed to the slow death of a consumer culture that&#39;ll just leave us all fat and useless.</p>\n<p>Why do we even have a culture that enshrines such a poisonous unidirectional flow of product to consumer?  Scarcity.  Mass production makes it cheap to make lots of the same thing—yet, the means of that production has historically been very expensive to acquire.  </p>\n<p>Thus, assembly lines are scarce.  The same has goes for transmission towers, radio frequencies, movie theaters, and recording studios.  As a perverse consequence, we&#39;ve all just gotten used to the idea that almost no one is cut out to make much at all and common creativity is relegated to head-patted cottage niches who make their own soap.</p>\n<p>What I think the growing Long Tail will tell us, though, is that for many areas of creative concern, scarcity in the means of production is evaporating.  Many products of creativity—i.e. sound, video, and text—can be composed on a cheap computer and duplicated with negligible cost on the web.  In fact, as things like <a href=\"http://www.bittorrent.com/\">BitTorrent</a> take off, distribution costs actually <em>fall</em> with popularity and scale.  (Just think, what if distribution costs can fall below zero?  I&#39;m not just talking money here.)</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve got a lot of hope in what I see happening with blogging, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/podcasting\">podcasting</a>, and other such network-driven channels for creativity.  I also have a lot of hope for the generations of kids not only growing up with computers, but also with <a href=\"http://netflix.com\">Netflix</a>, <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/\">GarageBand</a>, <a href=\"http://myspace.com\">MySpace</a>, <a href=\"http://livejournal.com\">LiveJournal</a>, <a href=\"http://youtube.com\">YouTube</a>, and even <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/podcasting\">YTMND</a>.  You can scoff at them all you like, but some of that stuff&#39;s got a little bit of genius in it.</p>\n<p>We&#39;ve got this entertainment industry with an ultra-rich royalty caste of supposedly super-creative celebrities, but it&#39;s all driven by the scarcity that technology is eroding away.  Sure, you can find some really, truly brilliant people up there—but I&#39;m willing to bet there are armies of people down here who just haven&#39;t gotten in the right place at the right time or who&#39;ve abandoned creativity because they had no viable outlet.  </p>\n<p>So, imagine a more distributed entertainment universe populated by more creative people—with fewer big productions and even fewer gazillionaires.  Creativity, attention, and time become the only significant scarcities.</p>\n<p>Imagine more people just entertaining each other and goading each other on.  Imagine making a <em>decent</em> living doing creative stuff you love, based on the moral and monetary contributions of intimate audiences filled with co-creators—who, while perhaps <a href=\"http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/28/what-is-friendship/\">not quite friends</a> are at least <em>befriendable*.  No one gets so rich bankwise—they get by just fine, mind you—but *everyone</em> lives in a lot more bliss.</p>\n<p>This is not unlike Orson Scott Card&#39;s description of <a href=\"http://www.hatrack.com/osc/books/crystalcity.shtml\">The Crystal City in his Alvin Maker series</a>.</p>\n<p>I want to see a culture where restrictions on remix are given the same odd looks as powdered wigs.  I want to see, as an entrenched tradition, future creative adults route around the network damage of old proprietary industries steeped in scarcity and control.  After all, &quot;<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2001/07/29/my_crush_on_spyro_what_flash_animations_remind_me_of_and_what_the_past_will_look_like_someday\">the only long-term effect of copy protection is to ensure that those who defeat it are immortalized.</a>&quot;</p>\n<p>We&#39;ll still need professional editors and crews for the <em>really</em> good stuff—<em>but that&#39;s creative work too</em>.  The same goes for everyone else who plays an honest role in getting visions realized—this isn&#39;t all just about the entertainment industry.  Honestly, I see the entrenchment of universal creativity as one of the few ways the United States can cope with increasingly global markets—we&#39;ve got a bit of a head start in some areas, if we take it.  Digging in heels and protecting aging ways of business that have long since ridden out their respective initial creative Big Bangs just won&#39;t cut it.</p>\n<p>I want to see the 10% left over from 90% of everyone&#39;s crud inevitably exceed the total output of today&#39;s entertainment industry and spill into other industries.  I want to see a new industry spring up whose sole purpose is to sift through chaff and cultivate the naturally emergent creative best.  And I want to see that industry as a distributed <em>service</em> (versus <em>control</em>) industry there to help what&#39;s already happening through the application of both machine and human intelligence to <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/\">homestead the noosphere</a>.</p>\n<p>...(<em>deep breath</em>)...</p>\n<p>So anyway, that&#39;s the sort of stuff that gets me really excited lately.  And, in excitement, I&#39;m handwaving away a lot of stuff.  But, I think there&#39;s something to all of this breathlessness that just might have something to do with my own bliss at the end of the day.</p>\n<!-- tags: longtail creative creativity podcasting future writing copyfight drm -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086499\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=85232f8499fd6ee91623408fc23835d1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\">Matt Brubeck</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086499\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-09T23:19:13\">2006-02-09T23:19:13</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n<p>\"Why do we even have a culture that enshrines such a poisonous unidirectional flow of product to consumer?

Bliss is a hard thing to follow—you've got to keep your eyes on it, and there's quite often a lot of pain involved.  But, I believe that following bliss is the only way to get real, honest, unbounded joy out of life that builds in unfailing increment.\r\n\r\nWhat does my bliss have to do with [the Long Tail][lt2]?  Well, you see, it's easier to be creative and live creatively in the midst of a culture that is itself steeped in creativity—and I think that a Long-Tailed culture is the best bet for it.  I see a Long Tail as the hallmark of a living artisan culture, as opposed to the slow death of a consumer culture that'll just leave us all fat and useless.\r\n\r\n[lt2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tail\r\n\r\nWhy do we even have a culture that enshrines such a poisonous unidirectional flow of product to consumer?  Scarcity.  Mass production makes it cheap to make lots of the same thing—yet, the means of that production has historically been very expensive to acquire.  \r\n\r\nThus, assembly lines are scarce.  The same has goes for transmission towers, radio frequencies, movie theaters, and recording studios.  As a perverse consequence, we've all just gotten used to the idea that almost no one is cut out to make much at all and common creativity is relegated to head-patted cottage niches who make their own soap.\r\n\r\nWhat I think the growing Long Tail will tell us, though, is that for many areas of creative concern, scarcity in the means of production is evaporating.  Many products of creativity—i.e. sound, video, and text—can be composed on a cheap computer and duplicated with negligible cost on the web.  In fact, as things like [BitTorrent][bt] take off, distribution costs actually *fall* with popularity and scale.  (Just think, what if distribution costs can fall below zero?  I'm not just talking money here.)\r\n\r\nI've got a lot of hope in what I see happening with blogging, [podcasting][pod], and other such network-driven channels for creativity.  I also have a lot of hope for the generations of kids not only growing up with computers, but also with [Netflix][nf], [GarageBand][gb], [MySpace][ms], [LiveJournal][lj], [YouTube][yt], and even [YTMND][].  You can scoff at them all you like, but some of that stuff's got a little bit of genius in it.\r\n\r\n[lj]: http://livejournal.com\r\n[yt]: http://youtube.com\r\n[ms]: http://myspace.com\r\n[nf]: http://netflix.com\r\n[gb]: http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/\r\n\r\nWe've got this entertainment industry with an ultra-rich royalty caste of supposedly super-creative celebrities, but it's all driven by the scarcity that technology is eroding away.  Sure, you can find some really, truly brilliant people up there—but I'm willing to bet there are armies of people down here who just haven't gotten in the right place at the right time or who've abandoned creativity because they had no viable outlet.  \r\n\r\nSo, imagine a more distributed entertainment universe populated by more creative people—with fewer big productions and even fewer gazillionaires.  Creativity, attention, and time become the only significant scarcities.\r\n\r\nImagine more people just entertaining each other and goading each other on.  Imagine making a *decent* living doing creative stuff you love, based on the moral and monetary contributions of intimate audiences filled with co-creators—who, while perhaps [not quite friends][friends] are at least *befriendable*.  No one gets so rich bankwise—they get by just fine, mind you—but *everyone* lives in a lot more bliss.\r\n\r\n[friends]: http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/28/what-is-friendship/\r\n\r\nThis is not unlike Orson Scott Card's description of [The Crystal City in his Alvin Maker series][cc].\r\n\r\n[cc]: http://www.hatrack.com/osc/books/crystalcity.shtml\r\n\r\nI want to see a culture where restrictions on remix are given the same odd looks as powdered wigs.  I want to see, as an entrenched tradition, future creative adults route around the network damage of old proprietary industries steeped in scarcity and control.  After all, \"[the only long-term effect of copy protection is to ensure that those who defeat it are immortalized.][imm]\"\r\n\r\n[imm]: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2001/07/29/my_crush_on_spyro_what_flash_animations_remind_me_of_and_what_the_past_will_look_like_someday\r\n\r\nWe'll still need professional editors and crews for the *really* good stuff—*but that's creative work too*.  The same goes for everyone else who plays an honest role in getting visions realized—this isn't all just about the entertainment industry.  Honestly, I see the entrenchment of universal creativity as one of the few ways the United States can cope with increasingly global markets—we've got a bit of a head start in some areas, if we take it.  Digging in heels and protecting aging ways of business that have long since ridden out their respective initial creative Big Bangs just won't cut it.\r\n\r\nI want to see the 10% left over from 90% of everyone's crud inevitably exceed the total output of today's entertainment industry and spill into other industries.  I want to see a new industry spring up whose sole purpose is to sift through chaff and cultivate the naturally emergent creative best.  And I want to see that industry as a distributed *service* (versus *control*) industry there to help what's already happening through the application of both machine and human intelligence to [homestead the noosphere][hn].\r\n\r\n...(*deep breath*)...\r\n\r\nSo anyway, that's the sort of stuff that gets me really excited lately.  And, in excitement, I'm handwaving away a lot of stuff.  But, I think there's something to all of this breathlessness that just might have something to do with my own bliss at the end of the day.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: longtail creative creativity podcasting future writing copyfight drm -->\r\n\r\n[hn]: http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/\r\n[ytmnd]: http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/podcasting\r\n[pod]: http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/podcasting\r\n[bt]: http://www.bittorrent.com/\r\n[mg]: http://davenet.scripting.com/2000/08/27/michegas\r\n[lt]: http://www.thelongtail.com/about.html\r\n[bb]: http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060207-6133.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086499\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=85232f8499fd6ee91623408fc23835d1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\">Matt Brubeck</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086499\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-09T23:19:13\">2006-02-09T23:19:13</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\r\n  <p>\"Why do we even have a culture that enshrines such a poisonous unidirectional flow of product to consumer?
