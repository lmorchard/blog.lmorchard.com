    "html": "<p>In the last few days, I&#39;ve switched news aggregators again - this time to <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a>.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve got a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/18/good-gregarius\">long</a>, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/12/further-work-on-decafbadnewsriver\">long</a>, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/05/feedspool-is-progressing-nicely\">long</a> <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/05/introducing-dbagg3-an-atom-powered-clientserver-aggregator\">history</a> of doing this - partially because of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiasm</a>, and partially because none of the aggregators I&#39;ve used so far have satisfied all of my itches.  Some tie up my laptop in terms of memory and CPU, some aren&#39;t fast enough UI-wise to help me really blaze through skimming, and some aren&#39;t flexible enough for me to tweak to my particular liking.</p>\n<p>At this point, though, <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a> comes really close to what I&#39;ve been wanting for years.  It&#39;s open source (<a href=\"http://vienna-rss.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vienna-rss/trunk/2.1.0/\">check it out!</a>); uses WebKit to offer a <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna_styles.php\">theme-able</a> feed item display (<a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/02/12/colloquy-irc\">hello Colloquy!</a>); and uses SQLite 3 for persistence (<a href=\"http://vienna-rss.sourceforge.net/public/DatabaseSchema.pdf\">with schema documentation!</a>).  Out of the box, it&#39;s a pretty nice app, but it was even nicer when I started poking under the hood.  I&#39;ve even <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=31310885&amp;forum_id=48723\">submitted my first small patch</a>, which got accepted into the codebase.</p>\n<p>When last I tried <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a>, it was on my poor old PowerBook G4 12&quot; 867Mhz and it was a somewhat rough and bad tasting experience.  At the time, <a href=\"http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire\">NetNewsWire</a> was my tool of choice, and <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a> was lacking some features - like, say, a user-sortable list of subscription folders and feeds.  It also thrashed a lot and generally made me Force Quit it and move on.  But now, on my new-ish MacBook Pro, the performance is stellar with my set of 500+ feeds and my few showstopper missing features are no longer missing.  </p>\n<p>Now, it seems like <a href=\"http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire\">NetNewsWire</a> is the app that thrashes for me and gets a Force Quit.  I need to try <a href=\"http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire\">NNW</a> a bit more and figure out if it&#39;s just my initial import of subscriptions that drags things down - but <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a>&#39;s got me now.  It&#39;s catching up mightily fast with the feature list of NNW.  And, nothing beats open source software for tossing in a few tweaks to things that are just <em>not quite</em> doing what I&#39;d like.</p>\n<p>Again, since I&#39;m a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiast</a>, I have no idea if I&#39;ll be a regular contributor of patches to <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a> or even offer any commitment to the project - but I&#39;m definitely happy with it at the moment.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085597\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.net\">Craig</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085597\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-02T22:20:49\">2007-01-02T22:20:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Not sure if you care much for web-based aggregators, but ReBlog is my current favorite.

For what it's worth, the Vienna team is working on BlogLines integration.</p>\n\n<p>@jose: Not sure when you tried Vienna last - it seems to have improved markedly, though that might just be my mileage with the MacBook Pro now.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085601\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e3b46099c3fd3844c4539b27f143fd97&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\">Michal Migurski</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085601\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-03T08:17:14\">2007-01-03T08:17:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I almost feel bad for wanting to switch. =)</p>\n\n<p>Vienna is <em>really good</em>.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085602\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7b3073e125f3ac8f09130950ef5d7790&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\">brian cors</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085602\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-03T16:45:29\">2007-01-03T16:45:29</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I checked out Vienna today a bit, and it's mucho nice.</p>\n\n<p>However, the one thing that I use the most on NNW is the ability to sync to NewsGator.

I think one of my next purchases may be a more compact and capable [SuperCard MicroSD][sc], which fits flush in the Nintendo DS Lite and accepts MicroSD expansion cards.\r\n\r\n[sc]: http://www.divineo.com/cgi-bin/div-us/dd-ds-suplite.html\r\n[gbamp]: http://movieadvance.com/\r\n[pc3]: http://www.divineo.com/cgi-bin/div-us/dd-ds-pssc\r\n[nt]: http://nitrotracker.tobw.net/index.php\r\n[svm]: http://scummvm.drunkencoders.com/\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082362\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://foosel.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bc9bc547d634817fe7ca6348119b0eaf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://foosel.net\">foosel</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082362\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-24T22:43:08\">2006-09-24T22:43:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Congratulations on the Passcard ;) I got one myself a couple of months ago, including a M3 CF, and playing Monkey Island on the DS rocks ;) I have to warn you though concerning SD based units, there were a couple of issues not so long ago with several homebrew apps (including Scumm), and write-support for SD is afaik still rather new in the standard fat-lib used by homebrew devs. So you might want to make sure that your most beloved or interesting apps will actually work like expected prior to spending loads of money.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082363\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://twitter.com/adammokan\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/amokan.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://twitter.com/adammokan\">Adam Mokan</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082363\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-28T04:21:30\">2006-09-28T04:21:30</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>How does the Passcard 3 fit in the DS?
