          <title>Animating Mermaid diagrams with terrible hacks</title>
          <description>So, I wanted to produce a GIF animation of a graph diagram changing over time. What I came up with wasn&#39;t the slickest result, but it&#39;s close enough to what I&#39;d initially imagined.</description>

          <description>TL;DR: I made a new static site generator for my blog. It&#39;s not very clever. I&#39;ve been calling it my &quot;Easy-Blog Oven&quot; and it seems to be working well so far.</description>

          <description>Ever since I switched this blog over to a Gulp-based toolchain - holy crap, 2 years ago - I had a TODO to wire this thing up for continual deployment. Well, today I finally did it.</description>

          <title>Experimenting with a multi-platform app using React</title>
          <description>TL;DR: I built a toy app using React for web and native to get a feel for whether this hybrid approach is worth using. I think the answer is &quot;yes&quot; - but mainly for apps whose business logic &amp; data models are more complex than their views.</description>

          <title>The Verge&#39;s web sucks</title>
          <description>TL;DR: Did you know that The Verge delivers you to around 20 companies for advertising &amp; tracking purposes? I didn&#39;t. That might foul up your web experience a little bit. Maybe we should try something different.</description>

          <title>Static blog generation with Gulp and S3</title>
          <description>I&#39;ve long agreed that many sites, like blogs, are better baked than
fried. It makes for web hosting that&#39;s cheaper to run and simpler to
maintain. I&#39;ve also often thought that using a database can be an
anti-pattern for managing content. But, what I&#39;ve also found is
that baked sites often yield a poor writing environment. That said, I think
I&#39;m going to give it another try, because I think I might have found a new
approach that works for me.</description>

          <title>tootr: microblogging app, hosting not included</title>
          <description>In my last two posts, I wrote about how I’ve been thinking about building yet another microblogging tool and how I think it might be interesting to separate web publishing apps from web hosting. Well, I started tinkering, and I’ve got a rough prototype working.</description>
