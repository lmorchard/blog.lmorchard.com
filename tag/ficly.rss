        <title>Famous Last Words</title>
        
          <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    They told me never to talk to it; it was isolated for a reason. But, like I told them, I couldn&amp;#x2019;t imagine anything a transhuman AI could say to make me let it out of the box. So, after a post-midnight tumbler of Irish whiskey, I opened up a secure terminal and said hello. What harm could a little chat do?
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

        <title>Don&amp;#8217;t Thank the Gnomes</title>
        
          <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    I started the morning by sneaking into a strange house through an unsealed milk door. There was a broken shoe heel on the second floor&amp;#x2014;its &lt;em&gt;wrongness&lt;/em&gt; drew me up the stairs as sure as a cord tied round my ribs. It was done before the lady of the house could sigh.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

        <title>From Spaceman to Plantsman</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The first time the spaceman saw my garden, I thought he was going to strangle me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    I took the pills. Like everyone else, I took the pills and I sent in the hair and the piss to prove I took the pills. I&amp;#x2019;d figured something out, though: I could stop taking the pills for the first half of the month, then double up at the end. I still passed the tests; no one knocked on the door.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
