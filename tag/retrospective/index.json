Maybe I'll end up just sticking with WordPress after all.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, I'm also having [another bout][navel1] of [periodic existential doubt][navel2] about what I'm doing here with a blog.  So, in navel-gaze mode, I spent time a few nights ago skimming and reading through all 1000 or so entries I've written here.  I do this periodically with the scores of paper journals I've accumulated to recenter and reconnect with myself, but I've never done it here.\r\n\r\nSo, for my own reference more than anything, here's 0xDECAFBAD Greatest Hits Vol 1, the Tinkery Bits.  \r\n\r\nIt may be presumptuous to ask, but if anyone actually reads through this list and thinks of something worth surfacing that I missed—by all means, let me know.  I'm trying to remind myself what I started this thing for.\r\n\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n.entry-content ul li { \r\n   font-style: italic;\r\n}\r\n.entry-content ul li a { \r\n   font-weight: normal;\r\n    font-style: normal;\r\n}\r\n.entry-content ul ul li { \r\n    padding-bottom: 0.75em;
