          <title>Pondering the cobwebs</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;apos;s plain to see that I&amp;apos;ve not been a blogger for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This place is a long-neglected ghost town that sees a begrudged entry every few months, when I happen to remember it still exists and I feel guilty for not feeding it with content. What I&amp;apos;ve yet to figure out is if the cause is a matter of motivation, publishing tools, audience, or writing topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold as I ramble on for many tens of words pondering the cobwebs here at 0xDECAFBAD.&lt;/p&gt;
