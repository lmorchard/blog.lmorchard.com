          <title>Quoting Greg Storey on Minimum Viable Humans</title>
          
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greg Storey, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brilliantcrank.com/minimum-viable-humans/&quot;&gt;Minimum Viable Humans.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; hits like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/15/quoting-will-larson-on-career-advice-in/index.html&quot;&gt;a funnel cloud&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies aren&#39;t just cutting costs—they&#39;re conducting a fundamental reset to find their Minimum Viable Humans model. They&#39;re stripping organizations down to the ground—the irreducible human functions that (currently) can&#39;t be replaced or augmented by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rings true to what I&#39;ve been seeing. The cruelty feels incidental to the process—not to me and everyone I know, mind you—but indignation won&#39;t pay my mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to get your old job back is futile—that role, as you remember it, isn’t coming back. The opportunity now lies in positioning yourself for the roles and capabilities that will emerge as organizations rebuild from the bottom up—core human strengths like creativity and ethical judgment, the ability to collaborate with AI, your unique experience and expertise, and the kind of discernment that values judgment over process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brutal, yet maybe positive? If drudgery gets distilled out, what&#39;s left are human creativity, judgment, and experience. That sounds nice, like what classic sci-fi promised us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can&#39;t mechanize that with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_motion_study&quot;&gt;a Taylorist time-and-motion study&lt;/a&gt;. Some jobs are just paychecks, some spark enthusiasm, and some flip between both unpredictably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will companies make allowances for that, while rewarding what they&#39;re asking for? I know we&#39;re seeing a reckoning right now, a firm snatching back from privileged labor. Fine, I don&#39;t need a free lunch or a foosball table, but I do need a health plan and a few days off. What&#39;s the churn for all of us while they figure that out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager&#39;s role isn&#39;t just being eliminated—it&#39;s being fundamentally redefined from day-to-day oversight to exception handling, strategic communication, and resource allocation across much larger teams. It will keep going into augmenting the decision-making process for leaders and individual contributors alike. The boundaries of acceptable risk at all levels are now in a constant prototype state as AI becomes more powerful and faster, giving mere mortals more access to information and insight than ever before. The trick will be what training we need in order to make the pairing work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might suit an ADHD-head like me. I could see myself as a human relay, occasionally reallocating &lt;a href=&quot;https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Pylon&quot;&gt;pylons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Vespene_gas&quot;&gt;vespene gas&lt;/a&gt; amongst largely autonomous &lt;a href=&quot;https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Protoss&quot;&gt;protoss&lt;/a&gt; units. I&#39;m already having better luck than some with AI-assisted coding. Maybe I&#39;m learning the magic invocations? Maybe I&#39;m a special kind of moron? Either way, I&#39;m ending up with working code and nodding heads. This gives me some hope that I can &quot;stay current&quot; - whatever that means in the current era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I&#39;m more comfortable directing Starcraft units and AI agents like this. That feels like a kind of management to me. I&#39;m not so comfortable directing human co-workers with the same interface, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t just another tech cycle. It&#39;s a fundamental recalibration of the human role in organizational life. And while there&#39;s no easy path through this transition, understanding what&#39;s actually happening might help you find your footing on shifting ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep slipping into snark because part of me finds this exciting while another part is cynical and burnt out. I&#39;m hoping optimism holds out longer than cynicism. Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://monkeybagel.com/pumas.html&quot;&gt;the thumbless neurotic puma driving a maroon AMC Gremlin&lt;/a&gt; have the last laugh after all? (Anybody get that reference anymore?) I dunno, I&#39;m just trying to figure how much of this is like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/earthquakes/first-of-its-kind-video-captures-the-terrifying-moment-the-ground-tore-apart-during-major-myanmar-earthquake&quot;&gt;that surface rupture in Myanmar last week&lt;/a&gt;  and whether my Crocs can carry me to the right side of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Burning out in a business (mech) suit</title>
          
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brilliantcrank (Greg Storey), &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brilliantcrank.com/the-coyote-trap/?ref=brilliantcrank-newsletter&quot;&gt;The coyote trap.&lt;/a&gt;&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if survival looked like ownership instead? What if the best response to getting laid off isn’t to get in the line to nowhere for the next thing, but to build your own thing? Do your own thing? The tools are there. The access is there. The demand is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got too many smart, experienced people standing at the edge of the workforce, assuming their only move is down or to keep trying what worked yesterday. From what I read many folks fear an AI fuled collapse, but I fear another powered by denial, retreat, and stubborn nostalgia. If enough of us take this route, we’re going to see a quiet, steady slide of educated, capable folks into poverty—and that’s not just a personal tragedy, it’s a societal one. And no amount of boycotting or avoiding AI is going to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about this, lately. And I keep thinking about &quot;my own thing&quot; that I could build. I&#39;ve had some ideas, but I&#39;m not sure any of them are big enough to convince people to shovel enough money at me to pay my mortgage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, I&#39;ve never felt a particular urge to be an entrepreneur. That doesn&#39;t sound like my kind of fun, at all. Ownership, being my own boss, making all the decisions, taking all the risk. Not enticing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, not that I think this would be a great business, but: Since I got my 3D printer, I&#39;ve seen lots of folks running little garage print farms. Looks like fun! I&#39;d love to have a dozen or two machines whirring away. But then I realize, practically speaking, a print farm isn&#39;t about printing. It&#39;s about bookkeeping, inventory, visits to the UPS store, and self-marketing—and I don&#39;t like any of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems like every idea I&#39;ve come up with boils down to that. Even if I&#39;m just thinking about being a freelancer doing what I already do for work. The thing is not the thing. You have to build &amp;amp; maintain a business mech suit around the thing to make the money happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think I would like it. I think it would burn me out after not very long. That&#39;s not denial or retreat or nostalgia—I think that&#39;s just self-honesty. I mean, if it&#39;s that or starving, I&#39;ll do the needful somehow. But, for as much as I&#39;m a socially-anxious hermit, I like being on a team or in a crew. I want to do my part, play my role. I don&#39;t want to try to pull off the whole heist by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&#39;m definitely not avoiding AI, and I&#39;m working to stay current. But I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m hanging out my own shingle any time soon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Quoting Will Larson on career advice in 2025</title>
          
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt; Will Larson, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lethain.com/career-advice-2025/&quot;&gt;Career advice in 2025&lt;/a&gt;&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t give advice on what you should do, but if you’re finding this job market difficult, it’s certainly not personal. My sense is that’s basically the experience that everyone is having when searching for new roles right now. If you are in a role today that’s frustrating you, my advice is to try harder than usual to find a way to make it a rewarding experience, even if it’s not perfect. I also wouldn’t personally try to sit this cycle out unless you’re comfortable with a small risk that reentry is quite difficult: I think it’s more likely that the ecosystem is meaningfully different in five years than that it’s largely unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, this hasn’t really been the advice that anyone wanted when they chatted with me, but it seems to generally have resonated with them as a realistic appraisal of the current markets. Hopefully there’s something useful for you in here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sure does feel personal if the paycheck stops, but I know what he means. It&#39;s not &quot;not personal&quot; so much as &lt;em&gt;impersonal&lt;/em&gt; like a funnel cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although, it does feel a bit &lt;em&gt;pointed&lt;/em&gt; insofar as some of the industry moves seem to be toward pulling back some of the privilege &amp;amp; perks folks like me have enjoyed for decades. Still, indignation doesn&#39;t pay my mortgage or feed the cats, so one must roll with the punches to stay intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>What I&#39;m thinking about AI and LLMs</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;I&#39;m in a weird place with this current AI wave in the tech industry. I feel like a good chunk of folks would tar &amp;amp; feather me if I wrote anything but a complete denunciation, while another chunk I already blocked during the crypto &amp;amp; NFT craze. I still feel like writing something, though, if only to bounce it off the screen for myself.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description
