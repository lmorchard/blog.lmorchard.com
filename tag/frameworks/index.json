    "html": "<p>Because it's been awhile since I last surveyed the landscape, I played around a bit with web frameworks this weekend.  Mainly, I tried getting something simple working with the <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/\">Zend Framework</a>.  After intermittent play and much studying of documentation between Saturday and Sunday, I got to \"hello world.\"</p>\n<p>Unlike other web frameworks of late, Zend Framework doesn't come with any magical CLI tools to build out directory trees and / or generate code.  Being somewhat suspicious and curmudgeonly about that sort of magic to begin with, this actually struck me as an attractive thing about ZF.  In fact, what I really liked about ZF at first glance is that it's less of a monolithic <b>system</b> and more of a bucket of parts from a single source that fit together decently.</p>\n<p>And, all my favorite parts are there:  Among other things there's <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.config.html\">config</a>, <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.log.html\">logging</a>, <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.html\">a front controller</a> with <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.router.html\">URL routing</a>, template-system agnostic <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.html\">view support</a>, and somewhat non-magical <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.html\">DB / model support</a>.</p>\n<p>These were all things I'd grabbed from <a href=\"http://pear.php.net/\">PEAR</a> for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/Cuckoo/lib/MiniFramework.php\">my more recent PHP mini-framework</a> play, but I figured there should be some benefit from finding them in a unified collection like the Zend Framework.</p>\n<p>The experience was somewhat similar to rolling my own, though.  I stumbled through some docs and eventually found some blog entries and a tutorial.  It's all very loosely-coupled and somewhat DIY, which is actually what I wanted.

I see abstraction where I think the gritty concrete needs to be left bare.  I often see lots of astronaut acrobatics that just have to be burning tons of cycles.
