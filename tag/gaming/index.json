Mouse &amp; keyboard &amp; headphones are also easy—USB cables come in long lengths and Bluetooth is a thing.</p>\n<p>No, the hard part was the monitor. I had been gaming on a 2012 15&quot; MacBook Pro—which was physically convenient but lacking in performance. A gaming PC solves the latter, but no one seems to sell 15&quot; standalone monitors equivalent to my laptop screen. That was when I discovered <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Laptop-to-Desktop-Conversion/\">an Instructable article</a> about how to turn an old laptop into a desktop panel. <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch/#Laptop_decapitation\">That gave me ideas</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-10---artisanal-acrylic\">Version 1.0 - Artisanal Acrylic</h2>\n<p>Turns out, there are <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/usr/chinatobby2011\">vendors on eBay</a> who offer complete kits for hooking a laptop display panel up to a PC. They just don&#39;t come with any kind of enclosure like your typical computer monitor. So, <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/02/10/building-my-couch-computing-station/\">I ordered one of those kits and tried handcrafting a case</a>. It turned out crude yet functional:</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8439217201/in/photolist-5m6a-dRKcfR-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRk8-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"First fully assembled power-on of my DIY monitor\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/8439217201_6eea54c3e5_z.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"First fully assembled power-on of my DIY monitor\"></a></p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8447859933/in/photolist-5m6a-dRKcfR-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRk8-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"Rear view #2 of DIY monitor and IKEA DAVE\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/8447859933_c1bf2c05aa_z.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Rear view #2 of DIY monitor and IKEA DAVE\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"version-11---custom-picture-frame\">Version 1.1 - Custom Picture Frame</h2>\n<p>I used that first version for a year in my living room. It was ugly &amp; heavy &amp; awkward. Happily, I fell upon <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Raspberry-Pi-Media-Panel-fka-Digita/?ALLSTEPS\">this Instructables article</a> that pointed me to <a href=\"http://www.americanframe.com/\">American Frame</a>. They&#39;ll produce a rectangular picture frame in just about any custom size you&#39;d like—height, width, <em>and</em> depth.</p>\n<p>So, I ordered a nice matte black metal frame close to the size of my display panel. I ended up with this:</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/12222356524/in/photolist-dRKcfR-7aTRk8-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-5m6a-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"Updated Couch PC monitor\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/12222356524_fcbd4cf0b4_z.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"Updated Couch PC monitor\"></a></p>\n<p>Sleeker and lighter. The back of the picture frame was just <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foamcore\">foamcore</a> and I used double-sided tape on the monitor arm and all the electronics. Luckily, the panel and all were light enough for these hacks. But, it kind of fell apart across two house moves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-12---mic-stands--laser-cutters-ftw\">Version 1.2 - Mic Stands &amp; Laser Cutters FTW</h2>\n<p>I decided I wanted to minimize things. The Ikea Dave laptop stand seemed a bit much, especially when I needed to move it around—or hide it when company came over.</p>\n<p>Last year, I (finally) got a membership at <a href=\"https://www.i3detroit.org/\">i3Detroit</a>. I skilled up on laser cutters and <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/2016/08/29/gamechord/\">made a DIY keypad that I showed off at the Detroit Maker Faire</a>. Things that, you know, <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/topic/i3detroit-public/Qv1P91ySqWo/discussion\">I should have done years ago at the start of this whole DIY monitor project</a>—rather than cutting things by hand and with a Dremel.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I discovered that there&#39;s a such thing as <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2jccG5D\">a VESA mount</a> for <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2jcc93M\">microphone stands</a>. I bought those and threw in an <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2j1YpeM\">adapter</a> &amp; a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2j1VYZq\">gooseneck</a>—all of which let me strip my rig down like so:</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/32182700386/in/datetaken/\" title=\"20170109_221645\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/32182700386_4320d2a1d0_z.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"800\" alt=\"20170109_221645\"></a></p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/31845156280/in/datetaken/\" title=\"20170109_221722\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/31845156280_d16551c8df_z.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"800\" alt=\"20170109_221722\"></a></p>\n<p>By this point, the double-sided tape and the foamcore just weren&#39;t up to the task. I decided that I needed to use my laser cutter skills and spare stock of acrylic sheets to build a new mounting solution.</p>\n<p>I came up with this in <a href=\"https://inkscape.org/en/\">Inkscape</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/monitor-back-2.svg\"><img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/path3848.png\"></a></p>\n<p>This is a flattened image (linked to <a href=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/monitor-back-2.svg\">the original SVG</a>) of what turned out to be two 2.5mm and two 1.5mm sheets behind the laptop display panel. This layout has places to bolt in all of the electronic components of the monitor—driver board, button panel, and power supply. It&#39;s also got a proper 75/100 VESA mount that accepts <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2iYwbAU\">10mm thumbscrew bolts</a> through the mic stand plate.</p>\n<p>The main thing that worked out better than I expected is this: <img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/nuts.png\" style=\"width: 1.5em\"></p>\n<p>The two 1.5mm layers have rectangular cut-outs. Each of those trap a 3mm thick hexogonal M4 nut and act as wrenches. The 2.5mm layers have holes for bolts. With a little Dremel work, I have a set of M4 bolts that are trimmed so as to prevent grinding into the display panel behind the acrylic layers.</p>\n<p>After a trip to <a href=\"https://www.i3detroit.org/\">i3Detroit</a> yesterday, I ended up with this:</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/32080951661/in/datetaken/\" title=\"20170108_214638\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/32080951661_c92bb3f74c_z.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" alt=\"20170108_214638\"></a></p>\n<p>I improvised attaching the power supply with bolted-down velcro straps. And, alas, the &quot;roof&quot; I made for the driver board didn&#39;t quite work—I need longer bolts &amp; spacers. But, the 75/100 VESA mounting holes worked great!</p>\n<p>The whole thing is now decidedly heavier than with the old foamcore—but it&#39;s still lighter than v1.0 and any other comparable monitor I&#39;ve seen. It&#39;s also much sturdier: I can turn &amp; adjust it however I like with the gooseneck without the constant threat of duct tape tearing and falling apart. And, of course, the mic stand raises &amp; lowers easily.</p>\n<p>But, when I <em>do</em> want to take it apart, it&#39;s totally doable without worry. Cables unplug, thumbscrews unscrew, the mic stand breaks down—and the whole thing can hide under the couch in pieces.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\">Next steps?</h2>\n<p>Enclosure upgrades notwithstanding, this is a 3-year-old 17&quot; 1080p monitor. I&#39;m starting to feel the itch for a 4k panel since <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BOlqtGyh7Ln\">I upgraded my video card</a>. But, there&#39;s apparently still no one who sells such a thing as a readymade product.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, on eBay, there are vendors offering <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/itm/HDMI-DVI-DP-Board-17-3-3840x2160-UHD-4K-Wideview-100-NTSC-LCD-B173ZAN01-0-/192056466946?hash=item2cb7751e02\">4k versions of the kit</a> that started me off on this whole adventure. I&#39;m tempted to order one of those and use what I&#39;ve learned so far to build the next revision of my monitor in a picture frame with a laser-cut VESA mount back panel.</p>\n<p>Maybe I&#39;ll retire this 1080p monitor for use with my CHIP <a href=\"https://getchip.com/pages/chip\">Pico-8 console kit</a> for a snazzy all-in-one barcade project. In any case, I&#39;m just happy my lovely wife continues to tolerate this experiment of mine in living room couch gaming.</p>\n<script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<!-- vim: set wrap linebreak nolist wrapmargin=0 textwidth=0 syntax=markdown formatoptions-=t textwidth=78: -->\n",

That was when I discovered [an Instructable article][instructablepanel] about how to turn an old laptop into a desktop panel. [That gave me ideas][laptopdecapitation].\n\n## Version 1.0 - Artisanal Acrylic\n\nTurns out, there are [vendors on eBay][monitorvendors] who offer complete kits for hooking a laptop display panel up to a PC. They just don't come with any kind of enclosure like your typical computer monitor. So, [I ordered one of those kits and tried handcrafting a case][buildingv1]. It turned out crude yet functional:\n\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8439217201/in/photolist-5m6a-dRKcfR-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRk8-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"First fully assembled power-on of my DIY monitor\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/8439217201_6eea54c3e5_z.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"First fully assembled power-on of my DIY monitor\"></a>\n\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8447859933/in/photolist-5m6a-dRKcfR-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRk8-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"Rear view #2 of DIY monitor and IKEA DAVE\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/8447859933_c1bf2c05aa_z.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Rear view #2 of DIY monitor and IKEA DAVE\"></a>\n\n## Version 1.1 - Custom Picture Frame\n\nI used that first version for a year in my living room. It was ugly & heavy & awkward. Happily, I fell upon [this Instructables article][instructableframe] that pointed me to [American Frame][]. They'll produce a rectangular picture frame in just about any custom size you'd like—height, width, *and* depth.\n\nSo, I ordered a nice matte black metal frame close to the size of my display panel. I ended up with this:\n\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/12222356524/in/photolist-dRKcfR-7aTRk8-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-5m6a-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"Updated Couch PC monitor\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/12222356524_fcbd4cf0b4_z.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"Updated Couch PC monitor\"></a>\n\nSleeker and lighter. The back of the picture frame was just [foamcore][] and I used double-sided tape on the monitor arm and all the electronics. Luckily, the panel and all were light enough for these hacks. But, it kind of fell apart across two house moves.\n\n## Version 1.2 - Mic Stands & Laser Cutters FTW\n\nI decided I wanted to minimize things. The Ikea Dave laptop stand seemed a bit much, especially when I needed to move it around—or hide it when company came over.\n\nLast year, I (finally) got a membership at [i3Detroit][]. I skilled up on laser cutters and [made a DIY keypad that I showed off at the Detroit Maker Faire][gamechord]. Things that, you know, [I should have done years ago at the start of this whole DIY monitor project][i3early]—rather than cutting things by hand and with a Dremel.\n\nAnyway, I discovered that there's a such thing as [a VESA mount][micvesa] for [microphone stands][micstand]. I bought those and threw in an [adapter][micadapter] & a [gooseneck][gooseneck]—all of which let me strip my rig down like so:\n\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/32182700386/in/datetaken/\" title=\"20170109_221645\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/32182700386_4320d2a1d0_z.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"800\" alt=\"20170109_221645\"></a>\n\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/31845156280/in/datetaken/\" title=\"20170109_221722\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/31845156280_d16551c8df_z.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"800\" alt=\"20170109_221722\"></a>\n\nBy this point, the double-sided tape and the foamcore just weren't up to the task. I decided that I needed to use my laser cutter skills and spare stock of acrylic sheets to build a new mounting solution.\n\nI came up with this in [Inkscape][]:\n\n[<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/path3848.png\">][backdesign]\n\nThis is a flattened image (linked to [the original SVG][backdesign]) of what turned out to be two 2.5mm and two 1.5mm sheets behind the laptop display panel. This layout has places to bolt in all of the electronic components of the monitor—driver board, button panel, and power supply. It's also got a proper 75/100 VESA mount that accepts [10mm thumbscrew bolts][thumbscrews] through the mic stand plate.\n\nThe main thing that worked out better than I expected is this: <img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/nuts.png\" style=\"width: 1.5em\">\n\nThe two 1.5mm layers have rectangular cut-outs. Each of those trap a 3mm thick hexogonal M4 nut and act as wrenches. The 2.5mm layers have holes for bolts. With a little Dremel work, I have a set of M4 bolts that are trimmed so as to prevent grinding into the display panel behind the acrylic layers.\n\nAfter a trip to [i3Detroit][] yesterday, I ended up with this:\n\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/32080951661/in/datetaken/\" title=\"20170108_214638\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/32080951661_c92bb3f74c_z.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" alt=\"20170108_214638\"></a>\n\nI improvised attaching the power supply with bolted-down velcro straps. And, alas, the \"roof\" I made for the driver board didn't quite work—I need longer bolts & spacers. But, the 75/100 VESA mounting holes worked great!\n\nThe whole thing is now decidedly heavier than with the old foamcore—but it's still lighter than v1.0 and any other comparable monitor I've seen. It's also much sturdier: I can turn & adjust it however I like with the gooseneck without the constant threat of duct tape tearing and falling apart. And, of course, the mic stand raises & lowers easily.\n\nBut, when I *do* want to take it apart, it's totally doable without worry. Cables unplug, thumbscrews unscrew, the mic stand breaks down—and the whole thing can hide under the couch in pieces.\n\n## Next steps?\n\nEnclosure upgrades notwithstanding, this is a 3-year-old 17\" 1080p monitor. I'm starting to feel the itch for a 4k panel since [I upgraded my video card][videocard]. But, there's apparently still no one who sells such a thing as a readymade product.\n\nMeanwhile, on eBay, there are vendors offering [4k versions of the kit][4kkit] that started me off on this whole adventure. I'm tempted to order one of those and use what I've learned so far to build the next revision of my monitor in a picture frame with a laser-cut VESA mount back panel.\n\nMaybe I'll retire this 1080p monitor for use with my CHIP [Pico-8 console kit][chipconsole] for a snazzy all-in-one barcade project. In any case, I'm just happy my lovely wife continues to tolerate this experiment of mine in living room couch gaming.\n\n<script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n[thumbscrews]: http://amzn.to/2iYwbAU\n[laptopdecapitation]: https://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch/#Laptop_decapitation\n[chipconsole]: https://getchip.com/pages/chip\n[4kkit]: http://www.ebay.com/itm/HDMI-DVI-DP-Board-17-3-3840x2160-UHD-4K-Wideview-100-NTSC-LCD-B173ZAN01-0-/192056466946?hash=item2cb7751e02\n[videocard]: https://www.instagram.com/p/BOlqtGyh7Ln\n[i3detroit]: https://www.i3detroit.org/\n[backdesign]: /uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/monitor-back-2.svg\n[inkscape]: https://inkscape.org/en/\n[gooseneck]: http://amzn.to/2j1VYZq\n[micadapter]: http://amzn.to/2j1YpeM\n[lapdesk]: http://amzn.to/2jntfL6\n[micstand]: http://amzn.to/2jcc93M\n[micvesa]: http://amzn.to/2jccG5D\n[i3early]: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/i3detroit-public/Qv1P91ySqWo/discussion\n[gamechord]: https://blog.lmorchard.com/2016/08/29/gamechord/\n[foamcore]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foamcore\n[monitorvendors]: http://www.ebay.com/usr/chinatobby2011\n[american frame]: http://www.americanframe.com/\n[instructablepanel]: http://www.instructables.com/id/Laptop-to-Desktop-Conversion/\n[instructableframe]: http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Raspberry-Pi-Media-Panel-fka-Digita/?ALLSTEPS\n[fractalnode]: http://amzn.to/2iy5G2b\n[couchgaming]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch\n[buildingv1]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/02/10/building-my-couch-computing-station/\n\n<!-- vim: set wrap linebreak nolist wrapmargin=0 textwidth=0 syntax=markdown formatoptions-=t textwidth=78: -->\n",

Through intentional constraints &amp; platform quirks, it offers offer creative hooks &amp; puzzles.</p>\n<p>The constraints mean it&#39;s not as easy to get lost in options or feel overwhelmed. For example, <a href=\"https://neko250.github.io/pico8-api/\">here&#39;s a Pico-8 API cheatsheet</a> - it&#39;s pretty much all I&#39;ve needed! It&#39;s also hard to build anything huge, so there&#39;s less of a compulsion to go beyond doodles or a few specific game mechanics. I can make something derpy but good enough and move on without stressing about my artistic skills.</p>\n<p>But also, some folks have found ways to really push the boundaries of the system - and that is a puzzle in itself. It&#39;s great to get a fresh dose of that old school awe from seeing a clever hack make the machine do something it wasn&#39;t meant to do. It&#39;s akin to seeing someone pull off some nasty moves in game streams where I know just enough to realize what&#39;s happening.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m nowhere near that level of Pico-8 mastery, but it could be interesting to dive into some of the things I&#39;ve learned so far. But, I&#39;ll save that for yet another post.</p>\n<h2 id=\"play-my-game\">Play my game!</h2>\n<p>Pico-8 games can also be exported to HTML5 and JavaScript. This embedded web player consists of the game code and an Emscripten-compiled version of the Pico-8 engine. So, <a href=\"/2015/08/07/web-awesome/\">because the web is awesome</a>, even if Pico-8 goes away this copy of my game will continue working long after:</p>\n<iframe class=\"lazyload\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 420px\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen data-src=\"/uploads/2016/poke-the-mongo/pokethemongo.html\"></iframe>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve also read that the folks behind Pico-8 aren&#39;t particularly hostile to others cloning the system - which has lead to things like <a href=\"https://github.com/picolove/picolove\">PICOLOVE</a>, an independent implementation of the Pico-8 APIs for another Lua-based game system. I&#39;ve seen a few folks leverage that to get their games running on Android, so I&#39;ll have to check that out at some point.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I&#39;ve got a few more things to add, but I think this game is getting pretty close to where I want it to be. It&#39;s all gone much faster than I expected, so I&#39;m looking forward to trying more ideas. </p>\n<p>Until then, let me know how you like Poke the Mongo, and I&#39;ll follow up with a more in-depth look at how I made this thing!</p>\n<script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<!-- vim: set wrap linebreak nolist wrapmargin=0 textwidth=0 syntax=markdown formatoptions-=t textwidth=78: -->\n",

Apropos of that, Lexaloffle has forums - a BBS - where folks post & discuss their Pico-8 carts. [You can find mine over here][mongobbs]!\n\n1. Inside Pico-8 is a mode called \"Splore\" which connects to the Lexaloffle BBS to let you browse uploaded carts from the console. So, when I uploaded my game, it was instantly available to everyone else with Pico-8!\n\nPico-8 is game making as a social activity, and the system has all the batteries included.\n\n## Game making is a fun game\n\nAs I tinkered, it occurred to me that Pico-8 is less a serious game development system and more a game about making games. Through intentional constraints & platform quirks, it offers offer creative hooks & puzzles.\n\nThe constraints mean it's not as easy to get lost in options or feel overwhelmed. For example, [here's a Pico-8 API cheatsheet](https://neko250.github.io/pico8-api/) - it's pretty much all I've needed! It's also hard to build anything huge, so there's less of a compulsion to go beyond doodles or a few specific game mechanics. I can make something derpy but good enough and move on without stressing about my artistic skills.\n\nBut also, some folks have found ways to really push the boundaries of the system - and that is a puzzle in itself. It's great to get a fresh dose of that old school awe from seeing a clever hack make the machine do something it wasn't meant to do. It's akin to seeing someone pull off some nasty moves in game streams where I know just enough to realize what's happening.\n\nI'm nowhere near that level of Pico-8 mastery, but it could be interesting to dive into some of the things I've learned so far. But, I'll save that for yet another post.\n\n## Play my game!\n\nPico-8 games can also be exported to HTML5 and JavaScript. This embedded web player consists of the game code and an Emscripten-compiled version of the Pico-8 engine. So, [because the web is awesome][webawesome], even if Pico-8 goes away this copy of my game will continue working long after:\n\n<iframe class=\"lazyload\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 420px\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen data-src=\"/uploads/2016/poke-the-mongo/pokethemongo.html\"></iframe>\n\nI've also read that the folks behind Pico-8 aren't particularly hostile to others cloning the system - which has lead to things like [PICOLOVE](https://github.com/picolove/picolove), an independent implementation of the Pico-8 APIs for another Lua-based game system. I've seen a few folks leverage that to get their games running on Android, so I'll have to check that out at some point.\n\nAnyway, I've got a few more things to add, but I think this game is getting pretty close to where I want it to be. It's all gone much faster than I expected, so I'm looking forward to trying more ideas. \n\nUntil then, let me know how you like Poke the Mongo, and I'll follow up with a more in-depth look at how I made this thing!\n\n[webawesome]: /2015/08/07/web-awesome/\n[mongobbs]: http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=4111\n\n<script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<!-- vim: set wrap linebreak nolist wrapmargin=0 textwidth=0 syntax=markdown formatoptions-=t textwidth=78: -->\n",

I used a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1nQby9D:\">Microsoft\nSidewinder Strategic Commander</a> to play Everquest one-handed. (The\nother hand was for tinkering with <a href=\"https://github.com/brainiac/showeq\">ShowEQ</a> on a nearby Linux machine, of course.)</p>\n<p>More recently, when I was playing a space trucker in EVE Online, I would often\nride a recumbent exercise bike and use a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1NKn0bq\">One Finger Mouse</a> with my\nlaptop to align and warp between stations.</p>\n<p>Given all the above, the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1nQzE4f\">Steam Controller</a> looked completely relevant to my\ninterests when <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/valve-announces-the-steam-controller-a-new-way-to-cont-1411558137\">it was announced</a> way back in 2013. </p>\n<p>Fast forward to November 2015, and after many prototypes &amp; tweaks, <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9705234/valve-steam-machines-controller-link-launch\">it finally\narrived</a>. I managed to wait a month or so, watching for red flags\nin early reviews. But, of course, I gave in and had it in time for my\ntraditional end-of-year holiday gaming binge. <br style=\"clear: both\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"ergonomics\">Ergonomics</h2>\n<img class=\"inset left\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/couch-pc.jpg\">\n\n<p>At <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch/\">my couch PC</a>, I use an Xbox 360 controller whenever I can. I don&#39;t\nwant to clutter the living room with big weird joysticks &amp; such.</p>\n<p>Besides that, having my hands in a neutral position in my lap seems to\nhelp quite a lot with keeping wrist pain at bay after a day in my office\nalready spent with trackball and keyboard. But, not every game supports a\ncontroller out of the box.</p>\n<p>So, it seemed really promising when I read Valve&#39;s claims that the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1nQzE4f\">Steam\nController</a> would work with &quot;<a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/353370/\">games from all genres</a>&quot;\nincluding titles typically bound to a keyboard and mouse.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24524584120\"><img class=\"inset right\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/all-3-controllers.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Now that I&#39;ve got the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1nQzE4f\">Steam Controller</a> in my hands, it makes my Xbox 360\ncontroller feel tiny. It reminds me a little of the original Xbox controller.\nThough, it&#39;s really unfair to take that comparison too far - I mean, that\nthing was bigger than some actual game consoles.</p>\n<p>The Xbox 360 handles taper down into rounded points that cover a third of my\npalm. But, the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1nQzE4f\">Steam Controller</a> bulges out at the bottoms and covers about\nhalf of my palm.  </p>\n<p>It&#39;s like the difference between a small chicken egg\nand a jumbo.  (Sorry, I&#39;ve been cooking today.) And where my fingers curl\ninward toward my palm with the 360 controller, the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1nQzE4f\">Steam Controller</a> has\nthem pointing more toward my chest to accomodate the thicker grips.\n<br style=\"clear: both\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24206620773/in/datetaken/\"><img class=\"inset left\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/360-hands.jpg\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24740006121/in/datetaken/\"><img class=\"inset left\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/sc-hands.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>(And, this is where I realize I was never destined to be a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZxX3-rJoNI\">hand model</a>.)</p>\n<p>The Xbox 360 controller feels like curved handlebars between\nmy palms and the last three fingers, leaving just my index fingers and thumbs\nfree to move. It could be that I&#39;ve gotten used to it over the years, but the\ndesign of this controller feels like it naturally falls into my relaxed\nhands after I&#39;ve flopped them lazily into my lap. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1nQzE4f\">Steam Controller</a>, though, seems to call for a more tense grip that I\ncan feel in my shoulders &amp; wrists after awhile. </p>\n<p>To keep things stable as I play, I find myself using some arm muscle &amp; elbow\npressure to wedge it between the bony first knuckles of my index fingers and\nthe bases of my thumbs.  Except for a little stabilization from my pinkies and\nring fingers, this leaves the rest of my fingers free to reach the thumbpads\nand buttons. <br style=\"clear: both\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24726646081/in/dateposted-public/\"><img class=\"inset right\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/sides.jpg\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24702264542/in/dateposted-public/\"><img class=\"inset right\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/backs.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>The face of the Xbox 360 controller follows a convex curve. When relaxed, my\nextended thumbs arch over that curve, their pads resting on the left stick and\nright button cluster.</p>\n<p>The face of the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1nQzE4f\">Steam Controller</a> is concave, almost the inverse of the\nother controller.

I&#39;d like to\nsee Valve come up with a rechargeable pack at some point.\n<br style=\"clear: both\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"software\">Software</h2>\n<p>The physical design and laundry list of sensors is vaguely interesting. But,\nwhat really makes the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1nQzE4f\">Steam Controller</a> shine - and sometimes stink - is\nthe software. And, that software is Steam in Big Picture Mode.</p>\n<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/big-picture-home.jpg\">\n\n<p>The only way to configure the Controller is via Big Picture mode.\nAnd, as far as I can tell, launching games (even non-Steam games) via Big\nPicture is the only way to load game-specific configurations. </p>\n<p>I understand that this thing was designed to be paired with a Steam Machine\nand played on a TV. But, I don&#39;t play in front of a TV - and I doubt many PC\ngamers do. I find Big Picture Mode clunky and occasionally crashy. A few\ntimes, the controller has gone non-responsive or got loaded with the wrong\nconfiguration. </p>\n<p>After <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/controller/update/dec15\">the firmware update in December</a>, my configuration changes\nare often reverted &amp; lost. Sometimes the Big Picture interface offers up\ndelays &amp; progress animations with no explanation of what&#39;s happening. I&#39;m\nhoping I can troll the forums for some fixes, but having to do that is a bit\ndisappointing.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s early days yet, so things could get better with future patches. Valve\nshows every indication that they plan to support this device for the long\nhaul.  Still, I&#39;d love it if Valve (or the community) released an &quot;expert&quot;\nconfiguration tool as a straightforward desktop Windows application.  Just let\nme quickly assign bindings in a solid, ugly, utilitarian interface and let me\nmanually save &amp; load configurations.</p>\n<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/controller-config.png\">\n\n<p>The awkwardness is frustrating, because configuration is the whole reason the\ncontroller exists: I put up with the annoying UI because the result is\ninteresting. With a little tweaking, it really can generate whatever inputs are\nneeded for any game I want to play.</p>\n<p>Except for the Valve button, there are 17 other buttons on the device available\nto generate any combination of keyboard &amp; mouse signals. That includes the\nclicky trackpads &amp; joystick - and I&#39;m counting the analog triggers twice,\nbecause you can set different inputs for both partial and full pulls.</p>\n<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/trackpad-config.png\">\n\n<p>And then, there are the trackpads: In a nutshell, either trackpad can be\nconfigured as a mouse, an analog joystick, a digital d-pad, a cluster of\nbuttons, or to summon up overlay menus triggering arbitrary inputs. There are 9\ndifferent modes covering slightly different simulations of these devices. Each\nmode comes with its own control panel offering an array of sliders, variants,\nand advanced settings.</p>\n<p>For button input, there are ways to define segments of the trackpad as virtual\nbuttons activated on touch or by clicking down the pad.  Joystick input comes\nin a few subtly different flavors I haven&#39;t yet fully explored. </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve also not played much with touch menus. These consist of Steam-generated\noverlays offering up to 16 buttons plus an alternate layer of 16 more.\nBetween both trackpads, this can add up to 64 different virtual buttons\ntriggering whatever keyboard, mouse, or gamepad combinations I&#39;d like.</p>\n<p>For pointer input, there&#39;s a mouse mode similar to a laptop trackpad, with\nvarious acceleration and sensitivity settings. To my personal delight, there&#39;s\na trackball mode: the pad signals momentum through haptic rasping that\ntrails off after your thumb has lifted from a swipe - and it stops immediately\nwhen your thumb returns to the pad. </p>\n<p>You can also enable scroll wheel inputs via the raised outer edges of the\ntrackpads. It feels like to the old click-wheel iPods. </p>\n<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/controller-config-import.png\">\n\n<p>If all this sounds overwhelming, Steam offers ready-made crowdsourced\nconfigurations.  These are created by game developers, Valve, and shared by\nthe community at large. This means that I don&#39;t have to wait for all the\ndevelopers in the world to get around to supporting this particular weird\ncontroller. Ideally, as time goes on, control schemes will arrive that hit a\nsweet spot for every game.</p>\n<p>Valve has certainly thrown a lot at the wall here. We&#39;ll see how much sticks.\nIt certainly scratches my itch for a fiddly input device, in any case.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h2>\n<p>In a nutshell, if it accepts mouse, keyboard, joystick, or gamepad - the\n<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1nQzE4f\">Steam Controller</a> works. In this, the marketing is correct and it does what\nit says on the tin.  The more pressing issue is whether the Controller is\ncompatible with <em>me</em> as an interface to <em>the games I like</em>.</p>\n<p>Of course, it should be noted that I&#39;m by no means a pro gamer. I&#39;m\nthe filthiest of casuals - whatever that means after playing video games avidly\nfor 30 years. I&#39;m in it for fun, couldn&#39;t care less about being competitive.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve had the most luck in mouse-and-keyboard games like the ponderously-paced\n<a href=\"http://www.failbettergames.com/sunless/\">Sunless Sea</a> and even in the more frenetic <a href=\"http://us.battle.net/d3/en/\">Diablo III</a>. Of course, at\ntimes, I lose track of the pointer in Diablo when I&#39;m spazzing out with my\nthumb and flinging it around between targets and running away to kite things.\nThat seems to get better as I turn down acceleration and play with\nsensitivity. The newer Mouse Regions mode looks interesting, too, as it\nprovides a direct screen-to-trackpad map rather than mouse or trackball style\ninput. </p>\n<p>For what it&#39;s worth, <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/how-league-of-legends-enables-toxicity-1693572469\">I don&#39;t play a lot of MOBAs lately</a>, but I\ncan imagine the dynamics are similar to Diablo.</p>\n<p>I also played a bit of <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/440/\">Team Fortress 2</a>. As promised, I was able to use\na trackpad for steering &amp; coarse aiming and then tilt the controller itself to\nrefine my aim. Like many things with this device, it takes a bit of getting\nused to and kind of turns it into a new game. Fun-ish, but I&#39;m not great at it\nyet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/252950/\">Rocket League</a> worked out pretty well - in that I was equally terrible both\nwith the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1nQzE4f\">Steam Controller</a> and the Xbox 360 controller. I had a lot of fun\nand never felt like I could blame the controller. Again, I&#39;m just a filthy\ncasual.</p>\n<p>I didn&#39;t have as much luck with <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/323040/\">Laserlife</a>, a surreal rhythm game in the\ntradition of Rez where you guide twin laser trails through targets with analog\nsticks. Ideally, I should be able to use the two trackpads as analog sticks.\nBut, I did a lot better going back to the physical sticks on my Xbox 360\ncontroller. I think the spring resistance in the physical joysticks helped cue\nme into its position. </p>\n<p>The issue seems similar to how I rarely get along with on-screen\ncontrols in smartphone games. But, these trackpads have an advantage\nover virtual glass joysticks - i.e. tactile cues like their surface curve,\nraised edges, and the embossed d-pad shape. I&#39;d like to see if I can find\nworkable settings, because twin-stick shooters are one of my favorite genres.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.elitedangerous.com/\">Elite Dangerous</a> offers a kind of bottomless pit of customization.  It&#39;s a\nwork in progress translating my mouse-and-keyboard controls to a comfortable\nscheme on the Controller. For example, it was stupid fun tying pitch and roll\nto the motion sensors and flying the controller around like a model spaceship.\n(I made zoomy-whoosh-pew-pew noises, too.) I&#39;ve seen other control schemes use\nthe gyro for looking around the cockpit, which is actually used to summon up\nvarious ship panels via gaze. This won&#39;t replace <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvAI3l0v62E\">a super-immersive HOTAS &amp;\nhead tracking setup</a>, but I think I can get it to an enjoyable\npoint.</p>\n<p>Overall, I&#39;ve had decent luck with the games I play. Where things\nhaven&#39;t quite worked out, I have a hunch that there&#39;s a workable control\nscheme somewhere inside the giant bag of options on offer. I&#39;ve seen some\nfolks describe the process a bit like getting accustomed to a new keyboard\nlayout like Dvorak. That&#39;s oddly interesting to me, so I&#39;m going to keep\npoking at it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hackability\">Hackability</h2>\n<p>The Controller is a USB HID composite device - in other words, It <em>is</em> a mouse\n<em>and</em> a keyboard <em>and</em> a joystick <em>and</em> a gamepad, as far as USB is concerned.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve gotten the sense that Steam does <em>something</em> with the Controller input,\nbut I&#39;m not sure if it analgous to things like <a href=\"http://joytokey.net/en/\">JoyToKey</a> or <a href=\"https://autohotkey.com/\">AutoHotKey</a>\nto translate things on the PC side. My guess is that it leans most heavily on\nprocessing in the controller itself to emit standard USB messages to\nachieve maximum compatibility in games.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24639522001/in/dateposted-public/\"><img class=\"inset left\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/teensy-keyboard.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Considering the things found in the <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Steam+Controller+Teardown/52578\">iFixit teardown</a>,\nI&#39;m not seeing any particularly exotic parts. Valve stated early on that &quot;<a href=\"http://hackaday.com/2013/10/01/steam-controller-open-and-hackable/\">the\nSteam Controller was designed from the ground up to be hackable</a>&quot;.</p>\n<p>For example, from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamControllerMods/comments/3p6d26/some_details_on_the_chips_in_the_controller_and/\">a Reddit thread</a>, I\nlearned that the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1nQzE4f\">Steam Controller</a> is built around the <a href=\"http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m0.php\">ARM\nCortex-M0</a>. That&#39;s similar to the <a href=\"http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m0plus.php\">ARM Cortex-M0+</a>\nused in the <a href=\"https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensylc.html\">Teensy LC</a>. </p>\n<p>This is interesting, because I&#39;ve been reading up on how to build a custom\nkeyboard. (You know, as one does.) In the course of that, I&#39;ve been\nacquainting myself with the <a href=\"https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/\">Teensy line of USB development boards</a>.</p>\n<p>Lately, I&#39;ve been playing with the <a href=\"https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html\">Teensy 2.0</a>. That seems to be\npopular in the DIY community for how easy it makes implementing \nUSB devices.  Granted, that&#39;s a different microcontroller (an <a href=\"http://www.atmel.com/devices/atmega32u4.aspx\">Atmel\nATmega32u4</a>), but I&#39;m hoping that general experience with things like the\nTeensy family of dev boards can eventually translate to some personal fun and\nsome community firmware to explore the potential of the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1nQzE4f\">Steam Controller</a>.</p>\n<p>As it is, someone&#39;s already figured out how to <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/353370/discussions/0/494632506573267894/\">play music through the haptic\nactuators</a> and they released the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/Pilatomic/SteamControllerSinger\">source\ncode</a>.  That&#39;s more a function of decoding the \nprotocol from PC to Controller than messing around with the microcontrollers,\nbut it&#39;s still pretty cool.</p>\n<p>It would be great if Valve released more docs &amp; code around this thing. I\ncan understand that there might be some pressure to keep the Steam hardware &amp;\nsoftware ecosystem cohesive. But, for a weird little device like this, I\nimagine they&#39;d only get more sales by fully opening everything up and letting\nthe tinkering world pave the way for more uses - and maybe fix a few bugs for\nthem as clever folks scratch their own itches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1nQzE4f\">Steam Controller</a> is an odd little duck. It&#39;s a bit awkward to hold\nand the software is not great. But, software can be fixed and the controls &amp;\nsensors onboard have so much great potential for PC gaming. </p>\n<p>This is clearly not a mature, finished product - which is disappointing,\nbecause I paid money for it - but I&#39;m really rooting for it. And I&#39;ve already\nused it for dozens of hours in games, so it&#39;s obviously worked for me in many\ncapacities. I&#39;m really hoping that Valve follows through on their promises to\nopen things up for tinkering - because it might be the thing that ultimately\nredeems the whole project.</p>\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=markdown textwidth=78: -->\n",

I used a [Microsoft\nSidewinder Strategic Commander][msssc] to play Everquest one-handed. (The\nother hand was for tinkering with [ShowEQ][] on a nearby Linux machine, of course.)\n\n[showeq]: https://github.com/brainiac/showeq\n\nMore recently, when I was playing a space trucker in EVE Online, I would often\nride a recumbent exercise bike and use a [One Finger Mouse][ofm] with my\nlaptop to align and warp between stations.\n\n[msssc]: http://amzn.to/1nQby9D:\n[pantherxl]: http://assassin3d.squarespace.com/history-panther-xl/ \n[ofm]: http://amzn.to/1NKn0bq\n\nGiven all the above, the [Steam Controller][] looked completely relevant to my\ninterests when [it was announced][scannounce] way back in 2013. \n\nFast forward to November 2015, and after many prototypes & tweaks, [it finally\narrived][screleased].

I don't\nwant to clutter the living room with big weird joysticks & such.\n\n[couchpc]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch/\n\nBesides that, having my hands in a neutral position in my lap seems to\nhelp quite a lot with keeping wrist pain at bay after a day in my office\nalready spent with trackball and keyboard. But, not every game supports a\ncontroller out of the box.\n\nSo, it seemed really promising when I read Valve's claims that the [Steam\nController][] would work with \"[games from all genres][steamhardware]\"\nincluding titles typically bound to a keyboard and mouse.\n\n[steamhardware]: http://store.steampowered.com/app/353370/\n\n[<img class=\"inset right\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/all-3-controllers.jpg\">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24524584120)\n\nNow that I've got the [Steam Controller][] in my hands, it makes my Xbox 360\ncontroller feel tiny. It reminds me a little of the original Xbox controller.\nThough, it's really unfair to take that comparison too far - I mean, that\nthing was bigger than some actual game consoles.\n\nThe Xbox 360 handles taper down into rounded points that cover a third of my\npalm. But, the [Steam Controller][] bulges out at the bottoms and covers about\nhalf of my palm.  \n\nIt's like the difference between a small chicken egg\nand a jumbo.  (Sorry, I've been cooking today.) And where my fingers curl\ninward toward my palm with the 360 controller, the [Steam Controller][] has\nthem pointing more toward my chest to accomodate the thicker grips.\n<br style=\"clear: both\">\n\n[<img class=\"inset left\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/360-hands.jpg\">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24206620773/in/datetaken/)\n[<img class=\"inset left\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/sc-hands.jpg\">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24740006121/in/datetaken/)\n\n(And, this is where I realize I was never destined to be a [hand model][].)\n\n[hand model]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZxX3-rJoNI\n\nThe Xbox 360 controller feels like curved handlebars between\nmy palms and the last three fingers, leaving just my index fingers and thumbs\nfree to move. It could be that I've gotten used to it over the years, but the\ndesign of this controller feels like it naturally falls into my relaxed\nhands after I've flopped them lazily into my lap. \n\nThe [Steam Controller][], though, seems to call for a more tense grip that I\ncan feel in my shoulders & wrists after awhile. \n\nTo keep things stable as I play, I find myself using some arm muscle & elbow\npressure to wedge it between the bony first knuckles of my index fingers and\nthe bases of my thumbs.  Except for a little stabilization from my pinkies and\nring fingers, this leaves the rest of my fingers free to reach the thumbpads\nand buttons. <br style=\"clear: both\">\n\n[<img class=\"inset right\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/sides.jpg\">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24726646081/in/dateposted-public/)\n[<img class=\"inset right\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/backs.jpg\">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24702264542/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nThe face of the Xbox 360 controller follows a convex curve. When relaxed, my\nextended thumbs arch over that curve, their pads resting on the left stick and\nright button cluster.\n\nThe face of the [Steam Controller][] is concave, almost the inverse of the\nother controller. My bent thumbs hover over a pair of circular trackpads,\nwhich are far better controlled with strokes from thumb tips than by swiping or\nrolling flat thumb pads across them.\n\n[dpbone]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_bone#Distal_phalanx\n\nOverall, I can't say I'm entirely comfortable with the [Steam Controller][] in\nmy hands. That worries me a little after years of being unkind to my wrists.\nI'm still adjusting my grip on the thing, though. Maybe I'll get used to it. \nAfter all, I spent years with the first NES gamepad - and it was no ergonomic\nmarvel.\n<br style=\"clear: both\">\n\n## Hardware\n\nIn terms of input hardware, the [Steam Controller][] offers interesting\nimprovements over my trusty old Xbox 360 controller.\n\n[<img id=\"thumbnail\" class=\"inset wide left\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/sc-top.jpg\">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24525157630/in/photostream/)\n\nOn the front, there's the \"Valve\" button flanked by a back & start buttons.\nThere's also an analog clicky joystick and an X/Y/A/B button cluster. \n\nBut, the [Steam Controller][]'s special sauce is the pair of trackpads at the\ntop of the controller.

But,\nwhat really makes the [Steam Controller][] shine - and sometimes stink - is\nthe software. And, that software is Steam in Big Picture Mode.\n\n<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/big-picture-home.jpg\">\n\nThe only way to configure the Controller is via Big Picture mode.\nAnd, as far as I can tell, launching games (even non-Steam games) via Big\nPicture is the only way to load game-specific configurations. \n\nI understand that this thing was designed to be paired with a Steam Machine\nand played on a TV. But, I don't play in front of a TV - and I doubt many PC\ngamers do. I find Big Picture Mode clunky and occasionally crashy. A few\ntimes, the controller has gone non-responsive or got loaded with the wrong\nconfiguration. \n\nAfter [the firmware update in December][scdecpatch], my configuration changes\nare often reverted & lost. Sometimes the Big Picture interface offers up\ndelays & progress animations with no explanation of what's happening. I'm\nhoping I can troll the forums for some fixes, but having to do that is a bit\ndisappointing.\n\n[scdecpatch]: http://store.steampowered.com/controller/update/dec15\n\nIt's early days yet, so things could get better with future patches. Valve\nshows every indication that they plan to support this device for the long\nhaul.  Still, I'd love it if Valve (or the community) released an \"expert\"\nconfiguration tool as a straightforward desktop Windows application.  Just let\nme quickly assign bindings in a solid, ugly, utilitarian interface and let me\nmanually save & load configurations.\n\n<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/controller-config.png\">\n\nThe awkwardness is frustrating, because configuration is the whole reason the\ncontroller exists: I put up with the annoying UI because the result is\ninteresting. With a little tweaking, it really can generate whatever inputs are\nneeded for any game I want to play.\n\nExcept for the Valve button, there are 17 other buttons on the device available\nto generate any combination of keyboard & mouse signals. That includes the\nclicky trackpads & joystick - and I'm counting the analog triggers twice,\nbecause you can set different inputs for both partial and full pulls.\n\n<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/trackpad-config.png\">\n\nAnd then, there are the trackpads: In a nutshell, either trackpad can be\nconfigured as a mouse, an analog joystick, a digital d-pad, a cluster of\nbuttons, or to summon up overlay menus triggering arbitrary inputs. There are 9\ndifferent modes covering slightly different simulations of these devices. Each\nmode comes with its own control panel offering an array of sliders, variants,\nand advanced settings.\n\nFor button input, there are ways to define segments of the trackpad as virtual\nbuttons activated on touch or by clicking down the pad.  Joystick input comes\nin a few subtly different flavors I haven't yet fully explored. \n\nI've also not played much with touch menus. These consist of Steam-generated\noverlays offering up to 16 buttons plus an alternate layer of 16 more.\nBetween both trackpads, this can add up to 64 different virtual buttons\ntriggering whatever keyboard, mouse, or gamepad combinations I'd like.\n\nFor pointer input, there's a mouse mode similar to a laptop trackpad, with\nvarious acceleration and sensitivity settings. To my personal delight, there's\na trackball mode: the pad signals momentum through haptic rasping that\ntrails off after your thumb has lifted from a swipe - and it stops immediately\nwhen your thumb returns to the pad. \n\nYou can also enable scroll wheel inputs via the raised outer edges of the\ntrackpads. It feels like to the old click-wheel iPods. \n\n<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/controller-config-import.png\">\n\nIf all this sounds overwhelming, Steam offers ready-made crowdsourced\nconfigurations.  These are created by game developers, Valve, and shared by\nthe community at large. This means that I don't have to wait for all the\ndevelopers in the world to get around to supporting this particular weird\ncontroller. Ideally, as time goes on, control schemes will arrive that hit a\nsweet spot for every game.\n\nValve has certainly thrown a lot at the wall here. We'll see how much sticks.\nIt certainly scratches my itch for a fiddly input device, in any case.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nIn a nutshell, if it accepts mouse, keyboard, joystick, or gamepad - the\n[Steam Controller][] works. In this, the marketing is correct and it does what\nit says on the tin.  The more pressing issue is whether the Controller is\ncompatible with *me* as an interface to *the games I like*.\n\nOf course, it should be noted that I'm by no means a pro gamer. I'm\nthe filthiest of casuals - whatever that means after playing video games avidly\nfor 30 years. I'm in it for fun, couldn't care less about being competitive.\n\nI've had the most luck in mouse-and-keyboard games like the ponderously-paced\n[Sunless Sea][] and even in the more frenetic [Diablo III][]. Of course, at\ntimes, I lose track of the pointer in Diablo when I'm spazzing out with my\nthumb and flinging it around between targets and running away to kite things.\nThat seems to get better as I turn down acceleration and play with\nsensitivity. The newer Mouse Regions mode looks interesting, too, as it\nprovides a direct screen-to-trackpad map rather than mouse or trackball style\ninput. \n\nFor what it's worth, [I don't play a lot of MOBAs lately][mobatoxic], but I\ncan imagine the dynamics are similar to Diablo.\n\n[mobatoxic]: http://kotaku.com/how-league-of-legends-enables-toxicity-1693572469\n\nI also played a bit of [Team Fortress 2][tf2]. As promised, I was able to use\na trackpad for steering & coarse aiming and then tilt the controller itself to\nrefine my aim. Like many things with this device, it takes a bit of getting\nused to and kind of turns it into a new game. Fun-ish, but I'm not great at it\nyet.\n\n[tf2]: http://store.steampowered.com/app/440/\n\n[Rocket League][] worked out pretty well - in that I was equally terrible both\nwith the [Steam Controller][] and the Xbox 360 controller. I had a lot of fun\nand never felt like I could blame the controller. Again, I'm just a filthy\ncasual.\n\nI didn't have as much luck with [Laserlife][], a surreal rhythm game in the\ntradition of Rez where you guide twin laser trails through targets with analog\nsticks. Ideally, I should be able to use the two trackpads as analog sticks.\nBut, I did a lot better going back to the physical sticks on my Xbox 360\ncontroller. I think the spring resistance in the physical joysticks helped cue\nme into its position. \n\nThe issue seems similar to how I rarely get along with on-screen\ncontrols in smartphone games. But, these trackpads have an advantage\nover virtual glass joysticks - i.e. tactile cues like their surface curve,\nraised edges, and the embossed d-pad shape. I'd like to see if I can find\nworkable settings, because twin-stick shooters are one of my favorite genres.\n\n[Elite Dangerous][] offers a kind of bottomless pit of customization.  It's a\nwork in progress translating my mouse-and-keyboard controls to a comfortable\nscheme on the Controller. For example, it was stupid fun tying pitch and roll\nto the motion sensors and flying the controller around like a model spaceship.\n(I made zoomy-whoosh-pew-pew noises, too.) I've seen other control schemes use\nthe gyro for looking around the cockpit, which is actually used to summon up\nvarious ship panels via gaze. This won't replace [a super-immersive HOTAS &\nhead tracking setup][eliteimmersive], but I think I can get it to an enjoyable\npoint.\n\n[eliteimmersive]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvAI3l0v62E\n[Sunless Sea]: http://www.failbettergames.com/sunless/\n[Diablo III]: http://us.battle.net/d3/en/\n[Laserlife]: http://store.steampowered.com/app/323040/\n[Rocket League]: http://store.steampowered.com/app/252950/\n[Elite Dangerous]: https://www.elitedangerous.com/\n \nOverall, I've had decent luck with the games I play. Where things\nhaven't quite worked out, I have a hunch that there's a workable control\nscheme somewhere inside the giant bag of options on offer. I've seen some\nfolks describe the process a bit like getting accustomed to a new keyboard\nlayout like Dvorak. That's oddly interesting to me, so I'm going to keep\npoking at it.\n\n## Hackability\n\nThe Controller is a USB HID composite device - in other words, It *is* a mouse\n*and* a keyboard *and* a joystick *and* a gamepad, as far as USB is concerned.\n\nI've gotten the sense that Steam does *something* with the Controller input,\nbut I'm not sure if it analgous to things like [JoyToKey][] or [AutoHotKey][]\nto translate things on the PC side. My guess is that it leans most heavily on\nprocessing in the controller itself to emit standard USB messages to\nachieve maximum compatibility in games.\n\n[JoyToKey]: http://joytokey.net/en/\n[AutoHotKey]: https://autohotkey.com/\n\n[<img class=\"inset left\" src=\"/uploads/2016/steam-controller/teensy-keyboard.jpg\">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24639522001/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nConsidering the things found in the [iFixit teardown][teardown],\nI'm not seeing any particularly exotic parts. Valve stated early on that \"[the\nSteam Controller was designed from the ground up to be hackable][schackable]\".\n\nFor example, from [a Reddit thread][reddit-chips], I\nlearned that the [Steam Controller][] is built around the [ARM\nCortex-M0][cortex-m0]. That's similar to the [ARM Cortex-M0+][cortex-m0-plus]\nused in the [Teensy LC][teensylc]. \n\nThis is interesting, because I've been reading up on how to build a custom\nkeyboard. (You know, as one does.) In the course of that, I've been\nacquainting myself with the [Teensy line of USB development boards][teensy].\n\nLately, I've been playing with the [Teensy 2.0][teensy20]. That seems to be\npopular in the DIY community for how easy it makes implementing \nUSB devices.  Granted, that's a different microcontroller (an [Atmel\nATmega32u4][ATmega32u4]), but I'm hoping that general experience with things like the\nTeensy family of dev boards can eventually translate to some personal fun and\nsome community firmware to explore the potential of the [Steam Controller][].\n\nAs it is, someone's already figured out how to [play music through the haptic\nactuators][hapticmusic] and they released the [source\ncode][hapticmusicsource].  That's more a function of decoding the \nprotocol from PC to Controller than messing around with the microcontrollers,\nbut it's still pretty cool.\n\nIt would be great if Valve released more docs & code around this thing. I\ncan understand that there might be some pressure to keep the Steam hardware &\nsoftware ecosystem cohesive. But, for a weird little device like this, I\nimagine they'd only get more sales by fully opening everything up and letting\nthe tinkering world pave the way for more uses - and maybe fix a few bugs for\nthem as clever folks scratch their own itches.\n\n[ATmega32u4]: http://www.atmel.com/devices/atmega32u4.aspx\n[schackable]: http://hackaday.com/2013/10/01/steam-controller-open-and-hackable/\n[teensylc]: https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensylc.html\n[teensy]: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/\n[teensy20]: https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html\n[teardown]: https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Steam+Controller+Teardown/52578\n[cortex-m0-plus]: http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m0plus.php\n[cortex-m0]: http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m0.php\n\n[reddit-chips]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamControllerMods/comments/3p6d26/some_details_on_the_chips_in_the_controller_and/\n\n[hapticmusic]: https://steamcommunity.com/app/353370/discussions/0/494632506573267894/\n[hapticmusicsource]: https://gitlab.com/Pilatomic/SteamControllerSinger\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe [Steam Controller][] is an odd little duck. It's a bit awkward to hold\nand the software is not great. But, software can be fixed and the controls &\nsensors onboard have so much great potential for PC gaming. \n\nThis is clearly not a mature, finished product - which is disappointing,\nbecause I paid money for it - but I'm really rooting for it. And I've already\nused it for dozens of hours in games, so it's obviously worked for me in many\ncapacities. I'm really hoping that Valve follows through on their promises to\nopen things up for tinkering - because it might be the thing that ultimately\nredeems the whole project.\n\n\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=markdown textwidth=78: -->\n",

But, this is suboptimal and a dead end for upgrades where it matters. I could get an updated laptop, but that&#8217;s just kicking the can down the road. And besides, this machine is intended more as a productivity machine for me than gaming.</p>\n<p>I could also buy a real gaming laptop, but those things are expensive &#8211; and also less than great for upgrades.</p>\n<p><a style=\"display: block; float: left; margin: 0 0.75em 0.75em 0\" href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2-pc.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2-pc-300x248.png\" alt=\"couch-gaming-2-pc\" width=\"300\" height=\"248\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-672\" /></a></p>\n<p>What about a desktop gaming PC?

Basically, what I&#8217;ve mocked up here is the LCD panel from my laptop torn off and bolted to the DAVE. I&#8217;ve got an <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Wireless-Keyboard-MC184LL-VERSION/dp/B005DLDO4U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358748005&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=apple+wireless\">Apple Wireless Keyboard</a> there. But, it could just as easily be a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BW01X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0000BW01X\">Happy Hacking Keyboard</a>, if only I&#8217;d found the right model in SketchUp. Maybe I&#8217;ll even get &#8220;serious&#8221; and look into a gaming keyboard with a numpad.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t seem to find a decent off-the-shelf LCD monitor that won&#8217;t crush the DAVE and yet has as nice a resolution &amp; density as my MacBook Pro display. But, after a day of musing on Facebook and poking around on eBay, I found an exciting lead.</p>\n<p><a style=\"display: block; float: left; margin: 0 0.75em 0.75em 0\" href=\"http://www.ebay.com/itm/HDMI-VGA-DVI-Audio-LCD-controller-board-17-3-LP173WF1-1920-1080-lcd-panel-/170940546439?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&#038;hash=item27ccd9bd87\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/622302621_o-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"622302621_o\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-682\" /></a></p>\n<p>As it turns out, you can buy an LCD display panel and a board to drive it from plain old HDMI / DVI / VGA inputs. On the left is one that I&#8217;ve ordered. <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/itm/HDMI-VGA-DVI-Audio-LCD-controller-board-17-3-LP173WF1-1920-1080-lcd-panel-/170940546439?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item27ccd9bd87\">It&#8217;s 17.3&#8243; and offers 1920 x 1080 resolution</a>.</p>\n<p>This seems pretty nice to me, since it&#8217;s slightly better than my current laptop and will sit less than 2-3 feet from my face.

I also like hanging out with my wife; she&#8217;s my favorite person in the world. This is a post about ensuring these two things can happen together. This is also a post where I played with SketchUp for the first time.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"The_nightlife_at_Orchard_House\">The nightlife at Orchard House</span>\r\n\r\n<a style=\"display: block; float: right; margin: 0 0 0.75em 0.75em\" href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-1-laptop.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-1-laptop-300x238.png\" alt=\"couch-gaming-1-laptop\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-670\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere, on the left, you can see a scale model of evenings at Orchard House. Alex and I like to spend nights making fun of crappy TV, piddling around on our laptops, and attracting household pets. (Yeah, I had a little too much fun playing around in [SketchUp][1] tonight.)\r\n\r\nSo, when I play video games, I don&#8217;t usually take over the TV &#8211; at least, not until later in the evening, when the girl succumbs to napping and I feel like firing up the Xbox. What I&#8217;ve ended up with for most nights, then, is running games from Steam (I&#8217;m [lmorchard][2]) on Windows 7 running on a 2010 MacBook Pro 15&#8243; via Boot Camp.\r\n\r\nThis is less than optimal, but it works tolerably for many fun things.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"My_current_gaming_rig\">My current gaming rig</span>\r\n\r\n<a style=\"display: block; float: left; margin: 0 0.75em 0.75em 0\" href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-1a-laptop.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-1a-laptop-175x300.png\" alt=\"couch-gaming-1a-laptop\" width=\"175\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-669\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLet&#8217;s zoom and enhance, because I can do that in SketchUp. On the right, you can see a model of my gaming rig. It consists mainly of the aforementioned [Apple MacBook Pro][3], an [Ikea DAVE laptop table][4], and a [Logitech Trackman Marble Mouse][5].\r\n\r\nI really like the DAVE table &#8211; we&#8217;ve accumulated 4 of these things at last count. They&#8217;re cheap &#8211; easily had from Ikea for around $20 &#8211; and go together in 2 minutes. I&#8217;ve used them instead of buying [$400 ergonomic keyboard trays][6] for my desk. (I really missed those, when I left Yahoo!)\r\n\r\nI even took one outside to make [working on the deck][7] easier on my wrists. And, of course, I&#8217;ve been gradually evolving one into a couch computing station.\r\n\r\n<a style=\"display: block; float: right; margin: 0 0 0.75em 0.75em\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8269329367/\" title=\"My couch computing rig by lmorchard, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/coughrigphoto.png\" alt=\"coughrigphoto\" width=\"261\" height=\"266\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-716\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere on the right is a picture of my couch-side DAVE, sans MacBook pro. The big thing is a [Cooler Master NotePal X-Slim Cooling Pad][8], because my laptop has a habit of overheating and shutting itself down in the middle of Windows games, especially in the middle of summer.\r\n\r\nI&#8217;ve also been cycling through different pairs of headphones, and am currently trying out a pair of [Logitech H800][9] wireless headphones. (The [Plantronics 355&#8217;s][10] in the picture had been turned wireless when the bunny hopped by and gave it a nip. So, I took the hint.)\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Thoughts_on_a_new_gaming_rig\">Thoughts on a new gaming rig</span>\r\n\r\nLike I wrote earlier, many fun games can be played tolerably well on this 2010 MacBook Pro in Boot Camp. But, this is suboptimal and a dead end for upgrades where it matters. I could get an updated laptop, but that&#8217;s just kicking the can down the road. And besides, this machine is intended more as a productivity machine for me than gaming.\r\n\r\nI could also buy a real gaming laptop, but those things are expensive &#8211; and also less than great for upgrades.\r\n\r\n<a style=\"display: block; float: left; margin: 0 0.75em 0.75em 0\" href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2-pc.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2-pc-300x248.png\" alt=\"couch-gaming-2-pc\" width=\"300\" height=\"248\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-672\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhat about a desktop gaming PC? It&#8217;s been a long time since I last built a PC &#8211; something on the order of 10 years. But, it seems like this would be the cheaper and more easily upgraded route\r\n\r\nThe deal breaker, though, is the *desktop* part. Like I said, I like hanging out with my wife on the couch &#8211; I&#8217;m not going to wander off to a desk by myself to indulge my gaming hobby. If I had to choose, my wife wins every time. She&#8217;s my best friend.\r\n\r\nSo, pictured above, I&#8217;m thinking about what it would take to replace my laptop with a desktop at the couch. I need a monitor that fits on my DAVE, and I need a place to stick a big box.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Laptop_decapitation\">Laptop decapitation</span>\r\n\r\n<a style=\"display: block; float: right; margin: 0 0 0.75em 0.75em\" href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2a-pc.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2a-pc-166x300.png\" alt=\"couch-gaming-2a-pc\" width=\"166\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-671\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLet&#8217;s zoom & enhance again, on the right. Basically, what I&#8217;ve mocked up here is the LCD panel from my laptop torn off and bolted to the DAVE. I&#8217;ve got an [Apple Wireless Keyboard][11] there. But, it could just as easily be a [Happy Hacking Keyboard][12], if only I&#8217;d found the right model in SketchUp. Maybe I&#8217;ll even get &#8220;serious&#8221; and look into a gaming keyboard with a numpad.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can&#8217;t seem to find a decent off-the-shelf LCD monitor that won&#8217;t crush the DAVE and yet has as nice a resolution & density as my MacBook Pro display. But, after a day of musing on Facebook and poking around on eBay, I found an exciting lead.\r\n\r\n<a style=\"display: block; float: left; margin: 0 0.75em 0.75em 0\" href=\"http://www.ebay.com/itm/HDMI-VGA-DVI-Audio-LCD-controller-board-17-3-LP173WF1-1920-1080-lcd-panel-/170940546439?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&#038;hash=item27ccd9bd87\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/622302621_o-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"622302621_o\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-682\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, you can buy an LCD display panel and a board to drive it from plain old HDMI / DVI / VGA inputs. On the left is one that I&#8217;ve ordered. [It&#8217;s 17.3&#8243; and offers 1920 x 1080 resolution][13].\r\n\r\nThis seems pretty nice to me, since it&#8217;s slightly better than my current laptop and will sit less than 2-3 feet from my face. Worst case, I can use it as a second monitor for my desk. Or, I could move the Xbox to under the couch and hook it up on the HDMI input. I could even use headphones, since the display interface board has an output jack.\r\n\r\nI&#8217;ll have to fabricate some sort of housing for the display, and find a way to attach it to the DAVE with friction hinges. Since this will be in the living room, it also wouldn&#8217;t hurt if the result looks clean. I&#8217;m hoping this won&#8217;t be an impossible task, despite my carpentry skills having last been exercised in high school shop class almost 20 years ago. Less than 10 miles from me is [i3Detroit][14], an awesome maker space, so I could avail myself of some tinkerers there.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Couching_gamer_hidden_tower\">Couching gamer, hidden tower</span>\r\n\r\n<a style=\"display: block; float: right; margin: 0 0 0.75em 0.75em\" href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/unsightly-pc-tower.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/unsightly-pc-tower-300x279.png\" alt=\"unsightly-pc-tower\" width=\"300\" height=\"279\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-756\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLet&#8217;s zoom & enhance on that PC tower.

    "html": "<p>I just finished Bioware&#39;s Mass Effect 2 for Xbox 360, and I&#39;ve got some thoughts about it.  Haven&#39;t really written reviews here for games before, but I said I wanted to start posting things here that I&#39;d want to read.  So, here goes...</p>\n<p>In a nutshell: I loved it, will play it again—but it could have been so much better.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3 id=\"mass-effect-1-the-obsession\">Mass Effect 1: The Obsession</h3>\n<p>After having had a blast playing through <a href=\"http://sc2.sourceforge.net/\">Star Control 2 / The Ur-Quan Masters</a> and loving the classic (albeit pulpy) sci-fi storyline, someone suggested <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect 1</a> would feel like a modern remake.  I forget who it was, but they were right.  Galactic exploration, negotiation between alien races, even taking a moon patrol buggy (a.k.a. the Mako) down to planets for resource gathering—it all matched up pretty well and compared very favorably.</p>\n<p>So, I was set up to be impressed.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect 1</a> was <em>cinematic</em>—even down to the film grain simulation in graphics options.  It was also the first major next-gen console game I spent any time with on a nice, big HDTV.  </p>\n<p>The storyline gave me a nice <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder\">sensawunda</a>, like a season of a well-made sci-fi series like <a href=\"http://www.henson.com/fantasy_scifi.php?content=farscape\">Farscape</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1\">Stargate SG-1</a>.  I actually cared about what happened in the dialog sequences, and I wanted to explore those bits equally alongside combat and planetary exploration.  I actually said &quot;Whoa,&quot; when I first saw the inside of the Citadel, with its massive cylindrical interior dotted with neighborhoods and landscaping.  I read all the Codex entries and planet descriptions to soak in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding\">worldbuilding</a>.</p>\n<p>And then there were the art and music direction of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect 1</a>, both of which were note-perfect for me.  </p>\n<p>The art was like the future <a href=\"http://www.atarimuseum.com/otherprojects/bionics/proto/index.html\">Atari computer designers had envisioned</a>, all clean surfaces and angles.  </p>\n<p>The music was like a modern Vangelis soundtrack for an alternate reality Blade Runner.  The transition from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhN4CUG4ek\">Eden Prime</a> to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdfc4GVPsRk\">Battle at Eden Prime</a> was a great build-up of suspense in the opening mission.  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9SiMTmCqvI&amp;feature=related\">The Citadel</a> was a big <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder\">sensawunda</a> moment—in fact, the whole soundtrack had a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder\">sensawunda</a> thread throughout. You might be on a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph6XcHu9ZB8&amp;feature=related\">dangerous safari</a>, but damn if it ain&#39;t an awesome universe to do it in.</p>\n<p>At the end—spoiler alert—they surprised me by carrying through the total feel of an 80&#39;s movie with a <em>real band</em> playing out the closing credits. It was a total &quot;the end&quot; kind of song that you&#39;d walk out of a theater listening to, all jazzed about the show you&#39;d just seen.  The first things I did after the game ended was to look up that song (<a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M4_Part_II\">M4 Part II</a> by <a href=\"http://www.faunts.com/\">Faunts</a>), buy that band&#39;s albums, and then buy the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XXWKAW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000XXWKAW\" title=\"Mass Effect Original Game Soundtrack\">game soundtrack</a>.  </p>\n<p>During a plane ride to California, I watched <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lPsGxJhyq4\">the making-of videos</a> on my iPod Touch.  I bought an <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/3501486581/\">SR1 hat</a> when I got back home.  </p>\n<p>I have done these things before for favorite movies, but only rarely for games.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-i-liked-in-me2\">What I liked in ME2</h3>\n<p>So... that brings me to <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">Mass Effect 2</a>, and the large shoes it had to fill.</p>\n<p>As a game, <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> is much improved over <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> in many ways.  They&#39;ve streamlined a lot of fiddly tedium in the gameplay; amped up the combat to compete with other cover-based shooters; backed away from the cookie-cutter procedural environments to hand-craft all missions.</p>\n<p>That last part, hand-crafting every mission, is easily the biggest improvement.  In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>, nearly every mission was a <a href=\"http://www.madlibs.com/\">Mad Libs</a> mashup of some pre-fab warehouse / mine / space station; an assortment of cloned enemies; some loot lockers; and maybe a unique objective or two.  I still liked it: dungeon-crawlers like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_%28video_game%29\">Diablo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.torchlightgame.com/\">Torchlight</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nethack.org/\">Nethack</a> are fun, and I have an even softer spot for space opera than fantasy.  </p>\n<p>But, <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> clearly shows more effort in mission design.  It&#39;s obvious that a human being spent many, many hours building every environment rather than just filling out a few data structures with object IDs and sketching out simple maps.  I&#39;m sure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> was more involved than I make it out to be, but the fact that <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> spans two discs alone is a testament to the extra effort.</p>\n<p>Oh, and the new &quot;circuit bypass&quot; and &quot;code hacking&quot; mini-games? They&#39;re a <em>huge</em> improvement over the all-purpose &quot;Simon&quot; game from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>.  I miss having the cheating option to just throw some omnigel at a locked door, but I don&#39;t have the overstuffed inventory to constantly recycle into wonderstuff any more either.</p>\n<p>In terms of the story, well, it has a very brief main arc accompanied by a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales\">Canterbury Tales</a> parade of side-stories for everyone you need to recruit to go up against the <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Collectors\">Collectors</a>.

    "body": "I just finished Bioware's Mass Effect 2 for Xbox 360, and I've got some thoughts about it.  Haven't really written reviews here for games before, but I said I wanted to start posting things here that I'd want to read.  So, here goes...\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell: I loved it, will play it again—but it could have been so much better.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n### Mass Effect 1: The Obsession\r\n\r\nAfter having had a blast playing through [Star Control 2 / The Ur-Quan Masters][urquan] and loving the classic (albeit pulpy) sci-fi storyline, someone suggested [Mass Effect 1][me1] would feel like a modern remake.  I forget who it was, but they were right.  Galactic exploration, negotiation between alien races, even taking a moon patrol buggy (a.k.a. the Mako) down to planets for resource gathering—it all matched up pretty well and compared very favorably.\r\n\r\nSo, I was set up to be impressed.  [Mass Effect 1][me1] was *cinematic*—even down to the film grain simulation in graphics options.  It was also the first major next-gen console game I spent any time with on a nice, big HDTV.  \r\n\r\nThe storyline gave me a nice [sensawunda][sensawunda], like a season of a well-made sci-fi series like [Farscape][farscape] or [Stargate SG-1][sg1].  I actually cared about what happened in the dialog sequences, and I wanted to explore those bits equally alongside combat and planetary exploration.  I actually said \"Whoa,\" when I first saw the inside of the Citadel, with its massive cylindrical interior dotted with neighborhoods and landscaping.  I read all the Codex entries and planet descriptions to soak in the [worldbuilding][].\r\n\r\n[worldbuilding]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding\r\n\r\nAnd then there were the art and music direction of [Mass Effect 1][me1], both of which were note-perfect for me.  \r\n\r\nThe art was like the future [Atari computer designers had envisioned][ataridesign], all clean surfaces and angles.  \r\n\r\nThe music was like a modern Vangelis soundtrack for an alternate reality Blade Runner.  The transition from [Eden Prime][eden-prime] to [Battle at Eden Prime][edenbattle] was a great build-up of suspense in the opening mission.  [The Citadel][citadel] was a big [sensawunda][] moment—in fact, the whole soundtrack had a [sensawunda][] thread throughout. You might be on a [dangerous safari][virmire], but damn if it ain't an awesome universe to do it in.\r\n\r\n[eden-prime]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhN4CUG4ek\r\n[edenbattle]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdfc4GVPsRk\r\n[virmire]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph6XcHu9ZB8&feature=related\r\n[citadel]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9SiMTmCqvI&feature=related\r\n[presidium]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7V6P8MUwKw&feature=related\r\n\r\nAt the end—spoiler alert—they surprised me by carrying through the total feel of an 80's movie with a *real band* playing out the closing credits. It was a total \"the end\" kind of song that you'd walk out of a theater listening to, all jazzed about the show you'd just seen.  The first things I did after the game ended was to look up that song ([M4 Part II][m4] by [Faunts][faunts]), buy that band's albums, and then buy the [game soundtrack][me1soundtrack].  \r\n\r\nDuring a plane ride to California, I watched [the making-of videos][makingof] on my iPod Touch.  I bought an [SR1 hat][sr1hat] when I got back home.  \r\n\r\nI have done these things before for favorite movies, but only rarely for games.\r\n\r\n### What I liked in ME2\r\n\r\nSo... that brings me to [Mass Effect 2][me2], and the large shoes it had to fill.\r\n\r\nAs a game, [ME2][me2] is much improved over [ME1][me1] in many ways.  They've streamlined a lot of fiddly tedium in the gameplay; amped up the combat to compete with other cover-based shooters; backed away from the cookie-cutter procedural environments to hand-craft all missions.\r\n\r\nThat last part, hand-crafting every mission, is easily the biggest improvement.  In [ME1][me1], nearly every mission was a [Mad Libs][madlibs] mashup of some pre-fab warehouse / mine / space station; an assortment of cloned enemies; some loot lockers; and maybe a unique objective or two.  I still liked it: dungeon-crawlers like [Diablo][diablo] and [Torchlight][torchlight] and [Nethack][nethack] are fun, and I have an even softer spot for space opera than fantasy.  \r\n\r\nBut, [ME2][] clearly shows more effort in mission design.  It's obvious that a human being spent many, many hours building every environment rather than just filling out a few data structures with object IDs and sketching out simple maps.  I'm sure [ME1][] was more involved than I make it out to be, but the fact that [ME2][] spans two discs alone is a testament to the extra effort.\r\n\r\nOh, and the new \"circuit bypass\" and \"code hacking\" mini-games? They're a *huge* improvement over the all-purpose \"Simon\" game from [ME1][].  I miss having the cheating option to just throw some omnigel at a locked door, but I don't have the overstuffed inventory to constantly recycle into wonderstuff any more either.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the story, well, it has a very brief main arc accompanied by a [Canterbury Tales][chaucer] parade of side-stories for everyone you need to recruit to go up against the [Collectors][].  The [Collectors][] are very definitely bad—but, all told, you rarely see them in the act of doing bad things.  They're less of a constant nemesis, and more of a looming threat that will nonetheless wait until you're done puttering around with your sniper's family problems.\r\n\r\nReally, the [Collectors][] felt like a blatant [MacGuffin][] for getting Shepard involved in the lives of some interesting characters.  I *did* find most of those characters interesting, so I was able to go with it.\r\n\r\n[chaucer]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales\r\n[macguffin]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macguffin\r\n[collectors]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Collectors\r\n\r\n### It's a small world\r\n\r\nWhat I missed in the story, though, was a real sense of exploration and worldbuilding.  I guess maybe they figured they got it all out of the way in the previous season and just wanted to plow through with action in the second.\r\n\r\nI *was* expecting Omega to be the \"anti-Citadel\", though, so I was a bit disappointed to find that the area was so sparse and small. Instead of a load of nooks and crannies to wander through, I got a few bare floors of grunge leading straight to objectives.  I really wanted to spend some time digging into the place in the talk-to-every-villager style of most RPGs.  Instead, I got a seedy nightclub, some shops, and an apartment—that's it.\r\n\r\nIn fact, although the Citadel returned and the Asari world Ilium was introduced in [ME2][], I felt like they were mere shadows of what [ME1][] offered.  I guess the flip side of having the hand-crafted environments throughout the rest of the game's missions means that the hub worlds suffer.  \r\n\r\nAnother weird thing were the news reports on various terminals, mentioning things happening throughout the galaxy.  In [ME1][], hearing about trouble and raids on colonies were the starting points for side missions.  In [ME2][], they were just random fluff and color.  I'm not sure why they bothered with the content, to be honest.\r\n\r\n### Mediocre art and music\r\n\r\nStyle-wise, [ME2][] stripped out a lot of what I adored about [ME1][], coming very close to making it *just another game* rather than *a work of art*.  You can call me nuts—and probably already have, though strangely you're still reading—but yes: I thought [ME1][] was special.\r\n\r\nThe music in [ME2][] is largely forgettable. There's an orchestra with horns and strings, and occasionally a chorus chants.  Sometimes, there are bells and triangles.  There were no themes that stuck with me, other than maybe the end-of-mission report jingle.  It's just like every other modern video game with a big budget.\r\n\r\nAt least they kept something like [Uncharted Worlds][uncharted] from [ME1][] for the Galaxy Map.\r\n\r\n[uncharted]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMyu9kehCVY&feature=related\r\n\r\nThe art direction in [ME2][] also strays toward mediocrity.  [ME1][] was *stylized*, all clean surfaces and sleek angles.  It was nostalgic and [optimistic][optimisticscifi], something refreshing.  (See also: [The New Star Trek][newstartrek].)\r\n\r\n[ME2][] introduces more grime & dirt—it's \"grittier\" and more \"realistic\". Just like every other modern video game with a big budget.\r\n\r\nBut, you know what? \"Realism\" and \"grit\" are so last-decade—I'm sick of it. If I'd wanted to play [Gears of War][gow], I'd play it.  I didn't. I watched [Battlestar Galactica][bsg]—it was good; it's over now. \r\n\r\n### R.I.P. M35 Mako\r\n\r\nThey also killed the [M35 Mako][mako], replacing it with a tedious planet-scanning mini-game.  No more endless alien skies over suited-up away teams, unless you're on a mission and don't have time to look up anyway.\r\n\r\n[mako]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M35_Mako\r\n\r\nSure, there were pain-in-the-ass 89.999º inclines to navigate with the I-think-I-can moon patrol buggy and its annoying jump-jets that would throw you right off a mile-high mountain peak with a slipped button press.

Hell, give me a scoreboard of Collector versus Colonist body count for extra fun.\r\n\r\n### Dragon Age got my hopes up\r\n\r\nIn another [BioWare][] game, [Dragon Age][], [I got sucked in despite my so-so attraction to fantasy stories][dragonage].  The main thing came down to dialog and character interactions, and a departure from the general [Paragon / Renegade system][me-morality] of [ME1][].  \r\n\r\nIn [Dragon Age][], you get [*per-character* approval meters][approval].  This means that what endears one character may repulse another.  So, if you want to try to please or at least gain respect from everyone you recruit, you need to be careful about who you bring on which quests and what you do in the course of accomplishing goals.  The occasional deep conversation or gift helps, too.  It makes the game surprisingly rich.\r\n\r\n[approval]: http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Approval\r\n\r\nAssuming that [BioWare][] has a set of technologies and notions they carry from game to game, I expected to see this sort of thing pop up in [ME2][].\r\n\r\nNo such luck.\r\n\r\nInstead, you get the same [Paragon / Renegade system][me-morality] that opens up special options in dialog as before, and [a simple binary not-loyal / loyal state][me2-loyalty] for each of your squaddies depending on whether you completed their respective special-attention missions.  Makes for fun additional missions, but is relatively boring overall.\r\n\r\n### I'd play it again, and I'll play Mass Effect 3\r\n\r\nI grouse, but it's out of love.\r\n\r\n[Mass Effect 1][me1] hit all the right spots for me as a sci-fi adventure and a storytelling experience in general. There's no way I wouldn't play [Mass Effect 2][me2], and I'll be right in line for Mass Effect 3.  I'll probably even start over again from the beginning and replay #1 & #2 before #3 comes out.\r\n\r\nBut, [BioWare][]? I'd really love it if you pulled back from fully making Mass Effect 3 *just another video game* and recaptured a bit of what made the first one so great.\r\n\r\n[makingof]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lPsGxJhyq4\r\n[optimisticscifi]: http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2010/apr/01/science-fiction\r\n[newstartrek]: http://io9.com/5064844/new-star-trek-movie-is-intentionally-cheesy\r\n[urquan]: http://sc2.sourceforge.net/\r\n[me1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\r\n[me-morality]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Morality\r\n[me2-loyalty]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Loyalty\r\n[me1soundtrack]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XXWKAW?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000XXWKAW \"Mass Effect Original Game Soundtrack\"\r\n[m4]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M4_Part_II\r\n[faunts]: http://www.faunts.com/\r\n[sr1hat]: http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/3501486581/\r\n[me2]: http://masseffect.[BioWare][].com/\r\n[sensawunda]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder\r\n[farscape]: http://www.henson.com/fantasy_scifi.php?content=farscape\r\n[sg1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1\r\n[ataridesign]: http://www.atarimuseum.com/otherprojects/bionics/proto/index.html\r\n[madlibs]: http://www.madlibs.com/\r\n[diablo]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_%28video_game%29\r\n[nethack]: http://www.nethack.org/\r\n[torchlight]: http://www.torchlightgame.com/\r\n[gow]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_of_War\r\n[bsg]: http://www.syfy.com/battlestar/\r\n[dragonage]: http://random.lmorchard.com/dragon-age-origins-is-an-interactive-fantasy\r\n[bioware]: http://www.[BioWare][].com/\r\n[Dragon Age]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonAge\r\n",

Or, at least the MMORPG side of it - not that I've got that much an investment in it anyway.  \r\n\r\nI mean, sure, some people are making significant real money from play money.  There's value in time spent and time saved running the treadmills.  But no one should be delusioned to think that there's anything other than a service purchase involved, and the laws of the game world are part of the purchase.  If the game world allows a scam, then you bought the fun of an in-game scam along with your rupees or ISK or gold or whatever.  Ignorance of that fact is ignorance, but it ain't an excuse.\r\n\r\nSomeone has to have thought of this:  What about forming governments, laws, police, and courts inside EVE?  Get scammed once too many times?  Don't escape to the meta level and cry for mommy in the outside world.  Organize and fend for yourselves.  Does the game specifically make this sort of thing impossible?  If so, then the game's broken - stop playing it.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085374\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ffe238ed68da35e8037df461552234&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085374\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-29T18:37:45\">2006-08-29T18:37:45</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Being a 3-year EvEer I've gotta say, it's quite possible to do such things.

Again.  True, life itself has been pretty busy lately.  The days are booked, the weekends have been filling up--and in spare moments I&#39;ve been obsessed with <a href=\"http://www.hulkgames.com/us/\" title=\"THE INCREDIBLE HULK: ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION\">jumping from building to building</a>.  But, when it comes down to me and a pile of code on the screen, I find myself in ever further depths of recursion.</p>\n<p>For instance, I keep meaning to get down to posting some <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Asides\">lightweight &quot;asides&quot;</a> in place of my old <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/08/12/quick-and-random-thoughts\">&quot;quick bullets&quot;</a> posts I was doing.  But, of course, before I do that, I want to do some <a href=\"http://www.kottke.org/03/11/kottke-redesign\">Kottkesque template mungeing</a> to more properly present these smaller bits.  </p>\n<p>And, though I&#39;m actually most of the way done making another rev to the theme here, I also want to fold my linkblog back into the site.  The absence of these <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/12/redesigninprogress#comment-1850\">has already been noticed</a>, so I&#39;d like to give those a proper treatment.</p>\n<p>In addition, I still mean to start pimping my new book a bit; maybe even starting tonight.  I&#39;ve got a notion to post teasers highlighting a few of my favorite things.  And then, of course, there&#39;s the <a href=\"http://www.hackingfeeds.com/blog/\">neglected companion site</a> on which I&#39;ve yet to spend much time at all.  But I&#39;ve got grand plans, including some which go beyond the book itself and toward making <a href=\"http://www.hackingfeeds.com/blog/\">hackingfeeds.com</a> a regularly updated and relevant resource.</p>\n<p>Speaking of that...  I&#39;ve also continued working a bit with some feed hacks since finishing the book.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/feedspool/\">FeedSpool</a> is one of these: I&#39;ve revived some of FeedReactor&#39;s old code--this time aiming for a much higher degree of simplicity, trying to stick with standard Python modules, and dumping the database altogether.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to make a more formal announcement about this thing, once it&#39;s a bit more in usable shape.  In a nutshell:  It polls feeds and downloads the data.  New entries are split out into individual files, like an email or usenet spool.  That&#39;s it.  Other programs are expected to do the clever bits.</p>\n<p>And, to go along with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/feedspool/\">FeedSpool</a>, I&#39;ve been toying with building a Spotlight importer for OS X Tiger which indexes RSS and Atom feeds and entries.

    "body": "Well, of course I've lapsed pretty much right back into silence after [having shaken this place up][redesign] and [having announced the arrival of the book][book].\r\n\r\nThe culprit, of course, is [yak shaving][yak].  Again.  True, life itself has been pretty busy lately.  The days are booked, the weekends have been filling up--and in spare moments I've been obsessed with [jumping from building to building][hulk].  But, when it comes down to me and a pile of code on the screen, I find myself in ever further depths of recursion.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I keep meaning to get down to posting some [lightweight \"asides\"][asides] in place of my old [\"quick bullets\"][quick] posts I was doing.  But, of course, before I do that, I want to do some [Kottkesque template mungeing][kottke] to more properly present these smaller bits.  \r\n\r\nAnd, though I'm actually most of the way done making another rev to the theme here, I also want to fold my linkblog back into the site.  The absence of these [has already been noticed][noticed], so I'd like to give those a proper treatment.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I still mean to start pimping my new book a bit; maybe even starting tonight.  I've got a notion to post teasers highlighting a few of my favorite things.  And then, of course, there's the [neglected companion site][hackingfeeds] on which I've yet to spend much time at all.  But I've got grand plans, including some which go beyond the book itself and toward making [hackingfeeds.com][hackingfeeds] a regularly updated and relevant resource.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of that...  I've also continued working a bit with some feed hacks since finishing the book.  \r\n\r\n[FeedSpool][feedspool] is one of these: I've revived some of FeedReactor's old code--this time aiming for a much higher degree of simplicity, trying to stick with standard Python modules, and dumping the database altogether.  \r\n\r\nI've been meaning to make a more formal announcement about this thing, once it's a bit more in usable shape.  In a nutshell:  It polls feeds and downloads the data.  New entries are split out into individual files, like an email or usenet spool.  That's it.  Other programs are expected to do the clever bits.\r\n\r\nAnd, to go along with [FeedSpool][feedspool], I've been toying with building a Spotlight importer for OS X Tiger which indexes RSS and Atom feeds and entries.  Not in Subversion yet, and not nearly ready for public consumption, but it's been pretty fun to play with.  (And I totally forgot just how many feeds I have lying around on my hard drive!)\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's enough for now.

This article brings two thoughts to mind for me...</p>\n<p>First is this:  Of course, if you&#39;re striving for some semblance of realism in games, the costs will likely approach and exceed the cost to produce movies.  It&#39;ll approach the cost because, eventually, you&#39;ll need either movie-grade animators or real actors.  And then it&#39;ll exceed the cost, because who wants a game that&#39;s as linear as a 2-hour movie?  If you want any replay value out of the thing, you&#39;re going to have to produce the equivalent of a 4-hour movie at least, if not a 20- to 40-hour movie.  And then, you&#39;re going to have to be satisfied that many players will miss most of it.  Once things reach this point, I think in some sense video games will have arrived as a &quot;successor&quot; to movies, as movies were a &quot;successor&quot; to radio plays.</p>\n<p>This brings me to my second thought:  Right now, I&#39;m listening to a streaming radio station that&#39;s playing old sci-fi and drama radio plays, like X Minus One and The Shadow.  These shows are great, and I&#39;m thinking of buying a few box sets of them.  These old radio shows get quite a bit of mileage out of their less technologically advanced medium.  In contrast to this, my consumption of contemporary and popular television, movies, and music has been dropping off from year to year as I get more tired of supremely well-produced yet worthless content.</p>\n<p>Music gets sold on anything but a good tune, movies sold on special effects over plot, and video games head toward technological supremacy over a fun hook or even an engaging story line.  But, I don&#39;t want anything to do with any of these.</p>\n<p>A few days ago, a friend of mine remarked that many &quot;retro&quot; video games were just as horrible as modern video games, but I have to disagree a bit.  There were a lot of horrible games.  But, for games to be successful back when the dazzle factor of the hardware was low, you needed the fun trick or clever twist that addicted players.  The constraints called for ingenuity.  Sometimes this meant pushing the hardware, and sometimes this meant coming up with a brilliant yet simple-to-implement idea.  (Tetris, I&#39;m looking at you.)</p>\n<p>As the hardware platforms progress, we&#39;ll see more and more absolutely dazzling demos of the hardware sold as games that completely fail at being fun.  But they&#39;ll have insane budgets and probably sell very well just because people want to see the pretty sparklies and foobar shaders.  The increased capabilities will offer more expressive ability to interactive storytellers, but I bet it will just give even more excuse for game makers to be distracted from that and keep pumping out stories that suck carried by game play that reeks.</p>\n<p>It all makes me almost wish for a kink in Moore&#39;s Law that stalls the progress of dazzling hardware and forces developers back to being clever with their resources and game ideas.  Maybe we&#39;ll see more and more of an indie games community rise, producing genuinely fun and amusingly ingenious games.

It'll approach the cost because, eventually, you'll need either movie-grade animators or real actors.  And then it'll exceed the cost, because who wants a game that's as linear as a 2-hour movie?  If you want any replay value out of the thing, you're going to have to produce the equivalent of a 4-hour movie at least, if not a 20- to 40-hour movie.  And then, you're going to have to be satisfied that many players will miss most of it.  Once things reach this point, I think in some sense video games will have arrived as a \"successor\" to movies, as movies were a \"successor\" to radio plays.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to my second thought:  Right now, I'm listening to a streaming radio station that's playing old sci-fi and drama radio plays, like X Minus One and The Shadow.  These shows are great, and I'm thinking of buying a few box sets of them.  These old radio shows get quite a bit of mileage out of their less technologically advanced medium.  In contrast to this, my consumption of contemporary and popular television, movies, and music has been dropping off from year to year as I get more tired of supremely well-produced yet worthless content.\r\n\r\nMusic gets sold on anything but a good tune, movies sold on special effects over plot, and video games head toward technological supremacy over a fun hook or even an engaging story line.  But, I don't want anything to do with any of these.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, a friend of mine remarked that many \"retro\" video games were just as horrible as modern video games, but I have to disagree a bit.  There were a lot of horrible games.  But, for games to be successful back when the dazzle factor of the hardware was low, you needed the fun trick or clever twist that addicted players.  The constraints called for ingenuity.  Sometimes this meant pushing the hardware, and sometimes this meant coming up with a brilliant yet simple-to-implement idea.  (Tetris, I'm looking at you.)\r\n\r\nAs the hardware platforms progress, we'll see more and more absolutely dazzling demos of the hardware sold as games that completely fail at being fun.  But they'll have insane budgets and probably sell very well just because people want to see the pretty sparklies and foobar shaders.  The increased capabilities will offer more expressive ability to interactive storytellers, but I bet it will just give even more excuse for game makers to be distracted from that and keep pumping out stories that suck carried by game play that reeks.\r\n\r\nIt all makes me almost wish for a kink in Moore's Law that stalls the progress of dazzling hardware and forces developers back to being clever with their resources and game ideas.  Maybe we'll see more and more of an indie games community rise, producing genuinely fun and amusingly ingenious games.

The cellphones Russell Beattie describes are severely restricted compared to today's monster desktop/video-card setups that comprise even bargain-basement PCs (tho Russ DOES today talk about getting a 512MB memory card for his phone -- size of a thumbnail -- for about $100. The constraints won't be there for long -- enjoy while you can!)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090866\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4a5d522f073b25af74daa13b4a161730&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">byran connor</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090866\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-09T12:20:22\">2005-03-09T12:20:22</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Hey your right man.
