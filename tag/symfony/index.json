Also, very much less magic than <a href=\"http://cakephp.org/\">CakePHP</a> and barely in the same universe as <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.com/\">Symfony</a>.  I think I may have found my sweet spot of simplicity and comprehensible magic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://codeigniter.com/\">CodeIgniter</a> has is a PHP 4 / 5 framework that provides a lightweight Model / View / Controller arrangement with URL routing and a useful but minimal constellation of utility classes and helpers.  The view templates are in PHP, with just a bit of pre-processing.  The controllers are plain-old PHP classes whose methods are called via simple URL routes.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/models.html\">model layer of CodeIgniter</a>, however, is the weakest part of the trio - which I actually like a lot.  It's not a magical ORM - instead it's just a simple superclass from which to derive, mostly there to suggest that a separate model is a good thing to write.  The DB abstraction classes just make the job of writing SQL statements easier and don't pretend that there's no impedance mismatch between objects and relational tables.</p>\n<p>The depth of code in <a href=\"http://codeigniter.com/\">CodeIgniter</a> is shallow enough that I felt I was able to get into developing quickly while still taking side trips through the framework methods I was calling and get at least a glance at what being taken care of for me.  <a href=\"http://codeigniter.com/forums/viewthread/50715/\">There's always danger in magic</a>, but this stuff doesn't really get out of hand.</p>\n<p>To doodle around with an idea, I threw together a layout decorator class to support the sort of nested templates I'm used to from <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.com/\">Symfony</a>.

Being somewhat suspicious and curmudgeonly about that sort of magic to begin with, this actually struck me as an attractive thing about ZF.  In fact, what I really liked about ZF at first glance is that it's less of a monolithic <b>system</b> and more of a bucket of parts from a single source that fit together decently.</p>\n<p>And, all my favorite parts are there:  Among other things there's <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.config.html\">config</a>, <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.log.html\">logging</a>, <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.html\">a front controller</a> with <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.router.html\">URL routing</a>, template-system agnostic <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.html\">view support</a>, and somewhat non-magical <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.html\">DB / model support</a>.</p>\n<p>These were all things I'd grabbed from <a href=\"http://pear.php.net/\">PEAR</a> for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/Cuckoo/lib/MiniFramework.php\">my more recent PHP mini-framework</a> play, but I figured there should be some benefit from finding them in a unified collection like the Zend Framework.</p>\n<p>The experience was somewhat similar to rolling my own, though.  I stumbled through some docs and eventually found some blog entries and a tutorial.  It's all very loosely-coupled and somewhat DIY, which is actually what I wanted.

They come with a lot of moving parts doing things that I don't see - and when I do finally see them, I tend to run into decisions with which I disagree.  I see abstraction where I think the gritty concrete needs to be left bare.  I often see lots of astronaut acrobatics that just have to be burning tons of cycles.

Their configuration system runs PHP code that results in YAML.  Parsing that YAML, along with cascading layers of other generated YAML, then drives a PHP code generation stage, composing all the static code necessary to bootstrap the framework with each request.  There's an amazing amount of flexibility exposed by that system, and it's quite clever -&nbsp;but my curmudgeonly side catches whiffs of insanity.</p>\n<p>Maybe that's really the issue -&nbsp;I've been doing this stuff long enough to have written my own one of everything, so I've got my own opinions and I like to have a grasp on everything.  I've written front controllers, templating systems, and model abstraction layers.  I've worked in a half-dozen or so languages doing all the above.  I don't yet accept that web app development has <a href=\"http://mengwong.livejournal.com/38969.html\">passed the da Vinci point</a> -&nbsp;a single developer should be able to grasp the structure of a web framework in mind without getting lost in too many fractal branchings.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm rambling like an old grouch, but I think I've reached my point.  Hopefully more actual experimentation soon.</p>\n",

I see further acrobatics done to compensate, unrolling loops and pre-parsing config files - which requires further layers of magical tools to generate code and caches.</p>\r\n<p>Too many moving parts wherein assumptions can hide, later to bite me when we're hundreds of miles into the post-launch desert and trying to fight scaling fires or develop a new feature with some weird angles to it.</p>\r\n<p>For example, consider <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.com/\">Symfony</a> for PHP.  Their configuration system runs PHP code that results in YAML.  Parsing that YAML, along with cascading layers of other generated YAML, then drives a PHP code generation stage, composing all the static code necessary to bootstrap the framework with each request.  There's an amazing amount of flexibility exposed by that system, and it's quite clever -&nbsp;but my curmudgeonly side catches whiffs of insanity.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe that's really the issue -&nbsp;I've been doing this stuff long enough to have written my own one of everything, so I've got my own opinions and I like to have a grasp on everything.  I've written front controllers, templating systems, and model abstraction layers.  I've worked in a half-dozen or so languages doing all the above.  I don't yet accept that web app development has <a href=\"http://mengwong.livejournal.com/38969.html\">passed the da Vinci point</a> -&nbsp;a single developer should be able to grasp the structure of a web framework in mind without getting lost in too many fractal branchings.</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I'm rambling like an old grouch, but I think I've reached my point.  Hopefully more actual experimentation soon.</p>\n",
