    "summary": "<p>For the \"<a href=\"delicious.com/tag/tl;dr\">too long</a>; <a href=\"http://delicious.com/tag/tldr\">didn't read</a>\" crowd:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I've <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/deusx\">been using a lot of tags on Delicious</a> over a relatively long time, so they seem very useful to me.</li>\n<li>Delicious encourages the use of tags through UI convention and tool usage patterns, whereas Flickr presents no particular bias toward collecting tags from users.</li>\n<li>Since title and description attract more contribution effort from users on Flickr than on Delicious, it's natural that search over those fields will be more productive than for tags.</li>\n<li>Search on Delicious doesn't have access to the complete text of the bookmarked resource, and often tags will contain information missing from the supplied title or description.</li>\n<li>All told, tags on Delicious are more essential than tags on Flickr.</li>\n<li>In conclusion, I think <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> misses the value of tags, as I know them, by focusing on Flickr.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, I don't really care what this means for folksonomy and the rest of Web 2.0â€”tags work for me on Delicious.  So, I suspect this means I'm not <em>entirely</em> opposed to the sentiment in <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a>, because I don't think tags work everywhere their use is attempted.</p>\n<p>The rest of this entry elaborates on the above.</p>\n",
