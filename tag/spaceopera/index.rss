          <title>Behemoth, Part 1</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#x2019;ve been meaning to get myself writing again, so here&amp;#x2019;s the first rough part of a story that&amp;#x2019;s been bouncing in my head. It&amp;#x2019;s a quick and dirty opening scene for a space opera, but I&amp;#x2019;m hoping to take it in an interesting direction almost immediately after this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distant sun cast silvery rays through a field of tumbling asteroids and swirling dust. Among the rocks, a balletic swarm of glinting motes danced, alighting here and there to vaporize and harvest masses with actinic flares. The source and sink of the swarm&amp;#x2019;s flow was a dark, ovoid craft tracing a lazy, eccentric orbit around the cluster of debris. Nestled within the craft was its pilot, Alan Rickard.&lt;/p&gt;
