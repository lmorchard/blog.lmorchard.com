    "html": "<p>Now, in my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/02/a-kerfluffle-of-opml-and-web-directories\">previous post</a>, I&#39;d mentioned that I might have some ideas to &quot;put up&quot; in response to this recent OPML and web directories kerfluffle.  Here&#39;s my general idea:</p>\n<p>How about trying <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo\">XOXO</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html#h-12.2\">the <code>rel</code> attribute on HTML links</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links\">the <code>subsection</code> link type</a>—all with a bit of XSL to make it work?</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s some working data and code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/xsltproc?xslAddr=xoxo-transclude.xsl&amp;docAddr=ex1.html\">Here&#39;s the end result</a>, a simple web directory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some clues as to what the above does:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This directory started with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/ex1.html\">this top-level outline</a>.  View source on this page, notice the &quot;Syndication Feeds&quot; link with the <code>rel=&quot;subsection&quot;</code>.</li>\n<li>Applying <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/xoxo-transclude.xsl\">this XSL</a> using <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/xsltproc\">this web service</a> is where the work gets done.  This consists of dereferencing each link with a <code>rel=&quot;subsection&quot;</code> and transcluding the innards of the page at the end of the URL.</li>\n<li>Notice that <a href=\"http://hackingfeeds.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/ex2.html\">the URL of &quot;Syndication Feeds&quot;</a> comes from a domain other than <code>decafbad.com</code>.  If I wanted to, the <a href=\"http://hackingfeeds.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/ex3.html\">third level of transclusion</a> could&#39;ve come from yet another domain, too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think this solution is better than using OPML for web directories.  Although it could use some refinement—using a bit of <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> or AJAX magic to include in a page, perhaps—it&#39;s not only <em>already supported</em> by more applications than OPML, it <em>also</em> leverages a lot of prior art and consensus work.  </p>\n<p>So, am I wrong here?

But I have a slightly different take on what that means.</p>\n<p>When group 2 people ask for working code, they aren't asking simply for \"working code\". (Such as your XOXO &amp; XSL thing) They're thinking of an entire <em>system</em> of real users, a real application (need / problem to be solved) etc.</p>\n<p>The reason Dave Winer and OPML will win this, is because Winer really <em>wants</em> shared outlining on the internet. And he knows \"why\" he wants it. He has a vision, and a passion for it. He knows what he wants to do with it. He knows how to make interesting applications with like-minded collaborators. </p>\n<p>You can come up with a \"better\" format than OPML. You might be able to knock off better code overnight. But you do it for a \"lark\" or for some principle of \"doing it properly\".</p>\n<p>Winer doesn't care if its \"crappy\". He just has a drive to make something happen, and OPML is the simplest thing that can possibly work to do that. </p>\n<p>I think that's exactly the right thing to bet on.</p>\n<p>When you say \"I’ve become convinced that what group #1 does is best over the long term, as some of the early successes of group #2 may become tottering unbalanced stacks of plates later on.\"</p>\n<p>I'd be interested in some real world examples. As I see it, \"worse is better\" is the golden rule of computer history, in the long as well as short term.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084232\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084232\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-10T11:34:30\">2005-10-10T11:34:30</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Phil:  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/03/27/oooofc\" rel=\"nofollow\">I've watched Dave's push for shared outlining</a> for awhile now, and certainly he's been working towards it for much longer than I've been watching.  </p>\n<p>And, though it's gotten some mileage through Dave's sheer exuberance and people infected by his cool ideas, it's never quite caught on.  Instead, things like wikis and <a href=\"http://www.jotlive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JotSpotLive</a> and <a href=\"http://www.backpackit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backpack</a> and <a href=\"http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SubEthaEdit</a> have been capturing the users.</p>\n<p>And now, this latest push doesn't look so much like shared outlining <em>per se</em>, but more like a new attempt at <a href=\"http://dmoz.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DMOZ</a>.  And since Google's pretty much <a href=\"http://www.webworkshop.net/dmoz-2005.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">driven a stake into DMOZ</a>, my further interest in Gopher NG is really just a sometimes-interesting problem.  </p>\n<p>I could see some people joining Dave's World Outline effort to get some buzz in their interest niches—trying to be first to get their constituent URLs placed in the new, distributed OPML DMOZ-killer.  And it might be nifty for awhile, but I doubt it'll take hold.</p>\n<p>But as for real world examples of shared outlining, in the particular form Dave's pushing right now... Look at just about anyone's blogroll.  They're almost all in XOXO form <em>right now</em>.  That's the thing:  XOXO is just an HTML list.  It's so unexciting as to be unremarkable—<em>but they're everywhere, right now</em>.  Hell, even OPML has to get converted to XOXO to be used with web browsers—unless you're falling back to some ugly form of tables-as-list.</p>\n<p>XOXO is actually the simplest thing that can possibly work, <em>and people are using and have been using it all along</em>.  I think that's the right thing to bet on, versus OPML.  It doesn't need any evangelism or adoption efforts, other than maybe to remind people of that what they're already using is itself a viable format.  <strong>That's the only reason XOXO has a name.</strong></p>\n<p>I've <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo-outliner-experiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">already shown an in-browser XOXO editor prototype</a>—and believe me, that was easier to implement reliably than anything I've tried with OPML.  I could turn that into a full flown app given sustained free time and interest.  I plan to do that eventually, with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/Micronian\" rel=\"nofollow\">a project I've got simmering</a>.  </p>\n<p>Will I do it?  Who knows—I'm a busy nerd, and I certainly don't have the constant ebulience, time, and money that Dave Winer has.  All I can do is call <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenanigan\" rel=\"nofollow\">shenanigans</a> and preach to the choir.</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

Perhaps I'll write one.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084230\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.synaesmedia.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=248a3c4ba8f2972427222d46954f9c1c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.synaesmedia.net\">phil jones</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084230\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-10T04:06:28\">2005-10-10T04:06:28</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I'm definitely a group #2 person. But I have a slightly different take on what that means.</p>\n\n<p>When group 2 people ask for working code, they aren't asking simply for \"working code\". (Such as your XOXO &amp; XSL thing) They're thinking of an entire <em>system</em> of real users, a real application (need / problem to be solved) etc.</p>\n\n<p>The reason Dave Winer and OPML will win this, is because Winer really <em>wants</em> shared outlining on the internet. And he knows \"why\" he wants it. He has a vision, and a passion for it. He knows what he wants to do with it. He knows how to make interesting applications with like-minded collaborators. </p>\n\n<p>You can come up with a \"better\" format than OPML. You might be able to knock off better code overnight. But you do it for a \"lark\" or for some principle of \"doing it properly\".</p>\n\n<p>Winer doesn't care if its \"crappy\". He just has a drive to make something happen, and OPML is the simplest thing that can possibly work to do that. </p>\n\n<p>I think that's exactly the right thing to bet on.</p>\n\n<p>When you say \"I’ve become convinced that what group #1 does is best over the long term, as some of the early successes of group #2 may become tottering unbalanced stacks of plates later on.\"</p>\n\n<p>I'd be interested in some real world examples. As I see it, \"worse is better\" is the golden rule of computer history, in the long as well as short term.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084232\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084232\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-10T11:34:30\">2005-10-10T11:34:30</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Phil:  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/03/27/oooofc\" rel=\"nofollow\">I've watched Dave's push for shared outlining</a> for awhile now, and certainly he's been working towards it for much longer than I've been watching.  </p>\n\n<p>And, though it's gotten some mileage through Dave's sheer exuberance and people infected by his cool ideas, it's never quite caught on.  Instead, things like wikis and <a href=\"http://www.jotlive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JotSpotLive</a> and <a href=\"http://www.backpackit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backpack</a> and <a href=\"http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SubEthaEdit</a> have been capturing the users.</p>\n\n<p>And now, this latest push doesn't look so much like shared outlining <em>per se</em>, but more like a new attempt at <a href=\"http://dmoz.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DMOZ</a>.  And since Google's pretty much <a href=\"http://www.webworkshop.net/dmoz-2005.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">driven a stake into DMOZ</a>, my further interest in Gopher NG is really just a sometimes-interesting problem.  </p>\n\n<p>I could see some people joining Dave's World Outline effort to get some buzz in their interest niches—trying to be first to get their constituent URLs placed in the new, distributed OPML DMOZ-killer.  And it might be nifty for awhile, but I doubt it'll take hold.</p>\n\n<p>But as for real world examples of shared outlining, in the particular form Dave's pushing right now... Look at just about anyone's blogroll.  They're almost all in XOXO form <em>right now</em>.  That's the thing:  XOXO is just an HTML list.  It's so unexciting as to be unremarkable—<em>but they're everywhere, right now</em>.  Hell, even OPML has to get converted to XOXO to be used with web browsers—unless you're falling back to some ugly form of tables-as-list.</p>\n\n<p>XOXO is actually the simplest thing that can possibly work, <em>and people are using and have been using it all along</em>.  I think that's the right thing to bet on, versus OPML.  It doesn't need any evangelism or adoption efforts, other than maybe to remind people of that what they're already using is itself a viable format.  <strong>That's the only reason XOXO has a name.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo-outliner-experiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">already shown an in-browser XOXO editor prototype</a>—and believe me, that was easier to implement reliably than anything I've tried with OPML.  I could turn that into a full flown app given sustained free time and interest.  I plan to do that eventually, with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/Micronian\" rel=\"nofollow\">a project I've got simmering</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Will I do it?  Who knows—I'm a busy nerd, and I certainly don't have the constant ebulience, time, and money that Dave Winer has.  All I can do is call <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenanigan\" rel=\"nofollow\">shenanigans</a> and preach to the choir.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",
