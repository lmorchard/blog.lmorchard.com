    "summary": "<p>In my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/08/31/ubiquity-cracks-open-personal-mashup-tinkering\" title=\"Ubiquity cracks open personal mashup tinkering\">last post</a>, I got all fluffy about how cool <a href=\"http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/\">Ubiquity</a> is but didn't share any code to prove the point.  As it happens, I have come up with at least one useful command that I'm starting to use habitually in posting bookmarks to Delicious.  You can <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/UbiquityCommands/\">subscribe to my command</a> or <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/hg/UbiquityCommands/file/tip/delicious.ubiq.js\">check out the full source</a>â€”this post will serve as a dissection of the thing.  Since this will be fairly lengthy, follow along after the jump.</p>\n<p>Oh, and it's been awhile since I posted something this in-depth around here, so feel free to let me know how this first draft works.  And, bug reports and patches are of course welcome.</p>\n",
