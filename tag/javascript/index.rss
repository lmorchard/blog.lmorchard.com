          <title>Spying on Big Sonic Heaven</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;TL;DR: A little over a year ago, one of my favorite radio DJs, Darren Revell, started up a new streaming radio station named Big Sonic Heaven. I got the idea to try building a Spotify playlist collected from the music he plays. My quick &amp;amp; dirty program for doing that turned 1-year-old on April 24 and the playlist has collected over 2000 songs, so far.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Naming Things: CamelCase vs snake_case</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;I’ve contributed code to a number of projects, often as a drive-by bug fix in a GitHub pull request. And, usually, I’ll try to do as the Romans do and follow the local naming and coding conventions. But, sometimes, I’ll fall back to my personal conventions and get dinged in the code review.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>HTML5 drag and drop in Firefox 3.5</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Oh hey, look! It&#39;s another blog post—and this one
is cross-posted on hacks.mozilla.com.
I won&#39;t say this is the start of a renewed blogging habit, but let&#39;s see what happens.





Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions
afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it
allows users to pair the selection of an object with the
execution of an action, often including a second object in the
operation.  It&#39;s a simple yet powerful UI concept used to
support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),
and even the creation of link relationships.

Since it&#39;s so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web
applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first
offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although
mousedown, mousemove, and
mouseup made it possible, the implementation has been
limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,
since these events refer only to the object being dragged,
there&#39;s a challenge to find the subject of the drop when
the interaction is completed.

Of course, that doesn&#39;t prevent most modern JavaScript
frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and
throwing in some flourishes while they&#39;re at it.  But, wouldn&#39;t
it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and
drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?

As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification 
section on new drag-and-drop events, and 
Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation of those events.

If you want to jump straight to the code, I&#39;ve put together 
some simple demos 
of the new events.  

I&#39;ve even scratched an itch of my own and
built the beginnings of an outline editor,
where every draggable element is also a drop target—of which
there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something
that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past
while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.

And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from 
a GitHub repository
I&#39;ve created especially for this article—which continues after the jump.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Writing a Delicious command for Ubiquity</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;In my last post, I got all fluffy about how cool Ubiquity is but didn&#39;t share any code to prove the point.  As it happens, I have come up with at least one useful command that I&#39;m starting to use habitually in posting bookmarks to Delicious.  You can subscribe to my command or check out the full source—this post will serve as a dissection of the thing.  Since this will be fairly lengthy, follow along after the jump.
Oh, and it&#39;s been awhile since I posted something this in-depth around here, so feel free to let me know how this first draft works.  And, bug reports and patches are of course welcome.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description
