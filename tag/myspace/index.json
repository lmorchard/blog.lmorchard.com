Indeed, they also help considerably with the problem of expressing this kind of machine-readable data in HTML. But \"FOAF would be a lot more useful if it didn’t rely on RDF.\" - the power, the expressivity of FOAF comes from RDF. </p>\n<p>I suspect Bob (like Mad William) may be assuming RDF (including FOAF) has to mean RDF/XML. But RDF is a model, it doesn't have to serialize to XML, there are other formats - including HTML (via <a href=\"http://research.talis.com/2005/erdf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">eRDF</a>).

I would contend that FOAF's expressivity actually relies far, far more, simply on XML's ability to namespace things, and thus allow for extensions.  Something that a simple XML dialect would also have, but with the added bonus of an infinitely simpler parser, fewer confused programmers, and quite a bit less bandwidth consumed.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085270\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://tantek.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02cd45622e90350cc061aaaa02229195&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://tantek.com/\">Tantek Çelik</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085270\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-20T07:22:55\">2006-08-20T07:22:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Indeed Les, this is exactly what <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard\" rel=\"nofollow\">hCard</a> solves on the Web with the minimum of duplication of data into hidden places and mimetype hackery/configuration (problems of the other approaches mentioned).</p>\n<p>You can either use a 3rd party service like claimID as mentioned to claim your various profiles on the Web, or you can simply continue to publish your profile information on your about or author page, simply add just a bit of hCard markup, and use <a href=\"http://www.gmpg.org/xfn/and/#idconsolidation\" rel=\"nofollow\">XFN Identity Consolidation</a> (rel=\"me\") to turn your about page into your consolidated identity hub.</p>\n<p>While services will undoubtedly continue to ask you a hundred profile questions, the better ones will do something as simple as use the simple open source <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/hkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">hKit Microformats Toolkit</a> by <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drew McLellan</a> to let you simply enter your hCard URL and fill out all the questions automatically from that.</p>\n<p>And the best services will help you, the user, keep your profile as portable as you would like it, by marking it up with hCard as well.  Already, profiles on numerous services, in addition to the abovementioned claimID, like <a href=\"http://flickr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flickr</a> and <a href=\"http://technorati.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Technorati</a> are marked up with hCard and thus ready for reuse with services that use hKit.</p>\n<p>Finally, some have brought up \"extensibility\" as something that is desirable yet recent lessons have taught us that in terms of standards and interoperability, the opposite is true.  The more well-defined not-infinitely-extensible a standard is, the sooner implementers know they are \"done\" implementing it (interoperably even!), and the less chance there is of a zillion non-interoperable extensions randomly emerging (i.e. Tower of Babel problem) which then cause headaches not only for all implementers, but users as well as the users then have to contend with their data not quite working interoperably across all the different services that all support slightly different sets of incompatible/non-interoperable extensions.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085272\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://macgirvin.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=74685c9f342f159611317a68c2655218&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://macgirvin.com\">Mike Macgirvin</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085272\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-22T20:38:14\">2006-08-22T20:38:14</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with Steve. Who am I? It depends. Who are you, and based on that - what do I wish you to know about me? Who are my friends? Same thing. Even if I wanted to divulge them, I then need to  respect their privacy wishes and decide if they want you to know that they are a friend of mine (or not) and how they came to be tagged as friends. A web service which tries to consolidate all of this info is presented with too many privacy conflicts to ever get it right (IMAO). I can recall this concept being tried by a hundred different companies (not to mention open source projects) going back to the early 90's. It was never an issue of technology. The hurdles are primarily social and revolve around trust and privacy - and delegation of these rights to third parties in language even my mother would understand.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085274\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dekoration.cc\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f67e69a66a666638b4e3ba3b9fa68eda&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dekoration.cc\">Wohnaccessoires</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085274\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-16T22:04:59\">2007-03-16T22:04:59</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>But you’re forgetting that a lot of people, myself included, like to represent themselves in different ways on different sites.

    "body": "I'm tired of filling out profiles, and I'm tired of building up networks of others' profiles online.  Everyone needs to adopt something like <strike>[FOAF](http://www.foaf-project.org/)</strike> [hCard][] and [XFN][] (updated per suggestion from [Kevin Marks][]), and be done with it.

Indeed, they also help considerably with the problem of expressing this kind of machine-readable data in HTML. But \"FOAF would be a lot more useful if it didn’t rely on RDF.\" - the power, the expressivity of FOAF comes from RDF. </p>\n\n<p>I suspect Bob (like Mad William) may be assuming RDF (including FOAF) has to mean RDF/XML. But RDF is a model, it doesn't have to serialize to XML, there are other formats - including HTML (via <a href=\"http://research.talis.com/2005/erdf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">eRDF</a>). Note too that microformats like XFN and hCard can be interpreted as RDF (including FOAF terms as appropriate) with <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/spec\" rel=\"nofollow\">GRDDL</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(Incidentally I got to this post before even looking in my personal agg via Marc Canter's on <a href=\"http://planetweb20.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planet Web 2.0</a>)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085268\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e664d95e68ab4e364b35fabb89c8fdee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Steve</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085268\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-19T17:37:36\">2006-08-19T17:37:36</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>But you're forgetting that a lot of people, myself included, like to represent themselves in different ways on different sites.

I would contend that FOAF's expressivity actually relies far, far more, simply on XML's ability to namespace things, and thus allow for extensions.  Something that a simple XML dialect would also have, but with the added bonus of an infinitely simpler parser, fewer confused programmers, and quite a bit less bandwidth consumed.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085270\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://tantek.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02cd45622e90350cc061aaaa02229195&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://tantek.com/\">Tantek Çelik</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085270\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-20T07:22:55\">2006-08-20T07:22:55</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Indeed Les, this is exactly what <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard\" rel=\"nofollow\">hCard</a> solves on the Web with the minimum of duplication of data into hidden places and mimetype hackery/configuration (problems of the other approaches mentioned).</p>\n\n<p>You can either use a 3rd party service like claimID as mentioned to claim your various profiles on the Web, or you can simply continue to publish your profile information on your about or author page, simply add just a bit of hCard markup, and use <a href=\"http://www.gmpg.org/xfn/and/#idconsolidation\" rel=\"nofollow\">XFN Identity Consolidation</a> (rel=\"me\") to turn your about page into your consolidated identity hub.</p>\n\n<p>While services will undoubtedly continue to ask you a hundred profile questions, the better ones will do something as simple as use the simple open source <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/hkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">hKit Microformats Toolkit</a> by <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drew McLellan</a> to let you simply enter your hCard URL and fill out all the questions automatically from that.</p>\n\n<p>And the best services will help you, the user, keep your profile as portable as you would like it, by marking it up with hCard as well.  Already, profiles on numerous services, in addition to the abovementioned claimID, like <a href=\"http://flickr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flickr</a> and <a href=\"http://technorati.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Technorati</a> are marked up with hCard and thus ready for reuse with services that use hKit.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, some have brought up \"extensibility\" as something that is desirable yet recent lessons have taught us that in terms of standards and interoperability, the opposite is true.  The more well-defined not-infinitely-extensible a standard is, the sooner implementers know they are \"done\" implementing it (interoperably even!), and the less chance there is of a zillion non-interoperable extensions randomly emerging (i.e. Tower of Babel problem) which then cause headaches not only for all implementers, but users as well as the users then have to contend with their data not quite working interoperably across all the different services that all support slightly different sets of incompatible/non-interoperable extensions.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085272\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://macgirvin.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=74685c9f342f159611317a68c2655218&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://macgirvin.com\">Mike Macgirvin</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085272\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-22T20:38:14\">2006-08-22T20:38:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with Steve. Who am I? It depends. Who are you, and based on that - what do I wish you to know about me? Who are my friends? Same thing. Even if I wanted to divulge them, I then need to  respect their privacy wishes and decide if they want you to know that they are a friend of mine (or not) and how they came to be tagged as friends. A web service which tries to consolidate all of this info is presented with too many privacy conflicts to ever get it right (IMAO). I can recall this concept being tried by a hundred different companies (not to mention open source projects) going back to the early 90's. It was never an issue of technology. The hurdles are primarily social and revolve around trust and privacy - and delegation of these rights to third parties in language even my mother would understand.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085274\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://dekoration.cc\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f67e69a66a666638b4e3ba3b9fa68eda&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://dekoration.cc\">Wohnaccessoires</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085274\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-16T22:04:59\">2007-03-16T22:04:59</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>But you’re forgetting that a lot of people, myself included, like to represent themselves in different ways on different sites.
