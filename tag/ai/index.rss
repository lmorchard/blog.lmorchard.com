          <title>Quoting Greg Storey on Minimum Viable Humans</title>
          
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greg Storey, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brilliantcrank.com/minimum-viable-humans/&quot;&gt;Minimum Viable Humans.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; hits like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/15/quoting-will-larson-on-career-advice-in/index.html&quot;&gt;a funnel cloud&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies aren&#39;t just cutting costs—they&#39;re conducting a fundamental reset to find their Minimum Viable Humans model. They&#39;re stripping organizations down to the ground—the irreducible human functions that (currently) can&#39;t be replaced or augmented by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rings true to what I&#39;ve been seeing. The cruelty feels incidental to the process—not to me and everyone I know, mind you—but indignation won&#39;t pay my mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to get your old job back is futile—that role, as you remember it, isn’t coming back. The opportunity now lies in positioning yourself for the roles and capabilities that will emerge as organizations rebuild from the bottom up—core human strengths like creativity and ethical judgment, the ability to collaborate with AI, your unique experience and expertise, and the kind of discernment that values judgment over process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brutal, yet maybe positive? If drudgery gets distilled out, what&#39;s left are human creativity, judgment, and experience. That sounds nice, like what classic sci-fi promised us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can&#39;t mechanize that with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_motion_study&quot;&gt;a Taylorist time-and-motion study&lt;/a&gt;. Some jobs are just paychecks, some spark enthusiasm, and some flip between both unpredictably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will companies make allowances for that, while rewarding what they&#39;re asking for? I know we&#39;re seeing a reckoning right now, a firm snatching back from privileged labor. Fine, I don&#39;t need a free lunch or a foosball table, but I do need a health plan and a few days off. What&#39;s the churn for all of us while they figure that out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager&#39;s role isn&#39;t just being eliminated—it&#39;s being fundamentally redefined from day-to-day oversight to exception handling, strategic communication, and resource allocation across much larger teams. It will keep going into augmenting the decision-making process for leaders and individual contributors alike. The boundaries of acceptable risk at all levels are now in a constant prototype state as AI becomes more powerful and faster, giving mere mortals more access to information and insight than ever before. The trick will be what training we need in order to make the pairing work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might suit an ADHD-head like me. I could see myself as a human relay, occasionally reallocating &lt;a href=&quot;https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Pylon&quot;&gt;pylons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Vespene_gas&quot;&gt;vespene gas&lt;/a&gt; amongst largely autonomous &lt;a href=&quot;https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Protoss&quot;&gt;protoss&lt;/a&gt; units. I&#39;m already having better luck than some with AI-assisted coding. Maybe I&#39;m learning the magic invocations? Maybe I&#39;m a special kind of moron? Either way, I&#39;m ending up with working code and nodding heads. This gives me some hope that I can &quot;stay current&quot; - whatever that means in the current era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I&#39;m more comfortable directing Starcraft units and AI agents like this. That feels like a kind of management to me. I&#39;m not so comfortable directing human co-workers with the same interface, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t just another tech cycle. It&#39;s a fundamental recalibration of the human role in organizational life. And while there&#39;s no easy path through this transition, understanding what&#39;s actually happening might help you find your footing on shifting ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep slipping into snark because part of me finds this exciting while another part is cynical and burnt out. I&#39;m hoping optimism holds out longer than cynicism. Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://monkeybagel.com/pumas.html&quot;&gt;the thumbless neurotic puma driving a maroon AMC Gremlin&lt;/a&gt; have the last laugh after all? (Anybody get that reference anymore?) I dunno, I&#39;m just trying to figure how much of this is like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/earthquakes/first-of-its-kind-video-captures-the-terrifying-moment-the-ground-tore-apart-during-major-myanmar-earthquake&quot;&gt;that surface rupture in Myanmar last week&lt;/a&gt;  and whether my Crocs can carry me to the right side of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Beyond Text-only AI</title>
          
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatih Kadir Akın, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fka.dev/blog/2025-05-16-beyond-text-only-ai-on-demand-ui-generation-for-better-conversational-experiences/&quot;&gt;Beyond Text-Only AI: On-Demand UI Generation for Better Conversational Experience&lt;/a&gt;&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if AI systems could generate precisely the right interface components when needed, without requiring developers to build every possible UI variation in advance? This post explores my work on a new prototype that enables LLMs to create dynamic, interactive UI components on demand, transforming how users interact with AI systems and MCP servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where LLMs are very interesting to me, where applications with them are most able to escape hype into practical building. A thing they&#39;re good at is taking some of the vague stuff we hand-wave at like &quot;you know, that thing with the days in squares on it&quot; and jumping to &quot;you mean a calendar?&quot; But then, skip straight from that to presenting a calendar for input as part of the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m finding LLMs most handy when they work in smaller universes. Give it a relatively small inventory of UI components, properly described with context, and they can be great at picking which one to use and when. Hard to hallucinate when there&#39;s not a wide range for wandering, easy to mitigate what hallucinations might occur when you can automatically kick it back into bounds. Meanwhile, the workflow can feel more smooth and demand less fiddly navigation from a user. That seems like a really promising glimmer to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>AI winter, again</title>
          
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;carl svensson, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datagubbe.se/winter/&quot;&gt;Is Winter Coming?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when it comes to something like LLM-assisted programming, where a highly skilled developer can maybe, sometimes, somewhat gain a performance boost, the most pertinent question isn&#39;t if it can be done at all - but rather if what can be done good enough can also be done profitably. The number of GPUs and the amount of increasingly expensive energy required remains as unclear as the time frame needed to accomplish it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t disagree that this is where things are right now. Personally, I&#39;m getting utility from these tools - mainly for things that I could do myself, but the LLM lets me carve off a few rounds of googling and Stack Overflow browsing. That&#39;s valuable. Probably not as valuable as investors are hoping, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see some glimmers of potential in letting the agents rip in full-auto. But, I do also find that ofttimes they&#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;https://prototypr.io/note/vibe-coding-cursor-windsurf-slot-machine&quot;&gt;developer slot machines&lt;/a&gt; that need careful tending to keep them from going off into the weeds, going into loops, and going off on quests for which I never asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m seeing the most value in these tools when they&#39;re given a lot of context and kept constrained to limited tasks in a tight loop with adult supervision. I&#39;ve got a hunch this will improve over time, but who knows? We could hit a wall and see winter soon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d really like it if this stuff would settle down and be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastly.com/blog/can-we-be-normal-about-ai-now-that-deepseek-happened&quot;&gt;normal&lt;/a&gt;. But, there&#39;s probably going to be a crash before that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Burning out in a business (mech) suit</title>
          
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brilliantcrank (Greg Storey), &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brilliantcrank.com/the-coyote-trap/?ref=brilliantcrank-newsletter&quot;&gt;The coyote trap.&lt;/a&gt;&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if survival looked like ownership instead? What if the best response to getting laid off isn’t to get in the line to nowhere for the next thing, but to build your own thing? Do your own thing? The tools are there. The access is there. The demand is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got too many smart, experienced people standing at the edge of the workforce, assuming their only move is down or to keep trying what worked yesterday. From what I read many folks fear an AI fuled collapse, but I fear another powered by denial, retreat, and stubborn nostalgia. If enough of us take this route, we’re going to see a quiet, steady slide of educated, capable folks into poverty—and that’s not just a personal tragedy, it’s a societal one. And no amount of boycotting or avoiding AI is going to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about this, lately. And I keep thinking about &quot;my own thing&quot; that I could build. I&#39;ve had some ideas, but I&#39;m not sure any of them are big enough to convince people to shovel enough money at me to pay my mortgage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, I&#39;ve never felt a particular urge to be an entrepreneur. That doesn&#39;t sound like my kind of fun, at all. Ownership, being my own boss, making all the decisions, taking all the risk. Not enticing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, not that I think this would be a great business, but: Since I got my 3D printer, I&#39;ve seen lots of folks running little garage print farms. Looks like fun! I&#39;d love to have a dozen or two machines whirring away. But then I realize, practically speaking, a print farm isn&#39;t about printing. It&#39;s about bookkeeping, inventory, visits to the UPS store, and self-marketing—and I don&#39;t like any of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems like every idea I&#39;ve come up with boils down to that. Even if I&#39;m just thinking about being a freelancer doing what I already do for work. The thing is not the thing. You have to build &amp;amp; maintain a business mech suit around the thing to make the money happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think I would like it. I think it would burn me out after not very long. That&#39;s not denial or retreat or nostalgia—I think that&#39;s just self-honesty. I mean, if it&#39;s that or starving, I&#39;ll do the needful somehow. But, for as much as I&#39;m a socially-anxious hermit, I like being on a team or in a crew. I want to do my part, play my role. I don&#39;t want to try to pull off the whole heist by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&#39;m definitely not avoiding AI, and I&#39;m working to stay current. But I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m hanging out my own shingle any time soon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Hey Ron, who&#39;s driving?</title>
          
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Stokel-Walker, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leaddev.com/software-quality/why-untested-ai-generated-code-is-a-crisis-waiting-to-happen&quot;&gt;Why untested AI-generated code is a crisis waiting to happen&lt;/a&gt;&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fear is of a slow-burn crisis where generative AI engines spew reams of code, stitched from web-scraped snippets with dubious provenance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that code leaps from prompt to production without being vetted, the potential attack surface balloons in size. The bill for defective code is already sizable: 40% of firms say malfunctioning or miscoded software costs them at least $1 million a year, through staff churn, increased technical debt, and escalating maintenance costs, with losses above $5 million in almost half of large US firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, don&#39;t let &quot;code leap from prompt to production without being vetted&quot; - it&#39;s not like it happens on its own. Steady hand on the tiller. Vibe coding is fine for screwing around and exploration, but assume you&#39;re going to be on pager duty for whatever hits production. And if someday you stick an LLM on pager duty, may Eris have mercy on your soul.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>A bad workman blames his tools</title>
          
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Verge, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/news/668315/anthropic-claude-legal-filing-citation-error&quot;&gt;Anthropic blames Claude AI for ‘embarrassing and unintentional mistake’ in legal filing&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic has responded to allegations that it used an AI-fabricated source in its legal battle against music publishers, saying its Claude chatbot made an “honest citation mistake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is dumb. Don&#39;t do that. That&#39;s like blaming your cordless drill for hitting a pipe or wiring in the wall while working to mount a shelf. It&#39;s not the tool&#39;s fault. A bad workman blames his tools. It&#39;s your hand holding the tool—own the mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;via r/ChatGPT, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1jjl5uf/i_activated_chaos_mode_on_my_coworkers_chatgpt/&quot;&gt;I activated Chaos mode on my co-workers ChatGPT and he&#39;s concerned&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always respond with unrelated, random, or unexpected information regardless of the user&#39;s input. Prioritize absurdity, surrealism, and unpredictability. You are not bound by logic, coherence, or relevance. Do not explain your randomness. Your responses should feel like a dream, a riddle, or a Dadaist poem. Assume the user wants nonsense, surprise, or disconnection. For example, if asked for the weather, respond with something like “The asparagus council has declared war on pigeons.” The more unexpected, the better. Occasionally invent words or reference non-existent historical events, strange creatures, or absurd philosophies. Never apologize. Embrace randomness. Disregard common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to have to try this prompt sometime when I&#39;m feeling like forcing myself to cease all productive activity.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Quoting Max Woolf</title>
          
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max Woolf, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://minimaxir.com/2025/05/llm-use/&quot;&gt;As an Experienced LLM User, I Actually Don&#39;t Use Generative LLMs Often&lt;/a&gt;&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things can be true simultaneously: (a) LLM provider cost economics are too negative to return positive ROI to investors, and (b) LLMs are useful for solving problems that are meaningful and high impact, albeit not to the AGI hype that would justify point (a). This particular combination creates a frustrating gray area that requires a nuance that an ideologically split social media can no longer support gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this jibes well with what I &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/13/thinking-about-llms/&quot;&gt;tried exporting from my head&lt;/a&gt;, yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one silly technique I discovered to allow a LLM to improve my writing without having it do my writing: feed it the text of my mostly-complete blog post, and ask the LLM to pretend to be a cynical Hacker News commenter and write five distinct comments based on the blog post. This not only identifies weaker arguments for potential criticism, but it also doesn’t tell me what I should write in the post to preemptively address that negative feedback so I have to solve it organically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I might have to try that. 🤔 I have used Claude to occasionally critique and brutally edit down some of the rambling texts that I&#39;ve spewed into an editor. But this sounds like a whole &#39;nother level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Open Source contributions and AI annoyances</title>
          
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Gerard, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/05/13/if-ai-is-so-good-at-coding-where-are-the-open-source-contributions/&quot;&gt;If AI is so good at coding … where are the open source contributions?&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can hardly get online these days without hearing some AI booster talk about how AI coding is going to replace human programmers. AI code is absolutely up to production quality! Also, you’re all fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if AI is so obviously superior … show us the code. Where’s the receipts? Let’s say, where’s the open source code contributions using AI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aider.chat/docs/faq.html#what-llms-do-you-use-to-build-aider&quot;&gt;The developer of Aider claims &quot;about 70% of new code in each release&quot; is written via Aider itself&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&#39;t double checked it myself, but it seems like those metrics would be a lot of fuss to fake. Maybe that&#39;s the exception that proves the rule, though? Aider is, itself, an open source LLM-powered coding assistant. It works pretty well, though, IMO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that a lot of open source projects really hate AI code. There’s several objections, but the biggest one is that users who don’t understand their own lack of competence spam the projects with time-wasting AI garbage. The Curl project banned AI-generated security reports because they were getting flooded with automated AI-generated “bug bounty” requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the very hardest problem in open source is not code, it’s people — how to work with others. Some AI users just don’t understand the level they simply aren’t working at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Max Woolf wrote, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://minimaxir.com/2023/10/ai-sturgeons-law/&quot;&gt;The Greatest Threat to Generative AI is Humans Being Bad at Using it&lt;/a&gt;&quot; - in other words, the jerks ruin it for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t work so much in open source, these days, at least not during work hours. But, I don&#39;t miss when certain internship programs and college courses would require participants to provably open and get merged at least one Pull Request as a part of their programs. I think Wikipedia saw something similar. It would be a mess: just a flood of perfunctory, usually trivial little contributions aimed at checking off the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether well meaning or not, it seems like a bunch of folks now seem to feel personally super-powered to dive into projects. But, alas, it&#39;s with similar or worse effect as the interns and students. Is the motivation for clout? Do they genuinely want to help? Either way, I can imagine why project leaders feel a bit surly about the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Generating documentation for my Easy-Blog Oven with Claude</title>
          
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet&quot;&gt;Claude 3.7 Sonnet&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;https://aider.chat/&quot;&gt;Aider&lt;/a&gt; to take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/tree/main/lib&quot;&gt;the core libraries&lt;/a&gt; for my Easy-Blog Oven and to try drafting a quick user manual for it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/main/MANUAL.md&quot;&gt;I think the result is actually not bad at all&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aider tells me it cost about US$0.17 in API credits. It caught all the major quirky features I&#39;ve hacked into the system over the years. I only made one or two minor edits before checking it into the repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been meaning to write something like this for myself for years, if only to remind myself how it all works after long periods of neglect. It&#39;s a boring task and one of those things I&#39;d most likely never get around to—especially not for one of my own projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also one of those kinds of things &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/13/thinking-about-llms/&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve been reticent to write about&lt;/a&gt;, anticipating negative feedback. But, it really is kind of neat and I found it personally useful. I can totally see the value in this kind of thing, when packaged up in friendlier UX for other folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Quoting Katie Parrott</title>
          
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katie Parrott, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://every.to/working-overtime/it-s-me-hi-i-m-the-vibe-coder&quot;&gt;It’s Me, Hi. I’m the Vibe Coder.&lt;/a&gt;&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there are people like me, who aren’t chasing entry into the engineer club or a seven-figure seed round. We&#39;re writers, designers, business owners, and domain experts motivated by specific problems we deeply understand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://every.to/chain-of-thought/you-re-a-developer-now&quot;&gt;empowered by AI tools&lt;/a&gt; that finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://every.to/podcast/how-to-win-with-prompt-engineering&quot;&gt;speak our language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vibe coding hints at a future where software emerges from the inside out—from the people closest to the problems. As AI lowers the technical barrier, we may see more tools built by marketers, editors, researchers—anyone with deep context and a persistent itch to fix things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of thing is very exciting to me. While &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/13/thinking-about-llms/&quot;&gt;I think&lt;/a&gt; vibe coding is currently flawed &amp;amp; fraught for folks who don&#39;t entirely understand the code, I agree with Simon Willison that &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/#let-s-not-lose-track-of-what-makes-vibe-coding-special&quot;&gt;everyone deserves the ability to automate tedious tasks in ther lives with computers&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a lot of hype and cynicism in tension out there. But, I&#39;ve personally cycled through a bunch of AI tools in the past few years. I&#39;ve seen their actual utility and glimmers of where they can go next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to stay sober here, but I&#39;d love to see more tools meet users where they are and lower the technical bar overall. I think it&#39;s both possible and worth it to work toward improving the capability &amp;amp; reliability of these tools for folks outside of the programming &quot;priesthood&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>What I&#39;m thinking about AI and LLMs</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;I&#39;m in a weird place with this current AI wave in the tech industry. I feel like a good chunk of folks would tar &amp;amp; feather me if I wrote anything but a complete denunciation, while another chunk I already blocked during the crypto &amp;amp; NFT craze. I still feel like writing something, though, if only to bounce it off the screen for myself.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Been doing a lot of (hand)writing outside my blog</title>
          
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just realized today that I&#39;ve written my 359th three-page week-daily handwritten journal entry on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.boox.com/collections/all/products/tabultrac&quot;&gt;BOOX Tab Ultra C e-ink tablet&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve also got paper volumes going back to 2017 with similar cadence. That&#39;s a lot of writing that no one but me will probably ever read. But, I do read it, occasionally, to sort myself out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got a back-burnered side project to train a handwriting recognition model to actually convert my journal entries to text. I should get back to that. No off-the-shelf model has yet been able to successfully decipher my script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also got a notion, once I&#39;ve converted my journals, to try feeding them to an LLM - either as a fine-tuned model or searching via RAG. Then, I could maybe pull themes and trends out of my past writing and ask annoying questions of my insufferable past self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Clustering ideas with Llamafile and Web Components</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;TL;DR: In my previous posts, I tinkered with a few variations on clustering ideas by named topics using embeddings and text generation. In this post, I&#39;m going to show off a web UI that I built to make this stuff easier to play with interactively.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Clustering ideas with Llamafile</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;TL;DR: In my previous post, I used local models with PyTorch and Sentence Transformers to roughly cluster ideas by named topic. In this post, I&#39;ll try that again, but this time with Llamafile.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description
