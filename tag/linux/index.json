    "html": "<p>Hell, while I&#39;m at it, I&#39;ve got an expanded question to follow up <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/11/02/why-microsoft\">my last one</a>:</p>\n<p>Why would anyone developing a web application today sink any money whatsoever into a platform with any degree of proprietary technology?</p>\n<p>The latest <a href=\"http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/11/01/ross-doesnt-trust-microsofts-approach-to-web/\">Scoble dispatch</a> is asking about Microsoft, but what about all the other closed-world web development environments out there?  Really, it&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve heard much about anything other than Microsoft versus Open Source in the web development world.  And, when I have heard about the other guys, it&#39;s usually in a scenario where someone got roped into the technology sometime in the dot-com boom days and have since built everything around it.  </p>\n<p>It seems this far out from the initial adoption that decisions are made less and less from technical merit, and more from monetary and political merit driven by the sales force.  The momentum of the platform maintains lock-in, despite any resulting impedance mismatches or inefficiencies which may crop up as the platform matures or (less charitably) ages.</p>\n<p>Finally, consider one of the main routes for finding support for Open Source platforms:  Google.  Have you run into a cryptic error message?  Google it.  Need to find docs for an API?  Google it.  So many of these wholly proprietary platforms have locked up a lot of their docs and forums behind for-pay password walls that Google never sees.</p>\n<p>Now, for now at least, it seems Microsoft has avoided these things.  But, my suspicion is that they&#39;re only able to do this as a commercial venture because of the sheer number of people and the wads of cash they have.  Eventually, I expect even they will be overrun.  I couldn&#39;t imagine a new closed-world web development platform taking off today.</p>\n<!-- tags: webdev linux microsoft -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086794\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086794\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-02T20:26:22\">2005-11-02T20:26:22</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>\"Why would anyone developing a web application today sink any money whatsoever into a platform with any degree of proprietary technology?\"</p>\n<p>Because I like 'em? </p>\n<p>I use Win2k3/IIS because it is stable, easy to administer, and doesn't cost one dime more than a similar Linux/Apache server. I use Coldfusion because it's stable, easy to administer, gives me the option of using Java and COM stuff when necessary, and has a great group of folks at Macromedia supporting it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I use MySQL because it's stable, cheap, and has a smaller footprint than SQL Server.

For what it's worth, I actually <em>do</em> want to see comments from people who've had good experiences with proprietary platforms, so as to balance out my leanings.</p>\n<p>Since you mentioned Macromedia, I realize that I wasn't thinking of them in my post.  They're basically semi-open proprietary (not unlike Microsoft), but I <em>do</em> like their stuff.  Well, Flash at least.  But ColdFusion...?  Admittedly, I haven't used it much since the arrival of CFMX, but I tend to think PHP's a better deal.  No offense, though, since I'm willing to blame my own ignorance.</p>\n<p>It's interesting that you say a Win2k3/IIS server is cost comparable to a Linux/Apache server, though.  Do you own your own server?

    "body": "Hell, while I'm at it, I've got an expanded question to follow up [my last one][wm]:\r\n\r\nWhy would anyone developing a web application today sink any money whatsoever into a platform with any degree of proprietary technology?\r\n\r\nThe latest [Scoble dispatch][scob] is asking about Microsoft, but what about all the other closed-world web development environments out there?  Really, it's been awhile since I've heard much about anything other than Microsoft versus Open Source in the web development world.  And, when I have heard about the other guys, it's usually in a scenario where someone got roped into the technology sometime in the dot-com boom days and have since built everything around it.  \r\n\r\nIt seems this far out from the initial adoption that decisions are made less and less from technical merit, and more from monetary and political merit driven by the sales force.  The momentum of the platform maintains lock-in, despite any resulting impedance mismatches or inefficiencies which may crop up as the platform matures or (less charitably) ages.\r\n\r\nFinally, consider one of the main routes for finding support for Open Source platforms:  Google.  Have you run into a cryptic error message?  Google it.  Need to find docs for an API?  Google it.  So many of these wholly proprietary platforms have locked up a lot of their docs and forums behind for-pay password walls that Google never sees.\r\n\r\nNow, for now at least, it seems Microsoft has avoided these things.  But, my suspicion is that they're only able to do this as a commercial venture because of the sheer number of people and the wads of cash they have.  Eventually, I expect even they will be overrun.  I couldn't imagine a new closed-world web development platform taking off today.\r\n\r\n[scob]: http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/11/01/ross-doesnt-trust-microsofts-approach-to-web/\r\n[wm]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/11/02/why-microsoft\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: webdev linux microsoft -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086794\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086794\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-02T20:26:22\">2005-11-02T20:26:22</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>\"Why would anyone developing a web application today sink any money whatsoever into a platform with any degree of proprietary technology?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because I like 'em? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I use Win2k3/IIS because it is stable, easy to administer, and doesn't cost one dime more than a similar Linux/Apache server.

As in, someone to call and bug for answers or blame for problems.  Because—and maybe this is just a demonstration of my own ignorance—I can&#39;t really think of an area where Microsoft&#39;s offerings really blow any Open Source platforms out of the water, especially not once you&#39;ve considered cost and the loss of flexibility.</p>\n<!-- tags: webdev microsoft linux -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086323\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://virtuallyshocking.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=066c167d7062108915aa0eb5dd59d8bf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://virtuallyshocking.com\">Brock Tice</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086323\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-03T02:12:59\">2005-11-03T02:12:59</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Hiya,\nI wanted to write a post about this myself with a trackback, but despite this being WordPress I can't seem to find a trackback URL.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I agree.
