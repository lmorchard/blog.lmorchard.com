But, the changes seem to have removed most of the\nvalue from the service for me, so I&#39;m moving on as I was invited to\ndo.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"display: block; float: right; text-decoration: none; border: none; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/images/2011/11/Newspaper_Feed_256x256.png\" style=\"width: 256px\" /></span></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-happened\">What happened?</h2>\n<p>Almost a year ago, I wrote about how my habits had gotten\n<a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2010/12/18/less-del-icio-us-than-ever-before\">less del.icio.us</a>. One of the main culprits that stole my sharing\nflow was <a href=\"http://reader.google.com\">Google Reader</a>: I went from using a quick bookmarklet to an\neven quicker icon-click in my feed reader. That meant I left most\nthings <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/untagged/\">untagged</a>, but I shared even more than before. Eventually,\nGoogle Reader released a bookmarklet for use off-site, which\nmeant I started sharing everything everywhere to Reader.</p>\n<p>I also found a replacement for my old del.icio.us network in Google\nReader&#39;s social features. I could follow people, and the stream of\nthings <em>they</em> shared and annotated turned into a great source of\nnews curated and pre-filtered by likeminded people.</p>\n<p>Well, as it turns out, Google&#39;s <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/new-in-reader-fresh-design-and-google.html\">recent changes</a> to Reader just\nremoved all of the above. In exchange, they added a couple of buttons\nto +1 and share items to Google+, which streamlines things for them\nand encourages more use of the new service.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/114487965928288927815/posts/fgscQet4kxh\">As I wrote</a> on Google+, the net result is nothing to stomp and\nshout about, but there&#39;s nothing there that makes me happier. As I\nplayed more, though, I came to realize that most of the value\nI derived from the service had evaporated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"item-centric-vs-people-centric-efficiency-vs-engagement\">Item-centric vs People-centric, Efficiency vs Engagement</h2>\n<p>There&#39;s a big difference between the way sharing happened on Google\nReader, and the way it happens now on Google+. The best way I can\nthink to explain is that the old way was item-centric and the new way\nis people-centric.  In other words, <em>people</em> seem to be the dominant\n<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/jyri/microblogging-tiny-social-objects-on-the-future-of-participatory-media\">social objects</a> in Google+, whereas Google Reader used to treat\n<em>items</em> that way.</p>\n<p>Before, we all gathered around the news. The headline and summary were\nprimary, and our comments were collected after the item. The result\nwas a de-duped stream of great news filtered through smart brains.\nEven if the people I followed never said a word, the fact that they&#39;d\nclicked &quot;share&quot; was value enough. In fact, it was better that\nway most of the time, because we all got out of the way of each other\nand the news.</p>\n<p>This, by the way, is what I loved about del.icio.us and now\n<a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">pinboard.in</a>: It&#39;s anti-social networking. We can provide\nlow-effort, intelligent inputs to build something useful for each\nother, but we&#39;re not there to assert a presence or distract each other\nfrom the things we each came to see.</p>\n<p>But now, that filtered news stream is gone. In its place, on a\ndifferent site entirely, removed from the flow of feeding on news, is\na highly-engaging flood of people babbling away, which occasionally\nincludes repeated shares of things that have bubbled up during the\nday.</p>\n<p>What&#39;s wrong with that, for me?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I don&#39;t want to wade through a heavily-padded, user-friendly flood\nof duplicated, echoed items.</li>\n<li>I don&#39;t want to engage with the people—at least, not when I&#39;m in a\nmood to feed on news. I want to catch up on what&#39;s been put out\ninto the infosphere already, and <em>then</em> start talking about it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The design of Google+—which has spilled over into the Google Reader\nface-lift—is about engagement and not fast &amp; efficient processing of\nthe day&#39;s news. Engagement in general puts a drag on the task—which\nfor me is like a <a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd\">GTD</a>, <a href=\"http://inboxzero.com/\">Inbox Zero</a>, headline skimming, pattern\nrecognition zen thing that might not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea.</p>\n<p>But, for all I know, avowed weirdo and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/10/11/allgrowedup\">info freako</a> that I am,\nthese changes may drive Google Reader growth through the roof for\nmainstream users.  But, it&#39;s no longer a product for me. The changes\nin sharing have removed most of the value for me, because I no longer\nhave the warp speed cruise through news that other people used to\npower for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"circles-point-the-wrong-way\">Circles point the wrong way</h2>\n<p>One of the things <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/100535338638690515335/posts/95ZsWiCG3xS\">Louis Gray touted about the new sharing\nfeatures</a> reads like so:</p>\n<blockquote>In Reader’s previous sharing model, as a follower of your\nitems, I would see every single item you shared, no matter what it was\nabout. Obviously, as I have different interests than you do, not\neverything you shared was something I cared about, which often led to\nreduced sharing of off-topic content.

But, the changes seem to have removed most of the\r\nvalue from the service for me, so I'm moving on as I was invited to\r\ndo.</em>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"display: block; float: right; text-decoration: none; border: none; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/images/2011/11/Newspaper_Feed_256x256.png\" style=\"width: 256px\" /></span>\r\n\r\n## What happened?\r\n\r\nAlmost a year ago, I wrote about how my habits had gotten\r\n[less del.icio.us][]. One of the main culprits that stole my sharing\r\nflow was [Google Reader][]: I went from using a quick bookmarklet to an\r\neven quicker icon-click in my feed reader. That meant I left most\r\nthings [untagged][], but I shared even more than before. Eventually,\r\nGoogle Reader released a bookmarklet for use off-site, which\r\nmeant I started sharing everything everywhere to Reader.\r\n\r\n[google reader]: http://reader.google.com\r\n\r\nI also found a replacement for my old del.icio.us network in Google\r\nReader's social features. I could follow people, and the stream of\r\nthings *they* shared and annotated turned into a great source of\r\nnews curated and pre-filtered by likeminded people.\r\n\r\nWell, as it turns out, Google's [recent changes][] to Reader just\r\nremoved all of the above. In exchange, they added a couple of buttons\r\nto +1 and share items to Google+, which streamlines things for them\r\nand encourages more use of the new service.\r\n\r\n[As I wrote][] on Google+, the net result is nothing to stomp and\r\nshout about, but there's nothing there that makes me happier. As I\r\nplayed more, though, I came to realize that most of the value\r\nI derived from the service had evaporated.\r\n\r\n[as i wrote]: https://plus.google.com/114487965928288927815/posts/fgscQet4kxh\r\n[recent changes]: http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/new-in-reader-fresh-design-and-google.html\r\n[less del.icio.us]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2010/12/18/less-del-icio-us-than-ever-before\r\n[untagged]: http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/untagged/\r\n\r\n## Item-centric vs People-centric, Efficiency vs Engagement\r\n\r\nThere's a big difference between the way sharing happened on Google\r\nReader, and the way it happens now on Google+. The best way I can\r\nthink to explain is that the old way was item-centric and the new way\r\nis people-centric.  In other words, *people* seem to be the dominant\r\n[social objects][] in Google+, whereas Google Reader used to treat\r\n*items* that way.\r\n\r\n[social objects]: http://www.slideshare.net/jyri/microblogging-tiny-social-objects-on-the-future-of-participatory-media\r\n\r\nBefore, we all gathered around the news. The headline and summary were\r\nprimary, and our comments were collected after the item. The result\r\nwas a de-duped stream of great news filtered through smart brains.\r\nEven if the people I followed never said a word, the fact that they'd\r\nclicked \"share\" was value enough. In fact, it was better that\r\nway most of the time, because we all got out of the way of each other\r\nand the news.\r\n\r\nThis, by the way, is what I loved about del.icio.us and now\r\n[pinboard.in][]: It's anti-social networking. We can provide\r\nlow-effort, intelligent inputs to build something useful for each\r\nother, but we're not there to assert a presence or distract each other\r\nfrom the things we each came to see.\r\n\r\n[pinboard.in]: http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\r\n\r\nBut now, that filtered news stream is gone. In its place, on a\r\ndifferent site entirely, removed from the flow of feeding on news, is\r\na highly-engaging flood of people babbling away, which occasionally\r\nincludes repeated shares of things that have bubbled up during the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWhat's wrong with that, for me?\r\n\r\n1. I don't want to wade through a heavily-padded, user-friendly flood\r\n   of duplicated, echoed items.\r\n1. I don't want to engage with the people—at least, not when I'm in a\r\n   mood to feed on news. I want to catch up on what's been put out\r\n   into the infosphere already, and *then* start talking about it.\r\n\r\nThe design of Google+—which has spilled over into the Google Reader\r\nface-lift—is about engagement and not fast & efficient processing of\r\nthe day's news. Engagement in general puts a drag on the task—which\r\nfor me is like a [GTD][], [Inbox Zero][], headline skimming, pattern\r\nrecognition zen thing that might not be everyone's cup of tea.\r\n\r\nBut, for all I know, avowed weirdo and [info freako][] that I am,\r\nthese changes may drive Google Reader growth through the roof for\r\nmainstream users.  But, it's no longer a product for me. The changes\r\nin sharing have removed most of the value for me, because I no longer\r\nhave the warp speed cruise through news that other people used to\r\npower for me.\r\n\r\n[gtd]: http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd\r\n[inbox zero]: http://inboxzero.com/\r\n[info freako]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/10/11/allgrowedup\r\n\r\n## Circles point the wrong way\r\n\r\nOne of the things [Louis Gray touted about the new sharing\r\nfeatures][touted] reads like so:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In Reader’s previous sharing model, as a follower of your\r\nitems, I would see every single item you shared, no matter what it was\r\nabout. Obviously, as I have different interests than you do, not\r\neverything you shared was something I cared about, which often led to\r\nreduced sharing of off-topic content. Now, you are more in control, so\r\nyou can share sports items to your sports circles, great recipes with\r\nyour foodies circle, or local news to family and friends. You can keep\r\nsharing, like you always have, but now, you can better select who sees\r\nwhat.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n[touted]: https://plus.google.com/100535338638690515335/posts/95ZsWiCG3xS\r\n\r\nBut, for this purpose, Circles point the wrong way.\r\n\r\nCircles on Google+ are lists of people controlled by me.

    "html": "<p><em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/firefox-sync-appengine\">I built an implementation</a> of the <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Sync/1.0/API\">Firefox Sync server API</a> for <a href=\"http://appengine.google.com/\">Google App Engine</a>.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\" style=\"float: right; padding: 0 0 0em 0em; display: block; text-decoration: none; border: none\"><img src=\"http://mozcom-cdn.mozilla.net/img/firefox/sync/sync-background.png\" style=\"border: none\" /></a></p>\n<p>To celebrate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_%28United_States%29\">Independence Day</a>, I figured I might take a shot at liberating <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\">Firefox Sync</a> from the tyranny of <a href=\"https://services.mozilla.com/\">Mozilla&#39;s servers</a>. </p>\n<p>Thus, over the past few days, I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/firefox-sync-appengine\">built a sync server</a> using the <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Sync/1.0/API\">1.0 Sync API</a>, hosted on <a href=\"http://appengine.google.com/\">Google App Engine</a>.</p>\n<p>I lied about the <em>tyranny</em> thing, though—I just wanted to say something clever about the holiday. In reality, with respect to <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\">Firefox Sync</a>, Mozilla has done all of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Published <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Sync/1.0/API\">the Sync API spec</a>;</li>\n<li>Released <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/services/sync-server/\">the source code for the server used in-house</a>;</li>\n<li>Explicitly included the option to use a custom server when setting up sync in the browser.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This means that, although Mozilla offers servers to go along with <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\">Firefox Sync</a>, you&#39;re totally free to take your data elsewhere. Since your sync data is encrypted and practically opaque to the server, there&#39;s no direct profit for Mozilla in offering free sync hosting—not even through any clandestine data mining for devious purposes. It&#39;s just that sync makes Firefox a better browser, and <em>somebody</em> has to run some servers to make it work.</p>\n<p>So, there&#39;s every incentive to make it easy for you to switch sync providers and <em>stop freeloading</em> on Mozilla&#39;s servers. Building a server on <a href=\"http://appengine.google.com/\">Google App Engine</a> means I can freeload on <em>Google&#39;s</em> servers!</p>\n<p>I kid, of course. No one&#39;s really complaining about freeloaders, and App Engine has quotas in place to head off any serious mooching—which is why I&#39;m not telling you where to find <em>my</em> sync server deployed on Google App Engine, by the way. </p>\n<p>No, I did this because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firefox Sync and Google App Engine are interesting and important technologies;</li>\n<li>I&#39;ve already done a bit of work on the PHP-based Firefox Sync server at Mozilla;</li>\n<li>I really wanted to take a break from PHP and spend some time with my old friend Python.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are, of course, a number of bugs in this server. But, it seems to be working between a number of machines and browser profiles I have at home. Things are really in need of optimization, it suffers from my inexperience with App Engine, and I keep running into those aforementioned App Engine resource limits—especially when updating or deleting large numbers of items (ie. 1000&#39;s to 10000&#39;s of items).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/firefox-sync-appengine\"><em>Pull requests and issue reports on GitHub are welcome!</em></a></p>\n<p>A next step I&#39;d like to take with this thing is to revisit another old friend, the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer\">desktop web app server</a>.

    "body": "<em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> [I built an implementation][impl] of the [Firefox Sync server API][api10] for [Google App Engine][appengine].</em>\r\n\r\n[impl]: http://github.com/lmorchard/firefox-sync-appengine\r\n[api10]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Sync/1.0/API\r\n[appengine]: http://appengine.google.com/\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\" style=\"float: right; padding: 0 0 0em 0em; display: block; text-decoration: none; border: none\"><img src=\"http://mozcom-cdn.mozilla.net/img/firefox/sync/sync-background.png\" style=\"border: none\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTo celebrate [Independence Day][july4], I figured I might take a shot at liberating [Firefox Sync][sync] from the tyranny of [Mozilla's servers][servers]. \r\n\r\nThus, over the past few days, I've [built a sync server][impl] using the [1.0 Sync API][api10], hosted on [Google App Engine][appengine].\r\n\r\nI lied about the *tyranny* thing, though—I just wanted to say something clever about the holiday. In reality, with respect to [Firefox Sync][sync], Mozilla has done all of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Published [the Sync API spec][api10];\r\n2. Released [the source code for the server used in-house][sync-server];\r\n3. Explicitly included the option to use a custom server when setting up sync in the browser.\r\n\r\nThis means that, although Mozilla offers servers to go along with [Firefox Sync][sync], you're totally free to take your data elsewhere. Since your sync data is encrypted and practically opaque to the server, there's no direct profit for Mozilla in offering free sync hosting—not even through any clandestine data mining for devious purposes. It's just that sync makes Firefox a better browser, and *somebody* has to run some servers to make it work.\r\n\r\nSo, there's every incentive to make it easy for you to switch sync providers and *stop freeloading* on Mozilla's servers. Building a server on [Google App Engine][appengine] means I can freeload on *Google's* servers!\r\n\r\nI kid, of course. No one's really complaining about freeloaders, and App Engine has quotas in place to head off any serious mooching—which is why I'm not telling you where to find *my* sync server deployed on Google App Engine, by the way. \r\n\r\nNo, I did this because:\r\n\r\n* Firefox Sync and Google App Engine are interesting and important technologies;\r\n* I've already done a bit of work on the PHP-based Firefox Sync server at Mozilla;\r\n* I really wanted to take a break from PHP and spend some time with my old friend Python.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, a number of bugs in this server. But, it seems to be working between a number of machines and browser profiles I have at home. Things are really in need of optimization, it suffers from my inexperience with App Engine, and I keep running into those aforementioned App Engine resource limits—especially when updating or deleting large numbers of items (ie. 1000's to 10000's of items).\r\n\r\n[*Pull requests and issue reports on GitHub are welcome!*][impl]\r\n\r\nA next step I'd like to take with this thing is to revisit another old friend, the [desktop web app server][desktopserver]. (Also known as the [desktop website][dw].) It seems to me that it would be interesting to scale this server down to a household appliance—say, just for use by my wife and I.\r\n\r\nI'd be especially happy if the work I'm doing for a Google-hosted app could be self-hosted at home. Seeing as the development environment for App Engine runs on my laptop, I'm willing to bet I can hack the whole shebang into a simple, special-purpose app to download and double-click on a home desktop PC for use as your sync hub.\r\n\r\nAnyway, [check it out][impl] and let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n[dw]: http://www.scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/04/desktopWebsites.html#4\r\n[dave]: http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html\r\n[desktopserver]: http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer\r\n[sync-server]: http://hg.mozilla.org/services/sync-server/\r\n[july4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_%28United_States%29\r\n[sync]: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\r\n[servers]: https://services.mozilla.com/\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088097\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://coffeeonthekeyboard.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8371744716a9335eb3dcae228fd9d996&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://coffeeonthekeyboard.com/\">James Socol</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088097\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-07-06T01:28:02\">2010-07-06T01:28:02</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Assuming you already had a network and a Mac Mini or something at home, it would be pretty interesting to run your own small Sync server just to keep your home computers together.

As a developer, I'm sure that you've been in the position where suits see a business opportunity and decide to launch an app that's not ready. That's what the Google reader feels like to me. More so when the acquisition of Ranchero (owner of NetNewsWire) earlier this week is taken to account. For example, the lack of rudimentary autodiscovery in supplied urls. That's a no brainer to add and yet it's missing. I suppose that the developers could've neglected that feature, but that seems like something that would've been added in a later internal development release prior to a public beta launch. </p>\n<p>Eh, it's all supposition on my part, but if it is the case that perceived business opportunity outweighed holding off a bit and shipping a solid app then that's not a good sign for Google at all.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085370\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.sencer.de\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0e94b4d4662542b91df48f0ff3b36d26&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.sencer.de\">Sencer</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085370\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-08T22:38:56\">2005-10-08T22:38:56</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n<p>where suits see a business opportunity and decide to launch an app \nthat’s not ready.

More so when the acquisition of Ranchero (owner of NetNewsWire) earlier this week is taken to account. For example, the lack of rudimentary autodiscovery in supplied urls. That's a no brainer to add and yet it's missing. I suppose that the developers could've neglected that feature, but that seems like something that would've been added in a later internal development release prior to a public beta launch. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eh, it's all supposition on my part, but if it is the case that perceived business opportunity outweighed holding off a bit and shipping a solid app then that's not a good sign for Google at all.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085370\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.sencer.de\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0e94b4d4662542b91df48f0ff3b36d26&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.sencer.de\">Sencer</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085370\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-08T22:38:56\">2005-10-08T22:38:56</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\r\n  <p>where suits see a business opportunity and decide to launch an app \r\n  that’s not ready.
