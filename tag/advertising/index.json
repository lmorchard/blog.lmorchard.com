It&#39;s up to you what you do with it.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"the-beauty-of-the-open-web\">The beauty of the open web</h2>\n<p>So, here I am again, channelling my easily excited self from 1993: Man, I love the web.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s easy to take this thing for granted, but take a step back and consider it: You&#39;ve got this thing called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser\">browser</a>. It acts as an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent\">Agent</a> on your behalf, reaching out to computers on the Internet and requesting resources identified via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator\">Universal Resource Locators</a>. Looking among these resources, you&#39;d find <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext\">hypertext</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_(web_development)\">style sheets</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia\">multimedia</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"pullquote\">\nSo, here I am again, channelling my easily excited self from 1993: **Man, I love the web.**\n</div>\n\n<p>Your browser comes with code that knows what to do with common types of content. But, browsers can&#39;t anticipate every invention. So, one of the supported resource content types is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\">JavaScript</a>. This is a <em>meta content type</em>. That is, it offers the ability to augment existing content types and support completely new ones.</p>\n<p>Chew on <em>that</em> awhile: Not satisfied to be just a networked document viewer with a frozen set of features, browsers ship with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain\">toolchain</a> for running code on demand. Kind of scary, but it works way better than any reasonable person should expect.</p>\n<p>And again, thanks to the Internet, these resources can each come literally from anywhere<!-- ([even Sweden][cern]!) -->, hosted by any person or company or organization. Your browser chases URL references and collects all these disparate resources automatically. It assembles them into what is basically a zero-installation software application that&#39;s temporarily resident on your computer.</p>\n<p>We call these insane things &quot;web pages&quot;. Their negotiated &amp; ephemeral hold on our computers is why we say we only &quot;visit&quot; them. In fact, it might be more accurate to say web pages are guests we host on our computers for a short time.</p>\n<!--\nSo, yeah, I'm crazy about the web. Crazy enough to work for Mozilla and turn down every other job offer over the years because the mission aligns so well with so many of my favorite things.\n-->\n\n<h2 id=\"makers-have-power\">Makers have power</h2>\n<p>There is no other successful system like this on the planet. No other system for delivering content and software that is this open and free of gatekeepers deciding what we can publish. There&#39;s no app store, no review process, no adult supervision. You can make the most amazing or terrible things. Short of legal action or government intervention, no one can really stop you as long as you&#39;re paying the hosting bill.</p>\n<h3 id=\"build-your-own-whatever\">Build your own whatever</h3>\n<p>In fact, even though I wrote that browsers are agents acting on their users&#39; behalf - they&#39;re historically weak advocates by default. In other words, browsers do what web pages ask, with a few exceptions for safety and security.

cheaper to put something on the web. For example, <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/20/static-blog-generation-with-gulp/\">this blog lives mostly on Amazon S3</a>. My <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2015/07/22/the-verge-web-sucks/\">last post</a> got around 55,000 unique views so far - the most attention I&#39;ve gotten in years. It looks like that&#39;s going to cost me about $6 by the end of the month. I could have probably cut that in half if I&#39;d been smarter about things.</p>\n<p>To put this in my old-person perspective: Someone once told me it was $1 or $5 to photocopy &amp; mail a single issue of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine\">zine</a>. Bump that up to $5-10 for a CD-ROM or DVD in a nice padded envelope. Holy crap. I couldn&#39;t even imagine funding a passion project centered around media like that and reaching 55,000 people across the planet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"users-have-leverage\">Users have leverage</h2>\n<p>I know I just wrote that the balance of control on the web leans mainly toward the publishers. But, users on the web <em>do</em> have leverage when they care to assert themselves.</p>\n<div class=\"pullquote right\">\nWith this choice in personalized user agents, **the relationship between reader and publisher must be negotiated**.\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"browser-choice\">Browser choice</h3>\n<p>First off, you have a choice in browsers. The browser market is pretty healthy right now. Once upon a time, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#First_browser_war\">Microsoft Internet Explorer held 96% of the market</a>. Today, we&#39;ve got <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#Second_browser_war\">at least half-a-dozen browsers</a> with almost as many rendering engines under their hoods.</p>\n<p>This diversity in browsers is important, and switching cost is low on a web with shared standards. You can vote with your feet and try another browser at any time. This also hinders any single company from injecting their own proprietary features into the web and setting up tollbooths.</p>\n<h3 id=\"add-ons-and-extensions\">Add-ons and extensions</h3>\n<p>Your choice in browsers includes some that can be customized with <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/\">add-ons</a> and <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions\">extensions</a>. This is where a browser can really shine as a personalized <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent\">User Agent</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/en/about\"><img class=\"lazyload inset left wide\" data-src=\"/uploads/2015/web-awesome/adblock.png\"></a></p>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/\">Adblock Plus</a>, and you can deflect most attempts to track you &amp; display ads.</p>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://www.readability.com/\">Readability</a>, and you can get a cleaner view of articles you&#39;d like to read.</p>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://www.libraryextension.com/\">Library Extension</a> and your browser will automatically tell you when a book is available at your local library while you&#39;re shopping on Amazon.</p>\n<p>You can even craft your own tweaks, if you&#39;re so inclined. In a spirit similar to the web itself, the tech to build these things is generally available to anyone.</p>\n<p>Publishers on the web sometimes deride these tweaks. It&#39;s understandable: The most popular ones have long been centered around refusing to accept many of the annoyances that also happen to fund the web.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-web-is-a-negotiation\">The web is a negotiation</h3>\n<p>With this choice in personalized user agents, the relationship between reader and publisher must be <em>negotiated</em>. Mostly, it&#39;s a quiet negotiation by defaults: Publishers can do as much as readers accept. But, when readers introduce resistance in the form of using ad-blockers, they can impose a cost to publishers who get carried away.</p>\n<p>As I wrote before, web pages are <em>guests</em> on our computers. Most users have been very tolerant of these guests&#39; behavior. Tolerant to the point where a publisher could take for granted or even feel entitled to the bandwidth and hardware we pay for. But, it&#39;s entirely possible for this negotiation to turn sour, <a href=\"http://fredrikdeboer.com/2015/04/27/the-supervillains-guide-to-saving-the-internet/\">forcing the industry to come up with a new deal</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"if-its-not-the-web-its-not-the-web\">If it&#39;s not the web, it&#39;s not the web</h2>\n<p>There&#39;s a new iPhone ad out there - &quot;<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iphone/why-theres-iphone/\">If it&#39;s not an iPhone, it&#39;s not an iPhone</a>&quot;.</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe class=\"lazyload\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wl3PlrPq8sw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<p>This is one of the things the narrator says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The hardware part makes the most of the software part, and the software part makes the most of the hardware part. When you design the whole phone, all the parts work together as one amazing part.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is obviously true, and the iPhone is a great product. You can curate a smooth and &quot;magical&quot; experience, when you own a platform from bottom to top. But, the cost is that makers have less power and users have less leverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"theres-only-one-app-store\">There&#39;s only one App Store</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/connor-macleod/4005-47561/\"><img class=\"lazyload inset right\" data-src=\"/uploads/2015/web-awesome/connor-macleod.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>As gatekeepers running the one and only App Store, Apple can demand a cut of all money that flows to makers. <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\">Apple also lists a lot of requirements</a>. Some are great ideas for users, while some serve to reinforce Apple&#39;s control over its platform.</p>\n<!-- more to say about makers? -->\n\n<p>As a user, you can somewhat customize your iPhone by the apps you install. As of iOS 8, there are also <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/06/explaining-ios-8s-extensions-opening-the-platform-while-keeping-it-secure/\">App Extensions</a> that allow you to add selected bits of new functionality to existing apps.</p>\n<p>But, there are limits: For instance, did you know that despite there being many apps that let you browse the web, <a href=\"http://www.howtogeek.com/184283/why-third-party-browsers-will-always-be-inferior-to-safari-on-iphone-and-ipad/\">there&#39;s really only one web engine</a> on iOS? (&quot;<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\">2.17 Apps that browse the web must use the iOS WebKit framework and WebKit Javascript</a>&quot;)</p>\n<h3 id=\"leverage-constrained\">Leverage constrained</h3>\n<p>Luckily, users of iOS 9 will soon benefit from <a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/06/15/inside-app-extensions-webkit-content-blockers-extend-user-privacy-in-ios-9-safari-9\">Content Blocker App Extensions</a> in Safari. These an improvement on filter lists for <a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/\">AdBlock Plus</a>: The extensions consist of JSON files containing patterns &amp; rules used to block requests and selectively remove content from pages.</p>\n<p>Outside of Safari and the constrained world of App Extensions, though, users don&#39;t have much leverage over what apps makers do. If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t install it. There&#39;s no view source or built-in developer tools, so even power users mainly rely on Apple to monitor apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"black-boxes-all-the-way-down\">Black boxes all the way down</h3>\n<p>There&#39;s also the matter of apps being their own mini-silos. They don&#39;t have the spontaneous linkability of the web. Sure, <a href=\"http://applinks.org/\">some efforts have been made</a> with regard to that, but it&#39;s kind of an awkward bolt-on rather than something inherent to the fabric of it all.</p>\n<p>On top of linkability, the web also offers <em>composability</em>. That is, you can embed resources and scripts from other sites. For example, there was a YouTube video just a few paragraphs ago and there&#39;s a Disqus-driven comment section at the end of this post.</p>\n<p>Or, check out this tweet:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Current cat status: Cheddars and Catsby Cheddarsson <a href=\"http://t.co/9y9Q2uDwxb\">pic.twitter.com/9y9Q2uDwxb</a></p>&mdash; Les Orchard (@lmorchard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/628683951629029376\">August 4, 2015</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p>Or, hey, want to try a game of Oregon Trail?</p>\n<iframe class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://archive.org/embed/msdos_Oregon_Trail_Deluxe_The_1992\" width=\"560\" height=\"384\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>In an app, it&#39;s hard to mix content from totally different sites together like this. At least, not without a lot of preparation at the top or just punting off to an embedded web browser. Me, I didn&#39;t write any of the code to make a tweet or an MS-DOS emulator work on this page.</p>\n<h3 id=\"you-cant-take-it-with-you\">You can&#39;t take it with you</h3>\n<p>As something that affects a normal busy person, this is the strongest argument I have against apps in Apple&#39;s ecosystem: If you don&#39;t like any part of it, your only move is not to play.</p>\n<p>Like the ad says, the hardware part and the software part are inseparable. But, if you ever decide to leave once you&#39;ve been inside, you leave behind what you bought while you were there. This is why I&#39;ve owned iPods, but never an iPhone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-web-is-learning-from-apps\">The web is learning from apps</h2>\n<p>Even after writing that last section, though, I&#39;m hard pressed to make a case against apps. Apps solve a lot of problems we&#39;ve had on the web. Installation versus a temporary visit can make things work better. User interfaces tend to be simpler &amp; more focused - something which Apple in particular is inclined to enforce &amp; curate. Monetization is better - there aren&#39;t as many trackers &amp; ads.</p>\n<p>Most of the problems apps solve <em>can</em> be solved on the web. Some of them are technological, but some of them are more a matter of perspective and assumptions.</p>\n<div class=\"pullquote right\">\nMost of the problems apps solve **can be solved on the web**.\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"permanence--integration\">Permanence &amp; Integration</h3>\n<p>If this page was an app, you might install it. But, that&#39;s an explicit up front commitment. And you have to remember to uninstall it later. What if web pages could do that implicitly and <a href=\"https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/\">maybe even ask nicely - <em>after a few visits</em> - if you&#39;d like to make the relationship more explicit by pinning it to your home screen</a>?</p>\n<p>We have technologies on the horizon like <a href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/\">Service Workers</a> and <a href=\"https://brendaneich.com/2015/06/from-asm-js-to-webassembly/\">WebAssembly</a> that can make web pages more persistent and efficient by downloading optimized content &amp; code and making it available offline. Web pages can ask for expanded access to your device through <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI\">WebAPIs</a>. This includes things like <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/increasing-engagement-with-app-install-banners-in-chrome-for-android?hl=en\">an icon on your home screen</a>, running in the background, and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API/Using_the_Notifications_API\">displaying notifications</a>.</p>\n<p>In other words, we&#39;re very close to a state where web pages can have benefits of installed native apps while retaining the maker power and user leverage of the open web.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-web-deserves-a-cleaner-slate\">The web deserves a cleaner slate</h3>\n<p>Lots of developers are after a <a href=\"http://jankfree.org/\">jank free</a>, <a href=\"http://engineering.flipboard.com/2015/02/mobile-web/\">60 frames-per-second</a> experience. That&#39;s where many native apps can shine and it&#39;s great. I think the mobile web is entirely capable of it. We&#39;ve got <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_transitions\">hardware-accelerated CSS transitions</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes\">flexbox</a> to help with fast, flexible user interfaces. We&#39;ve got <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers\">Web Workers</a> to shove work off onto separate threads to help keep things smooth.</p>\n<div class=\"pullquote\">\nWhen you're making an app, most of the time you're forced to **start fresh and work within app constraints**.\n</div>\n\n<p>I think a helpful thing is start with a <a href=\"https://codemyviews.com/blog/mobilefirst\">clean mobile-first slate</a>. Maybe more important than the <em>mobile</em> is the <strong>clean slate</strong>:</p>\n<p>It&#39;s easy to start with a years&#39; old web site and just slap a few extra styles &amp; scripts on. When you&#39;re making an app, most of the time you&#39;re <em>forced</em> to start fresh and work within app constraints. I think that&#39;s a huge advantage for the experience that I haven&#39;t seen a lot of folks talk about.</p>\n<p>Hell, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript\">make a fresh effort to see what&#39;s out there</a>. Skip the crowd of JS frameworks for a bit. Take a look at <a href=\"http://vanilla-js.com/\">Vanilla JS</a>. You might be surprised at how much you can get done these days without even jQuery onboard.</p>\n<p>Accept cutting off or (ideally) shipping a reduced experience to older browsers, and you might be surprised what you can make happen on modern browsers. Even better, get your <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement\">progressive enhancement</a> game on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"monetization-is-hard-without-a-gatekeeper\">Monetization is hard without a gatekeeper</h3>\n<p>As for monetization, well, that&#39;s a can of worms. More persistent web pages <em>will</em> help solve <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2015/07/22/the-verge-web-sucks/\">the problem of the continually re-downloaded 7MB of JavaScript tracking you and showing ads</a>. But, if that stuff causes less of a drag, will we really care quite as much?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1MTayLa\"><img class=\"lazyload inset right\" data-src=\"/uploads/2015/web-awesome/who-owns-the-future.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Maybe not. If performance &amp; surveillance concerns are decoupled, we might not notice a problem. I mean, native apps <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics/mobile/\">track</a> <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-analytics/\">us</a> <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/products/analytics/\">too</a>, and we don&#39;t seem to care. Though, I suppose the siloed nature of apps might make it a little harder to follow you everywhere you go. (I wouldn&#39;t count on that, though.)</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t really have great ideas, here. I pay for some stuff, I don&#39;t pay for some other stuff. I&#39;m honestly not 100% against ads, though I think we could use fewer of them.</p>\n<p>Without an App Store as a gateway, though, the same old revenue problems persist. And still, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain&#39;t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch\">there ain&#39;t no such thing as a free lunch</a>. In fact, folks like <a href=\"http://transcopyright.org/hcoinRemarks-D28.html\">Ted Nelson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/05/jaron-lanier-wants-to-build-a-new-middle-class-on-micropayments/\">Jaron Lanier</a> have been saying for years (and decades) that the free-of-charge web is failing itself and all of us. Maybe we need a web with more robust two-way links that track provenance and distribute wealth.</p>\n<p>(For what it&#39;s worth, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/11/11/ooocba/\">I made fun of Ted Nelson &amp; Xanadu</a> once upon a time.

    "body": "<nav role=\"navigation\" class=\"table-of-contents\"></nav>\n\nTL;DR: The open web is a beautiful thing that empowers makers while offering users leverage. There's nothing else like it. It's constantly improving. It's up to you what you do with it.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## The beauty of the open web\n\nSo, here I am again, channelling my easily excited self from 1993: Man, I love the web.\n\nIt's easy to take this thing for granted, but take a step back and consider it: You've got this thing called a [browser][]. It acts as an [Agent][] on your behalf, reaching out to computers on the Internet and requesting resources identified via [Universal Resource Locators][url]. Looking among these resources, you'd find [hypertext][], [style sheets][], and [multimedia][].\n\n[url]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator\n[browser]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser\n[agent]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent\n[hypertext]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext\n[style sheets]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_(web_development)\n[multimedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia\n\n<div class=\"pullquote\">\nSo, here I am again, channelling my easily excited self from 1993: **Man, I love the web.**\n</div>\n\nYour browser comes with code that knows what to do with common types of content. But, browsers can't anticipate every invention. So, one of the supported resource content types is [JavaScript][]. This is a *meta content type*. That is, it offers the ability to augment existing content types and support completely new ones.\n\n[javascript]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\n\nChew on *that* awhile: Not satisfied to be just a networked document viewer with a frozen set of features, browsers ship with a [toolchain][] for running code on demand. Kind of scary, but it works way better than any reasonable person should expect.\n\n[toolchain]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain\n\nAnd again, thanks to the Internet, these resources can each come literally from anywhere<!-- ([even Sweden][cern]!) -->, hosted by any person or company or organization. Your browser chases URL references and collects all these disparate resources automatically. It assembles them into what is basically a zero-installation software application that's temporarily resident on your computer.\n\n[cern]: http://home.web.cern.ch/\n\nWe call these insane things \"web pages\". Their negotiated & ephemeral hold on our computers is why we say we only \"visit\" them. In fact, it might be more accurate to say web pages are guests we host on our computers for a short time.\n\n<!--\nSo, yeah, I'm crazy about the web. Crazy enough to work for Mozilla and turn down every other job offer over the years because the mission aligns so well with so many of my favorite things.\n-->\n\n[gopher]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)\n[zen]: https://www.cs.indiana.edu/docproject/zen/zen-1.0_toc.html\n\n[newlydigital]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2003/06/13/newly-digital/\n\n## Makers have power\n\nThere is no other successful system like this on the planet. No other system for delivering content and software that is this open and free of gatekeepers deciding what we can publish. There's no app store, no review process, no adult supervision. You can make the most amazing or terrible things. Short of legal action or government intervention, no one can really stop you as long as you're paying the hosting bill.\n\n### Build your own whatever\n\nIn fact, even though I wrote that browsers are agents acting on their users' behalf - they're historically weak advocates by default. In other words, browsers do what web pages ask, with a few exceptions for safety and security. Today's open web offers the balance of control largely to publishers.\n\n<div class=\"image-group\">\n[<img class=\"lazyload inset left\" data-src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/im-surrounded.png\">][theverge]\n[<img class=\"lazyload inset right\" data-src=\"/uploads/2015/web-awesome/oregon-trail.png\">][jsmess]\n</div>\n\nNo one will stop you from [building a magazine site loaded with spyware and ads][theverge].\n\nOf course, you can also [emulate old computers to make running classic software linkable and embeddable][jsmess].\n\n<div class=\"image-group\">\n[<img class=\"inset left\" id=\"thumbnail\" src=\"/uploads/2015/web-awesome/troxel.png\">][troxel]\n[<img class=\"lazyload inset right\" data-src=\"/uploads/2015/web-awesome/blogger.jpeg\">][iranjail]\n</div>\n\nOr you can [create new hats and weapons for an MMO][trovecreations], sharing your work [as a link to a live 3D modeling tool][troxel].\n\nOr you can write [a blog that lands you in an Iranian jail][iranjail] for political speech.\n\nOr you can craft [a gorgeous existential narrative about luminous beings][enough].\n\n[<img src=\"/uploads/2015/web-awesome/enough.png\" style=\"display: block;

For example, [this blog lives mostly on Amazon S3][s3blog]. My [last post][theverge] got around 55,000 unique views so far - the most attention I've gotten in years. It looks like that's going to cost me about $6 by the end of the month. I could have probably cut that in half if I'd been smarter about things.\n\n[s3blog]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/20/static-blog-generation-with-gulp/\n\nTo put this in my old-person perspective: Someone once told me it was $1 or $5 to photocopy & mail a single issue of a [zine][]. Bump that up to $5-10 for a CD-ROM or DVD in a nice padded envelope. Holy crap. I couldn't even imagine funding a passion project centered around media like that and reaching 55,000 people across the planet.\n\n[zine]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine\n\n## Users have leverage\n\nI know I just wrote that the balance of control on the web leans mainly toward the publishers. But, users on the web *do* have leverage when they care to assert themselves.\n\n<div class=\"pullquote right\">\nWith this choice in personalized user agents, **the relationship between reader and publisher must be negotiated**.\n</div>\n\n### Browser choice\n\nFirst off, you have a choice in browsers. The browser market is pretty healthy right now. Once upon a time, [Microsoft Internet Explorer held 96% of the market][msie96]. Today, we've got [at least half-a-dozen browsers][browserstoday] with almost as many rendering engines under their hoods.\n\nThis diversity in browsers is important, and switching cost is low on a web with shared standards. You can vote with your feet and try another browser at any time. This also hinders any single company from injecting their own proprietary features into the web and setting up tollbooths.\n\n[msie96]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#First_browser_war\n[browserstoday]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#Second_browser_war\n\n### Add-ons and extensions\n\nYour choice in browsers includes some that can be customized with [add-ons][] and [extensions][]. This is where a browser can really shine as a personalized [User Agent][].\n\n[<img class=\"lazyload inset left wide\" data-src=\"/uploads/2015/web-awesome/adblock.png\">][about-adblock]\n\n[about-adblock]: https://adblockplus.org/en/about\n\nInstall [Adblock Plus][], and you can deflect most attempts to track you & display ads.\n\nInstall [Readability][], and you can get a cleaner view of articles you'd like to read.\n\nInstall [Library Extension][] and your browser will automatically tell you when a book is available at your local library while you're shopping on Amazon.\n\nYou can even craft your own tweaks, if you're so inclined. In a spirit similar to the web itself, the tech to build these things is generally available to anyone.\n\nPublishers on the web sometimes deride these tweaks. It's understandable: The most popular ones have long been centered around refusing to accept many of the annoyances that also happen to fund the web.\n\n### The web is a negotiation\n\nWith this choice in personalized user agents, the relationship between reader and publisher must be *negotiated*. Mostly, it's a quiet negotiation by defaults: Publishers can do as much as readers accept. But, when readers introduce resistance in the form of using ad-blockers, they can impose a cost to publishers who get carried away.\n\nAs I wrote before, web pages are *guests* on our computers. Most users have been very tolerant of these guests' behavior. Tolerant to the point where a publisher could take for granted or even feel entitled to the bandwidth and hardware we pay for. But, it's entirely possible for this negotiation to turn sour, [forcing the industry to come up with a new deal][savingtheinternet].\n\n[savingtheinternet]: http://fredrikdeboer.com/2015/04/27/the-supervillains-guide-to-saving-the-internet/\n[library extension]: https://www.libraryextension.com/\n[extensions]: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions\n[add-ons]: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/\n[readability]: https://www.readability.com/\n[adblock plus]: https://adblockplus.org/\n[User Agent]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent\n\n## If it's not the web, it's not the web\n\nThere's a new iPhone ad out there - \"[If it's not an iPhone, it's not an iPhone][iphonead]\".\n\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe class=\"lazyload\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wl3PlrPq8sw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nThis is one of the things the narrator says:\n\n> The hardware part makes the most of the software part, and the software part makes the most of the hardware part. When you design the whole phone, all the parts work together as one amazing part.\n\nThis is obviously true, and the iPhone is a great product. You can curate a smooth and \"magical\" experience, when you own a platform from bottom to top. But, the cost is that makers have less power and users have less leverage.\n\n### There's only one App Store\n\n[<img class=\"lazyload inset right\" data-src=\"/uploads/2015/web-awesome/connor-macleod.jpg\">][connor-macleod]\n\n[connor-macleod]: http://www.comicvine.com/connor-macleod/4005-47561/\n\nAs gatekeepers running the one and only App Store, Apple can demand a cut of all money that flows to makers. [Apple also lists a lot of requirements][appguidelines]. Some are great ideas for users, while some serve to reinforce Apple's control over its platform.\n\n<!-- more to say about makers? -->\n\nAs a user, you can somewhat customize your iPhone by the apps you install. As of iOS 8, there are also [App Extensions][appextensions] that allow you to add selected bits of new functionality to existing apps.\n\nBut, there are limits: For instance, did you know that despite there being many apps that let you browse the web, [there's really only one web engine][onebrowser] on iOS? (\"[2.17 Apps that browse the web must use the iOS WebKit framework and WebKit Javascript][appguidelines]\")\n\n### Leverage constrained\n\nLuckily, users of iOS 9 will soon benefit from [Content Blocker App Extensions][contentblocksafari] in Safari. These an improvement on filter lists for [AdBlock Plus][]: The extensions consist of JSON files containing patterns & rules used to block requests and selectively remove content from pages.\n\nOutside of Safari and the constrained world of App Extensions, though, users don't have much leverage over what apps makers do. If you don't like it, don't install it. There's no view source or built-in developer tools, so even power users mainly rely on Apple to monitor apps.\n\n[appextensions]: http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/06/explaining-ios-8s-extensions-opening-the-platform-while-keeping-it-secure/\n\n[contentblocksafari]: http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/06/15/inside-app-extensions-webkit-content-blockers-extend-user-privacy-in-ios-9-safari-9\n[onebrowser]: http://www.howtogeek.com/184283/why-third-party-browsers-will-always-be-inferior-to-safari-on-iphone-and-ipad/\n[appguidelines]: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\n[iphonead]: https://www.apple.com/iphone/why-theres-iphone/\n\n### Black boxes all the way down\n\nThere's also the matter of apps being their own mini-silos. They don't have the spontaneous linkability of the web. Sure, [some efforts have been made][applinks] with regard to that, but it's kind of an awkward bolt-on rather than something inherent to the fabric of it all.\n\nOn top of linkability, the web also offers *composability*. That is, you can embed resources and scripts from other sites. For example, there was a YouTube video just a few paragraphs ago and there's a Disqus-driven comment section at the end of this post.\n\nOr, check out this tweet:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Current cat status: Cheddars and Catsby Cheddarsson <a href=\"http://t.co/9y9Q2uDwxb\">pic.twitter.com/9y9Q2uDwxb</a></p>&mdash; Les Orchard (@lmorchard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/628683951629029376\">August 4, 2015</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nOr, hey, want to try a game of Oregon Trail?\n\n<iframe class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://archive.org/embed/msdos_Oregon_Trail_Deluxe_The_1992\" width=\"560\" height=\"384\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIn an app, it's hard to mix content from totally different sites together like this. At least, not without a lot of preparation at the top or just punting off to an embedded web browser. Me, I didn't write any of the code to make a tweet or an MS-DOS emulator work on this page.\n\n### You can't take it with you\n\nAs something that affects a normal busy person, this is the strongest argument I have against apps in Apple's ecosystem: If you don't like any part of it, your only move is not to play.\n\nLike the ad says, the hardware part and the software part are inseparable. But, if you ever decide to leave once you've been inside, you leave behind what you bought while you were there. This is why I've owned iPods, but never an iPhone.\n\n[applinks]: http://applinks.org/\n\n## The web is learning from apps\n\nEven after writing that last section, though, I'm hard pressed to make a case against apps. Apps solve a lot of problems we've had on the web. Installation versus a temporary visit can make things work better. User interfaces tend to be simpler & more focused - something which Apple in particular is inclined to enforce & curate. Monetization is better - there aren't as many trackers & ads.\n\nMost of the problems apps solve *can* be solved on the web. Some of them are technological, but some of them are more a matter of perspective and assumptions.\n\n<div class=\"pullquote right\">\nMost of the problems apps solve **can be solved on the web**.\n</div>\n\n### Permanence & Integration\n\nIf this page was an app, you might install it. But, that's an explicit up front commitment. And you have to remember to uninstall it later. What if web pages could do that implicitly and [maybe even ask nicely - *after a few visits* - if you'd like to make the relationship more explicit by pinning it to your home screen][progressiveapps]?\n\nWe have technologies on the horizon like [Service Workers][] and [WebAssembly][] that can make web pages more persistent and efficient by downloading optimized content & code and making it available offline. Web pages can ask for expanded access to your device through [WebAPIs][]. This includes things like [an icon on your home screen][installbanners], running in the background, and [displaying notifications][notifications].\n\nIn other words, we're very close to a state where web pages can have benefits of installed native apps while retaining the maker power and user leverage of the open web.\n\n[notifications]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API/Using_the_Notifications_API\n[installbanners]: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/increasing-engagement-with-app-install-banners-in-chrome-for-android?hl=en\n[webapis]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI\n[webassembly]: https://brendaneich.com/2015/06/from-asm-js-to-webassembly/\n[service workers]: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/\n[progressiveapps]: https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/\n\n### The web deserves a cleaner slate\n\nLots of developers are after a [jank free][], [60 frames-per-second][60fps] experience. That's where many native apps can shine and it's great. I think the mobile web is entirely capable of it. We've got [hardware-accelerated CSS transitions][csstransitions] and [flexbox][] to help with fast, flexible user interfaces. We've got [Web Workers][] to shove work off onto separate threads to help keep things smooth.\n\n[Web Workers]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers\n[flexbox]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes\n[csstransitions]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_transitions\n\n<div class=\"pullquote\">\nWhen you're making an app, most of the time you're forced to **start fresh and work within app constraints**.\n</div>\n\nI think a helpful thing is start with a [clean mobile-first slate][mobilefirst]. Maybe more important than the *mobile* is the **clean slate**:\n\nIt's easy to start with a years' old web site and just slap a few extra styles & scripts on. When you're making an app, most of the time you're *forced* to start fresh and work within app constraints. I think that's a huge advantage for the experience that I haven't seen a lot of folks talk about.\n\n[mobilefirst]: https://codemyviews.com/blog/mobilefirst\n[jank free]: http://jankfree.org/\n[60fps]: http://engineering.flipboard.com/2015/02/mobile-web/\n\nHell, [make a fresh effort to see what's out there][mdnjs]. Skip the crowd of JS frameworks for a bit. Take a look at [Vanilla JS][vanilla]. You might be surprised at how much you can get done these days without even jQuery onboard.\n\nAccept cutting off or (ideally) shipping a reduced experience to older browsers, and you might be surprised what you can make happen on modern browsers.

More persistent web pages *will* help solve [the problem of the continually re-downloaded 7MB of JavaScript tracking you and showing ads][theverge]. But, if that stuff causes less of a drag, will we really care quite as much?\n\n[<img class=\"lazyload inset right\" data-src=\"/uploads/2015/web-awesome/who-owns-the-future.jpg\">][who-owns-the-future]\n\n[who-owns-the-future]: http://amzn.to/1MTayLa\n\nMaybe not. If performance & surveillance concerns are decoupled, we might not notice a problem. I mean, native apps [track][track1] [us][track2] [too][track3], and we don't seem to care. Though, I suppose the siloed nature of apps might make it a little harder to follow you everywhere you go. (I wouldn't count on that, though.)\n\nI don't really have great ideas, here. I pay for some stuff, I don't pay for some other stuff. I'm honestly not 100% against ads, though I think we could use fewer of them.\n\n[track1]: http://www.google.com/analytics/mobile/\n[track2]: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-analytics/\n[track3]: https://developers.facebook.com/products/analytics/\n\nWithout an App Store as a gateway, though, the same old revenue problems persist. And still, [there ain't no such thing as a free lunch][tanstaafl]. In fact, folks like [Ted Nelson][micro-liberation] and [Jaron Lanier][free-info] have been saying for years (and decades) that the free-of-charge web is failing itself and all of us. Maybe we need a web with more robust two-way links that track provenance and distribute wealth.\n\n(For what it's worth, [I made fun of Ted Nelson & Xanadu][xanadu-fun] once upon a time.

To try to capture what about it has captured me for the bulk of my career so far. Oh, and maybe to say a few things about now and future challenges. I've got a few ideas, but certainly not all the answers.\n\nI think things look bright, despite [many](http://www.wired.com/2010/08/ff_webrip/) [exaggerated](http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/02/web-dead/) [attempts](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-web-is-dying-apps-are-killing-it-1416169934) [to declare](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-mobile-web-is-dead-its-all-about-apps-2014-4) [the web's demise](http://christianheilmann.com/2014/05/10/tedx-thessaloniki-the-web-is-dead/). Most of the issues with the web stem from what we do with it, not necessarily from what it can (or can't) do. The creative constraints and curation of app ecosystems have forced us to build better mobile experiences, and we've expanded the capabilities of the web in response.\n\nMy hope is that we can take fresh looks at the web and revisit its unique capabilities. There's a ton of value in the [secure, linkable, indexable, composable, and ephemeral][slice] facets of the open web that closed app silos just can't match.\n\n[slice]: https://paul.kinlan.me/slice-the-web/\n",

It&#39;s a gorgeous site and the content is great.</p>\n<p>They&#39;ve done some amazing things with longform articles like &quot;<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8809723/jerry-seinfeld-tv-show-international-translation\">What&#39;s the deal with translating Seinfeld</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/2/8285139/max-headroom-oral-history-80s-cyberpunk-interview\">Max Headroom: the definitive history of the 1980s digital icon</a>&quot;, and the daily news output is high quality.</p>\n<p>But, I have to say, reading <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reckless/\">Nilay Patel</a>&#39;s &quot;<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002721/the-mobile-web-sucks\">The Mobile Web Sucks</a>&quot; felt like getting pelted by rocks thrown <a href=\"http://product.voxmedia.com/2015/5/6/8561867/declaring-performance-bankruptcy\">from a bright, shiny glass house</a>.</p>\n<p>Calling out browser makers for the performance of sites like his? That&#39;s a bit much.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s my thing: I&#39;ve never had an iPhone. I&#39;ve had Palm webOS phones, a parade of Android devices, and now <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/news/mozilla-overhauls-firefox-smartphone-plan-to-focus-on-quality-not-cost/\">an experimental Boot2Gecko phone on really nice hardware</a>. Some sites have long been a delight on whatever gadget I fetch from my pocket. Others, I&#39;ve watched decay over the years as their mobile web experiences are neglected in favor of those frantically promoted apps.</p>\n<p>The Verge isn&#39;t quite either of those. And, for me as a fan, it&#39;s frustrating.</p>\n<h2 id=\"time-to-open-the-dev-tools\">Time to open the Dev Tools</h2>\n<p>A page view on The Verge is a heavy load. I&#39;ve known this for awhile, but it wasn&#39;t until now that I decided to take a peek at what might be wriggling under this log.</p>\n<p>So, I opened up the Dev Tools in Firefox and gave the page a reload on a cleared cache.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/the-verge-html-size.png\" class=\"fullwidth\"\n  alt=\"HTML size on the article\"/></p>\n<p>That&#39;s fine - 75kb of HTML for the article. But, I also expect there&#39;ll be a font or two and a raft of images.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/more-resources.png\" class=\"fullwidth\"\n  alt=\"Loading more resources...\" /></p>\n<p>We&#39;re up to 20 requests and 1.4MB over ~7 seconds. That&#39;s on the upper end of what I&#39;d advise, but it&#39;s not terrible. I said that The Verge is a gorgeous site - that takes some resources. Hell, this very blog post is going to be bigger than I&#39;d like thanks to the Twitters &amp; Googles &amp; Disqus, and it&#39;s no visual delight either.</p>\n<p>Oh, but wait, it&#39;s not done loading yet. I&#39;m starting to read &amp; scroll, but my browser&#39;s still spinning. I wonder what the final stats will be?</p>\n<h2 id=\"ow-my-data-plan\">Ow, my data plan!</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/the-verge-final-load-stats.png\"\n  class=\"fullwidth\" alt=\"It finally stopped loading\" /></p>\n<p>Holy crap. It took over 30 seconds. In the end, it fetched over 9.5MB across 263 HTTP requests. That&#39;s almost an order of magnitude more data &amp; time than needed for the article itself.</p>\n<p>What the hell is all this stuff?</p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/resource-breakdown.png\"\n  class=\"fullwidth\" alt=\"It finally stopped loading\" /></p>\n<p>Wow. Devtools performed a second reload of the page to get an overall performance analysis. This time it downloaded 12MB - a little over 7MB in that is JavaScript!</p>\n<p>Just to put this in some rough perspective: Assuming I had a 1GB / month data plan, I could visit sites like The Verge about 3 times per day before I hit my cap. If I&#39;m lucky, some or most of this will get cached between requests so it won&#39;t be <em>quite</em> that bad. In fact, another report tells me that a primed cache yields 8MB transferred - so maybe 4 visits per day.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s assuming caches on mobile are comparable to my laptop, <a href=\"http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2012/07/12/early-findings-mobile-browser-cache-persistence-and-behaviour/\">which is not a safe assumption</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, this isn&#39;t one of the cool longform articles on The Verge with interactive features and whatnot. This is just a straightforward 1600 word rant with a few quotes &amp; images. Oh, and one video. Not entirely different than this blog post.</p>\n<p>What in the world is all this code <em>doing</em>?</p>\n<h2 id=\"shining-a-lightbeam-under-the-log\">Shining a Lightbeam under the log</h2>\n<p>Hmm, I think I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reckless/status/623234268152598528\">Nilay Patel tweeted a hint</a>:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/satefan\">@satefan</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/verge\">@verge</a> part of the content we deliver is advertising! :)</p>&mdash; nilay patel (@reckless) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reckless/status/623234268152598528\">July 20, 2015</a></blockquote>\n\n<p>Man, I&#39;d hazard a guess that <em>most</em> of what you just delivered was advertising. That, and spyware.</p>\n<p>In one of the <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/WeeklyUpdates\">public Monday update calls at Mozilla</a> I heard about this project called <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/lightbeam/\">Lightbeam</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Lightbeam is a Firefox add-on that uses interactive visualizations to show you the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web.</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, I figured I&#39;d let it take a look at The Verge. This is what it showed:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/im-surrounded.png\"\n  class=\"fullwidth\" id=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"I'm surrounded\" /></p>\n<p>Imagine this is an iceberg as viewed from above. The Verge is the tip above water, the big circle in the middle. The triangles dancing around it are third-party sites lurking under the surface. Lightbeam has a list view, so I switched to get a closer look:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/lightbeam-listview.png\"\n  class=\"fullwidth\" alt=\"Lightbeam list view\" /></p>\n<p>Sweet Jeebus. &quot;You have visited <strong>1 SITE</strong>. You have connected with <strong>47 THIRD PARTY SITES.</strong>&quot;</p>\n<h2 id=\"22-flavors-of-spyware\">22 flavors of spyware</h2>\n<p>Now, to be fair, scrolling through the report I could see that some of these distinct &quot;sites&quot; are clearly alternate domains owned by the same organization. That said, I still found <em>over 20 different companies</em> before I got tired of digging:</p>\n<!-- mosaic here? -->\n\n<ul> <!-- class=\"columns clearfix\"> -->\n<li><a href=\"http://googleadservices.com\">Google</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://advertising.amazon.com/\">Amazon</a> - \"Reach millions of customers who find, discover, and buy at Amazon\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://skimresources.com\">skimresources.com</a> - \"When links in publishers’ content lead their users to click through and buy from an online retailer, we make sure they’re rewarded!\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://sonobi.com\">sonobi.com</a> - \"Sonobi’s suite of buy and sell-side tools allow our customers to identify, deliver, and manage advertising opportunities through performance filters once absent from programmatic channels\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://umbel.com\">umbel.com</a> - \"Umbel helps you securely collect first-party customer data and combine all of your existing data from multiple sources to give you a complete view of your customers.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.krux.com/\">krux.com</a> - \"Krux helps businesses drive revenue by delivering smarter content, commerce and marketing experiences to people.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://mathtag.com\">mediamath.com</a> - \"MediaMath’s TerminalOne™ platform activates data, automates execution, and optimizes advertising interactions across addressable media—delivering greater performance, transparency, and control to marketers and a better experience to consumers.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://adnxs.com\">adnxs.com</a> - \"Adnxs™ is a portal for Publishers to the AppNexus® online auction exchange used to sell advertising space.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bidswitch.net\">bidswitch.net</a> - \"BidSwitch provides immediate and seamless real-time access for Supply and Demand Partners across all media types (display, mobile, video, native, etc.).\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://scorecardresearch.com\">scorecardresearch.com</a> - \"ScorecardResearch, a service of Full Circle Studies, Inc., is part of the comScore, Inc. market research community, a leading global market research effort that studies and reports on Internet trends and behavior.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://kargo.com\">kargo.com</a> - \"Kargo weaves our content and ad technology into our premium publishers’ mobile and tablet properties, offering advertisers the best brand experiences.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://quantserve.com\">quantcast.com</a> - \"Understand your audience.

Seriously, could you folks just not pick one or two or ten? Did you hit every booth and say &quot;Yeah, cool, sign us up!&quot; I feel thoroughly spindled &amp; folded &amp; researched, here.</p>\n<p>As a webdev at Mozilla, I&#39;ve been in hour-long meetings where we&#39;ve agonized over whether it&#39;s copacetic to include <em>just one little Google Analytics snippet</em> without notifying users and updating the privacy policy. But, I know we&#39;re crazy in our own very special ways.</p>\n<p>In former lives, I&#39;ve worked at ad agencies and digital marketing companies. I&#39;m no stranger to conversations that revolve around partners &amp; bizdev &amp; analytics &amp; media buys. I can only imagine things have intensified &amp; evolved since I&#39;ve been out of those trenches.</p>\n<p>Still - and maybe this is the Mozilla brain-damage talking - I can&#39;t imagine a sane conversation that resulted in The Verge extending an invitation to over 20 companies to set up shop on my computer with every page visit. I can only imagine this as a steady drip-drop of bizdev decisions and emails to internal webdevs:</p>\n<p>*&quot;Hey, can you add this tracking pixel? These guys do realtime attention heatmapping and it&#39;s brilliant!&quot;*</p>\n<p>*&quot;Paste this snippet into the global template, please? This fourth programmatic ad platform is really going to fill in the gaps for the other three.&quot;*</p>\n<p>*&quot;One more script thing here. We need to capture the affiliate credit for all these links going out to e-commerce sites.*&quot;</p>\n<p>*&quot;Oh hey, we&#39;re going to need this new script to manage the dozen ad platforms we use now.&quot;*</p>\n<p>I&#39;m guessing no one along the way had the power or motivation to say no. I mean, really, what&#39;s the cost in tossing one more straw onto that camel&#39;s back? I know I never looked or complained until now, and I doubt the majority of readers will ever bother.</p>\n<p>We all just kind of get this growing sense of malaise about &quot;the web&quot; as a gestalt of our favorite sites as they get suckier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-make-the-web-suck\">How to make the web suck</h2>\n<p>So, I haven&#39;t taken the time to dig into the source code of those companies&#39; specific contributions to the article. There are only so many hours in the day, and I have a ranty blog post to finish.</p>\n<p>But, if you want to talk about browser performance - mobile or desktop - don&#39;t you think that maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, some of that <strong>7 megabytes</strong> of JavaScript code might have an impact?</p>\n<p>First, even assuming this code comes from a local cache, <a href=\"http://timkadlec.com/2014/09/js-parse-and-execution-time/\">parsing it into something executable has a cost</a>. Of course, someday, we&#39;ll have <a href=\"https://brendaneich.com/2015/06/from-asm-js-to-webassembly/\">WebAssembly</a> to shift this first stage upstream into webdev build tools. But we don&#39;t have that, yet.</p>\n<p>Then, there&#39;s what that code&#39;s actually doing once it runs. There&#39;s the usual reporting on every scrap of browser fingerprint data. There&#39;s deciding whether and what ads to fetch &amp; inject. I&#39;ve seen scripts that record every pixel of mouse movement and phone home every few seconds.</p>\n<p>Some spawn lots of hidden iframes, each doing something fun. Others run code 10 times per second that trigger little invisible page re-renderings that chew up CPU and make scrolling &amp; orientation changes chug. Some scripts get run multiple times and perform duplicate work. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate.</p>\n<p>Wait, where was I?</p>\n<h2 id=\"everybodys-not-doing-it\">Everybody&#39;s (not) doing it!</h2>\n<p>I&#39;ve seen the argument that this is how the web gets funded. Everybody&#39;s doing it. This is the current state of the art. Browsers just need to suck it up &amp; make it happen.</p>\n<p>Some sites are (much) better than others, though, and it doesn&#39;t seem to be directly related to the content.

    "body": "TL;DR: Did you know that The Verge delivers you to around 20 companies for advertising & tracking purposes? I didn't. That might foul up your web experience a little bit. Maybe we should try something different.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<nav role=\"navigation\" class=\"table-of-contents\"></nav>\n\n## I love The Verge, but man...\n\nSo, I've been a big fan of The Verge, [almost since day one][verge-fan]. It's a gorgeous site and the content is great.\n\nThey've done some amazing things with longform articles like \"[What's the deal with translating Seinfeld][translating-seinfeld]\" and \"[Max Headroom: the definitive history of the 1980s digital icon][max-headroom]\", and the daily news output is high quality.\n\nBut, I have to say, reading [Nilay Patel][]'s \"[The Mobile Web Sucks][mobile-web-sucks]\" felt like getting pelted by rocks thrown [from a bright, shiny glass house][performance-bankruptcy].\n\n[nilay patel]: https://twitter.com/reckless/\n\nCalling out browser makers for the performance of sites like his? That's a bit much.\n\nHere's my thing: I've never had an iPhone. I've had Palm webOS phones, a parade of Android devices, and now [an experimental Boot2Gecko phone on really nice hardware][mozilla-ignite]. Some sites have long been a delight on whatever gadget I fetch from my pocket. Others, I've watched decay over the years as their mobile web experiences are neglected in favor of those frantically promoted apps.\n\n[mozilla-ignite]: http://www.cnet.com/news/mozilla-overhauls-firefox-smartphone-plan-to-focus-on-quality-not-cost/\n\nThe Verge isn't quite either of those. And, for me as a fan, it's frustrating.\n\n## Time to open the Dev Tools\n\nA page view on The Verge is a heavy load. I've known this for awhile, but it wasn't until now that I decided to take a peek at what might be wriggling under this log.\n\nSo, I opened up the Dev Tools in Firefox and gave the page a reload on a cleared cache.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/the-verge-html-size.png\" class=\"fullwidth\"\n  alt=\"HTML size on the article\"/>\n\nThat's fine - 75kb of HTML for the article. But, I also expect there'll be a font or two and a raft of images.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/more-resources.png\" class=\"fullwidth\"\n  alt=\"Loading more resources...\" />\n\nWe're up to 20 requests and 1.4MB over ~7 seconds. That's on the upper end of what I'd advise, but it's not terrible. I said that The Verge is a gorgeous site - that takes some resources. Hell, this very blog post is going to be bigger than I'd like thanks to the Twitters & Googles & Disqus, and it's no visual delight either.\n\nOh, but wait, it's not done loading yet. I'm starting to read & scroll, but my browser's still spinning. I wonder what the final stats will be?\n\n## Ow, my data plan!\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/the-verge-final-load-stats.png\"\n  class=\"fullwidth\" alt=\"It finally stopped loading\" />\n\nHoly crap. It took over 30 seconds. In the end, it fetched over 9.5MB across 263 HTTP requests. That's almost an order of magnitude more data & time than needed for the article itself.\n\nWhat the hell is all this stuff?\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/resource-breakdown.png\"\n  class=\"fullwidth\" alt=\"It finally stopped loading\" />\n\nWow. Devtools performed a second reload of the page to get an overall performance analysis. This time it downloaded 12MB - a little over 7MB in that is JavaScript!\n\nJust to put this in some rough perspective: Assuming I had a 1GB / month data plan, I could visit sites like The Verge about 3 times per day before I hit my cap. If I'm lucky, some or most of this will get cached between requests so it won't be *quite* that bad. In fact, another report tells me that a primed cache yields 8MB transferred - so maybe 4 visits per day.\n\nThat's assuming caches on mobile are comparable to my laptop, [which is not a safe assumption][mobile-caching].\n\n[mobile-caching]: http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2012/07/12/early-findings-mobile-browser-cache-persistence-and-behaviour/\n\nStill, this isn't one of the cool longform articles on The Verge with interactive features and whatnot. This is just a straightforward 1600 word rant with a few quotes & images. Oh, and one video. Not entirely different than this blog post.\n\nWhat in the world is all this code *doing*?\n\n## Shining a Lightbeam under the log\n\nHmm, I think I [Nilay Patel tweeted a hint](https://twitter.com/reckless/status/623234268152598528):\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/satefan\">@satefan</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/verge\">@verge</a> part of the content we deliver is advertising! :)</p>&mdash; nilay patel (@reckless) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reckless/status/623234268152598528\">July 20, 2015</a></blockquote>\n\nMan, I'd hazard a guess that *most* of what you just delivered was advertising. That, and spyware.\n\nIn one of the [public Monday update calls at Mozilla][weeklyupdates] I heard about this project called [Lightbeam][lightbeam]:\n\n[weeklyupdates]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/WeeklyUpdates\n\n<blockquote>Lightbeam is a Firefox add-on that uses interactive visualizations to show you the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web.</blockquote>\n\nSo, I figured I'd let it take a look at The Verge. This is what it showed:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/im-surrounded.png\"\n  class=\"fullwidth\" id=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"I'm surrounded\" />\n\nImagine this is an iceberg as viewed from above. The Verge is the tip above water, the big circle in the middle. The triangles dancing around it are third-party sites lurking under the surface. Lightbeam has a list view, so I switched to get a closer look:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/lightbeam-listview.png\"\n  class=\"fullwidth\" alt=\"Lightbeam list view\" />\n\nSweet Jeebus. \"You have visited **1 SITE**. You have connected with **47 THIRD PARTY SITES.**\"\n\n## 22 flavors of spyware\n\nNow, to be fair, scrolling through the report I could see that some of these distinct \"sites\" are clearly alternate domains owned by the same organization. That said, I still found *over 20 different companies* before I got tired of digging:\n\n<!-- mosaic here? -->\n\n<ul> <!-- class=\"columns clearfix\"> -->\n<li><a href=\"http://googleadservices.com\">Google</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://advertising.amazon.com/\">Amazon</a> - \"Reach millions of customers who find, discover, and buy at Amazon\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://skimresources.com\">skimresources.com</a> - \"When links in publishers’ content lead their users to click through and buy from an online retailer, we make sure they’re rewarded!\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://sonobi.com\">sonobi.com</a> - \"Sonobi’s suite of buy and sell-side tools allow our customers to identify, deliver, and manage advertising opportunities through performance filters once absent from programmatic channels\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://umbel.com\">umbel.com</a> - \"Umbel helps you securely collect first-party customer data and combine all of your existing data from multiple sources to give you a complete view of your customers.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.krux.com/\">krux.com</a> - \"Krux helps businesses drive revenue by delivering smarter content, commerce and marketing experiences to people.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://mathtag.com\">mediamath.com</a> - \"MediaMath’s TerminalOne™ platform activates data, automates execution, and optimizes advertising interactions across addressable media—delivering greater performance, transparency, and control to marketers and a better experience to consumers.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://adnxs.com\">adnxs.com</a> - \"Adnxs™ is a portal for Publishers to the AppNexus® online auction exchange used to sell advertising space.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bidswitch.net\">bidswitch.net</a> - \"BidSwitch provides immediate and seamless real-time access for Supply and Demand Partners across all media types (display, mobile, video, native, etc.).\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://scorecardresearch.com\">scorecardresearch.com</a> - \"ScorecardResearch, a service of Full Circle Studies, Inc., is part of the comScore, Inc. market research community, a leading global market research effort that studies and reports on Internet trends and behavior.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://kargo.com\">kargo.com</a> - \"Kargo weaves our content and ad technology into our premium publishers’ mobile and tablet properties, offering advertisers the best brand experiences.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://quantserve.com\">quantcast.com</a> - \"Understand your audience.

Seriously, could you folks just not pick one or two or ten? Did you hit every booth and say \"Yeah, cool, sign us up!\" I feel thoroughly spindled & folded & researched, here.\n\nAs a webdev at Mozilla, I've been in hour-long meetings where we've agonized over whether it's copacetic to include *just one little Google Analytics snippet* without notifying users and updating the privacy policy. But, I know we're crazy in our own very special ways.\n\nIn former lives, I've worked at ad agencies and digital marketing companies. I'm no stranger to conversations that revolve around partners & bizdev & analytics & media buys. I can only imagine things have intensified & evolved since I've been out of those trenches.\n\nStill - and maybe this is the Mozilla brain-damage talking - I can't imagine a sane conversation that resulted in The Verge extending an invitation to over 20 companies to set up shop on my computer with every page visit. I can only imagine this as a steady drip-drop of bizdev decisions and emails to internal webdevs:\n\n*\"Hey, can you add this tracking pixel? These guys do realtime attention heatmapping and it's brilliant!\"*\n\n*\"Paste this snippet into the global template, please? This fourth programmatic ad platform is really going to fill in the gaps for the other three.\"*\n\n*\"One more script thing here. We need to capture the affiliate credit for all these links going out to e-commerce sites.*\"\n\n*\"Oh hey, we're going to need this new script to manage the dozen ad platforms we use now.\"*\n\nI'm guessing no one along the way had the power or motivation to say no. I mean, really, what's the cost in tossing one more straw onto that camel's back? I know I never looked or complained until now, and I doubt the majority of readers will ever bother.\n\nWe all just kind of get this growing sense of malaise about \"the web\" as a gestalt of our favorite sites as they get suckier.\n\n## How to make the web suck\n\nSo, I haven't taken the time to dig into the source code of those companies' specific contributions to the article. There are only so many hours in the day, and I have a ranty blog post to finish.\n\nBut, if you want to talk about browser performance - mobile or desktop - don't you think that maybe, *just maybe*, some of that **7 megabytes** of JavaScript code might have an impact?\n\nFirst, even assuming this code comes from a local cache, [parsing it into something executable has a cost][js-parsing]. Of course, someday, we'll have [WebAssembly][] to shift this first stage upstream into webdev build tools. But we don't have that, yet.\n\n[js-parsing]: http://timkadlec.com/2014/09/js-parse-and-execution-time/\n[WebAssembly]: https://brendaneich.com/2015/06/from-asm-js-to-webassembly/\n\nThen, there's what that code's actually doing once it runs. There's the usual reporting on every scrap of browser fingerprint data. There's deciding whether and what ads to fetch & inject. I've seen scripts that record every pixel of mouse movement and phone home every few seconds.\n\nSome spawn lots of hidden iframes, each doing something fun. Others run code 10 times per second that trigger little invisible page re-renderings that chew up CPU and make scrolling & orientation changes chug. Some scripts get run multiple times and perform duplicate work. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate.\n\nWait, where was I?\n\n## Everybody's (not) doing it!\n\nI've seen the argument that this is how the web gets funded. Everybody's doing it. This is the current state of the art. Browsers just need to suck it up & make it happen.\n\nSome sites are (much) better than others, though, and it doesn't seem to be directly related to the content. Here's what I saw when I did a quick check of some daily reads:\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n  img.inline { vertical-align: middle; }\n</style>\n\n* <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/forbes.png\"> - [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2015/07/20/as-paypal-goes-public-again-ceo-hints-at-working-with-amazon-and-sets-sights-on-acquisitions/)\n* <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/huffpo.png\"> - [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/first-half-of-2015-was-hottest-january-june-ever-recorded_55ad7b8ce4b0caf721b3a968)\n* <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/cnn.png\"> - [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/23/politics/donald-trump-border-visit-texas/index.html)\n* <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/readwrite.png\"> - [Readwrite](http://readwrite.com/2015/07/15/bittorrent-sync-new-api)\n* <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/bbc.png\"> - [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-33642158)\n* <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/ars-technica.png\"> - [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/07/rare-breed-linux-mint-17-2-offers-desktop-familiarity-and-responds-to-user-wants/)\n* <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/qz.png\"> - [Quartz](http://qz.com/458826/behold-nasas-first-image-in-decades-of-the-whole-earth/)\n* <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/npr.png\"> - [NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/07/20/424630545/with-ad-blocking-use-on-the-rise-what-happens-to-online-publishers)\n* <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/io9.png\"> - [io9](http://io9.com/molybdenum-the-most-important-element-youve-never-hear-1718443869)\n* <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/the-guardian.png\"> - [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/20/bernie-sanders-structural-racism-economic-justice)\n* <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/mozilla.png\"> - [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/)\n* <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/uploads/2015/the-verge-web-sucks/mdn.png\"> - [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)\n\nIf you've bought into my thesis that this stuff should take a lot of the blame for poor mobile performance - it's no surprise that I'll claim these sites are progressively better experiences as I step down the list.\n\nI also didn't dig deeply into each of these. But, it's pretty clear The Verge blows other sites out of the water in terms of what it demands from a browser.

There are interesting capabilities on the horizon.\n\nBut, I can't help thinking if everyone shrank those tracking & advertising icebergs down to some sane magnitude relative to the actual content, that this web might be a better place overall.\n\n[plunk-ads]: http://www.computerworld.com/article/2847727/mozilla-plunks-ads-into-firefox.html\n[flipboard]: https://flipboard.com/\n[s2w]: https://air.mozilla.org/subscribe2web/\n[flattr]: https://flattr.com/\n[dtns]: http://www.dailytechnewsshow.com/\n[dtns-patreon]: https://www.patreon.com/acedtect\n[tiles-flow]: https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/advancingcontent/files/2015/05/How-data-is-protected-Infographic1.pdf\n[content-services]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Content_services\n[tiles]: https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2015/05/21/providing-a-valuable-platform-for-advertisers-content-publishers-and-users/\n[Adblock Plus]: https://adblockplus.org/\n[party-cookies]: http://www.iab.net/mozilla_rothenberg\n[Facebook's Instant Articles]: http://instantarticles.fb.com/\n[Apple's News app]: https://www.apple.com/news/\n[lightbeam]: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/lightbeam/\n[performance-bankruptcy]: http://product.voxmedia.com/2015/5/6/8561867/declaring-performance-bankruptcy\n[mobile-web-sucks]: http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002721/the-mobile-web-sucks\n[translating-seinfeld]: http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8809723/jerry-seinfeld-tv-show-international-translation\n[max-headroom]: http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/2/8285139/max-headroom-oral-history-80s-cyberpunk-interview\n[verge-fan]: https://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/142396733316534272\n\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n",
