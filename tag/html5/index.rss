          <title>Parsec Patrol Diaries: How To Avoid Smashing Into Things</title>
          <description>I made a hero ship with beam weapons. I even built drifting asteroids that handle smashing into things. What gave me trouble was finding a way to teach enemy ships how to avoid smashing into things. You know, not perfectly, but just well enough to seem vaguely cunning and worth pretending to outsmart in a video game.</description>

          <title>Parsec Patrol Diaries: Entity Component Systems</title>
          <description>The Entity, Component, &amp; System design pattern is old hat for many game developers. But, keep in mind that I’m a web developer, and mostly on the server side of things for the past decade or so. One of my last big revelations was discovering the Model, View, &amp; Controller way of doing things. Apropos of that, this ECS thing seems to be a Big Deal of similar proportions.</description>

          <title>Parsec Patrol Diaries: Hello World</title>
          <description>So, I’ve been working on a retro space game for the web. I planned it as a fun project to “sharpen the saw” and get myself more current on some newer technologies. I also planned to use it as blog fodder, writing little diary entries about what I’ve been doing &amp; discovering along the way. But, 147 commits and almost 4 months later, I’ve had fun doing the coding and have totally neglected the writing.</description>

          <title>Parsec Patrol Diaries: Why a Game?</title>
          <description>I decided to start writing a retro space game for the web, because I thought it might be a good way to exercise a lot of interesting technologies and have fun to boot. You know, like how sending rockets into space yields astronaut ice cream &amp; anti-shock trousers back down on Earth. But, I’ve also wanted to make games all the way back to my Atari 2600, Commodore 64, and Apple ][ days – because Warren Robinett is my hero.</description>
