    "summary": "Oh hey, look! It's another blog post—and this one\nis cross-posted on hacks.mozilla.com.\nI won't say this is the start of a renewed blogging habit, but let's see what happens.\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions\n        afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it\n        allows users to pair the selection of an object with the\n        execution of an action, often including a second object in the\n        operation.  It's a simple yet powerful UI concept used to\n        support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),\n        and even the creation of link relationships.\n    \n        Since it's so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web\n        applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first\n        offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although\n        mousedown, mousemove, and\n        mouseup made it possible, the implementation has been\n        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,\n        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,\n        there's a challenge to find the subject of the drop when\n        the interaction is completed.\n    \n\n    Of course, that doesn't prevent most modern JavaScript\n    frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and\n    throwing in some flourishes while they're at it.  But, wouldn't\n    it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and\n    drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?\n</p><p>\n    As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification \n    <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd\">section on new drag-and-drop events</a>, and \n    <a target=\"_new\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop\">Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation</a> of those events.\n</p><p>\n    If you want to jump straight to the code, I've put together \n    <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html\">some simple demos</a> \n    of the new events.  \n</p><p>\n\n    I've even scratched an itch of my own and\n    built <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html\">the beginnings of an outline editor</a>,\n    where every draggable element is also a drop target—of which\n    there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something\n    that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past\n    while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.\n</p><p>\n    And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from \n    <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop\">a GitHub repository</a>\n    I've created especially for this article—which continues after the jump.\n</p>",
