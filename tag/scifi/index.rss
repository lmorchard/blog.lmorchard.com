          <title>Catbearcoin, a web science fiction story</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Wherein I write a web sci-fi story about how I imagine micropayments
could work.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Behemoth, Part 1</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#x2019;ve been meaning to get myself writing again, so here&amp;#x2019;s the first rough part of a story that&amp;#x2019;s been bouncing in my head. It&amp;#x2019;s a quick and dirty opening scene for a space opera, but I&amp;#x2019;m hoping to take it in an interesting direction almost immediately after this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distant sun cast silvery rays through a field of tumbling asteroids and swirling dust. Among the rocks, a balletic swarm of glinting motes danced, alighting here and there to vaporize and harvest masses with actinic flares. The source and sink of the swarm&amp;#x2019;s flow was a dark, ovoid craft tracing a lazy, eccentric orbit around the cluster of debris. Nestled within the craft was its pilot, Alan Rickard.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Memoirs</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a story about what might happen if one takes life hacks, GTD, and IFTTT a bit too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so maybe that&amp;#x2019;s not a great intro. But, it&amp;#x2019;s the first thing my brain spewed out. I&amp;#x2019;ve had this story rattling around in my head for a few years, and just tonight managed to finish banging out a first draft. I&amp;#x2019;m hoping to work on it a bit more, and I&amp;#x2019;m not entirely happy with it yet, so comments welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Did you look under the couch?</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Earth had been a great home to us. But, the Sun was revving up to devour the inner planets, so we figured it was about time we pack the whole place up and archive it. No danger to the human species: We&amp;#x2019;d scattered ourselves across the galactic plane. There was no getting rid of us now, short of obliterating the whole Milky Way.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Homebrew Biotech Club</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The homebrew club got real interesting last night. Jerry started dating this girl Maddy, and she was something else: purple hair, piercings, and a load of tattoos. And then there&amp;#x2019;s Jerry: bearded, balding, and been carrying a spare tire for years now. I can see the appeal for him, but she&amp;#x2019;s out of his league.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>On the Market</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;It had been a busy week: she&amp;#x2019;d had her teeth whitened, removed four tattoos, dyed her hair back to its natural color, and gotten her optical implants updated. She&amp;#x2019;d also lost 4 pounds, working furiously over the past month in the fitness center on the ground floor of her apartment building. Her body had never looked more toned. She almost didn&amp;#x2019;t want to leave it.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Lonely Timeless Flight</title>
          <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    He kicks back, alone at a corner table in low-g. He nurses a high gravity beer for the alcoholic irony. It&amp;#x2019;s his fourth, and the faces around him are blurred. Funny thing, though: with his glasses on, the faces would have been blurred even if he&amp;#x2019;d been sober.
  &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Stuxnet was awesome, right?</title>
          <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The toaster wouldn&amp;#x2019;t toast, and the microwave wouldn&amp;#x2019;t&amp;#x2014;umm&amp;#x2014;make tiny heat waves, or whatever it does. The fridge, though, the fridge had slow-cooked everything inside overnight and the apartment stank like delicious death.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

          <title>Famous Last Words</title>
          <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    They told me never to talk to it; it was isolated for a reason. But, like I told them, I couldn&amp;#x2019;t imagine anything a transhuman AI could say to make me let it out of the box. So, after a post-midnight tumbler of Irish whiskey, I opened up a secure terminal and said hello. What harm could a little chat do?
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
