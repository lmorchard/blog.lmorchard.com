I won’t miss the sad moans when I\nclosed him up in the attic for the night by himself. (The alternative was\nwaking up in the wee hours to fights with the new cat Catsby. Or, waking up to\nhim making a mess in his favorite spot next to me on the bed.)</p>\n<p>The night before last, we took him to the vet and got news that he was\nseriously ill.

I didn’t expect it to turn into an overnight vigil - but every time I\ncame close to falling asleep, he’d do something to wake me back up. A meow, a\nmoan, a few times even a paw to my face. There we were, laying together on the\ncouch, or sometimes the carpet, watching the sky outside gradually lighten.</p>\n<p>Maybe he was excited to have me there or maybe it was just the new meds, but\nhe wanted my attention.

A [comment by Joe Grossberg][jg] leads me to consider that perhaps referring to \"[sheep farming][sf]\" as my eventual stressed-out programmer out-to-pasture phase is as insulting to [those who herd sheep][who] as [using \"Mom\" to stand in for \"naive user\"][mom] is to [actual mothers][actual].  Maybe what I'm really after is to [*become* a sheep][become] - though that's a bit scary.  Or better yet, I'd like to be [one of our own pampered cats][cats].  \r\n\r\nYeah, that's the ticket.\r\n\r\n[cats]: http://flickr.com/photos/deusx/60976291/in/set-1316941/\r\n[become]: http://www.bloosheep.com/Furry%20pics/picturesofframpton/Sheep-n-Skunk_JPG.html\r\n[actual]: http://www.mommybloggers.com/\r\n[who]: http://www.sheepusa.org/\r\n[sf]: http://www.sheep101.info/farm.html\r\n[mom]: http://www.whump.com/moreLikeThis/2006/08/05/your-mom-is-not-an-example-user\r\n[jg]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/07/firefox-rss-xsl-from-anger-to-apathy#comment-47968\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087979\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://bright-green.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=56a92f0c36ff78d8ab2e0d8255588ecc&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://bright-green.com\">Alan Green</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087979\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T02:08:33\">2006-11-08T02:08:33</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Ewe do come across as one crazy cat. </p>\n\n<p>More seriously, my father recently decided that being an Oracle guru was too stressful, so he gave that up and bought a newsagency.
