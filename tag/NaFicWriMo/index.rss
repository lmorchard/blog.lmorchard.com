          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;It had been a busy week: she’d had her teeth whitened, removed four tattoos, dyed her hair back to its natural color, and gotten her optical implants updated.

The fridge, though, the fridge had slow-cooked everything inside overnight and the apartment stank like delicious death.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description
