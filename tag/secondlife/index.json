Second411 (http://www.second411.com) is an in-world search engine that lets people find objects of interest to them within the world.

What's suprising is how much the level of interaction goes up in this situation: the performer can see the audience of avatars on their computer screen, they can see them clap, make requests, boo, dance or whatever. Since it's a live stream, the performer can also do shout outs to the audience: \"Thanks for coming out tonight green lizard guy in a Ween T-shirt!\". </p>\n<p>Live music is also ridiculously easy to find by searching for events in-world or by checking out the page on the SecondLife website - http://secondlife.com/events/index.php?category=20</p>\n<p>Also did you know that people have created tools for posting to del.icio.us from within SL as well as blogging (http://www.bloghud.com). </p>\n<p>Thanks, feel free to IM me in-world: Hal9k Andalso.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090462\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://brian.cors.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7b3073e125f3ac8f09130950ef5d7790&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://brian.cors.org\">brian cors</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090462\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-26T16:02:07\">2006-09-26T16:02:07</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Woo.
