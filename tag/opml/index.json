It&#39;s also the first time I&#39;ve heard Danny Ayers&#39; voice, so that was pretty cool after having been a textual blog acquaintance for a few years now.  As for the rest of the guys on the call, I&#39;m not quite as familiar with all of them yet, but I&#39;ll be adding them to my Reading Lists shortly.</p>\n<p>Apropos of this podcast, I&#39;ve lately gotten a bit of a fresh take on the RSS/OPML versus XHTML versus Semantic Web tech merry-go-round.  Here&#39;s the basic gist:  Invest time into tools that solve problems first and formats that enable possibilities second, if you want to get any attention and subsequent help.</p>\n<p>And then I say &quot;tools&quot;, I don&#39;t mean a GraphViz construct that makes really cool charts for people willing to chase down and install the dependencies.  No, I mean something like the OPML Editor.  The OPML Editor comes in a single package, and you launch it from a single icon.  The OPML Editor is <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty piece of software</a> that&#39;s nonetheless helping me achieve some practical goals that I&#39;ve heretofore been vaguely stymied in reaching.  The OPML Editor is making me think more favorably about OPML, <i>despite</i> OPML being <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty format</a>.</p>\n<p>The utility of the OPML Editor is giving me the motivation to build filters and workarounds to transmute OPML into XOXO and RDF formats, but only when the need arises.  I could also see putting an OPML-to-triples bridge in front of a semweb crawler or tool.  And, there&#39;s no reason why outlines in the OPML Editor couldn&#39;t be rendered in XOXO and RDF formats by the tool itself, if there&#39;s something useful around to consume it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I&#39;ve done enough with RDF and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo_outliner_experiment\">XOXO</a> to see the clear potential in both.  With enough RDF data around, you can turn the whole wide web into a single massively networked database ripe for the querying thanks to a uniform data model and clear specs for representation of that model.  With XOXO and microformats, you get a <a href=\"http://www.sudoku.com/\">Sudoku-esque</a> solution to providing both human and machine readable data in the same format and file, while sterring close to the inherent design principles of the web.</p>\n<p>The problem with these formats, though, is that they open potential avenues but don&#39;t provide value until there&#39;s some foot traffic on the avenues.  This is just establishing a world in which there can exist both chickens and eggs, but not doing much with respect to concrete instantiations of poultry.\nNow, to be fair, there have been efforts to make practical usage of RDF (see: <a href=\"http://musicbrainz.org/\">MusicBrainz</a>) and these are early days for microformats.  But, I think a lot more effort needs to be given toward making useful, personally rewarding tools - and less effort given toward expressing awe toward the potentials given by formats and models.  You can have both, but you&#39;ve got to pick one to start with.</p>\n<p>And, the reason you need to make tools first that use formats second is attention.  (That&#39;s been a buzzword lately, hasn&#39;t it?)  You need attention if you want adoption and help.  And, you can get attention - and subsequent help - by scratching someone&#39;s itch.</p>\n<p>Now, some people&#39;s itches are scratched by the fun of abstract symbol manipulation and the perception of elegance.  Others&#39; itches are scratched by getting work done, like writing or organizing thoughts or expanding awareness of more information sources.  Personally, I&#39;ve got itches of both of these varieties.  The problem is that there are many fewer people with itches in that first category.  And, no offense to anyone, that seems to be the bulk of the RDF and XOXO fanbase at the moment.  For the second category, even if things are shitty, smoke a bit and catch on fire - as long as some work gets done at the end of the day, there&#39;s a lot of tolerance to go around and a lot of motivation to pitch in to improve the situation.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I firmly believe that ATOM, RDF, and XHTML-based microformats trounce OPML, RSS, and the like in terms of clear definition, affordance in manipulation, and technical elegance.  But, OPML and RSS are still winning in the world because the tools using these formats are scratching some damn annoying itches.  And, though towers built atop shitty tools and formats seem Jenga-shaky, somehow they never quite come crashing down.  Maybe they will come crashing down someday, but we seem to be getting work done in the meantime.</p>\n<p>So, to wrap up:  My take on this whole mess is that your format will gain adoption to the degree that the tools producing it help people get work done.  I can&#39;t find tools today for RDF and XOXO that are as rewardingly useful as the OPML Editor has become.  When that happens, the story may change.</p>\n<!-- tags: metablogging rdf semweb webdev opml rss syndication microformats xoxo podcasting -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086877\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e377f3e2140297d32460ae9a4b38ff98&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086877\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-14T02:32:49\">2006-02-14T02:32:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>There's a lot to be said for rough consensus and running code, and there's a lot more running code that speaks OPML than there is that speaks XOXO or RDF.

    "html": "<p>So, I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/28/ancient-code-drifting-down-the-newsriver\">expressed some renewed interest</a> in tinkering around with the code behind the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/\">OPML Editor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.newsriver.org/\">NewsRiver</a>.  Well, it needs to be said that there are some strings attached to playing in this field:  That is, these are Dave Winer&#39;s potato chips I&#39;m enjoying.  </p>\n<p>And, well, when you&#39;re taking chips from another another guy&#39;s lunchpail, it&#39;s customary to at least be nice to the guy and be gracious about the sharing.  Granted, when I&#39;m done, there could end up being <em>more</em> potato chips left in the bag than when I found it—that&#39;s the nature of this sort of sharing, after all.  But the bag, nonetheless, was brought to the table by Dave.  </p>\n<p>Although I&#39;ve tried to bow out of it over the past few years, I have historically been found amongst the crowd who&#39;ve been known to take pokes at Dave when it affords a run of chuckles or guffaws.  Sometimes, this has been in the pursuit of making a technical point or two in dramatic fashion—but often this has just been done toward the goals of playground-level politics and tit-for-tat.    </p>\n<p>Well, this crap doesn&#39;t suit me.  Or at least, I don&#39;t want to be suited for it.  You see, I really just care about being friendly, working on decent code—and besides, my <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/21/whats_your_winer_number\">Winer Number</a> is right around <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)\">Mu</a>.</p>\n<p>Although I&#39;ve been witness to many clashes of ego involving the man with others of strong ego, I&#39;ve never actually been the personal victim of any slight from Mr. Winer that I care to count or remember.  It&#39;s been fashionable to poke at him, but my goal is to keep my ego at a calm distance from most things in life and I&#39;ve not got any personal gripes with Dave Winer.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, when I look at my career over the last few years, I see plain evidence that I&#39;ve benefitted well from the man&#39;s influence—even if indirectly from his work.

    "body": "So, I've [expressed some renewed interest][interest] in tinkering around with the code behind the [OPML Editor][opml] and [NewsRiver][news].  Well, it needs to be said that there are some strings attached to playing in this field:  That is, these are Dave Winer's potato chips I'm enjoying.  \r\n\r\nAnd, well, when you're taking chips from another another guy's lunchpail, it's customary to at least be nice to the guy and be gracious about the sharing.  Granted, when I'm done, there could end up being *more* potato chips left in the bag than when I found it—that's the nature of this sort of sharing, after all.  But the bag, nonetheless, was brought to the table by Dave.  \r\n\r\nAlthough I've tried to bow out of it over the past few years, I have historically been found amongst the crowd who've been known to take pokes at Dave when it affords a run of chuckles or guffaws.  Sometimes, this has been in the pursuit of making a technical point or two in dramatic fashion—but often this has just been done toward the goals of playground-level politics and tit-for-tat.    \r\n\r\nWell, this crap doesn't suit me.  Or at least, I don't want to be suited for it.  You see, I really just care about being friendly, working on decent code—and besides, my [Winer Number][wn] is right around [Mu][].\r\n\r\nAlthough I've been witness to many clashes of ego involving the man with others of strong ego, I've never actually been the personal victim of any slight from Mr. Winer that I care to count or remember.  It's been fashionable to poke at him, but my goal is to keep my ego at a calm distance from most things in life and I've not got any personal gripes with Dave Winer.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, when I look at my career over the last few years, I see plain evidence that I've benefitted well from the man's influence—even if indirectly from his work.  I've successfully profited from implementations of XML-RPC and RSS.  I've managed to [write my first book][book] thanks to things I first picked up from him.  And, I've learned a lot in pursuing [fractional horsepower HTTP servers][fh].\r\n\r\nDave writes [shitty software][shitty] and evangelizes shitty ideas.  And, since the turn of the century or so, I've adopted and improvised upon many of them for fun and profit.  Thus, while I don't want to be on any \"side\" or in any \"camp\" or  be a mindless fan or follower of anyone or anything—I do feel a need to at least be *nice* to Dave Winer while I'm sharing his potato chips.\r\n\r\nSo, Dave?  I'm sorry I've pissed in the bag of chips a few times.  Maybe we can just call those salt and vinegar and let someone else eat 'em.  In the meantime, I might make a run to the party store for some dip or something.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: winer opml newsriver  -->\r\n\r\n[shitty]: http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\r\n[fh]: http://davenet.scripting.com/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe\r\n[book]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1\r\n[mu]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)\r\n[wn]: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/21/whats_your_winer_number\r\n[interest]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/28/ancient-code-drifting-down-the-newsriver\r\n[opml]: http://support.opml.org/\r\n[news]: http://www.newsriver.org/\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083364\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.flirtinserat.de\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=66afe238f8f6f1f8028362dab437a8fb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.flirtinserat.de\">Brad Neuberg</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083364\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-30T10:54:25\">2006-01-30T10:54:25</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Do you have a online demo for the OPML Editor you mentioned ?</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

    "html": "<p>So, while working through some writing blockages last weekend, I started doing <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/21/a-bit-of-newsriver-hackery\">some hacking</a> on <a href=\"http://scripting.wordpress.com/2005/12/29/why-im-working-on-an-aggregator/\">Dave Winer&#39;s newsRiver</a> running on the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/\">OPML Editor</a> platform.  (Oh, and it <em>is</em> a platform, maybe more so than even emacs—don&#39;t let the moniker &#39;editor&#39; fool you.)</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s the thing:  It was a lot of addictive fun, and it takes me back to the <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/11/ooooho\">love/hate thing I had with Radio</a>, back toward the first days of this blog.  This Frontier / Radio / OPML Editor environment is undeniably satisfying for me to work in.  It&#39;s like potato chips:  Jump to an outline here, tweak some code there, mangle an outline node up there, reload a browser page, watch things go—lots of moments of instant gratification all building incrementally atop one another.</p>\n<p>In one package—which reminds me a lot of <a href=\"http://www.squeak.org/\">Squeak</a>—the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/\">OPML Editor</a> bundles a crazy amount of integrated machinery for both Windows and Mac OS X:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UserTalk, a very capable scripting language</li>\n<li>An IDE based on outlining, somewhat like Python&#39;s syntactic indentation</li>\n<li>Persistent on-disk hierarchical hashtables (aka the Object Database)</li>\n<li>Code and data all live in the same object database</li>\n<li>A web server and a host of other networking code—including Jabber messaging, although I can&#39;t attest to its freshness.</li>\n<li>Blog editing and no-effort external web hosting file synch</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/26/oooabf\">Hot patching</a> and easy upgrades that most other software packages dream of</li>\n<li>Years and years and years of (mostly) working code with datestamped change notes and living history.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the thing is?  This was the state of the art for Radio back in 2002—and earlier than that even for Frontier.  Fast forward from then till today, and you&#39;ll find that <a href=\"http://frontierkernel.sourceforge.net/\">Frontier is now Open Source</a>—with many of the same sorts of warts Mozilla&#39;s open source release helpfully revealed back in 1997.  (Some hero needs to come along and port this beast to Linux!  Good luck!)  And now, much of the guts of Radio are released as the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/\">OPML Editor</a>.  </p>\n<p>In a lot of ways, this whole family of apps built on this common ancestry of code is <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">really shitty software</a>.  Kind of like <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/02/24/ancient-software-and-programmer-archaeologists\">all that code on the <em>Qeng Ho</em> from Vernor Vinge&#39;s <em>A Deepness in the Sky</em></a>.  This stuff crashes and sets itself on fire a lot, but then again it&#39;s amazing to see just how many wheels have been reinvented and re-reinvented since 2002 (and before) when I fire up this code today.</p>\n<p>And now, it looks like the embers are stirring for this thing again.  There&#39;s been a lot of time for a lot of angst to fade from a lot of places, and it looks like there&#39;s a new crop of fresh people rediscovering this stuff.  </p>\n<p>So, anyway, I like these potato chips.  I think I want to start munching on them again, as time permits.

Of course, years from now, the XML-RPC stuff might smell a bit while the REST stuff will have stayed solid and revealed further unexpected benefits... but bah.

Here&#39;s a use case where I agree OPML has undeniably become king: Exporting and importing feed aggregator subscriptions.</p>\n<p>Because <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com/\">Radio UserLand</a> was the first aggregator to really take off—and because OPML is Radio&#39;s lingua franca, any new aggregators have needed to speak OPML to facilitate migration.  It grew from there, with nearly every aggregator supporting some basic form of OPML import/export for subscription lists.  OPML has won the &quot;feed subscription list format war&quot; before there was ever a notion that there might be such a war.</p>\n<p>Now, I&#39;m woefully behind on all the buzz connecting OPML with attention.  But, my impression so far is that people want to share their subscription list, exported from their aggregator of choice.  That comes out as OPML.  So then, the reasoning is that because aggregators produce OPML, and aggregators are powerful attention managers, OPML is the lingua franca of attention.  Is this about right?</p>\n<p>I guess where I go from there is with this:  <strong>My aggregator&#39;s OPML export is private data for interchange between my other aggregators.</strong>  Today, I&#39;m about as comfortable with sharing my OPML with you as I am sharing <a href=\"http://web.intuit.com/support/quicken/2002/win/1177.html\">QIF files exported from my bank account</a>.  Sure, it&#39;s an easy export process, but it&#39;s not meant for you.</p>\n<p>In my OPML, I&#39;ve got subscriptions that I&#39;ve paid for, that I&#39;ve password protected, and that give me details derived from my server logs.  I don&#39;t want to share that, at least not directly.  I&#39;ve been asked for my OPML by a few people so far, and every time, I need to dig through it and be sure I&#39;m not giving away any secrets.  Maybe this is where I&#39;m a bit confused about the attention hype.</p>\n<p><strong>You see, what I do want to share is called a *<a href=\"http://radio.outliners.com/blogRollOutliner\">blogroll</a>*.</strong>  Blogrolls are <em>public declarations of attention</em>, published on blogs.  </p>\n<p>Since revamping this blog, I haven&#39;t yet gotten around to throwing a proper blogroll together, but I&#39;m planning on it.  And, when I <em>do</em> share it, it&#39;ll be in HTML list form.

Here's a use case where I agree OPML has undeniably become king: Exporting and importing feed aggregator subscriptions.\r\n\r\nBecause [Radio UserLand][radio] was the first aggregator to really take off—and because OPML is Radio's lingua franca, any new aggregators have needed to speak OPML to facilitate migration.  It grew from there, with nearly every aggregator supporting some basic form of OPML import/export for subscription lists.  OPML has won the \"feed subscription list format war\" before there was ever a notion that there might be such a war.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm woefully behind on all the buzz connecting OPML with attention.  But, my impression so far is that people want to share their subscription list, exported from their aggregator of choice.  That comes out as OPML.  So then, the reasoning is that because aggregators produce OPML, and aggregators are powerful attention managers, OPML is the lingua franca of attention.  Is this about right?\r\n\r\nI guess where I go from there is with this:  **My aggregator's OPML export is private data for interchange between my other aggregators.**  Today, I'm about as comfortable with sharing my OPML with you as I am sharing [QIF files exported from my bank account][qif].  Sure, it's an easy export process, but it's not meant for you.\r\n\r\nIn my OPML, I've got subscriptions that I've paid for, that I've password protected, and that give me details derived from my server logs.  I don't want to share that, at least not directly.  I've been asked for my OPML by a few people so far, and every time, I need to dig through it and be sure I'm not giving away any secrets.  Maybe this is where I'm a bit confused about the attention hype.\r\n\r\n**You see, what I do want to share is called a *[blogroll][radioblogroll]*.**  Blogrolls are *public declarations of attention*, published on blogs.  \r\n\r\nSince revamping this blog, I haven't yet gotten around to throwing a proper blogroll together, but I'm planning on it.  And, when I *do* share it, it'll be in HTML list form.  And when I build it, it may start as an OPML export from my aggregator, but I'll have to spend some time weeding through it.\r\n\r\nI guess I don't have a clear picture here yet, but directly shipping around exports from my aggregator subscriptions gives me the willies.  And further, basing anything big on OPML gives me the willies too.  \r\n\r\nNowadays, sharing things on the web feels like XHTML and [microformats][] to me.  OPML for interchange between aggregators is one thing—but on the web at large, sinking deeper roots into OPML and the whole Rube Goldberg array of machinery following behind it feels like a backward step to me.  \r\n\r\nMaybe [microformats][] are the new XML-geekery, but I don't want a new, \"cleaner\" XML format—I just want to more cleverly use the format that everyone's been using to share outlines and declarations of attention in blogs.\r\n\r\n[qif]: http://web.intuit.com/support/quicken/2002/win/1177.html\r\n[radio]: http://radio.userland.com/\r\n[radioblogroll]: http://radio.outliners.com/blogRollOutliner\r\n[microformats]: http://www.microformats.org/\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082960\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082960\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-27T21:37:59\">2005-11-27T21:37:59</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Check out <a href=\"http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uche Ogbuji</a>'s pertinent posts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-11-14/I_already_\" rel=\"nofollow\">I already said OPML is crap, right?

Here&#39;s my general idea:</p>\n<p>How about trying <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo\">XOXO</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html#h-12.2\">the <code>rel</code> attribute on HTML links</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links\">the <code>subsection</code> link type</a>—all with a bit of XSL to make it work?</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s some working data and code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/xsltproc?xslAddr=xoxo-transclude.xsl&amp;docAddr=ex1.html\">Here&#39;s the end result</a>, a simple web directory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some clues as to what the above does:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This directory started with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/ex1.html\">this top-level outline</a>.  View source on this page, notice the &quot;Syndication Feeds&quot; link with the <code>rel=&quot;subsection&quot;</code>.</li>\n<li>Applying <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/xoxo-transclude.xsl\">this XSL</a> using <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/xsltproc\">this web service</a> is where the work gets done.  This consists of dereferencing each link with a <code>rel=&quot;subsection&quot;</code> and transcluding the innards of the page at the end of the URL.</li>\n<li>Notice that <a href=\"http://hackingfeeds.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/ex2.html\">the URL of &quot;Syndication Feeds&quot;</a> comes from a domain other than <code>decafbad.com</code>.  If I wanted to, the <a href=\"http://hackingfeeds.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/ex3.html\">third level of transclusion</a> could&#39;ve come from yet another domain, too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think this solution is better than using OPML for web directories.  Although it could use some refinement—using a bit of <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> or AJAX magic to include in a page, perhaps—it&#39;s not only <em>already supported</em> by more applications than OPML, it <em>also</em> leverages a lot of prior art and consensus work.  </p>\n<p>So, am I wrong here?

View source on this page, notice the \"Syndication Feeds\" link with the `rel=\"subsection\"`.\r\n  * Applying [this XSL][xsl] using [this web service][xsltproc] is where the work gets done.  This consists of dereferencing each link with a `rel=\"subsection\"` and transcluding the innards of the page at the end of the URL.\r\n  * Notice that [the URL of \"Syndication Feeds\"][ex2] comes from a domain other than `decafbad.com`.  If I wanted to, the [third level of transclusion][ex3] could've come from yet another domain, too.\r\n  \r\nI think this solution is better than using OPML for web directories.  Although it could use some refinement—using a bit of `<iframe>` or AJAX magic to include in a page, perhaps—it's not only *already supported* by more applications than OPML, it *also* leverages a lot of prior art and consensus work.  \r\n\r\nSo, am I wrong here?  If so, please tell me how, where, and why.\r\n\r\n[ex3]: http://hackingfeeds.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/ex3.html\r\n[ex2]: http://hackingfeeds.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/ex2.html\r\n[xsltproc_src]: http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/xsltproc.txt\r\n[xsltproc]: http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/xsltproc\r\n[xsl]: http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/xoxo-transclude.xsl\r\n[master]: http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/ex1.html\r\n[end]: http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/xsltproc?xslAddr=xoxo-transclude.xsl&amp;docAddr=ex1.html\r\n[subsection]: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links\r\n[rel]: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html#h-12.2\r\n[xoxo]: http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo\r\n[prev]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/02/a-kerfluffle-of-opml-and-web-directories\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085762\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://theryanking.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c846b78a4a4c978fd34ef965320a13b0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://theryanking.com\">ryan king</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085762\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-03T05:53:27\">2005-10-03T05:53:27</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>You're not wrong.

    "html": "<p>So, I guess there was a bit of an extended kerfluffle over the weekend.  And as these things usually do, it started out from a very cool idea: You can build a web directory as an outline of links, with some nodes &quot;farmed out&quot; to outlines hosted elsewhere—all through the magic of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion\">transclusion</a>.  </p>\n<p>For example, say you want to host a directory of resources on web development.  But, you might like to let me maintain the section on web syndication feeds.  Well, I can toss you a URL to my outline of RSS and Atom links, and you can just pull it into a branch of your &quot;superset&quot; outline—kind of like an RSS subscription, really.  Whenever I change my outline, yours will automatically get updated with my work.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine this going off into infinity in both directions:  Outlines including outlines including outlines.  Outlines included by outlines included by outlines.  It&#39;s a world-wide outline.</p>\n<p>So, anyway, <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/29/opml-an-awesome-experiment/\">TechCrunch&#39;s brainstorm</a> lead to <a href=\"http://archive.scripting.com/2005/09/29#When:7:36:29AM\">Dave Winer&#39;s kudos</a> and <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/29.html#a11295\">Scoble&#39;s OPML evangelism and an implementation challenge</a>.    But, to this, <a href=\"http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&amp;entry=3305486922\">James Robertson responded by calling OPML a &quot;really, really crappy format&quot;</a>.</p>\n<p>From this ensued a splattering of posts in various places chiming in on both sides:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://brainwagon.org/archives/2005/09/30/1610/\">OPML is a sucky and under-specified format, with implementations subject to approval by one guy</a>.</li>\n<li>OPML is a working format already in use by lots of code, <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/30.html#a11296\">so offer something better or shut up</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/10/01/put-up-or-shut-up/\">Shelley Powers of Burningbird says</a> that the &quot;put up or shut up&quot; attitude is wrong, that it&#39;s &quot;bad technology&quot;.  And, though I do agree with her, the problem is that the usual suspects involved in these sorts of kerfluffles fall on two sides:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We want to see good, well-specified agreements before we code something useful.</li>\n<li>We want working, useful code that we&#39;ll agree is good when we see it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While group #1 is willing to talk/shout things out and reach consensus ahead of time, group #2 wants to forge ahead with machines in motion and reach consensus through popular implementation.  So, members of group #2 will <em>never</em> take group #1 seriously until they&#39;ve &quot;put up&quot;, because that&#39;s <em>their</em> process.</p>\n<p>Personally, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/12/13/oooced\">I sympathize with the dirty ways of group #2</a>.  But, I&#39;ve become convinced that what group #1 does is best over the long term, as some of the early successes of group #2 may become tottering unbalanced stacks of plates later on.</p>\n<p>So...  What to do?  Bah, I don&#39;t know.  But, against my better judgement, I feel like <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/02/web-directories-with-xoxo-and-xsl\">I have an idea or two to &quot;put up&quot;</a>.  </p>\n<p>In the meantime: Members of group #1, stop arguing with members of group #2—you&#39;re not speaking in quite the same languages, and you&#39;re not going to convert anyone.  Just nod &amp; smile, walk away and come up with a better idea, come back and show why it&#39;s better.</p>\n<p>(Oh yeah, and whatever happened to <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/04/16/opml-vs-oml\">OML replacing OPML</a>?)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084228\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.voidstar.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ce83a8e239c0cfce3488d3fec4d5d8de&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.voidstar.com\">Julian Bond</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084228\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-03T07:50:53\">2005-10-03T07:50:53</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Both groups are right.

It is indeed neat. But I'm still struggling to see the point. Does it just re-invent Gopher? Then there's the inspired chaos of it all. At least with something like DMOZ, Yahoo, Wikipedia, the hierarchy has some formalised structure and editors (perhaps community editors). An open mesh of decentralised outlines is going to have lots of dead ends and missing cross links. Perhaps that's just an artifact of the browser Apps we've seen so far and the breadcrumb approach being used. Perhaps it doesn't matter.</p>\n<p>And finally, I'd love to see an OPML browser app written in PHP.

But I have a slightly different take on what that means.</p>\n<p>When group 2 people ask for working code, they aren't asking simply for \"working code\". (Such as your XOXO &amp; XSL thing) They're thinking of an entire <em>system</em> of real users, a real application (need / problem to be solved) etc.</p>\n<p>The reason Dave Winer and OPML will win this, is because Winer really <em>wants</em> shared outlining on the internet. And he knows \"why\" he wants it. He has a vision, and a passion for it. He knows what he wants to do with it. He knows how to make interesting applications with like-minded collaborators. </p>\n<p>You can come up with a \"better\" format than OPML. You might be able to knock off better code overnight. But you do it for a \"lark\" or for some principle of \"doing it properly\".</p>\n<p>Winer doesn't care if its \"crappy\". He just has a drive to make something happen, and OPML is the simplest thing that can possibly work to do that. </p>\n<p>I think that's exactly the right thing to bet on.</p>\n<p>When you say \"I’ve become convinced that what group #1 does is best over the long term, as some of the early successes of group #2 may become tottering unbalanced stacks of plates later on.\"</p>\n<p>I'd be interested in some real world examples. As I see it, \"worse is better\" is the golden rule of computer history, in the long as well as short term.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084232\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084232\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-10T11:34:30\">2005-10-10T11:34:30</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Phil:  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/03/27/oooofc\" rel=\"nofollow\">I've watched Dave's push for shared outlining</a> for awhile now, and certainly he's been working towards it for much longer than I've been watching.  </p>\n<p>And, though it's gotten some mileage through Dave's sheer exuberance and people infected by his cool ideas, it's never quite caught on.  Instead, things like wikis and <a href=\"http://www.jotlive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JotSpotLive</a> and <a href=\"http://www.backpackit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backpack</a> and <a href=\"http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SubEthaEdit</a> have been capturing the users.</p>\n<p>And now, this latest push doesn't look so much like shared outlining <em>per se</em>, but more like a new attempt at <a href=\"http://dmoz.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DMOZ</a>.  And since Google's pretty much <a href=\"http://www.webworkshop.net/dmoz-2005.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">driven a stake into DMOZ</a>, my further interest in Gopher NG is really just a sometimes-interesting problem.  </p>\n<p>I could see some people joining Dave's World Outline effort to get some buzz in their interest niches—trying to be first to get their constituent URLs placed in the new, distributed OPML DMOZ-killer.  And it might be nifty for awhile, but I doubt it'll take hold.</p>\n<p>But as for real world examples of shared outlining, in the particular form Dave's pushing right now... Look at just about anyone's blogroll.  They're almost all in XOXO form <em>right now</em>.  That's the thing:  XOXO is just an HTML list.  It's so unexciting as to be unremarkable—<em>but they're everywhere, right now</em>.  Hell, even OPML has to get converted to XOXO to be used with web browsers—unless you're falling back to some ugly form of tables-as-list.</p>\n<p>XOXO is actually the simplest thing that can possibly work, <em>and people are using and have been using it all along</em>.  I think that's the right thing to bet on, versus OPML.  It doesn't need any evangelism or adoption efforts, other than maybe to remind people of that what they're already using is itself a viable format.  <strong>That's the only reason XOXO has a name.</strong></p>\n<p>I've <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo-outliner-experiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">already shown an in-browser XOXO editor prototype</a>—and believe me, that was easier to implement reliably than anything I've tried with OPML.  I could turn that into a full flown app given sustained free time and interest.  I plan to do that eventually, with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/Micronian\" rel=\"nofollow\">a project I've got simmering</a>.  </p>\n<p>Will I do it?  Who knows—I'm a busy nerd, and I certainly don't have the constant ebulience, time, and money that Dave Winer has.

    "body": "So, I guess there was a bit of an extended kerfluffle over the weekend.  And as these things usually do, it started out from a very cool idea: You can build a web directory as an outline of links, with some nodes \"farmed out\" to outlines hosted elsewhere—all through the magic of [transclusion][trans].  \r\n\r\nFor example, say you want to host a directory of resources on web development.  But, you might like to let me maintain the section on web syndication feeds.  Well, I can toss you a URL to my outline of RSS and Atom links, and you can just pull it into a branch of your \"superset\" outline—kind of like an RSS subscription, really.  Whenever I change my outline, yours will automatically get updated with my work.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine this going off into infinity in both directions:  Outlines including outlines including outlines.  Outlines included by outlines included by outlines.  It's a world-wide outline.\r\n\r\nSo, anyway, [TechCrunch's brainstorm][tech] lead to [Dave Winer's kudos][dwk] and [Scoble's OPML evangelism and an implementation challenge][scoble].    But, to this, [James Robertson responded by calling OPML a \"really, really crappy format\"][jr].\r\n\r\nFrom this ensued a splattering of posts in various places chiming in on both sides:\r\n\r\n  1. [OPML is a sucky and under-specified format, with implementations subject to approval by one guy][bw].\r\n  2. OPML is a working format already in use by lots of code, [so offer something better or shut up][scob2].\r\n\r\nNow, [Shelley Powers of Burningbird says][sh] that the \"put up or shut up\" attitude is wrong, that it's \"bad technology\".  And, though I do agree with her, the problem is that the usual suspects involved in these sorts of kerfluffles fall on two sides:\r\n\r\n  1. We want to see good, well-specified agreements before we code something useful.\r\n  1. We want working, useful code that we'll agree is good when we see it.\r\n\r\nWhile group #1 is willing to talk/shout things out and reach consensus ahead of time, group #2 wants to forge ahead with machines in motion and reach consensus through popular implementation.  So, members of group #2 will *never* take group #1 seriously until they've \"put up\", because that's *their* process.\r\n\r\nPersonally, [I sympathize with the dirty ways of group #2][dirt].  But, I've become convinced that what group #1 does is best over the long term, as some of the early successes of group #2 may become tottering unbalanced stacks of plates later on.\r\n\r\nSo...  What to do?  Bah, I don't know.  But, against my better judgement, I feel like [I have an idea or two to \"put up\"][idea].  \r\n\r\nIn the meantime: Members of group #1, stop arguing with members of group #2—you're not speaking in quite the same languages, and you're not going to convert anyone.  Just nod & smile, walk away and come up with a better idea, come back and show why it's better.\r\n\r\n(Oh yeah, and whatever happened to [OML replacing OPML][oml]?)\r\n\r\n[idea]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/02/web-directories-with-xoxo-and-xsl\r\n[oml]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/04/16/opml-vs-oml\r\n[dirt]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/12/13/oooced\r\n[sh]: http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/10/01/put-up-or-shut-up/\r\n[bw]: http://brainwagon.org/archives/2005/09/30/1610/\r\n[trans]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion\r\n[scob2]: http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/30.html#a11296\r\n[jr]: http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&entry=3305486922\r\n[dwk]: http://archive.scripting.com/2005/09/29#When:7:36:29AM\r\n[tech]: http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/29/opml-an-awesome-experiment/\r\n[scoble]: http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/29.html#a11295\r\n[xoxo]: http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084228\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.voidstar.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ce83a8e239c0cfce3488d3fec4d5d8de&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.voidstar.com\">Julian Bond</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084228\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-03T07:50:53\">2005-10-03T07:50:53</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Both groups are right.

It is indeed neat. But I'm still struggling to see the point. Does it just re-invent Gopher? Then there's the inspired chaos of it all. At least with something like DMOZ, Yahoo, Wikipedia, the hierarchy has some formalised structure and editors (perhaps community editors). An open mesh of decentralised outlines is going to have lots of dead ends and missing cross links. Perhaps that's just an artifact of the browser Apps we've seen so far and the breadcrumb approach being used. Perhaps it doesn't matter.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, I'd love to see an OPML browser app written in PHP.

(Such as your XOXO &amp; XSL thing) They're thinking of an entire <em>system</em> of real users, a real application (need / problem to be solved) etc.</p>\n\n<p>The reason Dave Winer and OPML will win this, is because Winer really <em>wants</em> shared outlining on the internet.

He knows how to make interesting applications with like-minded collaborators. </p>\n\n<p>You can come up with a \"better\" format than OPML. You might be able to knock off better code overnight.

He just has a drive to make something happen, and OPML is the simplest thing that can possibly work to do that. </p>\n\n<p>I think that's exactly the right thing to bet on.</p>\n\n<p>When you say \"I’ve become convinced that what group #1 does is best over the long term, as some of the early successes of group #2 may become tottering unbalanced stacks of plates later on.\"</p>\n\n<p>I'd be interested in some real world examples.

Instead, things like wikis and <a href=\"http://www.jotlive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JotSpotLive</a> and <a href=\"http://www.backpackit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backpack</a> and <a href=\"http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SubEthaEdit</a> have been capturing the users.</p>\n\n<p>And now, this latest push doesn't look so much like shared outlining <em>per se</em>, but more like a new attempt at <a href=\"http://dmoz.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DMOZ</a>.  And since Google's pretty much <a href=\"http://www.webworkshop.net/dmoz-2005.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">driven a stake into DMOZ</a>, my further interest in Gopher NG is really just a sometimes-interesting problem.  </p>\n\n<p>I could see some people joining Dave's World Outline effort to get some buzz in their interest niches—trying to be first to get their constituent URLs placed in the new, distributed OPML DMOZ-killer.
