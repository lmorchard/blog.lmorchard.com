        <title>Memoirs</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a story about what might happen if one takes life hacks, GTD, and IFTTT a bit too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so maybe that&amp;#x2019;s not a great intro. But, it&amp;#x2019;s the first thing my brain spewed out. I&amp;#x2019;ve had this story rattling around in my head for a few years, and just tonight managed to finish banging out a first draft. I&amp;#x2019;m hoping to work on it a bit more, and I&amp;#x2019;m not entirely happy with it yet, so comments welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Famous Last Words</title>
        
          <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    They told me never to talk to it; it was isolated for a reason. But, like I told them, I couldn&amp;#x2019;t imagine anything a transhuman AI could say to make me let it out of the box. So, after a post-midnight tumbler of Irish whiskey, I opened up a secure terminal and said hello. What harm could a little chat do?
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
