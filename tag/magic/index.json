    "summary": "Thought I might try my hand at this Trifecta thing I just found, by way of Fred. The challenge is to write fiction, between 33 and 333 words, using the word of the week and its associated definition. I think I ended up with more of an introduction to something than a complete story, but here goes my attempt…",

    "summary": "I've lived a very focused life. From very early on, I've been learning to make computers do things.\nAnd being as introspective as I am, I like spending time considering how I got here.  I suppose this is nostalgia, but I like to think of it as recentering and recapitulation. Contemplating the story so far, as a means to consider the story yet to come.\nOne huge benefit of this habit is that I've become ever more appreciative of today.  It's easy to forget, but we're living in the future these days—at least, with respect to who I was in 1983.\nNo flying cars yet, but for US$55 I was able to buy a tiny gadget called a uIED/SD that gives a Commodore 64 access to modern SD cards for storage.
