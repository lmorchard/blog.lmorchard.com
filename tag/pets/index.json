I didn’t expect it to turn into an overnight vigil - but every time I\ncame close to falling asleep, he’d do something to wake me back up. A meow, a\nmoan, a few times even a paw to my face.

I got him to eat a little more, spent some time petting him, told\nhim good night. He cried as I went down the stairs and closed the door behind\nme. I told myself that he’d be okay in the morning.

They&#8217;re also quick to answer questions.\r\n*   Disqus continues to work well, add features I like, and have yet to disappoint me.\r\n\r\nNow, how about [Evernote][6]? They&#8217;re neck-and-neck with Dropbox for me:\r\n\r\n*   They store all my random thoughts & notes, make them available on all my computers regardless of vendor or OS.\r\n*   I can backup or export my notes and quit whenever I want, and they&#8217;re stored on all my computers.\r\n*   Evernote hasn&#8217;t done anything nasty with my notes, and have only ever made gentle suggestions that I pay or use other services.\r\n*   The Evernote team just keep improving things &#8211; and every time I switch to something like [Notational Velocity on Dropbox][7], I find myself coming back.\r\n\r\nSo, that&#8217;s it: Just a quick handful of thoughts that occurred to me when I was on a walk. I&#8217;m not entirely sure how this translates into execution and a successful business, but I know I like it when it works out this way.\r\n\r\nMight be interesting to muse on this further: Sometimes being treated like a pet is a trap. Sometimes it&#8217;s demeaning. I&#8217;m not entirely sure it&#8217;s a good thing all the time, mostly my point in this post is to describe the feeling.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://dropbox.com\r\n [2]: https://tech.dropbox.com/2012/08/some-love-for-javascript-applications-2/\r\n [3]: http://disqus.com\r\n [4]: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disqus-comment-system/\r\n [5]: http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/666278-introducing-promoted-discovery-and-f-a-q-\r\n [6]: http://evernote.com\r\n [7]: http://www.tuaw.com/2010/02/19/notational-velocity-simplenote-and-dropbox-bring-child-like-wo/",
