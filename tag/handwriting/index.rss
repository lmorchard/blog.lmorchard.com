          <title>Been doing a lot of (hand)writing outside my blog</title>
          
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just realized today that I&#39;ve written my 359th three-page week-daily handwritten journal entry on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.boox.com/collections/all/products/tabultrac&quot;&gt;BOOX Tab Ultra C e-ink tablet&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve also got paper volumes going back to 2017 with similar cadence. That&#39;s a lot of writing that no one but me will probably ever read. But, I do read it, occasionally, to sort myself out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got a back-burnered side project to train a handwriting recognition model to actually convert my journal entries to text. I should get back to that. No off-the-shelf model has yet been able to successfully decipher my script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also got a notion, once I&#39;ve converted my journals, to try feeding them to an LLM - either as a fine-tuned model or searching via RAG. Then, I could maybe pull themes and trends out of my past writing and ask annoying questions of my insufferable past self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description
