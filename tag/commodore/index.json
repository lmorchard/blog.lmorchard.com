    "summary": "<p>I've lived a very focused life. <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital\">From very early on</a>, I've been learning to make computers do things.</p>\n<p>And being as introspective as I am, I like spending time considering how I got here.  I suppose this is nostalgia, but I like to think of it as recentering and recapitulation. Contemplating the story so far, as a means to consider the story yet to come.</p>\n<p>One huge benefit of this habit is that I've become ever more appreciative of today.  It's easy to forget, but we're living in the future these days—at least, with respect to <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital\">who I was in 1983</a>.</p>\n<p>No flying cars yet, but for US$55 I was able to <a href=\"http://www.jbrain.net/products/uIEC%7B47%7DSD.html\">buy a tiny gadget called a uIED/SD</a> that gives a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64\">Commodore 64</a> access to modern SD cards for storage.  And, of course, I have <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2503\">Jason Scott's review of the more general-use FC5025 5.25? Floppy to USB Adapter</a> to blame in getting me started on this current mini-obsession.</p>\n<p>You want to talk about a magical device? Screw the iPad—this is magic.  </p>\n<p>This is what it looks like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/4486021528/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/4486021528_ce7ff4fc35.jpg\"></a></p>\n",
