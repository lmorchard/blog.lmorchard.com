I&#39;m productive and successful. I work from home.\nI shop from home. My main hobbies—writing, reading, tinkering, gaming—they&#39;re\nall things I usually do at home.

She reminds me that other people exist and need to be\nconsidered.</p>\n<p>She&#39;s also a lot of fun to be around and my life would not be\npossible without her.\n<br style=\"clear: both\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"relatively-functional-adult\">Relatively functional adult</h2>\n<p>That said, I do manage to strike out on <em>some</em> expeditions.  Grocery shopping,\nthough a challenge, is a thing I&#39;ve been known to do. We order take-out and I\noften pick it up. Haircuts and doctor visits are harder.</p>\n<p>So I guess I&#39;m a relatively functional adult. I&#39;ve read that it&#39;s\nusually only worth addressing a condition if it affects your ability to live\nand achieve goals. I do a lot of that. I&#39;m doing pretty well—so why change it?</p>\n<p>But, I often forget that this hermitage is bounded by anxiety, because I&#39;ve so\nsuccessfully built my adult life within that delimited space. There <em>are</em>\ntimes when I would like to interact with live people. That&#39;s usually from a\nperspective of great conceptual distance, like when I&#39;m <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/2017/01/31/pages-and-pens/\">writing in my\njournal</a>. </p>\n<p>I think of myself as the kind of person who <em>should</em> participate in events\nlike <a href=\"https://2017.penguicon.org/\">Penguicon</a>. I imagine I&#39;m the kind of person who <em>should</em> be an active\ncommunity member at a maker space like <a href=\"https://www.i3detroit.org/\">i3Detroit</a>. You <em>should</em> see me\noften at Detroit-area gaming &amp; tech meetups. I <em>should</em> have many nerdy\nfriends with whom I meet often and have great times.</p>\n<p>In reality, I am an elusive hermit of whom sightings are rare. When you\n<em>do</em> see me, it&#39;s likely that I&#39;m pushing down some serious terror. I may act\nawkward &amp; spazzy. I may look shifty and have my eyes on the exits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"on-being-gelatinous\">On being gelatinous</h2>\n<p>Here&#39;s a thing that happens a lot: Say there&#39;s an event I&#39;d like to attend—one\nof the fortnightly <a href=\"https://www.i3detroit.org/\">i3Detroit</a> <a href=\"https://www.i3detroit.org/wiki/Main_Page\">member meetings</a>, for example. When the\nday comes, I start getting nervous when I get out of bed. By afternoon, I&#39;m\nfeeling worn down by the day. I start telling myself I should just\nskip it. And this is also how I end up just kind of disappearing from things:\nIf I skip enough times, it starts to feel like that&#39;s not a thing I do\nanymore—and going back is awkward.</p>\n<img class=\"inset right\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tj8RNJyjuq8/V7zt0vRot7I/AAAAAAAAaoY/ae-HGggy-jYoB3BR6jAqyYikJdX_3igGgCLcB/s1600/Odo.gif\" />\n\n<p>If I&#39;m lucky, I can summon up this kind of Super Mario Star Power\nstate where I can be &quot;<strong>on</strong>&quot; and pass for human temporarily—before collapsing\ninto a gelatinous blob once I&#39;m alone again. Huge success! I did the thing and\nit wasn&#39;t so bad!</p>\n<p>If I&#39;m not so lucky, I manage to do the thing but I&#39;m a wreck about it. Once,\nI had to spend ten minutes with my head down on the steering wheel in a\nparking lot trying to pull myself together before an event. I fought down the\nurge to sob from frustration. I dragged myself in by sheer willpower, but I\nwanted to retreat at each stage: putting on shoes; getting my bag; turning the\nkey in the car; driving to the venue; leaving the car; walking in the door.</p>\n<h2 id=\"this-strange-year\">This strange year</h2>\n<p>Addressing this problem has taken on new importance this year: I feel compelled\nto do strange &amp; new things—like make daily phone calls to my\nrepresentatives in government and politely inform them of my preferences.\nEverywhere, I read things like &quot;<a href=\"https://dailyaction.org/\">in 90 seconds... be done with\nit</a>&quot; or &quot;<a href=\"https://5calls.org/\">spend 5 minutes, make 5\ncalls</a>&quot; and I laugh &amp; laugh. It turns a bit maniacal,\nthis laughing.</p>\n<p>It takes me <strong>hours</strong> to make calls: That includes build up &amp;\nprocrastination beforehand, as well as the subsequent release of nervous\nenergy afterward. Or, of course, there&#39;s the extended self-flagellation if I\ndon&#39;t manage to dial the phone. Doesn&#39;t matter that I&#39;m not leaving the\nhouse—phone calls are just as bad as anything else!</p>\n<h2 id=\"it-takes-a-steady-hand\">It takes a steady hand!</h2>\n<p>It feels like that old battery-powered game Operation. It goes like\nso: You have metal tweezers. You need to extract plastic bones from\nmetal-rimmed recesses in the game board. If your tweezers contact the sides, a\nharsh buzzer blares and you lose.</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe class=\"lazyload\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_6MAkLJ79LE?ecver=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Extracting a positive outcome from my head is like that: If I can thread\nmyself through the anxious thoughts and not touch any of them, I win. I can do\nthe thing easily. But, if I touch any of those thoughts with attention, they\nall pile in on me and I lose. I still might be able to do the thing, but only\nwith an exhausting effort of will. And then, there&#39;s little energy left to use\nduring the event itself.</p>\n<p>This forms a cycle: The next time I consider doing a thing, I remember the\ngamble. Can I turn on the Star Man Power? Or will this be an uphill climb with\na parking log sobbing session at the peak? It&#39;s not always predicable. The\nsame regular event can summon up either outcome. I&#39;ve given talks before large\ngroups and felt good before &amp; after. I&#39;ve gone to a friend&#39;s house for a\nsmall party and felt like sprinting away.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem-with-this-problem\">The problem with this problem</h2>\n<p>And here&#39;s the meta-problem: Knowing all of the above doesn&#39;t seem to help. So\nsilly at a rational distance, yet it always catches me by surprise in the\nmoment of truth. Still, I often wonder—is this real? Am I being melodramatic?\nIs this just some kind of habitual affectation in which I&#39;ve decided to\nwallow? Can&#39;t I just suck it up and power through like everyone else\napparently does? Should I even be writing this precious little blog post?</p>\n<p>Why <em>am</em> I writing this blog post, anyway? My inner critics accuse me of seeking\nattention, but that doesn&#39;t quite seem like me. If anything, I want these\nthoughts out of my head for the sake of catharsis. I wouldn&#39;t mind connecting\nwith other folks who are going through this too. Additionally, I suppose it\ncould serve as an explanation to folks who might be confused by why I&#39;m such\nan elusive hermit. </p>\n<h2 id=\"so-uh-what-now\">So, uh, what now?</h2>\n<p>I don&#39;t really know what to do from here.  I turned 41 last year and I&#39;ve\nbeen dealing with this issue for most of those decades. I&#39;m under no delusion\nthat I&#39;ll find some magic self-help cheat code to turn it around. </p>\n<p>I guess I&#39;m just going to keep plugging away at it, trying to alter my habits\nand trying to do the things.  Maybe having written this and admitting the\nproblem will help? Maybe this makes my efforts this year more real?</p>\n<p>Who knows? But, feel free to chime in with comments!</p>\n<script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=markdown textwidth=78: -->\n",

Grocery shopping,\nthough a challenge, is a thing I've been known to do. We order take-out and I\noften pick it up. Haircuts and doctor visits are harder.\n\nSo I guess I'm a relatively functional adult. I've read that it's\nusually only worth addressing a condition if it affects your ability to live\nand achieve goals. I do a lot of that. I'm doing pretty well—so why change it?\n\nBut, I often forget that this hermitage is bounded by anxiety, because I've so\nsuccessfully built my adult life within that delimited space. There *are*\ntimes when I would like to interact with live people. That's usually from a\nperspective of great conceptual distance, like when I'm [writing in my\njournal][]. \n\nI think of myself as the kind of person who *should* participate in events\nlike [Penguicon][]. I imagine I'm the kind of person who *should* be an active\ncommunity member at a maker space like [i3Detroit][]. You *should* see me\noften at Detroit-area gaming & tech meetups. I *should* have many nerdy\nfriends with whom I meet often and have great times.\n\nIn reality, I am an elusive hermit of whom sightings are rare. When you\n*do* see me, it's likely that I'm pushing down some serious terror. I may act\nawkward & spazzy. I may look shifty and have my eyes on the exits.\n\n## On being gelatinous\n\nHere's a thing that happens a lot: Say there's an event I'd like to attend—one\nof the fortnightly [i3Detroit][] [member meetings][], for example. When the\nday comes, I start getting nervous when I get out of bed. By afternoon, I'm\nfeeling worn down by the day. I start telling myself I should just\nskip it. And this is also how I end up just kind of disappearing from things:\nIf I skip enough times, it starts to feel like that's not a thing I do\nanymore—and going back is awkward.\n\n[member meetings]: https://www.i3detroit.org/wiki/Main_Page\n\n<img class=\"inset right\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tj8RNJyjuq8/V7zt0vRot7I/AAAAAAAAaoY/ae-HGggy-jYoB3BR6jAqyYikJdX_3igGgCLcB/s1600/Odo.gif\" />\n\nIf I'm lucky, I can summon up this kind of Super Mario Star Power\nstate where I can be \"**on**\" and pass for human temporarily—before collapsing\ninto a gelatinous blob once I'm alone again. Huge success! I did the thing and\nit wasn't so bad!\n\nIf I'm not so lucky, I manage to do the thing but I'm a wreck about it. Once,\nI had to spend ten minutes with my head down on the steering wheel in a\nparking lot trying to pull myself together before an event. I fought down the\nurge to sob from frustration. I dragged myself in by sheer willpower, but I\nwanted to retreat at each stage: putting on shoes; getting my bag; turning the\nkey in the car; driving to the venue; leaving the car; walking in the door.\n\n## This strange year\n\nAddressing this problem has taken on new importance this year: I feel compelled\nto do strange & new things—like make daily phone calls to my\nrepresentatives in government and politely inform them of my preferences.\nEverywhere, I read things like \"[in 90 seconds... be done with\nit](https://dailyaction.org/)\" or \"[spend 5 minutes, make 5\ncalls](https://5calls.org/)\" and I laugh & laugh. It turns a bit maniacal,\nthis laughing.\n\nIt takes me **hours** to make calls: That includes build up &\nprocrastination beforehand, as well as the subsequent release of nervous\nenergy afterward. Or, of course, there's the extended self-flagellation if I\ndon't manage to dial the phone. Doesn't matter that I'm not leaving the\nhouse—phone calls are just as bad as anything else!\n\n## It takes a steady hand!\n\nIt feels like that old battery-powered game Operation. It goes like\nso: You have metal tweezers. You need to extract plastic bones from\nmetal-rimmed recesses in the game board. If your tweezers contact the sides, a\nharsh buzzer blares and you lose.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe class=\"lazyload\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_6MAkLJ79LE?ecver=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nExtracting a positive outcome from my head is like that: If I can thread\nmyself through the anxious thoughts and not touch any of them, I win. I can do\nthe thing easily. But, if I touch any of those thoughts with attention, they\nall pile in on me and I lose. I still might be able to do the thing, but only\nwith an exhausting effort of will. And then, there's little energy left to use\nduring the event itself.\n\nThis forms a cycle: The next time I consider doing a thing, I remember the\ngamble. Can I turn on the Star Man Power? Or will this be an uphill climb with\na parking log sobbing session at the peak? It's not always predicable. The\nsame regular event can summon up either outcome. I've given talks before large\ngroups and felt good before & after. I've gone to a friend's house for a\nsmall party and felt like sprinting away.\n\n## The problem with this problem\n\nAnd here's the meta-problem: Knowing all of the above doesn't seem to help. So\nsilly at a rational distance, yet it always catches me by surprise in the\nmoment of truth. Still, I often wonder—is this real? Am I being melodramatic?\nIs this just some kind of habitual affectation in which I've decided to\nwallow? Can't I just suck it up and power through like everyone else\napparently does? Should I even be writing this precious little blog post?\n\nWhy *am* I writing this blog post, anyway? My inner critics accuse me of seeking\nattention, but that doesn't quite seem like me. If anything, I want these\nthoughts out of my head for the sake of catharsis. I wouldn't mind connecting\nwith other folks who are going through this too. Additionally, I suppose it\ncould serve as an explanation to folks who might be confused by why I'm such\nan elusive hermit. \n\n## So, uh, what now?\n\nI don't really know what to do from here.  I turned 41 last year and I've\nbeen dealing with this issue for most of those decades. I'm under no delusion\nthat I'll find some magic self-help cheat code to turn it around. \n\nI guess I'm just going to keep plugging away at it, trying to alter my habits\nand trying to do the things.  Maybe having written this and admitting the\nproblem will help? Maybe this makes my efforts this year more real?\n\nWho knows? But, feel free to chime in with comments!\n\n[i3Detroit]: https://www.i3detroit.org/\n[Penguicon]: https://2017.penguicon.org/\n[writing in my journal]: https://blog.lmorchard.com/2017/01/31/pages-and-pens/\n\n<script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=markdown textwidth=78: -->\n",

So, why not toots?\r\n\r\n[def]: http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/text\r\n[toot]: https://github.com/lmorchard/toothub/tree/ea774e76c7688e33ca5ec8144d13ae1a4c1546da#what\r\n\r\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=78: -->\r\n",

Instead, Amazon offers my app some simple profile details &#8211; user ID, email, & full name.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  But, having access to your Amazon identity offers even more power:\n</p>\n\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  Clicking &#8220;<a href=\"http://login.amazon.com/\">Login with Amazon</a>&#8221; gives your Amazon identity to my app.\n</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  My app can use your Amazon identity to assume a temporary role.\n</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  This temporary role enables use of a portion of an S3 bucket.\n</li>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  This is hewing pretty close to <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/09/separating-publishing-from-hosting-on-the-web\">the publishing app / hosting service notions I laid out in my last post</a>. So, how does it work?\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  Well, one of the things my app receives when you click the &#8220;Login&#8221; button is an <a href=\"http://login.amazon.com/glossary#access_token\"><code>access_token</code></a>. Chasing that <code>access_token</code> down the rabbit hole, I rediscovered Amazon IAM and STS &#8211; <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">Identity & Access Management</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html\">Secure Token Service</a>.\n</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  <span id=\"IAM_and_Roles\">IAM and Roles</span>\n</h2>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  Among other things, Amazon IAM lets you define roles and associate them with apps. Roles contain policies that grant access to resources controlled by your account &#8211; e.g. an S3 bucket.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  For example, here&#8217;s a policy snippet for a role I created on IAM:\n</p>\n\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\" style=\"text-align: left;\">{\n \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n \"Action\": [\n   \"s3:PutObject\",\n   \"s3:PutObjectAcl\",\n   \"s3:DeleteObject\",\n   \"s3:GetObject\",\n   \"s3:GetObjectAcl\"\n ],\n \"Resource\": [\n   \"arn:aws:s3:::tootr/users/amazon/${www.amazon.com:user_id}\",\n   \"arn:aws:s3:::tootr/users/amazon/${www.amazon.com:user_id}/*\"\n ]\n}</pre>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  This role grants access to GET, PUT, & DELETE web resources in my S3 bucket named &#8220;tootr&#8221; &#8211; but only as long as the resources are under the &#8220;<code>users/amazon/{USER_ID}</code>&#8221; URLspace, where <code>{USER_ID}</code> is a uniquely generated identifier supplied by an Amazon profile.\n</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  <span id=\"STS_and_Temporary_Credentials\">STS and Temporary Credentials</span>\n</h2>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  So, how can someone assume such a role? That&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr/blob/master/src/javascript/publishers/AmazonS3.js#L103\">where Amazon STS comes in</a>:\n</p>\n\n<pre style=\"text-align: left;\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">$.ajax('https://sts.amazonaws.com/?' + $.param({\n\n  'Action': 'AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity',\n  'Version': '2011-06-15',\n  'RoleArn': 'arn:aws:iam::8675309:role/tootr-amazon-user-buckets',\n  'RoleSessionName': 'web-identity-federation',\n  'ProviderId': 'www.amazon.com',\n  'DurationSeconds': '900',\n  'WebIdentityToken': access_token\n\n})).then(function (dataXML, status, xhr) {\n\n  var data = <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr/blob/master/src/javascript/misc.js#L11\">misc.xmlToObj</a>(dataXML);\n  var credentials = data\n    .AssumeRoleWithWebIdentityResponse\n    .AssumeRoleWithWebIdentityResult\n    .Credentials;\n\n});</code></pre>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  The <code>RoleArn</code> parameter identifies the IAM role created earlier. The <code>access_token</code> is what my app got when you logged in. The <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html\"><code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> API on Amazon STS</a> lets me <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr/blob/master/src/javascript/publishers/AmazonS3.js#L103\">connect the two and generate temporary credentials</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  Those credentials look something like this:\n</p>\n\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\" style=\"text-align: left;\">{\n  \"SessionToken\":\"NIweiunfiunIUWNLFIsd87\",\n  \"Expiration\":\"2014-10-11T19:15:58Z\",\n  \"AccessKeyId\":\"ASIAQWERTYUIOP\",\n  \"SecretAccessKey\":\"SKLN9869KJnisdhfli\"\n}</pre>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  As it turns out, <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr/blob/master/src/javascript/publishers/AmazonS3.js#L148\">these credentials work with Amazon S3</a>. So, after accepting a login and doing the <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> dance, my app can manage web hosting at Amazon S3 on your behalf.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  For further reading, check out &#8220;<a href=\"docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/CreatingWIF.html\">Creating Temporary Security Credentials for Mobile Apps Using Identity Providers</a>&#8221; in Amazon&#8217;s documentation. That&#8217;s from where I stole most of this stuff.\n</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  <span id=\"Demo_time_and_next_steps\">Demo time and next steps</span>\n</h2>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  I&#8217;ve rolled all of this into <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr\">a microblogging app called &#8220;tootr&#8221;</a>. Here&#8217;s a demo:\n</p>\n\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  <a href=\"https://lmorchard.github.io/tootr/\">https://lmorchard.github.io/tootr/</a>\n</li>\n\n<p>You can visit the app, click &#8220;Login with Amazon&#8221;, and you&#8217;ll soon be tooting up a storm. But, you should notice some serious drawbacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The app is terrible and missing almost every interesting feature.</li>\n<li>Your username is something like <a href=\"https://tootr.s3.amazonaws.com/users/amazon/amzn1.account.AF5OSES2YSFJEKYBANBHRFB25RXQ/index.html\">AF5OSES2YSFJEKYBANBHRFB25RXQ</a> and that&#8217;s also terrible.</li>\n<li>You&#8217;re tooting into my Amazon S3 bucket. You&#8217;re not paying me or Amazon. I <em>will</em> vandalize &amp; delete your stuff and not feel bad about it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a proof-of-concept, though, I think it works: The &#8220;tootr&#8221; app at <a href=\"https://lmorchard.github.io/tootr/\">lmorchard.github.io</a> publishes to a hosting API at <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com\">s3.amazonaws.com</a>. The on-ramp is a single button click and an Amazon sign-in dialog.</p>\n<p>But, I think all the above issues can be addressed. Also, Amazon is an interesting core for this stuff: Many people have an Amazon account, and Amazon is a place where people generally pay for things. So, it&#8217;s different territory than most social media sites.</p>\n<p>The challenge will be keeping the on-ramp simple while improving the app and switching to a user-owned web hosting space. Still, I think this is promising stuff. At any rate, it&#8217;s tinkering I&#8217;ve been procrastinating for years now, so I&#8217;ve got plenty of ideas to chase down.</p>\n",

The <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html\"><code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> API on Amazon STS</a> lets me <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr/blob/master/src/javascript/publishers/AmazonS3.js#L103\">connect the two and generate temporary credentials</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  Those credentials look something like this:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\" style=\"text-align: left;\">{\r\n  \"SessionToken\":\"NIweiunfiunIUWNLFIsd87\",\r\n  \"Expiration\":\"2014-10-11T19:15:58Z\",\r\n  \"AccessKeyId\":\"ASIAQWERTYUIOP\",\r\n  \"SecretAccessKey\":\"SKLN9869KJnisdhfli\"\r\n}</pre>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  As it turns out, <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr/blob/master/src/javascript/publishers/AmazonS3.js#L148\">these credentials work with Amazon S3</a>. So, after accepting a login and doing the <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> dance, my app can manage web hosting at Amazon S3 on your behalf.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  For further reading, check out &#8220;<a href=\"docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/CreatingWIF.html\">Creating Temporary Security Credentials for Mobile Apps Using Identity Providers</a>&#8221; in Amazon&#8217;s documentation. That&#8217;s from where I stole most of this stuff.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  <span id=\"Demo_time_and_next_steps\">Demo time and next steps</span>\r\n</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  I&#8217;ve rolled all of this into <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr\">a microblogging app called &#8220;tootr&#8221;</a>. Here&#8217;s a demo:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  <a href=\"https://lmorchard.github.io/tootr/\">https://lmorchard.github.io/tootr/</a>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\nYou can visit the app, click &#8220;Login with Amazon&#8221;, and you&#8217;ll soon be tooting up a storm. But, you should notice some serious drawbacks:\r\n\r\n*   The app is terrible and missing almost every interesting feature.\r\n*   Your username is something like [AF5OSES2YSFJEKYBANBHRFB25RXQ][3] and that&#8217;s also terrible.\r\n*   You&#8217;re tooting into my Amazon S3 bucket. You&#8217;re not paying me or Amazon. I *will* vandalize & delete your stuff and not feel bad about it.\r\n\r\nAs a proof-of-concept, though, I think it works: The &#8220;tootr&#8221; app at [lmorchard.github.io][4] publishes to a hosting API at [s3.amazonaws.com][5]. The on-ramp is a single button click and an Amazon sign-in dialog.\r\n\r\nBut, I think all the above issues can be addressed. Also, Amazon is an interesting core for this stuff: Many people have an Amazon account, and Amazon is a place where people generally pay for things. So, it&#8217;s different territory than most social media sites.\r\n\r\nThe challenge will be keeping the on-ramp simple while improving the app and switching to a user-owned web hosting space. Still, I think this is promising stuff. At any rate, it&#8217;s tinkering I&#8217;ve been procrastinating for years now, so I&#8217;ve got plenty of ideas to chase down.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/08/microblogging-like-its-2002\r\n [2]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/09/separating-publishing-from-hosting-on-the-web\r\n [3]: https://tootr.s3.amazonaws.com/users/amazon/amzn1.account.AF5OSES2YSFJEKYBANBHRFB25RXQ/index.html\r\n [4]: https://lmorchard.github.io/tootr/\r\n [5]: http://s3.amazonaws.com\r\n",

It&#8217;s sometimes after Twitter or Facebook does something cruddy to remind me that I&#8217;m the product. Sometimes, it&#8217;s when jerks have the run of the place and no one can do anything about it. Often these things are highly correlated.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"silos--sovereignty\"><span id=\"Silos_Sovereignty\">Silos &amp; Sovereignty</span></h2>\n<p>To just build another silo would be a mistake. So, as usual, my thinking strays toward decentralization &amp; user sovereignty. That is, empower people to put their stuff in lots of different places online that treat them like royalty &#8211; often because they&#8217;re paying customers.</p>\n<p>Historically, this tends to offer a terrible experience. To write on your own piece of the web, for example, you have to rent a domain &amp; a server. Then, get some kind of publishing tool working. Oh, and be sure to keep everything updated &amp; running.</p>\n<p>All of this requires hours of study and tinkering better spent doing something else. You know, like the things that prompted you to have thoughts worth sharing in the first place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-great-big-block-party-on-the-web\"><span id=\"The_Great_Big_Block_Party_on_the_Web\">The Great Big Block Party on the Web</span></h2>\n<p>Still, circa 2002 or so, we had us a great big block party on the web. The experience was so compelling that plenty of full- and part-time geeks braved the tech gauntlet to participate in the emergent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere\">blogosphere</a>. Good times, fun hacks.</p>\n<p>But, some folks had notions to make this even easier &amp; more accessible &#8211; and thereby rope in a much broader swath of humanity. Ditch decentralization. Simplify discovery. Provide the servers and the software. Improve the on-ramps. Make it free-as-in-beer.</p>\n<p>And it worked. The network effects of throwing open the doors on massive party silos soon dwarfed our little hobby homesteads on the open web. By the time I get a proper blog running and build myself <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_blogging#B\">a blogroll</a>, you&#8217;ve already gotten on both Twitter and Facebook and started making fun of me with all your new friends.</p>\n<p>However much I might grouse about the fix we find ourselves in now, it&#8217;s undeniable that these social networking silos have had massive success in connecting people around the world. You know, that thing we always dreamed the Internet would do?</p>\n<h2 id=\"free-as-in-lunch\"><span id=\"Free_as_in_Lunch\">Free as in Lunch</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch\">There ain&#8217;t no such thing as a free lunch</a>, though. Servers, developers, and bandwidth all cost money. As it turns out, though, having all these people partying in one place generates a big steaming heap of attention &amp; data.

It&#8217;s sometimes after Twitter or Facebook does something cruddy to remind me that I&#8217;m the product. Sometimes, it&#8217;s when jerks have the run of the place and no one can do anything about it. Often these things are highly correlated.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Silos_Sovereignty\">Silos & Sovereignty</span>\r\n\r\nTo just build another silo would be a mistake. So, as usual, my thinking strays toward decentralization & user sovereignty. That is, empower people to put their stuff in lots of different places online that treat them like royalty &#8211; often because they&#8217;re paying customers.\r\n\r\nHistorically, this tends to offer a terrible experience. To write on your own piece of the web, for example, you have to rent a domain & a server. Then, get some kind of publishing tool working. Oh, and be sure to keep everything updated & running.\r\n\r\nAll of this requires hours of study and tinkering better spent doing something else. You know, like the things that prompted you to have thoughts worth sharing in the first place.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"The_Great_Big_Block_Party_on_the_Web\">The Great Big Block Party on the Web</span>\r\n\r\nStill, circa 2002 or so, we had us a great big block party on the web. The experience was so compelling that plenty of full- and part-time geeks braved the tech gauntlet to participate in the emergent [blogosphere][2]. Good times, fun hacks.\r\n\r\nBut, some folks had notions to make this even easier & more accessible &#8211; and thereby rope in a much broader swath of humanity. Ditch decentralization. Simplify discovery. Provide the servers and the software. Improve the on-ramps. Make it free-as-in-beer.\r\n\r\nAnd it worked. The network effects of throwing open the doors on massive party silos soon dwarfed our little hobby homesteads on the open web. By the time I get a proper blog running and build myself [a blogroll][3], you&#8217;ve already gotten on both Twitter and Facebook and started making fun of me with all your new friends.\r\n\r\nHowever much I might grouse about the fix we find ourselves in now, it&#8217;s undeniable that these social networking silos have had massive success in connecting people around the world. You know, that thing we always dreamed the Internet would do?\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Free_as_in_Lunch\">Free as in Lunch</span>\r\n\r\n[There ain&#8217;t no such thing as a free lunch][4], though. Servers, developers, and bandwidth all cost money. As it turns out, though, having all these people partying in one place generates a big steaming heap of attention & data. Certain parties are willing to pay for (or semi-legally demand) access to this rich humus, because it helps their businesses grow.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate thing, though, is that this optimizes for treating people like organic waste. The only real concern is that you don&#8217;t raise too much of a stink and just keep stewing in the pile producing valuable nutrients.\r\n\r\nThat&#8217;s what it means to be the product rather than the customer.

One might ask the guests&#8217; opinion about the bonfire &#8211; but that&#8217;s just being a gracious host.\r\n\r\nA better scenario might be if the homeowner decided to start filming a reality show. Still, I think you agreed to a release at the door. It might have even been printed the plastic cups, and drinking the beer sealed the deal. That release covered this contingency, no matter how intuitively distasteful it seems. (Sounds shady to me, but then so do terms of service pages.)\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"The_cake_eating_vs_having_it\">The cake: eating vs having it</span>\r\n\r\nYou can&#8217;t both pay to party by supplying your content and then later claim ownership of the payment. You ate the cake; you can&#8217;t take it home after. You can express your feelings of stomach ache (which is also content), but the lesson here is Facebook never was and never will be a private space. There might have been perceived partitions at one point, but those partitions can move whenever the homeowners want.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Where_to_go_from_here\">Where to go from here</span>\r\n\r\nAs I see it, you have three options:\r\n\r\n1.  Pay to create your own private social spaces on the web. That, at least, [makes you the customer][9].\r\n2.  Accept Facebook for what it is: A party in a stranger&#8217;s backyard, at which you are both a guest and [the product on sale][9].\r\n3.  Lobby your lawmakers to outlaw what Facebook does with your content. Good luck.\r\n\r\nI&#8217;m willing to bet #1 and #2 are cheaper and much more practical than #3.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/24/freedom-of-from-choice#p[Dygtcp]\r\n [2]: http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/yes-facebook-this-was-a-privacy-bungle-heres-what-you-shouldve-done.php#comment-667692804\r\n [3]: http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/yes-facebook-this-was-a-privacy-bungle-heres-what-you-shouldve-done.php\r\n [4]: http://www.readwriteweb.com/\r\n [5]: http://video.adultswim.com/robot-chicken/this-deals-getting-worse-all-the-time.html\r\n [6]: http://tos-dr.info/\r\n [7]: http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/21/sponsored-stories-lawsuit/\r\n [8]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre#.22Free_beer.22_vs_.22free_speech.22_distinction\r\n [9]: http://www.metafilter.com/95152/Userdriven-discontent#3256046",

With the <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms\">Activity Stream</a> and <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PuSH</a>\naugmentations, users could connect their profiles with each of the\nother Mozilla sites they use.

It's using core template loaders and shortcuts, so switching over to standard stuff shouldn't be an issue for the views and models.\nI'm hoping at some point to put together some more Django-conventional template tags and templates toward that end, unless someone gets to it before me in a pull request (patches welcome!). Really, I think the template tags are the more important thing, since any templates out of the box will likely get overridden on a real site.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-301119028\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.integrating-technology.org/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/nelliemuller.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.integrating-technology.org/\">Dr. Nellie Deutsch</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-301119028\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-09-02T14:07:45\">2011-09-02T14:07:45</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I love the idea, Leslie.  I've been heading a self-funded organization that provides free online professional development workshops for educators around the world since 2006.

(I'd even got as far as knocking up a data-model in web2py.) And then I saw this.\r\n\r\nI quickly cloned and tried out your app with an ordinary Django project but it's blowing up without jingo and I guess other Playdoh related modules.

It's using core template loaders and shortcuts, so switching over to standard stuff shouldn't be an issue for the views and models.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping at some point to put together some more Django-conventional template tags and templates toward that end, unless someone gets to it before me in a pull request (patches welcome!). Really, I think the template tags are the more important thing, since any templates out of the box will likely get overridden on a real site.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-301119028\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.integrating-technology.org/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/nelliemuller.jpg\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.integrating-technology.org/\">Dr. Nellie Deutsch</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-301119028\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-09-02T14:07:45\">2011-09-02T14:07:45</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I love the idea, Leslie.  I've been heading a self-funded organization that provides free online professional development workshops for educators around the world since 2006.

Welcome to the Social? Screw that. Welcome to my front lawn, kids, and you're welcome to get off of it. :)</p>\n<p>All kidding aside, I think there's plenty of room for any kind of project people want to put together. I thought KDE and GNOME were silly for trying to recreate CDE, but they saw further than CDE. Had I been vocal, I might have dissuaded someone from contributing to the project. What kind of an asshole would I have been had I kept one of the main developers of these projects from developing? So, if Twitter, MySpace, Live Journal, or one of the hundreds of other social networks speaks to someone, by all means have fun. Me? I might check out Twitter. Most of the bands I like have MySapce pages now, so I think it'll be inevitable before I start a MySpace account. </p>\n<p>Heck, it took me a while before I started up my Last.fm account, so one thing at a time. :)</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084311\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.net\">CraigM</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084311\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-05-16T21:53:52\">2007-05-16T21:53:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Oh, and my lovely corporate overlords think Twitter might lead to dating or personals, so they've helpfully blocked it.

But neither of us are alone.</p>\n<p>Second, I am a big MMO guy, and use plenty of other social media tools (hell, my last two startups were community/social media plays.)</p>\n<p>Third, the whole point of my original post was to point out the very old business trap that a particular young entrepreneur was about to fall into.</p>\n<p>If you get value out of Twitter, great.

What you said really prompted me to comment on what I've seen happen over and over again, so it's not just (or even mostly) you.</p>\n<p>Though, when you write \"stop worrying about creating mindless tools to keep track of everything your friends are doing, and start solving real problems\" - I have to respond that keeping track of everything your friends are doing is a real problem some people want solved. :)  Now, whether there's still room in that market beyond Twitter... well, I dunno.  I have a hunch yes, that they're onto something big - but I'm not personally putting money down on it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the point I take your post otherwise is that just being a copy-cat isn't enough.  Twitter's addressing a problem for some people.  That problem might have room to be solved more effectively.

Granted, people can be insane, but it really is more likely that you're missing something - even if it's just that there's a particular brand of entertaining insanity in progress to which you're not attuned.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084309\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\">CraigM</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084309\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-05-16T21:46:56\">2007-05-16T21:46:56</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>No, I'm pretty much missing out on the appeal of MySpace and Twitter, but that's because I'm an electronic hermit. Welcome to the Social? Screw that. Welcome to my front lawn, kids, and you're welcome to get off of it. :)</p>\n\n<p>All kidding aside, I think there's plenty of room for any kind of project people want to put together. I thought KDE and GNOME were silly for trying to recreate CDE, but they saw further than CDE. Had I been vocal, I might have dissuaded someone from contributing to the project. What kind of an asshole would I have been had I kept one of the main developers of these projects from developing? So, if Twitter, MySpace, Live Journal, or one of the hundreds of other social networks speaks to someone, by all means have fun. Me? I might check out Twitter. Most of the bands I like have MySapce pages now, so I think it'll be inevitable before I start a MySpace account. </p>\n\n<p>Heck, it took me a while before I started up my Last.fm account, so one thing at a time. :)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084311\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\">CraigM</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084311\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-05-16T21:53:52\">2007-05-16T21:53:52</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Oh, and my lovely corporate overlords think Twitter might lead to dating or personals, so they've helpfully blocked it.

I simply stated my own dislike of the tool. Twitter is a very polarizing tool - if you find value in it, great. But neither of us are alone.</p>\n\n<p>Second, I am a big MMO guy, and use plenty of other social media tools (hell, my last two startups were community/social media plays.)</p>\n\n<p>Third, the whole point of my original post was to point out the very old business trap that a particular young entrepreneur was about to fall into.</p>\n\n<p>If you get value out of Twitter, great.  That wasn't my point.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers.\nScott</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084313\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084313\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-05-17T06:51:11\">2007-05-17T06:51:11</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@CraigM: Being a digital hermit, now that's a perfectly fine and reasonable excuse to miss out on Twitter and MySpace.

What you said really prompted me to comment on what I've seen happen over and over again, so it's not just (or even mostly) you.</p>\n\n<p>Though, when you write \"stop worrying about creating mindless tools to keep track of everything your friends are doing, and start solving real problems\" - I have to respond that keeping track of everything your friends are doing is a real problem some people want solved. :)  Now, whether there's still room in that market beyond Twitter... well, I dunno.  I have a hunch yes, that they're onto something big - but I'm not personally putting money down on it.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the point I take your post otherwise is that just being a copy-cat isn't enough.  Twitter's addressing a problem for some people.  That problem might have room to be solved more effectively.  But, if you can't figure that out, or if the problem's really not that deep, then yeah:  Find something else to make.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084315\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://howtosplitanatom.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=78b54231739cec1bbd916962715fac5e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://howtosplitanatom.com/\">Steve S</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084315\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-05-24T14:38:59\">2007-05-24T14:38:59</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Twitter is in no way useless, simple maybe but not useless.
