          <description>TL;DR: There are no ushers on Mastodon. There&#39;s no one paid to show you to your seat, no one whose job it is to ease you into comfort and remove friction.</description>

          <title>Random thoughts for 2014 Oct 23</title>
          <description>TL;DR: This is a bunch of stuff I just randomly collected throughout the day.
Look here for a bit of explanation. I may or may not do this again.
I&#39;m experimenting and entertaining myself.</description>

          <title>Toot = Tiny Outburst of Text</title>
          <description>I&#39;ve been toying with something Twitterish lately, and thought I needed a
different word to describe the central social object. So, I started using
toot, which means &quot;tiny outburst of text&quot;. Of course, I started by
making fart jokes to myself before that expansion appeared in my head. But, I
think it&#39;s fun.</description>

          <title>tootr: microblogging app, hosting not included</title>
          <description>In my last two posts, I wrote about how I’ve been thinking about building yet another microblogging tool and how I think it might be interesting to separate web publishing apps from web hosting. Well, I started tinkering, and I’ve got a rough prototype working.</description>

          <title>Separating publishing from hosting on the web</title>
          <description>Social media like Twitter and Facebook combine web publishing and hosting. You can’t run different software, and you can’t move your stuff. So, if you’re unhappy, your choices are a) deal with it or b) abandon your stuff and your friends. Those are pretty rough options.
But, what if you could move your stuff? And what if you could switch apps?</description>

          <title>Microblogging like it&amp;#8217;s 2002</title>
          <description>Every year or so, I (re)join the ranks of hackers who decide they’d like to try building a microblogging tool. It’s sometimes after Twitter or Facebook does something cruddy to remind me that I’m the product. Sometimes, it’s when jerks have the run of the place and no one can do anything about it. Often these things are highly correlated.</description>

          <title>Privacy and Social Media</title>
          <description>Somewhat apropos of what I posted recently about freedoms, there’s been a kerfuffle about Facebook and privacy (again). A particular post I just read kind of set me off, so I decided to expand on a comment I left there.</description>

          <title>Aerostats, Base Stations, and the Cloud</title>
          <description>In my thinking about things IndieWeb and user-supported cloud infrastructure, I’ve had a couple of notions bouncing around in my head that might help clarify some “products” I’d like to build if and when I have time. I guess this would be good to blog about, so maybe someone else can steal my ideas (if they’re any good). Because, after all, much of this is sourced from material I’ve stolen from guys like Dave Winer.</description>

          <title>Half-formed thoughts about Twitter, social silos, web APIs, and mashups</title>
          <description>TL;DR: Turns out, the way to derive value from web APIs is to let your community run off and do free research and development. Harvest the results, and profit. We were never promised participation, but it felt like it was a 2-way street. Silly us. Where do we go from here?</description>
