          <title>SIO2Pi = Atari 800 + Raspberry Pi</title>
          <description>TL;DR: The first computer I programmed was an Atari 800. I&#39;m using a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a simple serial voltage conversion circuit to load disk images from the internet onto my Atari 800.</description>

          <title>Reviving my C64 history with a uIEC/SD</title>
          <description>I&#39;ve lived a very focused life. From very early on, I&#39;ve been learning to make computers do things.
And being as introspective as I am, I like spending time considering how I got here.  I suppose this is nostalgia, but I like to think of it as recentering and recapitulation. Contemplating the story so far, as a means to consider the story yet to come.
One huge benefit of this habit is that I&#39;ve become ever more appreciative of today.  It&#39;s easy to forget, but we&#39;re living in the future these days—at least, with respect to who I was in 1983.
No flying cars yet, but for US$55 I was able to buy a tiny gadget called a uIED/SD that gives a Commodore 64 access to modern SD cards for storage.  And, of course, I have Jason Scott&#39;s review of the more general-use FC5025 5.25? Floppy to USB Adapter to blame in getting me started on this current mini-obsession.
You want to talk about a magical device? Screw the iPad—this is magic.  
This is what it looks like:</description>
