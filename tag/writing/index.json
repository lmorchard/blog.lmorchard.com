The thing is, I want to write more. And, it was pretty cool I managed to get something posted last night. But, the process of doing so ended up way more convoluted than it should have been. So, I want to share the story and invite public ridicule.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So I told myself that I should do some writing tonight, but now that it&#39;s tonight all I want to do is drink booze and play video games.</p>&mdash; Les Orchard (@lmorchard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/770771394816729088\">August 30, 2016</a></blockquote>\n\n<p>It started with yesterday morning&#39;s journal pages. I told myself it was a good night to get this done. I made plans to start working on it after dinner.  I cooked dinner. I ate dinner and had a beer. I sat down on the couch... and all I wanted to do was anything else but write.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recursive-yak-shaving\">Recursive yak shaving</h2>\n<p>Let&#39;s see, what did I do instead? I&#39;d mused in my journal that I needed a different venue to get myself into the ritual mindset to write. I write my daily pages at the kitchen island over breakfast. That&#39;s a way easier environment for focusing on that task than my workaday desk with my laptop and all that entails.</p>\n<p>So, that means I went to the kitchen island with notebook &amp; pen and started writing, right? Nope. </p>\n<p>I went to the basement to dig out an old laptop. I wanted something to write a blog post with fewer distractions. I dug up a ChromeBook, a MacBook, and an Android tablet with a keyboard. Surely one of those things would be handy for writing! (Why I didn&#39;t also dig up <a href=\"http://www.tankraider.com/DOSPALMTOP/prolinearps1000.html\">my old 80x24 DOS palmtop from 1993</a>, I&#39;m not sure. That thing&#39;s nifty and I used to write with it back in college!)</p>\n<div class=\"pullquote right\">\nSo, that means I went to the kitchen island with notebook & pen and started writing, right? Nope. \n</div>\n\n<p>On the way out of the basement, I noticed the unassembled comic book boxes I&#39;d been meaning to put together. So, I put them together. I considered reorganizing some comics from their 20+ year old boxes into the new ones. But, no, I decided: That was too far off task. I&#39;ll get to that later.</p>\n<p>Continuing on, I considered my Tempest arcade machine. The screen&#39;s still not working on that thing, and I&#39;ve been meaning to fix it most of the last year. I moved to pop open the back, but stopped. Again, too far off task!</p>\n<p>I made it upstairs with the laptops and the tablet. I got to the kitchen and plugged things in to charge. The tablet wouldn&#39;t get past the boot-up screen. Okay, forget the tablet. The MacBook booted into... Ubuntu Linux? I forgot I did that with this machine. I forgot my password. Wi-fi didn&#39;t work. Deal with that later. </p>\n<p>The ChromeBook booted up fine. But, for some reason, I suddenly decided it needed to have <a href=\"https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton\">Crouton</a> and Ubuntu installed. You know, so I could run git &amp; node &amp; gulp to preview my blog post and publish when I was done. So, I started on that. <a href=\"https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton\">Crouton</a>&#39;s nifty and it was up &amp; running with less fuss than I expected. I got all my tools installed, and had my blog building before I knew it.</p>\n<p>Then, around 10pm, I moved back to the couch and my Windows PC.

I told myself it was a good night to get this done. I made plans to start working on it after dinner.  I cooked dinner. I ate dinner and had a beer. I sat down on the couch... and all I wanted to do was anything else but write.\n\n## Recursive yak shaving\n\nLet's see, what did I do instead? I'd mused in my journal that I needed a different venue to get myself into the ritual mindset to write. I write my daily pages at the kitchen island over breakfast. That's a way easier environment for focusing on that task than my workaday desk with my laptop and all that entails.\n\nSo, that means I went to the kitchen island with notebook & pen and started writing, right? Nope. \n\nI went to the basement to dig out an old laptop. I wanted something to write a blog post with fewer distractions. I dug up a ChromeBook, a MacBook, and an Android tablet with a keyboard. Surely one of those things would be handy for writing! (Why I didn't also dig up [my old 80x24 DOS palmtop from 1993](http://www.tankraider.com/DOSPALMTOP/prolinearps1000.html), I'm not sure. That thing's nifty and I used to write with it back in college!)\n\n<div class=\"pullquote right\">\nSo, that means I went to the kitchen island with notebook & pen and started writing, right? Nope. \n</div>\n\nOn the way out of the basement, I noticed the unassembled comic book boxes I'd been meaning to put together. So, I put them together. I considered reorganizing some comics from their 20+ year old boxes into the new ones. But, no, I decided: That was too far off task. I'll get to that later.\n\nContinuing on, I considered my Tempest arcade machine. The screen's still not working on that thing, and I've been meaning to fix it most of the last year. I moved to pop open the back, but stopped. Again, too far off task!\n\nI made it upstairs with the laptops and the tablet. I got to the kitchen and plugged things in to charge. The tablet wouldn't get past the boot-up screen. Okay, forget the tablet. The MacBook booted into... Ubuntu Linux? I forgot I did that with this machine. I forgot my password. Wi-fi didn't work. Deal with that later. \n\nThe ChromeBook booted up fine. But, for some reason, I suddenly decided it needed to have [Crouton][] and Ubuntu installed. You know, so I could run git & node & gulp to preview my blog post and publish when I was done. So, I started on that. [Crouton][]'s nifty and it was up & running with less fuss than I expected. I got all my tools installed, and had my blog building before I knew it.\n\nThen, around 10pm, I moved back to the couch and my Windows PC. I opened up a text editor, a shell running my blog, and a browser for previews - all of which, mind you, I've had set up and working fine on that Windows machine for the past year at least. I put on headphones and started [Killing Joke][] on Spotify. I assembled photos and drafted the blog post for GameChord. Finally, around 3am, I published it.

Documentation is, among other things, how you can augment your own feeble recollection &#8211; so that you can remember what the hell you were thinking, 6 months down the line. Text is susceptible to analysis and search by machines, which allows us to further augment our thinking and problem solving.</p>\n<h3 id=\"language-is-the-ultimate-technology\"><span id=\"Language_is_the_ultimate_technology\">Language is the ultimate technology</span></h3>\n<p>In fact, I&#8217;ll go so far as to say: <strong>*It&#8217;s not okay to fail at written language as a modern, technologically-empowered human being</strong>. *Man on the moon, and all that.</p>\n<p>Seriously, you don&#8217;t have to be <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisAintRocketSurgery\">a rocket surgeon</a>, but you do have to read the whole damn article or email someone took the time to write, and you do have to make an effort at understanding fully what was written.

I lived through 8 years of a non-reading president along with everyone else. I know that the brogrammers out there are constantly getting texts from their buddies to plan the weekend&#8217;s broactivities, trying to decide in whose mancave they&#8217;ll be setting up their lan party, and are thoroughly distracted in between futzing with their smart phones and writing a few lines of code per day by cutting and pasting it from stackoverflow. But it&#8217;s really not ok to act functionally illiterate when you&#8217;re not actually illiterate, when an advanced society that once put a man on the moon worked so hard to educate you.\r\n\r\n<cite><a href=\"http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/01/29/mongo-ft/\">Broken by Design: MongoDB Fault Tolerance</a> by <a href=\"http://hackingdistributed.com/egs/\">E. Gün Sirer</a></cite>\r\n\r\nThe rest of [the blog post][1] about failings in MongoDB is interesting. But, that particular paragraph caused me to start a slow clap all by myself, confusing [the cats][2].\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_973\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://reactiongifs.com/?p=2273\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-973 \" alt=\"Well done, sir!\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/well_done_sir.gif\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    Well done, sir!\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nIt voices an anxiety and an anger of mine about which I stay mostly quiet to everyone but my wife, who often humors rants on the subject and proffers rants of her own. It&#8217;s one of the many reasons I love her with all my heart.\r\n\r\n### <span id=\"Write_like_no_one8217s_reading\">Write like no one&#8217;s reading</span>\r\n\r\nThis notion is partly why the tagline for this new blog of mine reads, &#8220;Write like no one&#8217;s reading.&#8221; It&#8217;s a corruption of the notion, *dance like no one&#8217;s watching*: It&#8217;s not so much that I&#8217;m anxious or shy about my writing &#8211; it&#8217;s that I&#8217;m quite cynical about amassing readers through writing long-form essays on a blog.\r\n\r\nStill, I like writing at length, and this blog is for things too big for Facebook or Twitter. So, rather than keep it short, I&#8217;m going to write what someone like me would like to read. And, in fact, since I love the web and hypertext, you&#8217;ll find my posts will tend to be link-crazed and branch out into all kinds of external references.\r\n\r\n### <span id=\"Reading_is_Power\">Reading is Power</span>\r\n\r\nI do generate my share of [quip-tweeting][3] & [link-blogging][4] and aspire to write more and in greater depth. That said, I wholly agree with the author above: It&#8217;s not okay to be ineffectual with written communication &#8211; especially not if you are a professional in knowledge work and information technology.\r\n\r\nWritten communication is how we can work asynchronously &#8211; we don&#8217;t all need to be in the same place at the same time to accomplish great things. Documentation is, among other things, how you can augment your own feeble recollection &#8211; so that you can remember what the hell you were thinking, 6 months down the line. Text is susceptible to analysis and search by machines, which allows us to further augment our thinking and problem solving.\r\n\r\n### <span id=\"Language_is_the_ultimate_technology\">Language is the ultimate technology</span>\r\n\r\nIn fact, I&#8217;ll go so far as to say: ***It&#8217;s not okay to fail at written language as a modern, technologically-empowered human being**. *Man on the moon, and all that.\r\n\r\nSeriously, you don&#8217;t have to be [a rocket surgeon][5], but you do have to read the whole damn article or email someone took the time to write, and you do have to make an effort at understanding fully what was written. And if you can&#8217;t write well enough to compose your thoughts in a considered & coherent form, **get better**.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_976\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3t434c/\"><img class=\" wp-image-976 \" alt=\"TOO LONG? READ ANYWAY.\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/too-long-read-anyway.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    TOO LONG? READ ANYWAY.\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nTake the time, do your homework, exercise that [prefrontal cortex][6].\r\n\r\nIf you&#8217;re college-educated, you had to do a lot of reading & writing for papers & essays. This might be stating the obvious, but the point of that exercise wasn&#8217;t to present an arbitrary gauntlet to pass and then never revisit. *The point was that you should have developed skills of literacy useful throughout the rest of your life*.\r\n\r\n### <span id=\"Meetings_are_the_mind_killer\">Meetings are the mind killer</span>\r\n\r\nHere&#8217;s an example beyond blog posts: I&#8217;ll admit that sometimes I bristle when someone suggests, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get {on a plane, in a room, in a video call} and hash this out.&#8221; The reason I bristle is because meetings can be called as a way to kick the can down the road. Rather than spend some time considering things up front, we&#8217;ll gather everyone up in time & space and start from a conceptual blank page.\r\n\r\nI understand that real-time, high-bandwidth, person-to-person communication is often the key to getting everyone all on the same page. There are emotional cues, social niceties, negotiations and understandings to be had. And, I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;m an introvert and weak at dealing with social situations &#8211; this is a lifelong work-in-progress for me.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_974\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://reactiongifs.com/?p=7214\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-974 \" alt=\"My &quot;people skills&quot; are &quot;rusty&quot;\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/rusty.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"287\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    My &#8220;people skills&#8221; are &#8220;rusty&#8221;\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nBut, one of the first things I&#8217;ll wonder when a meeting convenes is: *Who is taking notes & where can we find them*? Ideally the answers are &#8220;all of us&#8221; and &#8220;at this {Etherpad, Google Docs} URL&#8221;.\r\n\r\nI&#8217;ll also wonder: *What is the agenda for this meeting*? Ideally the answer is, &#8220;I already told you &#8211; at the {Etherpad, Google Docs} URL. Didn&#8217;t you read the meeting invite I sent out days ahead of time?&#8221;\r\n\r\nWhen I don&#8217;t get good answers to the above, I think: *Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if we&#8217;d spent some time writing things down &#8211; whether in docs or email or whatever &#8211; so we had something better to talk about? And then write all **that **down, too?  \r\n*\r\n\r\n### <span id=\"Wrapping_up\">Wrapping up</span>\r\n\r\nI&#8217;m not writing this with any particular person or persons in mind &#8211; I&#8217;m sorry if anyone reading this feels personally addressed by way of passive-aggression. This is just a general issue with which I&#8217;ve dealt throughout my life & career.\r\n\r\nThis post also expresses standards to which I personally aspire, but I&#8217;ll be the first to admit I&#8217;m not perfect. I love writing, and I think I&#8217;m pretty good at it, but I will always have lots of room for improvement.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the notion I&#8217;m trying to convey can be summed up like so: Written language is essential to life as a modern day human being.

But, I like to write at length and have finally decided that life&#39;s too short to write in browser <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>&#39;s, no matter how cleverly augmented.</p>\n<p>I did buy <a href=\"http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/\">MarsEdit 3</a>, which is a fine app for dashing off short entries. But, for longer things, I found myself doing the actual writing elsewhere and pasting the text into MarsEdit for posting later. I even wrote and posted <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/skein/2010/03/11/alpha-vs-delta/\">a whole fanfic novella</a> this way, and it was a silly way to do things.</p>\n<p>Well, one of the places where writing actually happens for me over the past few years is within <a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/\">Tinderbox</a> documents. And, as it turns out, <a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/\">Tinderbox</a> has some powerful HTML export facilities that I&#39;ve left underused until some things finally clicked for me.</p>\n<p>So, I thought I&#39;d try turning that experience back upon itself to produce something worth writing. Without further ado, here&#39;s the <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/tinderbox-article-tutorial\">source in GitHub</a>, and the <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2010/06/tinderbox-article-tutorial/article.html\">article exported to HTML for easy reading</a>.</p>\n<p>The funny thing is, I started working on this tutorial in the middle of writing another article.

But, I like to write at length and have finally decided that life's too short to write in browser `<textarea>`'s, no matter how cleverly augmented.\r\n\r\nI did buy [MarsEdit 3][marsedit], which is a fine app for dashing off short entries. But, for longer things, I found myself doing the actual writing elsewhere and pasting the text into MarsEdit for posting later. I even wrote and posted [a whole fanfic novella][avd] this way, and it was a silly way to do things.\r\n\r\n[marsedit]: http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/\r\n[avd]: http://decafbad.com/skein/2010/03/11/alpha-vs-delta/\r\n\r\nWell, one of the places where writing actually happens for me over the past few years is within [Tinderbox][] documents. And, as it turns out, [Tinderbox][] has some powerful HTML export facilities that I've left underused until some things finally clicked for me.\r\n\r\nSo, I thought I'd try turning that experience back upon itself to produce something worth writing. Without further ado, here's the [source in GitHub][github], and the [article exported to HTML for easy reading][article].\r\n\r\nThe funny thing is, I started working on this tutorial in the middle of writing another article.

    "html": "<p>It&#39;s plain to see that I&#39;ve not been a blogger for a long time.</p>\n<p>This place is a long-neglected ghost town that sees a begrudged entry every few months, when I happen to remember it still exists and I feel guilty for not feeding it with content. What I&#39;ve yet to figure out is if the cause is a matter of motivation, publishing tools, audience, or writing topics.</p>\n<p>Behold as I ramble on for many tens of words pondering the cobwebs here at 0xDECAFBAD.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"motivation\">Motivation</h2>\n<p>Other outlets have absorbed nearly all of my motivations that once prompted casual blogging. And those other outlets, in most cases, provide better rewards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For quick top-of-the-head thoughts and quips, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard\">Twitter</a> works best for the brain-spew and gets me feedback from interesting people faster than my spam-embattled comments here ever did.</li>\n<li>For sharing things I find on the web, <a href=\"http://delicious.com/deusx\">Delicious</a> took that job over years ago and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/shared/l.m.orchard\">Google Reader</a> has been angling for the job as well.</li>\n<li>For sharing code and projects, I&#39;ve started doing more and more over at <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/\">my GitHub account</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Quite awhile ago, I even went so far as to redirect the front page of my decafbad.com domain straight to a page that&#39;s nothing more than  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/lifestream\">a shell for a FriendFeed widget that aggregates my output from elsewhere</a>. It&#39;s kind of a cop-out, but if you want to see what I&#39;m really up to, that&#39;s a much better page than my stagnant blog index anyway.  I&#39;ve got a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/ffa/lmorchard\">local archive of my activity</a>, and have been meaning to make a self-hosted lifestream more front-and-center, but I&#39;ve been too busy to bother.</p>\n<h2 id=\"publishing-tools\">Publishing tools</h2>\n<p>In fact, I&#39;ve been thinking about killing my WordPress installation here altogether, and switching the blog over to a static fossil snapshot.  Since I rarely post, there&#39;s rarely a comment inbound here these days that&#39;s not trying to slip through an ad for pills or fake handbags. Thus, most of the CPU cycles on my web host are spent on busy work processing requests that will never amount to anything real. So, why bother having an actual PHP application running here?</p>\n<p>The one thing that I haven&#39;t done a lot of lately—and would like to carve out time to get back to—is some real long-form writing. You would think that that&#39;s where this WordPress thing would come in handy, but oddly it seems not to. I hate writing in textareas in browsers, haven&#39;t found a desktop blog client that I liked in years.</p>\n<p>So, because of the little things that annoy me, I stop writing before I start because the anticipated process to publish seems like a chore. I&#39;d much rather be writing in MacVim and checking text files into a git repository. Then, I could throw <a href=\"http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a> or something yak-shavingly homebrewed on top of post-receive hooks to do indexing magic and such in static HTML. You know, the stuff that took forever in MovableType back in the day, but decoupled from my actual writing process. </p>\n<p>Huh, now that I describe it, the above sounds like a chore too—but it would be a shiny new toy!  At that point, I wouldn&#39;t be blogging so much as publishing an archive of essays on the web.  But, at least I&#39;d know the format would be future-proof, the platform exploit-resistant, and the overall maintenance less worrisome.  If I had comments, I could even outsource them to another service and run periodic backups to be safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"audience\">Audience</h2>\n<p>But, beyond the mechanisms, there&#39;s who I imagine might be reading this stuff. I hold off on writing a lot of things that could be posted here because they&#39;re maybe not tech-nerdy enough. If it doesn&#39;t have at least one code example, I hesitate to share it here—and if I don&#39;t share it here, I probably don&#39;t share it anywhere.</p>\n<p>And then there&#39;s the thought that whatever I write here, no one will read it if it&#39;s too long.  This entry is mostly written to myself, and I expect a single-digit comment count—most likely zero.  I get the most feedback on the shortest things, which has ultimately lead to Twitter and its 140 character limit yielding some of my most rewarding interactions on the web in years. I post an essay here, and it&#39;s all crickets.</p>\n<p>The exceptions are where I post something really useful, like that article about <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2009/07/15/html5-drag-and-drop\">HTML 5 Drag &amp; Drop</a> or a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/09/01/writing-a-delicious-command-for-ubiquity\">Delicious command for Ubiquity</a>.  That is, of course, a clue if comments and feedback are what I&#39;m after.</p>\n<h2 id=\"writing-topics\">Writing topics</h2>\n<p>So, what could I be writing about these days? Let&#39;s see, I could write about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what I&#39;ve been up to at Mozilla since I started;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/homebrewing/\">brewing beer</a> and roasting coffee at home;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/4389264445/\">retro computing on my C64 and Amiga</a>;</li>\n<li>developing for Palm webOS;</li>\n<li>random thoughts on life;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Huh. That all sounds like a blog, and one I would read myself—though that last one sounds like <a href=\"http://deus-x.livejournal.com/\">my LiveJournal</a>, long neglected since I started dating my wife and got much less emo in general. We probably don&#39;t need to go there so much, but I could probably bore with more even-tempered philosophical expositions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-the-problem\">What&#39;s the problem?</h2>\n<p>I wonder what my real problem is, then? Is it really just a matter of <a href=\"http://www.dawsbrothers.com/2010/03/09/butt-in-the-seat-a-writers-technique/\">butt in the seat</a> that I&#39;m missing?  I write every day—in a paper journal, in wiki pages, in emails, to myself—I just don&#39;t write much here. Maybe all the above is just a collection of excuses.</p>\n<p>Lately, I&#39;ve had this notion that I should try writing and publishing for an earlier version of myself. That is: all these things I end up searching for and researching on the web, I should write them up in a way that I wish had been the first search result in Google. Whatever the topic, if a younger version of me wanted to find it, I should put it out there to be found. Never mind who else I think might read it or (not) comment on it.</p>\n<p>Write for myself, write what I&#39;d want to read—sounds pretty obvious when I put it out there like that. So, is that the deal? Who knows; we&#39;ll see if a change in perspective results in more happenings here.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090129\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ciarang.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=18910207650685d4592d9a6a71528180&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ciarang.com/\">CiaranG</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090129\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:04:04\">2010-03-10T19:04:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I write about stuff (including beer brewing, Amigas and less archaic techy stuff) mostly for the pleasure of my current self, and the amusement of my future self.</p>\n<p>I never considered writing for an earlier version of myself, but then I know for a fact he didn't have a time machine.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090132\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5441ca4708065da7e0467e1470c49653&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\">Carter Rabasa</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090132\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:19:19\">2010-03-10T19:19:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I long ago gave up on the idea of regular blogging.

I don't know how I ended up here, but it looks like last month was the seventh anniversary of my first comment:</p>\n<p>http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/02/20/ooodae</p>\n<p>\"Newly Digital in 1983\" is still one of my favorite stories ever.  You also got me interested in ifiction and flash fiction. (I ended up publishing a few stories on 365tomorrows and Ficlets.)  And this month I'm joining the Mozilla Corporation, partly because I want to work with you and other hackers whose work has influenced me over the years.  Your audience may be small, but we're devoted!  :)</p>\n<p>I moved my own technical blogging to Jekyll recently.  There's a bit less guilt about slow update schedules when I think of it more like a static collection of articles than an online journal.  (And yeah, using a real editor and version control makes it much easier to get longer pieces done.)  I use Planet Venus for my personally-hosted lifestream, though these days most of my friends get my aggregated data via Facebook or Buzz.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090136\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/danmactough.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">danmactough</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090136\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:27:53\">2010-03-10T19:27:53</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I've never used my blog as much as you've used yours -- I've never really been a blogger at all, honestly.</p>\n<p>I like posting code snippets. Maybe I'll check out github at some point, but I've got a 2-year-old now. He's way more fun and interesting than Python or whatever. (I guess that could be interpreted as implying that my wife is NOT more fun and interesting than those things. Rather than explain why that is not the case, I'll just say that we've been together forever, and I love her very much.)</p>\n<p>At any rate, I thought your post merited at least one comment pondering why the commenter does not blog (anymore).</p>\n<p>For my part, it has a lot to do with privacy, I think. I knew before I ever installed blosxom that I didn't want to be a \"blogger.\" I had no interest in sharing my deep thoughts about life, politics, or anything else. I enjoy talking with people; it's not an antisocial thing. It's just that I don't know what long-term ramifications there may be to such free expression. Likewise, you won't see pictures of me and my family generally available on Flickr or Picasa (there may be a handful). Facebook is nothing to me except somewhere to echo my Twitter stream, such as it is (and I've stopped doing that). Brightkite -- forget it! My last.fm profile is about as intimate as I get online.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking about shutting down my WP installation. I really don't use it. The only thing I really use my VPS for is my web-based feed reader.</p>\n<p>All of these blogging, microblogging, and social networking services -- especially the social networking services -- are really interesting to me, though. I will keep hanging around the periphery of them, dipping in a toe here and there.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090137\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://wambatech.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3ba9f5af09024586154461580b546479&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://wambatech.com\">bud</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:44:56\">2010-03-10T19:44:56</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Les I've followed this for a while.

I always wondered if it got many reads, but it was one of my own favorites to write since it was the sort of thing I liked to see on others' blogs.</p>\n<p>Oh, and welcome to Mozilla! I'm back out to Mountain View pretty regularly, so we'll have to hang out sometime.  Might have to pick your brain about Jekyll and how you like mobile hacking.</p>\n<p>@Dan: I'm a bit weird, since most of my friends since the age of 8 have been behind computers, modems, or the internet. And now, my job is almost entirely on the net since I'm telecommuting from my basement 3000 miles away from HQ. So, it's pretty natural for me to live online.</p><p>Still, I have gotten more and more private. My LiveJournal has some entries that I'd never write now, and I'll probably never post religious / political stuff here because it's not worth the debate or potential life / career damage.</p>\n<p>So... yeah, I'll probably never again be a blogger, per se. I don't feel like having a diary online so much as a place where I publish interesting things.</p>\n<p>I think really my thing here is I call myself a writer, so I should probably be doing more of it. :)</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090139\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/danmactough.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">danmactough</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090139\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T20:17:10\">2010-03-10T20:17:10</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Regarding publishing interesting things -- I'm totally with you there.

I had started to write my own, but then I started wondering why I had to have my own.  It turned out Jekyll gets most of what I want done with a minimum of yak shaving.  I think the only weakness is the lack of categories/tags and the requisite feeds.  It's nice to write something up with markdown, build the site, and push it out.

    "body": "It's plain to see that I've not been a blogger for a long time.\r\n\r\nThis place is a long-neglected ghost town that sees a begrudged entry every few months, when I happen to remember it still exists and I feel guilty for not feeding it with content. What I've yet to figure out is if the cause is a matter of motivation, publishing tools, audience, or writing topics.\r\n\r\nBehold as I ramble on for many tens of words pondering the cobwebs here at 0xDECAFBAD.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nOther outlets have absorbed nearly all of my motivations that once prompted casual blogging. And those other outlets, in most cases, provide better rewards:\r\n\r\n* For quick top-of-the-head thoughts and quips, [Twitter](http://twitter.com/lmorchard) works best for the brain-spew and gets me feedback from interesting people faster than my spam-embattled comments here ever did.\r\n* For sharing things I find on the web, [Delicious](http://delicious.com/deusx) took that job over years ago and [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/l.m.orchard) has been angling for the job as well.\r\n* For sharing code and projects, I've started doing more and more over at [my GitHub account](http://github.com/lmorchard/).\r\n\r\nQuite awhile ago, I even went so far as to redirect the front page of my decafbad.com domain straight to a page that's nothing more than  [a shell for a FriendFeed widget that aggregates my output from elsewhere](http://decafbad.com/blog/lifestream). It's kind of a cop-out, but if you want to see what I'm really up to, that's a much better page than my stagnant blog index anyway.  I've got a [local archive of my activity](http://decafbad.com/ffa/lmorchard), and have been meaning to make a self-hosted lifestream more front-and-center, but I've been too busy to bother.\r\n\r\n## Publishing tools\r\n\r\nIn fact, I've been thinking about killing my WordPress installation here altogether, and switching the blog over to a static fossil snapshot.  Since I rarely post, there's rarely a comment inbound here these days that's not trying to slip through an ad for pills or fake handbags. Thus, most of the CPU cycles on my web host are spent on busy work processing requests that will never amount to anything real. So, why bother having an actual PHP application running here?\r\n\r\nThe one thing that I haven't done a lot of lately—and would like to carve out time to get back to—is some real long-form writing. You would think that that's where this WordPress thing would come in handy, but oddly it seems not to. I hate writing in textareas in browsers, haven't found a desktop blog client that I liked in years.\r\n\r\nSo, because of the little things that annoy me, I stop writing before I start because the anticipated process to publish seems like a chore. I'd much rather be writing in MacVim and checking text files into a git repository. Then, I could throw [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) or something yak-shavingly homebrewed on top of post-receive hooks to do indexing magic and such in static HTML. You know, the stuff that took forever in MovableType back in the day, but decoupled from my actual writing process. \r\n\r\nHuh, now that I describe it, the above sounds like a chore too—but it would be a shiny new toy!  At that point, I wouldn't be blogging so much as publishing an archive of essays on the web.  But, at least I'd know the format would be future-proof, the platform exploit-resistant, and the overall maintenance less worrisome.  If I had comments, I could even outsource them to another service and run periodic backups to be safe.\r\n\r\n## Audience\r\n\r\nBut, beyond the mechanisms, there's who I imagine might be reading this stuff. I hold off on writing a lot of things that could be posted here because they're maybe not tech-nerdy enough. If it doesn't have at least one code example, I hesitate to share it here—and if I don't share it here, I probably don't share it anywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the thought that whatever I write here, no one will read it if it's too long.  This entry is mostly written to myself, and I expect a single-digit comment count—most likely zero.  I get the most feedback on the shortest things, which has ultimately lead to Twitter and its 140 character limit yielding some of my most rewarding interactions on the web in years. I post an essay here, and it's all crickets.\r\n\r\nThe exceptions are where I post something really useful, like that article about [HTML 5 Drag & Drop](http://decafbad.com/blog/2009/07/15/html5-drag-and-drop) or a [Delicious command for Ubiquity](http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/09/01/writing-a-delicious-command-for-ubiquity).  That is, of course, a clue if comments and feedback are what I'm after.\r\n\r\n## Writing topics\r\n\r\nSo, what could I be writing about these days? Let's see, I could write about:\r\n\r\n* what I've been up to at Mozilla since I started;\r\n* [brewing beer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/homebrewing/) and roasting coffee at home;\r\n* [retro computing on my C64 and Amiga](http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/4389264445/);\r\n* developing for Palm webOS;\r\n* random thoughts on life;\r\n\r\nHuh. That all sounds like a blog, and one I would read myself—though that last one sounds like [my LiveJournal](http://deus-x.livejournal.com/), long neglected since I started dating my wife and got much less emo in general. We probably don't need to go there so much, but I could probably bore with more even-tempered philosophical expositions.\r\n\r\n## What's the problem?\r\n\r\nI wonder what my real problem is, then? Is it really just a matter of [butt in the seat](http://www.dawsbrothers.com/2010/03/09/butt-in-the-seat-a-writers-technique/) that I'm missing?  I write every day—in a paper journal, in wiki pages, in emails, to myself—I just don't write much here. Maybe all the above is just a collection of excuses.\r\n\r\nLately, I've had this notion that I should try writing and publishing for an earlier version of myself. That is: all these things I end up searching for and researching on the web, I should write them up in a way that I wish had been the first search result in Google. Whatever the topic, if a younger version of me wanted to find it, I should put it out there to be found. Never mind who else I think might read it or (not) comment on it.\r\n\r\nWrite for myself, write what I'd want to read—sounds pretty obvious when I put it out there like that. So, is that the deal? Who knows; we'll see if a change in perspective results in more happenings here.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090129\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ciarang.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=18910207650685d4592d9a6a71528180&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ciarang.com/\">CiaranG</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090129\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:04:04\">2010-03-10T19:04:04</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I write about stuff (including beer brewing, Amigas and less archaic techy stuff) mostly for the pleasure of my current self, and the amusement of my future self.</p>\n\n<p>I never considered writing for an earlier version of myself, but then I know for a fact he didn't have a time machine.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090132\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5441ca4708065da7e0467e1470c49653&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\">Carter Rabasa</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090132\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:19:19\">2010-03-10T19:19:19</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I long ago gave up on the idea of regular blogging.

Likewise, you won't see pictures of me and my family generally available on Flickr or Picasa (there may be a handful). Facebook is nothing to me except somewhere to echo my Twitter stream, such as it is (and I've stopped doing that). Brightkite -- forget it! My last.fm profile is about as intimate as I get online.</p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking about shutting down my WP installation. I really don't use it. The only thing I really use my VPS for is my web-based feed reader.</p>\n\n<p>All of these blogging, microblogging, and social networking services -- especially the social networking services -- are really interesting to me, though. I will keep hanging around the periphery of them, dipping in a toe here and there.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090137\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://wambatech.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3ba9f5af09024586154461580b546479&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://wambatech.com\">bud</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:44:56\">2010-03-10T19:44:56</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Les I've followed this for a while.

The past self thing is really thinking that someone like me might come along and appreciate what I tossed onto the web.  Beyond that, I like writing and can't think of better any better topics than writing about the other stuff I like doing.</p>\n\n<p>@Carter: I think my main source of lament here is that I'm a writer who never seems to write on his own site. I feel like I should be publishing more about the stuff I do. But, yeah, this place isn't really the center of my online universe anymore.</p>\n\n<p>@Matt: Huh, you know, that <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital\" rel=\"nofollow\">Newly Digital in 1983</a> post was one of my quieter ones in terms of feedback. I always wondered if it got many reads, but it was one of my own favorites to write since it was the sort of thing I liked to see on others' blogs.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and welcome to Mozilla! I'm back out to Mountain View pretty regularly, so we'll have to hang out sometime.  Might have to pick your brain about Jekyll and how you like mobile hacking.</p>\n\n<p>@Dan: I'm a bit weird, since most of my friends since the age of 8 have been behind computers, modems, or the internet. And now, my job is almost entirely on the net since I'm telecommuting from my basement 3000 miles away from HQ. So, it's pretty natural for me to live online.</p><p>Still, I have gotten more and more private. My LiveJournal has some entries that I'd never write now, and I'll probably never post religious / political stuff here because it's not worth the debate or potential life / career damage.</p>\n\n<p>So... yeah, I'll probably never again be a blogger, per se. I don't feel like having a diary online so much as a place where I publish interesting things.</p>\n\n<p>I think really my thing here is I call myself a writer, so I should probably be doing more of it. :)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090139\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/danmactough.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">danmactough</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090139\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T20:17:10\">2010-03-10T20:17:10</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Regarding publishing interesting things -- I'm totally with you there.

For some reason, though, it has become the accepted practice that language manuals should spend lots of time with silly, self-deprecating jokes, and that their example applications should be breakfast loggers and fantasy football leagues (or, conversely, payroll programs).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As an tech author with just a few books under my belt, Mark&#39;s take on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590599195?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1590599195\">Practical Prototype and script.aculo.us</a> struck a bit of a sour note for me, because I&#39;d like to work on making my tech writing more entertaining than not.  I think that&#39;s a good thing, but I&#39;m willing to be convinced otherwise.</p>\n<p>I think the issue is that there are different meanings for &quot;professional&quot; when it comes to the web.  There are web scientists and there are web masons.  Web scientists pursue fundamentals and disambiguations, while web masons are busy building the next micro-site for the new product release from the almighty client.  Many web scientists are also computer scientists and many web masons are also web scientists—but most web masons I&#39;ve known come from creative liberal or fine arts backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Though, for what it&#39;s worth, even amongst computer scientists there&#39;s still a tradition of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1225292376&amp;sr=8-1\">leaving room for jelly stains</a> and other oddities.  This seems to be the sort of thing Mark acknowledges with dismay.  (&quot;It’s not fair to blame Mr. DuPont for the general vice.&quot;)</p>\n<p>Is playfulness in literature just a computer science thing?  I&#39;m not a chemist; maybe chemists just  don&#39;t like being funny in writing, or maybe their jokes are more subtle.</p>\n<p>In any case, I think the &quot;practical&quot; genre of tech books is aimed at people who want to get something done, aren&#39;t interested in or have little time for context or background, yet wouldn&#39;t mind being entertained during the course of weekend tinkering and self-education.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, a good book. But take out the jokes, trim back the sample code (or dispatch it to the Web site where it makes more sense), and give us to professional perspective, and everyone is going to be much happier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The guidelines with which I&#39;m familiar for tech books in the &quot;practical&quot; or similar genres include advice such as &quot;show, don&#39;t tell&quot;.  They also suggest that, although sample code should be made available online, the author should compose the book assuming that it&#39;s a standalone product.  Web sites and CDROMs with code often vanish, but a bound book remains stable—which is especially useful on a cross-country flight without net access.  Professional perspective is of course a desirable thing to work into the prose, but job #1 is to illustrate the right way to do things through running code.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How does Prototype+Javascript relate to other languages — C++/STL, say, or SELF? What, precisely, are the semantics of the key methods? I don&#39;t need the inevitable chapter 1 pitch for the wonderfulness of Javascript and the badness of MSIE, but it might be a good place for a quick summary for the pros. Call by reference • no pointers • primitives are objects • everything has a prototype slot • parens() do this, braces {} do that, brackets [] do something else • single and double quotes are different. Kernighan &amp; Ritchie did this so well in C, and it’s not like we’re not familiar with their example.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;d posit that most in the audience for &quot;practical&quot; tech books are entirely unfamiliar with Kernigan &amp; Ritchie and haven&#39;t touched a line of C source code.  Most of these readers have probably tumbled down the slope from HTML to CSS and finally to JavaScript in order to get something interesting to happen in a browser—and usually while under an unreasonable deadline.</p>\n<p>I&#39;d really be surprised if many readers have heard of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_programming_language\">Self</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library\">C++/STL</a> or have much of a grounding at all in computer science or programming language fundamentals.  Having these fundamentals would of course help web masons get a deeper understanding of the technologies that make the job possible, but the pragmatic rewards tend not to make up for the effort involved.</p>\n<p>So, to sum up, the purpose for this entry isn&#39;t to beat up on Mark Bernstein.  He&#39;s written a great deal of prose and code that I respect, so his opinion is interesting to me.  Rather, I&#39;ve tried to express my own understanding of this writing market, and hoping I&#39;ve aimed at the right goals.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086683\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.markbernstein.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cdb20bf8e09680028612532944833686&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.markbernstein.org/\">Mark Bernstein</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086683\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-10-29T16:51:59\">2008-10-29T16:51:59</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I'd settle for a better class of joke!</p>\n<p>On tech content, doesn't it annoy <em>you</em> that it's hard (or impossible) to find a book about a Web framework or language or facility that takes advantage of what you already know?

And I agree that it shouldn't count against me or my book, but perhaps I'm a bit biased there.</p>\n<p>Three things.</p>\n<p>First: my book reads the way it reads because that's how I write. The process of writing the thing was torturous enough that I doubt I'd have finished it if I subjected every word to the scrutiny of a hypothetical skeptical reader. I'm not good enough at the craft for that. I think that each author has to find his best angle on the material and write that way. Because there are many books and many publishers, it <em>tends</em> to balance out.</p>\n<p>Second: my book covers two JavaScript frameworks built to simplify common tasks. Basic familiarity with JavaScript is assumed. Right away that's a step away from the theoretical and toward the practical. I think tech books are best when they stick to one or the other, rather than try to drift between them.</p>\n<p>Third: the book Mark wants has already been written: <cite>JavaScript: The Good Parts</cite>, by Doug Crockford. Doug's style is dry and academic, but also direct and substantive. If I tried to write in that style it'd be only a pale imitation.</p>\n<p>Anyway... the \"quirky\" trend, I agree, can be tiring. As it applies to my book, the sticking point seems to be whether I'm <em>actually funny</em>. Readers of this weblog will simply have to buy the book to find out. It's several hundred pages long and has a fresh, earthy \"new book\" smell.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086691\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086691\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-10-31T03:47:37\">2008-10-31T03:47:37</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>@Mark: Yeah, these days my first impulse is not to reach for the latest book on a new technology like a web framework or new language.  I usually head straight for the source code or start soaking in whatever documentation may be lying around on the web.</p>\n<p>I suppose I could be a macho geek and say that's why I'm writing the books now—but to be honest I don't tend to get much out of practical programming books.  They seem to sell, though, so I keep wondering if mine shouldn't be lighter or more fun, should I get the opportunity to produce more of them.</p>\n<p>My first book was about half-and-half prose and code, with barely any screen shots to be found.  I got to about equal parts code, prose, and screen grabs in my second—I thought that might make it easier reading.  </p>\n<p>The latest one doesn't have any jokes, but I tried to get straight to the core framework features and spotlight a few obscure magical bits.  I worry if it might be a bit too dry.</p>\n<p>But yeah, I do wish there were more (though maybe shorter) books that started from the assumption that I've got a CS degree and have tangled with a few languages and libraries so far.  On the other hand, I do like having a sense for the author in a book—but that might be thanks to the fact that I read more blogs than books these days and enjoy the personal touches.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086692\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086692\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-10-31T04:05:01\">2008-10-31T04:05:01</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>@Andrew: Hey, thanks for dropping in for a comment!

I want to know the answer, and then I can read on for some backstory... rather than having to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086688\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://andrewdupont.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fede7405a0e4cd5722e0b85920a0728c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://andrewdupont.net/\">Andrew Dupont</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086688\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-10-31T03:30:21\">2008-10-31T03:30:21</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I'm quite familiar with the trend Mark's talking about. And I agree that it shouldn't count against me or my book, but perhaps I'm a bit biased there.</p>\n\n<p>Three things.</p>\n\n<p>First: my book reads the way it reads because that's how I write. The process of writing the thing was torturous enough that I doubt I'd have finished it if I subjected every word to the scrutiny of a hypothetical skeptical reader. I'm not good enough at the craft for that. I think that each author has to find his best angle on the material and write that way. Because there are many books and many publishers, it <em>tends</em> to balance out.</p>\n\n<p>Second: my book covers two JavaScript frameworks built to simplify common tasks. Basic familiarity with JavaScript is assumed. Right away that's a step away from the theoretical and toward the practical. I think tech books are best when they stick to one or the other, rather than try to drift between them.</p>\n\n<p>Third: the book Mark wants has already been written: <cite>JavaScript: The Good Parts</cite>, by Doug Crockford. Doug's style is dry and academic, but also direct and substantive. If I tried to write in that style it'd be only a pale imitation.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway... the \"quirky\" trend, I agree, can be tiring. As it applies to my book, the sticking point seems to be whether I'm <em>actually funny</em>. Readers of this weblog will simply have to buy the book to find out. It's several hundred pages long and has a fresh, earthy \"new book\" smell.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086691\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086691\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-10-31T03:47:37\">2008-10-31T03:47:37</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@Mark: Yeah, these days my first impulse is not to reach for the latest book on a new technology like a web framework or new language.  I usually head straight for the source code or start soaking in whatever documentation may be lying around on the web.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose I could be a macho geek and say that's why I'm writing the books now—but to be honest I don't tend to get much out of practical programming books.  They seem to sell, though, so I keep wondering if mine shouldn't be lighter or more fun, should I get the opportunity to produce more of them.</p>\n\n<p>My first book was about half-and-half prose and code, with barely any screen shots to be found.  I got to about equal parts code, prose, and screen grabs in my second—I thought that might make it easier reading.  </p>\n\n<p>The latest one doesn't have any jokes, but I tried to get straight to the core framework features and spotlight a few obscure magical bits.  I worry if it might be a bit too dry.</p>\n\n<p>But yeah, I do wish there were more (though maybe shorter) books that started from the assumption that I've got a CS degree and have tangled with a few languages and libraries so far.  On the other hand, I do like having a sense for the author in a book—but that might be thanks to the fact that I read more blogs than books these days and enjoy the personal touches.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086692\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086692\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-10-31T04:05:01\">2008-10-31T04:05:01</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@Andrew: Hey, thanks for dropping in for a comment!  I can completely sympathize with needing to find a groove to handle how grueling producing one of these books can be—especially if you're more programmer than writer.  (That's me, right now, anyway.)  You need to get the best thing out there in the shortest amount of time, and find a way to get yourself to finish it.</p>\n\n<p>At any rate, congrats on the new book, and I hope the cross-blog chatter sells a few more copies for you!</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

There are some things that I tell myself I&#39;d rather I was doing besides working in the day and playing World of Warcraft at night.  Some of them include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exploring San Francisco, the South Bay, and other interesting areas around here.</li>\n<li>Working on <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a> and other products of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiasm</a>.</li>\n<li>Continuing one of the half-dozen or so short stories I&#39;ve started.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The problem is that WoW gives such tasty little morsels of pseudo-achievement, and lately it&#39;s filled the spot for lunchtime babble at work that sports would occupy for other groups.  So, it&#39;s got some real-world rewards, but it&#39;s certainly not benefiting me in terms of personal growth - no matter how interesting I think the thing might be for <a href=\"http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/12/31/wow_talk_at_23c3.html\">The Future of Work</a> and all that.  But, you know, I could have just vegged out playing WoW back in Michigan.  There are Things to Do out here in California, and I&#39;ve got a lovely wife with whom to do them.</p>\n<p>As for exploring the area:  Alex and I have started making tentative forays the past couple of weeks.  Last week was a somewhat uninspiring trip to nearby downtown San Jose, which strangely seemed abandoned and under construction alternating by block.  The weekend before was a trip to the city to see Hayes Valley and North Beach, which was markedly more entertaining and worthwhile.  </p>\n<p>This weekend, I&#39;m recovering a bit on the couch.  Since recovering from <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/18/just-call-me-crash\">the crash</a>, I&#39;ve got quite a bit more mobility - but a full day of walking tends to drag me down for the next week or so.  I think we need to get around to hooking up with some friendly people around here for dinner, drinks, games, TV, and whatnot.  The only thing besides my leg that&#39;s troublesome is that I&#39;m an introvert - being around people is a drain, not an energizing agent.  That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t enjoy meeting people and being in interesting conversations, it&#39;s just that it costs me energy that makes me tend toward being a hermit.  So, eh, something to work against.</p>\n<p>As for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a>, I think it&#39;s in an interesting state: It works great for me for idea capture and simple outlining on my laptop under Firefox, but sucks completely in MSIE on Windows.  Thus, the itch is somewhat scratched, but doesn&#39;t offer much to anyone else but me.  I&#39;ve got a big list of planned work for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a> and some bugs to fix, but none of them have been compellingly itchy enough to re-trigger my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiasm</a>.  And, as I&#39;ve learned, I just can&#39;t guilt-trip or wish this enthusiasm into action.  If I don&#39;t feel like doing it, I don&#39;t get much done, regardless of how much potential I think this project might have in the abstract.</p>\n<p>As for writing:  I haven&#39;t done much writing since finishing the last book, though something I really want to <em>be</em> when I grow up (along with being a Computer Scientist) is a writer.  So, sooner or later, I want to actively pick up again.  I also figure it might be a future career option when my brain&#39;s gotten too addled (or just plain fed up) to be very effective as a coder.  And, I&#39;ve got craploads of story ideas that I&#39;d like to try out.  </p>\n<p>Stories ideas are cheap, though - it&#39;s the execution that counts.  I&#39;ve got to find a writing group or some arrangement that doesn&#39;t have me doing it in a vacuum.  I&#39;ve thought about starting up a separate writing blog and committing to a few hundred words a night of raw output, but not sure what that would do for me.

    "html": "<p>(<em>Note: This is a long one.</em>)</p>\n<p>Reading <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060207-6133.html\">&quot;The slow decline of the blockbuster&quot; on Ars Technica</a> reminds me that <a href=\"http://www.thelongtail.com/about.html\">this Long Tail stuff</a> is something on which I&#39;ve been wanting to write something intelligent for a long time now.  This might all just be techno-hippy <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/2000/08/27/michegas\">michegas</a> in the end, but I&#39;m really excited about the possibility of living in a Long-Tailed age.</p>\n<p>You see, if I were to pick a lifelong war cry and embroider it on my own personal flag, that cry would be &quot;<a href=\"http://www.jcf.org/bliss.php\">Follow Your Bliss</a>!&quot;  And my bliss is found in the course of learning, in the act of creative work and making things, and in the continual effort of self-refinement as creativity recursively applied.</p>\n<p>Now, the thing about bliss is that it&#39;s not just some hedonistic easy road paved with whipped cream.  Bliss is a hard thing to follow—you&#39;ve got to keep your eyes on it, and there&#39;s quite often a lot of pain involved.  But, I believe that following bliss is the only way to get real, honest, unbounded joy out of life that builds in unfailing increment.</p>\n<p>What does my bliss have to do with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tail\">the Long Tail</a>?  Well, you see, it&#39;s easier to be creative and live creatively in the midst of a culture that is itself steeped in creativity—and I think that a Long-Tailed culture is the best bet for it.  I see a Long Tail as the hallmark of a living artisan culture, as opposed to the slow death of a consumer culture that&#39;ll just leave us all fat and useless.</p>\n<p>Why do we even have a culture that enshrines such a poisonous unidirectional flow of product to consumer?  Scarcity.  Mass production makes it cheap to make lots of the same thing—yet, the means of that production has historically been very expensive to acquire.  </p>\n<p>Thus, assembly lines are scarce.  The same has goes for transmission towers, radio frequencies, movie theaters, and recording studios.  As a perverse consequence, we&#39;ve all just gotten used to the idea that almost no one is cut out to make much at all and common creativity is relegated to head-patted cottage niches who make their own soap.</p>\n<p>What I think the growing Long Tail will tell us, though, is that for many areas of creative concern, scarcity in the means of production is evaporating.  Many products of creativity—i.e. sound, video, and text—can be composed on a cheap computer and duplicated with negligible cost on the web.  In fact, as things like <a href=\"http://www.bittorrent.com/\">BitTorrent</a> take off, distribution costs actually <em>fall</em> with popularity and scale.  (Just think, what if distribution costs can fall below zero?  I&#39;m not just talking money here.)</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve got a lot of hope in what I see happening with blogging, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/podcasting\">podcasting</a>, and other such network-driven channels for creativity.  I also have a lot of hope for the generations of kids not only growing up with computers, but also with <a href=\"http://netflix.com\">Netflix</a>, <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/\">GarageBand</a>, <a href=\"http://myspace.com\">MySpace</a>, <a href=\"http://livejournal.com\">LiveJournal</a>, <a href=\"http://youtube.com\">YouTube</a>, and even <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/podcasting\">YTMND</a>.  You can scoff at them all you like, but some of that stuff&#39;s got a little bit of genius in it.</p>\n<p>We&#39;ve got this entertainment industry with an ultra-rich royalty caste of supposedly super-creative celebrities, but it&#39;s all driven by the scarcity that technology is eroding away.  Sure, you can find some really, truly brilliant people up there—but I&#39;m willing to bet there are armies of people down here who just haven&#39;t gotten in the right place at the right time or who&#39;ve abandoned creativity because they had no viable outlet.  </p>\n<p>So, imagine a more distributed entertainment universe populated by more creative people—with fewer big productions and even fewer gazillionaires.  Creativity, attention, and time become the only significant scarcities.</p>\n<p>Imagine more people just entertaining each other and goading each other on.  Imagine making a <em>decent</em> living doing creative stuff you love, based on the moral and monetary contributions of intimate audiences filled with co-creators—who, while perhaps <a href=\"http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/28/what-is-friendship/\">not quite friends</a> are at least <em>befriendable*.  No one gets so rich bankwise—they get by just fine, mind you—but *everyone</em> lives in a lot more bliss.</p>\n<p>This is not unlike Orson Scott Card&#39;s description of <a href=\"http://www.hatrack.com/osc/books/crystalcity.shtml\">The Crystal City in his Alvin Maker series</a>.</p>\n<p>I want to see a culture where restrictions on remix are given the same odd looks as powdered wigs.  I want to see, as an entrenched tradition, future creative adults route around the network damage of old proprietary industries steeped in scarcity and control.  After all, &quot;<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2001/07/29/my_crush_on_spyro_what_flash_animations_remind_me_of_and_what_the_past_will_look_like_someday\">the only long-term effect of copy protection is to ensure that those who defeat it are immortalized.</a>&quot;</p>\n<p>We&#39;ll still need professional editors and crews for the <em>really</em> good stuff—<em>but that&#39;s creative work too</em>.  The same goes for everyone else who plays an honest role in getting visions realized—this isn&#39;t all just about the entertainment industry.  Honestly, I see the entrenchment of universal creativity as one of the few ways the United States can cope with increasingly global markets—we&#39;ve got a bit of a head start in some areas, if we take it.  Digging in heels and protecting aging ways of business that have long since ridden out their respective initial creative Big Bangs just won&#39;t cut it.</p>\n<p>I want to see the 10% left over from 90% of everyone&#39;s crud inevitably exceed the total output of today&#39;s entertainment industry and spill into other industries.  I want to see a new industry spring up whose sole purpose is to sift through chaff and cultivate the naturally emergent creative best.  And I want to see that industry as a distributed <em>service</em> (versus <em>control</em>) industry there to help what&#39;s already happening through the application of both machine and human intelligence to <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/\">homestead the noosphere</a>.</p>\n<p>...(<em>deep breath</em>)...</p>\n<p>So anyway, that&#39;s the sort of stuff that gets me really excited lately.

Again.  True, life itself has been pretty busy lately.  The days are booked, the weekends have been filling up--and in spare moments I&#39;ve been obsessed with <a href=\"http://www.hulkgames.com/us/\" title=\"THE INCREDIBLE HULK: ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION\">jumping from building to building</a>.  But, when it comes down to me and a pile of code on the screen, I find myself in ever further depths of recursion.</p>\n<p>For instance, I keep meaning to get down to posting some <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Asides\">lightweight &quot;asides&quot;</a> in place of my old <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/08/12/quick-and-random-thoughts\">&quot;quick bullets&quot;</a> posts I was doing.  But, of course, before I do that, I want to do some <a href=\"http://www.kottke.org/03/11/kottke-redesign\">Kottkesque template mungeing</a> to more properly present these smaller bits.  </p>\n<p>And, though I&#39;m actually most of the way done making another rev to the theme here, I also want to fold my linkblog back into the site.  The absence of these <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/12/redesigninprogress#comment-1850\">has already been noticed</a>, so I&#39;d like to give those a proper treatment.</p>\n<p>In addition, I still mean to start pimping my new book a bit; maybe even starting tonight.  I&#39;ve got a notion to post teasers highlighting a few of my favorite things.  And then, of course, there&#39;s the <a href=\"http://www.hackingfeeds.com/blog/\">neglected companion site</a> on which I&#39;ve yet to spend much time at all.  But I&#39;ve got grand plans, including some which go beyond the book itself and toward making <a href=\"http://www.hackingfeeds.com/blog/\">hackingfeeds.com</a> a regularly updated and relevant resource.</p>\n<p>Speaking of that...  I&#39;ve also continued working a bit with some feed hacks since finishing the book.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/feedspool/\">FeedSpool</a> is one of these: I&#39;ve revived some of FeedReactor&#39;s old code--this time aiming for a much higher degree of simplicity, trying to stick with standard Python modules, and dumping the database altogether.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to make a more formal announcement about this thing, once it&#39;s a bit more in usable shape.  In a nutshell:  It polls feeds and downloads the data.  New entries are split out into individual files, like an email or usenet spool.  That&#39;s it.  Other programs are expected to do the clever bits.</p>\n<p>And, to go along with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/feedspool/\">FeedSpool</a>, I&#39;ve been toying with building a Spotlight importer for OS X Tiger which indexes RSS and Atom feeds and entries.  Not in Subversion yet, and not nearly ready for public consumption, but it&#39;s been pretty fun to play with.  (And I totally forgot just how many feeds I have lying around on my hard drive!)</p>\n<p>Anyway, that&#39;s enough for now.

    "body": "Well, of course I've lapsed pretty much right back into silence after [having shaken this place up][redesign] and [having announced the arrival of the book][book].\r\n\r\nThe culprit, of course, is [yak shaving][yak].  Again.  True, life itself has been pretty busy lately.  The days are booked, the weekends have been filling up--and in spare moments I've been obsessed with [jumping from building to building][hulk].  But, when it comes down to me and a pile of code on the screen, I find myself in ever further depths of recursion.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I keep meaning to get down to posting some [lightweight \"asides\"][asides] in place of my old [\"quick bullets\"][quick] posts I was doing.  But, of course, before I do that, I want to do some [Kottkesque template mungeing][kottke] to more properly present these smaller bits.  \r\n\r\nAnd, though I'm actually most of the way done making another rev to the theme here, I also want to fold my linkblog back into the site.  The absence of these [has already been noticed][noticed], so I'd like to give those a proper treatment.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I still mean to start pimping my new book a bit; maybe even starting tonight.  I've got a notion to post teasers highlighting a few of my favorite things.  And then, of course, there's the [neglected companion site][hackingfeeds] on which I've yet to spend much time at all.  But I've got grand plans, including some which go beyond the book itself and toward making [hackingfeeds.com][hackingfeeds] a regularly updated and relevant resource.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of that...  I've also continued working a bit with some feed hacks since finishing the book.  \r\n\r\n[FeedSpool][feedspool] is one of these: I've revived some of FeedReactor's old code--this time aiming for a much higher degree of simplicity, trying to stick with standard Python modules, and dumping the database altogether.  \r\n\r\nI've been meaning to make a more formal announcement about this thing, once it's a bit more in usable shape.  In a nutshell:  It polls feeds and downloads the data.  New entries are split out into individual files, like an email or usenet spool.  That's it.  Other programs are expected to do the clever bits.\r\n\r\nAnd, to go along with [FeedSpool][feedspool], I've been toying with building a Spotlight importer for OS X Tiger which indexes RSS and Atom feeds and entries.  Not in Subversion yet, and not nearly ready for public consumption, but it's been pretty fun to play with.  (And I totally forgot just how many feeds I have lying around on my hard drive!)\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's enough for now.

Well, lookee what landed on my doorstep late Friday afternoon--my author copies!</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog_attachments/IMG_3554-1.JPG\" onclick=\"window.open('http://www.decafbad.com/blog_attachments/IMG_3554-1.JPG','popup','width=1024,height=768,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false\"><img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog_attachments/IMG_3554-1-tm.jpg\" height=\"253\" width=\"337\" border=\"1\" align=\"middle\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Cue the angelic chorus\" title=\"Cue the angelic chorus\" /></a>\n</p>\n\n<p>This package was actually supposed to have been delivered on Thursday.  But, much to my consternation, I wasn&#39;t present to sign for the package.  But now, I&#39;ve got the surreal experience of holding a bound volume of around 600 pages with my name on the cover.  And inside?  There&#39;s all this stuff that once appeared on my PowerBook screen in MS Word and Terminal windows.  (Oh yeah, and there&#39;re a few photos of my iPod thrown in for good measure.)</p>\n<p>Funny thing is, this process started for me back in late <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/12/\">December 2004</a>.  But, you&#39;d barely know it, because--for whatever reason--I started off pretty cagey about the whole thing, and then plunged headlong into the effort.  I did manage to make <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/07/belated-happy-new-year\">a quick announcement of authorship</a>, but thereafter only managed to emerge for a few <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/02/19/writing-no-things-of-epic-import\">quick thought dumps</a>.</p>\n<p>I think part of my silence about things stemmed from a reticence to talk about or promise anything before I&#39;d written it--and also because this has been my first time doing anything like this and I didn&#39;t want to flub anything up along the way.  How I might&#39;ve done that, who knows?  But, I got a bit too busy to really worry about superstitions as the deadlines rolled on.</p>\n<p>But now, it&#39;s out!

But, much to my consternation, I wasn't present to sign for the package.  But now, I've got the surreal experience of holding a bound volume of around 600 pages with my name on the cover.  And inside?  There's all this stuff that once appeared on my PowerBook screen in MS Word and Terminal windows.  (Oh yeah, and there're a few photos of my iPod thrown in for good measure.)\r\n\r\nFunny thing is, this process started for me back in late [December 2004][dec04].  But, you'd barely know it, because--for whatever reason--I started off pretty cagey about the whole thing, and then plunged headlong into the effort.  I did manage to make [a quick announcement of authorship][announce], but thereafter only managed to emerge for a few [quick thought dumps][quick].\r\n\r\nI think part of my silence about things stemmed from a reticence to talk about or promise anything before I'd written it--and also because this has been my first time doing anything like this and I didn't want to flub anything up along the way.  How I might've done that, who knows?  But, I got a bit too busy to really worry about superstitions as the deadlines rolled on.\r\n\r\nBut now, it's out!  And [you should buy it!][buy]  Lookee, lookee:  It's already got a 5-star review from someone I don't even know!\r\n\r\nFor the moment, I'm going to wrap up this post, finish my dinner, and go for a walk with the girl--but, when we get back, I think I might post a few more details on what you'll find in my book debut. \r\n\r\n[buy]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1\r\n[announce]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/07/belated-happy-new-year\r\n[quick]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/02/19/writing-no-things-of-epic-import\r\n[dec04]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/12/\r\n[book]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/04/25/hacking-rss-and-atom-is-a-real-book\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082500\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://monkey.org/~jose/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d74863ca9c7785cd396379766095036c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://monkey.org/~jose/\">jose</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082500\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-14T01:03:36\">2005-09-14T01:03:36</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">congrats, les, if anyone should have written that book it's you. i'm glad to see it's hit the shelves .. now to go find a copy and look it over :)</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082501\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://stingthebee.nu\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0c6c4240507baf594a95fd3b25b975d2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://stingthebee.nu\">Jim Renaud</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082501\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-14T01:54:39\">2005-09-14T01:54:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Congrats Les.

It was preempted by <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/0764597582/\">the book</a>, something about which I want to gush in detail very shortly.</p>\n<p>In between bouts of actually being busy, I&#39;ve been yak shaving around the idea of executing this overhaul--making lists, researching sites I like, installing WordPress on my laptop.

My live links can be seen on del.icio.us here:\n\nhttp://del.icio.us/deusx\n\nBefore the weekend's out, though, I'm hoping to use an importer to pull my links into a category on this blog and try to reconstruct something of some semblance to the old links section.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088752\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.nur-eine-i.de\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e7368d797917d0df7942c26d4ed2e580&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.nur-eine-i.de\">Benjamin Reitzammer</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088752\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-21T10:41:12\">2005-09-21T10:41:12</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Thought I point it out ... your permalinks have changed slightly, for example from http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/18/ajax_testing_and_logging \nto \nhttp://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/18/ajax-testing-and-logging\n\nThis is especially \"challenging\" because you simply shout \"Go away\" on decafbad.com instead of redirecting to decafbad.com/blog which seems like a natural alternative.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088753\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.nur-eine-i.de\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e7368d797917d0df7942c26d4ed2e580&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.nur-eine-i.de\">Benjamin Reitzammer</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088753\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-21T10:42:51\">2005-09-21T10:42:51</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Worpress messed up my previous comment ... the URLs differ in that the new URLs have dashes in the \"post titles\" while the old URLs had underscores ... sorry for double posting.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088754\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088754\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-22T14:30:44\">2005-09-22T14:30:44</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Benjamin:  Ack!
