    "html": "<p>In the last few days, I&#39;ve switched news aggregators again - this time to <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a>.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve got a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/18/good-gregarius\">long</a>, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/12/further-work-on-decafbadnewsriver\">long</a>, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/05/feedspool-is-progressing-nicely\">long</a> <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/05/introducing-dbagg3-an-atom-powered-clientserver-aggregator\">history</a> of doing this - partially because of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiasm</a>, and partially because none of the aggregators I&#39;ve used so far have satisfied all of my itches.  Some tie up my laptop in terms of memory and CPU, some aren&#39;t fast enough UI-wise to help me really blaze through skimming, and some aren&#39;t flexible enough for me to tweak to my particular liking.</p>\n<p>At this point, though, <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a> comes really close to what I&#39;ve been wanting for years.  It&#39;s open source (<a href=\"http://vienna-rss.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vienna-rss/trunk/2.1.0/\">check it out!</a>); uses WebKit to offer a <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna_styles.php\">theme-able</a> feed item display (<a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/02/12/colloquy-irc\">hello Colloquy!</a>); and uses SQLite 3 for persistence (<a href=\"http://vienna-rss.sourceforge.net/public/DatabaseSchema.pdf\">with schema documentation!</a>).  Out of the box, it&#39;s a pretty nice app, but it was even nicer when I started poking under the hood.  I&#39;ve even <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=31310885&amp;forum_id=48723\">submitted my first small patch</a>, which got accepted into the codebase.</p>\n<p>When last I tried <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a>, it was on my poor old PowerBook G4 12&quot; 867Mhz and it was a somewhat rough and bad tasting experience.  At the time, <a href=\"http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire\">NetNewsWire</a> was my tool of choice, and <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a> was lacking some features - like, say, a user-sortable list of subscription folders and feeds.  It also thrashed a lot and generally made me Force Quit it and move on.  But now, on my new-ish MacBook Pro, the performance is stellar with my set of 500+ feeds and my few showstopper missing features are no longer missing.  </p>\n<p>Now, it seems like <a href=\"http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire\">NetNewsWire</a> is the app that thrashes for me and gets a Force Quit.  I need to try <a href=\"http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire\">NNW</a> a bit more and figure out if it&#39;s just my initial import of subscriptions that drags things down - but <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a>&#39;s got me now.

    "body": "In the last few days, I've switched news aggregators again - this time to [Vienna][].\r\n\r\nI've got a [long][l1], [long][l2], [long][l3] [history][l4] of doing this - partially because of my [serial enthusiasm][se], and partially because none of the aggregators I've used so far have satisfied all of my itches.  Some tie up my laptop in terms of memory and CPU, some aren't fast enough UI-wise to help me really blaze through skimming, and some aren't flexible enough for me to tweak to my particular liking.\r\n\r\nAt this point, though, [Vienna][] comes really close to what I've been wanting for years.  It's open source ([check it out!][vsvn]); uses WebKit to offer a [theme-able][vt] feed item display ([hello Colloquy!][wk]); and uses SQLite 3 for persistence ([with schema documentation!][vdb]).  Out of the box, it's a pretty nice app, but it was even nicer when I started poking under the hood.  I've even [submitted my first small patch][vpatch], which got accepted into the codebase.\r\n\r\nWhen last I tried [Vienna][], it was on my poor old PowerBook G4 12\" 867Mhz and it was a somewhat rough and bad tasting experience.  At the time, [NetNewsWire][] was my tool of choice, and [Vienna][] was lacking some features - like, say, a user-sortable list of subscription folders and feeds.  It also thrashed a lot and generally made me Force Quit it and move on.  But now, on my new-ish MacBook Pro, the performance is stellar with my set of 500+ feeds and my few showstopper missing features are no longer missing.  \r\n\r\nNow, it seems like [NetNewsWire][] is the app that thrashes for me and gets a Force Quit.  I need to try [NNW][NetNewsWire] a bit more and figure out if it's just my initial import of subscriptions that drags things down - but [Vienna][]'s got me now.  It's catching up mightily fast with the feature list of NNW.  And, nothing beats open source software for tossing in a few tweaks to things that are just *not quite* doing what I'd like.\r\n\r\nAgain, since I'm a [serial enthusiast][se], I have no idea if I'll be a regular contributor of patches to [Vienna][] or even offer any commitment to the project - but I'm definitely happy with it at the moment.\r\n\r\n[vpatch]: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=31310885&forum_id=48723\r\n[vt]: http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna_styles.php\r\n[vsvn]: http://vienna-rss.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vienna-rss/trunk/2.1.0/\r\n[vdb]: http://vienna-rss.sourceforge.net/public/DatabaseSchema.pdf\r\n[wk]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/02/12/colloquy-irc\r\n[Vienna]: http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\r\n[NetNewsWire]: http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire\r\n[l1]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/18/good-gregarius\r\n[l2]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/12/further-work-on-decafbadnewsriver\r\n[l3]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/05/feedspool-is-progressing-nicely\r\n[l4]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/05/introducing-dbagg3-an-atom-powered-clientserver-aggregator\r\n[se]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\r\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085597\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\">Craig</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085597\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-02T22:20:49\">2007-01-02T22:20:49</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Not sure if you care much for web-based aggregators, but ReBlog is my current favorite.

And because of that, these tools are unfortunately brittle and prone to future shock.</p>\n<p>For example, take <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb\"><code>Syndication.framework</code> on OS X</a>:  Amongst the monkeys and ninjas and pirates and robots, you&#39;ve got your standard <em>title-date-link-description</em> columns with a few other bits for good measure.  But, where&#39;s the data from <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/static/iTunesRSS.html\">iTunes RSS extensions</a>?  Nowhere, gone, lost.  If it was in the feed when <code>Syndication.framework</code> found it, it wasn&#39;t understood and so it wasn&#39;t retained after the parser finished chewing up and spitting the data into that DB table.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/building-a-proper-shared-syndication-feed-foundation\">I&#39;ve written about shared feed processing foundations before</a>, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve totally gotten the idea to gel in my head until now.  Here&#39;s the thing:  If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.  Rather than intrusively breaking apart and recasting feed data into a predetermined data structure, you&#39;ve got to remain hands-off as much as possible.</p>\n<p>This is what I did in <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a>.  This code can subscribe to feeds, poll feed data periodically, and even work out which items in a feed are new—but it punts on everything else by only caring about where a feed starts and ends, and where its individual entries start and end.  <em>The rest is left in its original XML form.</em>  So, if there was data in there for iTunes?  It&#39;s still there, because <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a> didn&#39;t know enough to do anything to it.</p>\n<p>This is the major difference in feed processing model.  <code>Syndication.framework</code> loses information when it encounters things it doesn&#39;t understand.  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a> retains the information, because it leaves things alone when it doesn&#39;t know any better.</p>\n<p>Now, this is not to pick on just <code>Syndication.framework</code>.  Despite the general-sounding name,  this framework is pretty much just around to power <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/\">Safari RSS</a> and not <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/\">iTunes</a> or anything else.  And as I said, pretty much every other feed processing framework and tool works in this manner.  Just about everybody uses a destructive process when they parse and marshal feed data into local-idiom structures.  </p>\n<p>And this destructive process is fine when all you want to do is satisfy a specific purpose—display a few headlines, for example.  But if you&#39;re trying to build general-case feed plumbing, this is unacceptable and untenable.  If most everything in a feed item gets lost as it goes through a pipeline, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/05/the-right-place-for-data-in-your-feed\">we might as well abandon feed extensions entirely in favor of microformats stuffed into the <code>description</code> tag</a>—an idea to which I&#39;m not <em>entirely</em> opposed.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, consider this:  This past summer, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/four-thoughts-on-ms-rss-so-far\">Microsoft released an architectural overview about an OS-wide RSS framework in the upcoming Vista</a>.  Unfortunately, like many RSS and Vista related things from this past summer, all links have evaporated into a redirect to a single developers portal.  I can&#39;t figure out why they didn&#39;t just <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/rss/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/rsssupportinlonghorn.asp\">redirect over to here</a>, which took me a search and a few clicks to rediscover.</p>\n<p>At any rate, there&#39;s one sentence in this overview that gives me hope for RSS as a general service in Windows Vista:  </p>\n<p>&quot;<em>It is also possible to access the item XML for applications that want to perform operations on the XML instead of using the item&#39;s properties.</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>So, dig that.  If it works the way I hope it does, RSS in Vista will take care of the subscriptions for you, poll the feed data, grab new stuff—but then it leaves the data intact for you to process whatever new and unanticipated feed payloads that may arrive.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s how it <em>should</em> work.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084486\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=622a34307765c2f7c1dfdc7345842418&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\">Darren Chamberlain</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-13T15:03:07\">2005-12-13T15:03:07</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n<p>If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.

(And that's not to mention the 7-8 step form I had to go through to start filtering.  Definitely not a URL-line application.)

The <code>dc:subject</code> elements encoding del.icio.us tags are gone, even in the RSS-1.0-to-RSS-1.0 transformation.

If it works the way I hope it does, RSS in Vista will take care of the subscriptions for you, poll the feed data, grab new stuff—but then it leaves the data intact for you to process whatever new and unanticipated feed payloads that may arrive.\r\n\r\nThat's how it *should* work.\r\n\r\n[fmf]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/05/the-right-place-for-data-in-your-feed\r\n[itp]: http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/\r\n[fir]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/13/feedmagick-the-feed-filter-that-doesnt-know-much-about-feeds\r\n[sr]: http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/\r\n[he]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/rss/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/rsssupportinlonghorn.asp\r\n[tc]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/integrated/\r\n[ao]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/four-thoughts-on-ms-rss-so-far\r\n[fs]: http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\r\n[ir]: http://phobos.apple.com/static/iTunesRSS.html\r\n[sx]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb\r\n[sf]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/building-a-proper-shared-syndication-feed-foundation\r\n[mi]: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/10/27/extend.html\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084486\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=622a34307765c2f7c1dfdc7345842418&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\">Darren Chamberlain</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-13T15:03:07\">2005-12-13T15:03:07</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n  <p>If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.

(And that's not to mention the 7-8 step form I had to go through to start filtering.  Definitely not a URL-line application.)  But, with respect to their filtering and conversion, check out these feeds:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>http://del.icio.us/rss/deusx</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/RSS0.91</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/RSS1.0</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/RSS2.0</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/ATOM0.3</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you compare these to each other, you'll find information loss and even just plain corruption.  The <code>dc:subject</code> elements encoding del.icio.us tags are gone, even in the RSS-1.0-to-RSS-1.0 transformation.  And somehow, in the Atom version, they managed to jumble up titles and authors.  Granted, my stuff doesn't do <em>conversion</em> yet, but I wouldn't want to do it like this.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't tried it yet, but I'd have to guess that a podcast feed with iTunes and/or Yahoo!
