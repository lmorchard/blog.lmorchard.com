I’ve watched him get\nolder, walking a little slower and taking breaks on his way through the house.\nHe wasn’t the same kitten I knew who would leap from the floor to the top of a\nbookshelf almost seven feet high.

I’ll miss him, but I won’t miss the constant\nvigilance to catch him before he soiled the couch. I won’t miss keeping on top\nof pills and injections and special food. I won’t miss the sad moans when I\nclosed him up in the attic for the night by himself. (The alternative was\nwaking up in the wee hours to fights with the new cat Catsby. Or, waking up to\nhim making a mess in his favorite spot next to me on the bed.)</p>\n<p>The night before last, we took him to the vet and got news that he was\nseriously ill. We were advised to keep an eye on him through the night, so I\nstayed with him on the couch in the attic.</p>\n<p>I hauled <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2004/12/03/if-you-snore-get-tested-for-sleep-apnea-now/\">my CPAP\nmachine</a> up there, figuring we’d fall asleep together like old\ntimes. I didn’t expect it to turn into an overnight vigil - but every time I\ncame close to falling asleep, he’d do something to wake me back up. A meow, a\nmoan, a few times even a paw to my face. There we were, laying together on the\ncouch, or sometimes the carpet, watching the sky outside gradually lighten.</p>\n<p>Maybe he was excited to have me there or maybe it was just the new meds, but\nhe wanted my attention. I spent a long time petting him and rubbing his belly.\nHe kneaded my arm and rubbed his head on me. We spent long minutes just\nlooking at each other like we would when I woke up with him on better days.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, he spent most of the day at the vet’s. They ran tests, got some new\nmeds into him. It was bad, but it seemed like he was responding to treatment.</p>\n<p><a style=\"position: block; float: left; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0;\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/16381807917\" title=\"IMG_20150218_012414 by Les Orchard, on Flickr\"><img src=\"/uploads/2015/puck/16381807917_d56aa3c0ee_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"IMG_20150218_012414\"></a></p>\n<p>We got him home and he spent the rest of the evening curled up in his favorite\nspot on the couch.

Puck seemed okay, or as well as could be expected. I carried him up to\nthe attic and put him on a soft blanket in front of a heater. He moaned, but\nsettled in. I got him to eat a little more, spent some time petting him, told\nhim good night. He cried as I went down the stairs and closed the door behind\nme. I told myself that he’d be okay in the morning. I couldn’t do another\nnight like the one before, I was just too tired.</p>\n<p>The girl woke me up early this morning. He hadn’t come down the attic stairs\nto demand his release like usual.
