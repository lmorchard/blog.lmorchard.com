The\ncore of it, handling the posts, looks something <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/master/lib/tasks/posts.js#L34\">like this</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function posts (path) {\n  return gulp.src(path)\n    .pipe(frontMatter({property: &#39;page&#39;, remove: true}))\n    .pipe(taskUtils.filename2date())\n    .pipe(marked())\n    .pipe(taskUtils.summarize(&#39;&lt;!--more--&gt;&#39;))\n    .pipe(rename(taskUtils.postNameToDatePath))\n    .pipe(taskUtils.applyTemplate(&#39;design/layouts/post.html&#39;))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(&#39;build&#39;));\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Pretty clean &amp; straightforward, at least to my eyes.</p>\n<p>Starting from <a href=\"https://github.com/rioki/www.rioki.org/blob/master/gulpfile.js\">Rioki&#39;s gulpfile.js</a>, I hacked and iterated until I had\na <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/master/gulpfile.js\">gulpfile.js</a> of my own, split into <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/master/lib/tasks/posts.js#L34\">a directory of small task\nmodules</a>.  At this point, I&#39;ve got a bunch of in-memory post indexes,\ndate &amp; tag based archive pages, RSS feeds, and a handful of other templated\npages. I can push all the content to an Amazon S3 bucket <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/master/gulpfile.js#L32\">with one\ncommand</a>. </p>\n<p>Oh, and building the whole site only takes around 30 seconds.

That&#39;s just a handful of files, if\nall I&#39;m doing is publishing one new post.</p>\n<p>It also seems like this module uploads one file at a time. I wonder if I might\nhack it to queue up a few dozen or so in parallel to speed things up? I doubt\nthat uploading thousands of files was the original use case, so it might do\nwith some tweaking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"page-sections-loaded-via-ajax\">Page sections loaded via AJAX</h2>\n<p>I&#39;ve got a simple template for this new blog, and I hope to keep it that way.\nBut, there&#39;s a lot of stuff in that sidebar. Well, I decided to tweak a few\nthings and suddenly I had 4750 files to upload to S3.</p>\n<p>Just because the site is statically published doesn&#39;t mean some parts\ncan&#39;t be dynamic with the help of the client. Rather than put up wth\nregenerating &amp; uploading all the things in the future, I yanked the sidebar\nout of almost every page and generated it as <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/master/design/sidebar.html\">a separate resource</a>.</p>\n<p>Then, with <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/master/design/js/main.js\">a tiny bit of jQuery magic</a>, I load that sidebar into\nthe page via AJAX. That shrank the size of the site overall, and it&#39;s so fast\nand cacheable that I never see any difference.</p>\n<p>I think this will be one of the little keys to maintaining the site: Try to\nextract any common element used throughout the site, and push it into a\ndynamically loaded asset. Not everything can be done that way, but I think\nplenty can.</p>\n<h2 id=\"disqus-and-comment-archival\">Disqus and comment archival</h2>\n<p>I&#39;m also back to using Disqus for comments. They&#39;ve got a great service, and\nthey&#39;re not a roach motel. They have a great API, and I even wrote a Python\nscript for decafbad.com that <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.decafbad.com/blob/master/_bin/archive_disqus_comments.py\">archives comments from closed\nthreads</a> right into the blog post itself.</p>\n<p>At some point, I need to get that working again and maybe transliterate it\nover to node.js. </p>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\">Next steps</h2>\n<p>I&#39;ve got some more I&#39;d like to do with this stuff, but the main next steps are\nthese:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write more often</li>\n<li>Write more consistently</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, having skimmed through my posts over the years on this blog, I&#39;d\nestimate about 25% of the whole thing is me grousing out loud about the long\nstretches I spend neglecting this place. </p>\n<p>So, who knows?

    "html": "<p>So, I read about <a href=\"http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html\">Blogging Like a Hacker</a> a few years ago. It sounded like a neat idea. A little over a year ago, after much procrastination, I <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/06/08/moved-to-jekyll\">switched to Jekyll and Disqus</a> for blogging and comments.</p>\n<p>Well, guess what? Though the process was novel, I didn&#8217;t blog with any more frequency than I have over the past couple of years. I think I&#8217;ve discovered this about myself: I like <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/\">hacking like a hacker</a>, and I might even like writing a book like a hacker using <a href=\"http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/\">AsciiDoc</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/schacon/git-scribe\">git-scribe</a>. But, those are things which tend to demand deliberation and attention to detail.</p>\n<p>But for blogging? Forget all that fuss. At least, not the way I want to blog. I usually want to spew things that are longer than a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard\">tweet</a>, but shorter than a formal essay. I might iterate by reviewing &amp; revising a few times, because I can&#8217;t resist. But, then, I&#8217;ll move on.</p>\n<p>And, for that kind of writing, the process of using git &amp; jekyll just throws too much friction into my brain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have to create a text file with a filename of proper form,</li>\n<li>edit the text with whatever&#8217;s floating in my brain stew,</li>\n<li>start up jekyll for a preview, wait, <code>Ctrl-C</code> after a few minutes,</li>\n<li>make sure I don&#8217;t have my other 1001 posts in the way because generating things takes <em>ffoorreevveerr</em>. (Tools like <a href=\"http://markedapp.com/\">Marked</a> help here, quite a lot.) </li>\n<li>start up jekyll again and load the new post in a browser</li>\n<li>repeat a few times</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh, and then once I&#8217;m happy with the post, I get to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>compose a commit message, </li>\n<li>push to my web server and github for good measure</li>\n<li>wander off while a post-receive hook regenerates my site on my server</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And then, very recently, I decided to check out WordPress again. I almost forgot how stupidly quick &amp; simple it was to set up. Things like that make me want to hack PHP again.</p>\n<p>In WordPress, my process is this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>visit my blog in my browser, create a new post; </li>\n<li>go tappy-tappy like a monkey writing Shakespeare, watch the preview pane;</li>\n<li>hit publish</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I&#8217;m feeling frisky, I can update a few more times and also hit some buttons to light up Facebook and Twitter with my new brain vomit.</p>\n<p>In my brain, this process makes it feel like so much less of a pain, lame as that might sound.

    "body": "So, I read about [Blogging Like a Hacker][1] a few years ago. It sounded like a neat idea. A little over a year ago, after much procrastination, I [switched to Jekyll and Disqus][2] for blogging and comments.\r\n\r\nWell, guess what? Though the process was novel, I didn&#8217;t blog with any more frequency than I have over the past couple of years. I think I&#8217;ve discovered this about myself: I like [hacking like a hacker][3], and I might even like writing a book like a hacker using [AsciiDoc][4] and [git-scribe][5]. But, those are things which tend to demand deliberation and attention to detail.\r\n\r\nBut for blogging? Forget all that fuss. At least, not the way I want to blog. I usually want to spew things that are longer than a [tweet][6], but shorter than a formal essay. I might iterate by reviewing & revising a few times, because I can&#8217;t resist. But, then, I&#8217;ll move on.\r\n\r\nAnd, for that kind of writing, the process of using git & jekyll just throws too much friction into my brain:\r\n\r\n*   I have to create a text file with a filename of proper form,\r\n*   edit the text with whatever&#8217;s floating in my brain stew,\r\n*   start up jekyll for a preview, wait, `Ctrl-C` after a few minutes,\r\n*   make sure I don&#8217;t have my other 1001 posts in the way because generating things takes *ffoorreevveerr*. (Tools like [Marked][7] help here, quite a lot.) \r\n*   start up jekyll again and load the new post in a browser\r\n*   repeat a few times\r\n\r\nOh, and then once I&#8217;m happy with the post, I get to:\r\n\r\n*   compose a commit message, \r\n*   push to my web server and github for good measure\r\n*   wander off while a post-receive hook regenerates my site on my server\r\n\r\nAnd then, very recently, I decided to check out WordPress again. I almost forgot how stupidly quick & simple it was to set up. Things like that make me want to hack PHP again.\r\n\r\nIn WordPress, my process is this:\r\n\r\n*   visit my blog in my browser, create a new post; \r\n*   go tappy-tappy like a monkey writing Shakespeare, watch the preview pane;\r\n*   hit publish\r\n\r\nIf I&#8217;m feeling frisky, I can update a few more times and also hit some buttons to light up Facebook and Twitter with my new brain vomit.\r\n\r\nIn my brain, this process makes it feel like so much less of a pain, lame as that might sound. And it&#8217;s still self-hosted. And I can still do weird things, if I even care about that anymore. Which I don&#8217;t, at least not [as much as I did back in 2002][8].\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, a pile of static <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML</a> generated from text files kept in git is a great way to archive & mothball a site.

    "html": "<p>Although I have <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/18/not-so-deep-php-thoughts\">my grousing about PHP in general</a>, I have to say that it makes much better template language as-is before pulling something like <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> into the mix.  </p>\n<p>At this point, I consider <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> to be evil—though I&#39;m willing to admit that I haven&#39;t grokked it fully yet.  And this is coming from <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/25/templates-good-or-evil\">a templating addict</a> who has been at times in love with <a href=\"http://www.template-toolkit.org/\">Template Toolkit</a> in Perl,  <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/\">Velocity</a> in Java, and <a href=\"http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/\">Cheetah</a> and <a href=\"http://twisted.sourceforge.net/TwistedDocs-1.2.0rc3/howto/woven.html\">Woven</a> and <a href=\"http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/\">ZPT/TAL</a> in Python.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> seems to have put native-PHP-as-templating to good use, so I&#39;ve already got a favorite for comparison.  But the use of <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> in <a href=\"http://www.reblog.org/\">reBlog</a> rubs me the wrong way.  Of course, <a href=\"http://www.reblog.org/\">reBlog</a> has a lot of highly-abstracted MVC architecture going on.  And this, itself, is something I haven&#39;t much in my PHP explorations thus far.  (In fact, I almost hate to see PHP chopped up in this J2EE-esque fashion, but that&#39;s another story.  Oh, and <a href=\"http://www.reblog.org/\">reBlog</a> rocks, by the way.)</p>\n<p>But either way, <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> makes this right-handed hacker feel like he&#39;s writing with his left.  It seems to have a lot of weird conventions and terminology for which neither knowledge of PHP nor knowledge of other templating systems in general seem much help.  It could just be a learning curve, but to me it seems like an odd <em>sideways</em> curve at the moment.  </p>\n<p>In fact, you know what?  <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> reminds me a lot of <a href=\"http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Guides/DTML-HTML/DTML.html\">DTML in Zope</a>.  I hate <a href=\"http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Guides/DTML-HTML/DTML.html\">DTML</a>—it, also, is most firmly on my evil list.</p>\n<p>Yuck.  Again, it could be just that I haven&#39;t known <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> long enough to like it... but yuck.</p>\n<!-- tags: templating php smarty dtml python perl cheetah webdev programming syndication reblog wordpress evil -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082526\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://luka.kladaric.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=78b0e32da6ce10e17db345a9aa8cde78&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://luka.kladaric.net/\">Luka Kladaric</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082526\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-08T11:55:40\">2006-01-08T11:55:40</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with you...

The main issue is that template authors may not be trustworthy. Once you include or eval() a PHP template the app is no longer in control and I don't see any way of structuring a PHP app such that it cannot be subverted from within. </p>\n<p>The only defense seems to be using the tokenizer functions to build a PHP parser that validates templates against a \"whitelist\" of allowed operations. Savant's Restricted Compiler is about the only implementation out there, but it's not quite complete and seems to be more of a proof-of-concept than battle-tested code.</p>\n<p>Whatever Smarty's faults, it solves the untrusted templates problem nicely.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082534\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082534\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-12T14:27:42\">2006-01-12T14:27:42</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Bryce: Oh, I totally understand the implications of offering too much capability to template authors.

Of course, I used others but it was getting sick coming to a new phase in a project and finding out the template system had become RIP....abandoned before their time.</p>\n<p>Smarty has done two great things for me, and I'll speak about them until the day that PHP is abolished:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Smarty has reduced my code to a reasonably sized, scan-able, masterpiece.  Having the logic and presentation seperate is so nice.  I recently rewrote one of my old projects using smarty and all of a sudden it made sense!  No more php in the html and no more html in the php.  And that's something you can't solve without templates for you juniors out there.</p></li>\n<li><p>Smarty's caching has turned monster db queries into non issues.  Consider this.  A top 10 list from all-time sales.  I'm talking about searching a db with sales spanning 6 years for all items purchased and creating a top sales page.  Easy!  Smarty does it once and caches the results until I decide they need to be refreshed.  Took a 4 second execution time down to less than 0.4 seconds.  And all without having to implement a CMS or otherwise.  Even if you have limitless resources to buy new hardware, caching like this still makes sense.  And the intermediate php/html cache is brilliant.  Everything is so much faster with smarty.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I can't deny, I love Smarty.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082542\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082542\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-01T11:43:36\">2006-02-01T11:43:36</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Tali: I'm usually opinionated, but I try to listen &amp; learn :)</p>\n<p>The benefits you describe with Smarty would seem to come with any decent web development system.

Why do You don’t have to have different languages to be able to put the business logic in one file and the display logic in another.</p>\n<p>Perl (not PERL), btw, has the Template Toolkit on the CPAN, which is the spiritual father of Smarty. (And it’s vaguely more defensible in Perl’s case becase Perl is not a template system; though constrated with Perl the deficiencies of TT’s mini language are just all the more painfully obvious.)</p>\n<p>By all of which I mean to say that whether people use languages in stupid ways does not mean the language is the problem; not in either PHP’s or Perl’s case.</p>\n<p>I also don’t see why you need a templating system to implement caching; in fact, having caching coupled with the template engine sounds like a bad distribution of responsibilities. (Indeed, Template Toolkit has no such facilities.) But there’s the Cache::Cache family of modules on the CPAN, which you can use to cache things completely independently of <em>what</em> is being cached – whether it be the output of a template, or the query results themselves, or anything else, which might not even have anything to do without any output you generate.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082546\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bab1c370ad7b246023e23e87c8e206c4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">M.</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082546\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-16T14:13:18\">2006-02-16T14:13:18</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I've good experiences with the Expose PHP template engine (www.kwasd.nl/expose).

I used it for some projects and it really offered all I needed. </p>\n<p>And for people who wonder why one would need a template engine: I work with designers and I don't want them to mingle application code. By setting up a shared folder which contains the templates, they can safely work on design and never need to touch my controller or module files. Especially since this template engine has a tokenizer/compiler, they can't call unsafe PHP functions (only those that you, the programmer, register).</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082549\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://mike.teczno.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e3b46099c3fd3844c4539b27f143fd97&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://mike.teczno.com\">Michal Migurski</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082549\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-05T23:16:25\">2006-03-05T23:16:25</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Smarty appealed to us because it offered a (relatively) clean way to separate the code from the HTML output. It's definitely got its problems. A large part of the choice was based on my perception of Smarty as having much thought &amp; effort behind it, plus I like the idea of templates caching down to plain PHP. I've done a few PHP projects where I used PHP as the templating language, and frequently succumbed to the temptation to stash app logic into the templates where it didn't really belong. Smarty has a pretty extensive vocabulary, but has (so far) resisted the pull to incorporate more real-language features, like PHP did. It's worth remembering that PHP was originally supposed to be a template language for \"real\" code to be written in C. <em>shudder</em></p>\n<p>When we forked Reblog from Feed On Feeds, we were starting with raw-PHP display code mixed in with database calls, and it was a freaking disaster. One of my first design goals was to make it hacker-friendly, clarifying and documenting as many seams as possible so people could make localized changes more easily. I'd like to be using Python under the hood with Smarty on top, though there's a lot to be said for using commonly-known tools like Smarty in apps where you want to encourage modifications.</p>\n<p>And Wordpress.... oh, Wordpress. My eyes roll back in my head when I'm forced to touch its convoluted innards. I pushed hard for a Reblog plug-in API specifically so I could cheerfully deprecate the old-style Wordpress plug-in. =)</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "Although I have [my grousing about PHP in general][gphp], I have to say that it makes much better template language as-is before pulling something like [Smarty][smarty] into the mix.  \r\n\r\nAt this point, I consider [Smarty][] to be evil—though I'm willing to admit that I haven't grokked it fully yet.  And this is coming from [a templating addict][tmpl] who has been at times in love with [Template Toolkit][tt] in Perl,  [Velocity][] in Java, and [Cheetah][] and [Woven][] and [ZPT/TAL][zpt] in Python.  \r\n\r\n[WordPress][] seems to have put native-PHP-as-templating to good use, so I've already got a favorite for comparison.  But the use of [Smarty][] in [reBlog][] rubs me the wrong way.  Of course, [reBlog][] has a lot of highly-abstracted MVC architecture going on.  And this, itself, is something I haven't much in my PHP explorations thus far.  (In fact, I almost hate to see PHP chopped up in this J2EE-esque fashion, but that's another story.  Oh, and [reBlog][] rocks, by the way.)\r\n\r\nBut either way, [Smarty][] makes this right-handed hacker feel like he's writing with his left.  It seems to have a lot of weird conventions and terminology for which neither knowledge of PHP nor knowledge of other templating systems in general seem much help.  It could just be a learning curve, but to me it seems like an odd *sideways* curve at the moment.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, you know what?  [Smarty][] reminds me a lot of [DTML in Zope][dtml].  I hate [DTML][]—it, also, is most firmly on my evil list.\r\n\r\nYuck.  Again, it could be just that I haven't known [Smarty][] long enough to like it... but yuck.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: templating php smarty dtml python perl cheetah webdev programming syndication reblog wordpress evil -->\r\n\r\n[dtml]: http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Guides/DTML-HTML/DTML.html\r\n[tt]: http://www.template-toolkit.org/\r\n[velocity]: http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/\r\n[gphp]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/18/not-so-deep-php-thoughts\r\n[cheetah]: http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/\r\n[zpt]: http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/\r\n[smarty]: http://smarty.php.net\r\n[wordpress]: http://wordpress.org/\r\n[reblog]: http://www.reblog.org/\r\n[woven]: http://twisted.sourceforge.net/TwistedDocs-1.2.0rc3/howto/woven.html\r\n[tmpl]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/25/templates-good-or-evil\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082526\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://luka.kladaric.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=78b0e32da6ce10e17db345a9aa8cde78&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://luka.kladaric.net/\">Luka Kladaric</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082526\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-08T11:55:40\">2006-01-08T11:55:40</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with you...

Of course, I used others but it was getting sick coming to a new phase in a project and finding out the template system had become RIP....abandoned before their time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smarty has done two great things for me, and I'll speak about them until the day that PHP is abolished:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><p>Smarty has reduced my code to a reasonably sized, scan-able, masterpiece.  Having the logic and presentation seperate is so nice.  I recently rewrote one of my old projects using smarty and all of a sudden it made sense!  No more php in the html and no more html in the php.  And that's something you can't solve without templates for you juniors out there.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Smarty's caching has turned monster db queries into non issues.  Consider this.  A top 10 list from all-time sales.  I'm talking about searching a db with sales spanning 6 years for all items purchased and creating a top sales page.  Easy!  Smarty does it once and caches the results until I decide they need to be refreshed.  Took a 4 second execution time down to less than 0.4 seconds.  And all without having to implement a CMS or otherwise.  Even if you have limitless resources to buy new hardware, caching like this still makes sense.  And the intermediate php/html cache is brilliant.  Everything is so much faster with smarty.</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>I can't deny, I love Smarty.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082542\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082542\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-01T11:43:36\">2006-02-01T11:43:36</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Tali: I'm usually opinionated, but I try to listen &amp; learn :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The benefits you describe with Smarty would seem to come with any decent web development system.  Separating logic and presentation are the general idea behind templating, and some sort of caching is a must no matter what you're using as a presentation-side tool.  My beef is that, out of all the templating systems I've used, Smarty is one of the ugliest.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082543\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bdbf6409528370f5549e8470caf6ba30&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Tali Banana</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082543\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-01T17:30:03\">2006-02-01T17:30:03</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Smarty does need some standards redesign on the interface, as does php itself which has been well documented but slow going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming from the PERL background and previous php template systems I've been very happy with Smarty in general, even if there are a few things that could be done to speed up the learning curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May be worthwhile jumping on the dev team and making some suggestions.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082544\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082544\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-02T01:30:31\">2006-02-02T01:30:31</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>But why would you need a template system when you’re already working with PHP, which is itself a template system? Why do You don’t have to have different languages to be able to put the business logic in one file and the display logic in another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perl (not PERL), btw, has the Template Toolkit on the CPAN, which is the spiritual father of Smarty. (And it’s vaguely more defensible in Perl’s case becase Perl is not a template system; though constrated with Perl the deficiencies of TT’s mini language are just all the more painfully obvious.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By all of which I mean to say that whether people use languages in stupid ways does not mean the language is the problem; not in either PHP’s or Perl’s case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also don’t see why you need a templating system to implement caching; in fact, having caching coupled with the template engine sounds like a bad distribution of responsibilities. (Indeed, Template Toolkit has no such facilities.) But there’s the Cache::Cache family of modules on the CPAN, which you can use to cache things completely independently of <em>what</em> is being cached – whether it be the output of a template, or the query results themselves, or anything else, which might not even have anything to do without any output you generate.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082546\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bab1c370ad7b246023e23e87c8e206c4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">M.</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082546\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-16T14:13:18\">2006-02-16T14:13:18</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I've good experiences with the Expose PHP template engine (www.kwasd.nl/expose). It doesn't require you to learn a new language, because it uses plain PHP and still offers security, because it contains a tokenizer and, in fact, a small compiler. I used it for some projects and it really offered all I needed. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And for people who wonder why one would need a template engine: I work with designers and I don't want them to mingle application code. By setting up a shared folder which contains the templates, they can safely work on design and never need to touch my controller or module files. Especially since this template engine has a tokenizer/compiler, they can't call unsafe PHP functions (only those that you, the programmer, register).</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082549\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e3b46099c3fd3844c4539b27f143fd97&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\">Michal Migurski</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082549\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-05T23:16:25\">2006-03-05T23:16:25</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Smarty appealed to us because it offered a (relatively) clean way to separate the code from the HTML output. It's definitely got its problems. A large part of the choice was based on my perception of Smarty as having much thought &amp; effort behind it, plus I like the idea of templates caching down to plain PHP. I've done a few PHP projects where I used PHP as the templating language, and frequently succumbed to the temptation to stash app logic into the templates where it didn't really belong. Smarty has a pretty extensive vocabulary, but has (so far) resisted the pull to incorporate more real-language features, like PHP did. It's worth remembering that PHP was originally supposed to be a template language for \"real\" code to be written in C. <em>shudder</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we forked Reblog from Feed On Feeds, we were starting with raw-PHP display code mixed in with database calls, and it was a freaking disaster. One of my first design goals was to make it hacker-friendly, clarifying and documenting as many seams as possible so people could make localized changes more easily. I'd like to be using Python under the hood with Smarty on top, though there's a lot to be said for using commonly-known tools like Smarty in apps where you want to encourage modifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Wordpress.... oh, Wordpress. My eyes roll back in my head when I'm forced to touch its convoluted innards. I pushed hard for a Reblog plug-in API specifically so I could cheerfully deprecate the old-style Wordpress plug-in. =)</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

My live links can be seen on del.icio.us here:\n\nhttp://del.icio.us/deusx\n\nBefore the weekend's out, though, I'm hoping to use an importer to pull my links into a category on this blog and try to reconstruct something of some semblance to the old links section.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088752\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.nur-eine-i.de\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e7368d797917d0df7942c26d4ed2e580&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.nur-eine-i.de\">Benjamin Reitzammer</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088752\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-21T10:41:12\">2005-09-21T10:41:12</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Thought I point it out ... your permalinks have changed slightly, for example from http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/18/ajax_testing_and_logging \nto \nhttp://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/18/ajax-testing-and-logging\n\nThis is especially \"challenging\" because you simply shout \"Go away\" on decafbad.com instead of redirecting to decafbad.com/blog which seems like a natural alternative.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088753\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.nur-eine-i.de\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e7368d797917d0df7942c26d4ed2e580&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.nur-eine-i.de\">Benjamin Reitzammer</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088753\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-21T10:42:51\">2005-09-21T10:42:51</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Worpress messed up my previous comment ... the URLs differ in that the new URLs have dashes in the \"post titles\" while the old URLs had underscores ... sorry for double posting.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088754\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088754\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-22T14:30:44\">2005-09-22T14:30:44</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Benjamin:  Ack!
