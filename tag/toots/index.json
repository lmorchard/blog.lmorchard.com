    "summary": "<p>I've been toying with something Twitterish lately, and thought I needed a\ndifferent word to describe the central <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_objects\">social object</a>.

Of course, I started by\nmaking fart jokes to myself before that expansion appeared in my head. But, I\nthink it's fun.</p>\n",
