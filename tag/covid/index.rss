                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baldur Bjarnason, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/notes/2025/foggy-feeds/&quot;&gt;Foggy feeds: the decline in my feed reader subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...I follow a lot of feeds in my feed reader, most of them only updating at most once a month, maybe weekly, and only a tiny handful update daily. About seven hundred (700) of the feeds I follow are active and I’ve been following some of them since the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a decent sample size both across fields – tech, media, and academia – and time – I’ve been following most of these since before COVID – and the decline in people’s thinking across many of these feeds has been noticeable because it’s incredibly fucking annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feeds suck, right now. My main excuse is I&#39;m way out of the habit of blogging like I did 20 years ago. And I think part of that habit is thinking out loud, getting things out into words in front of me to clarify the thinking. Tweets and toots aren&#39;t really long enough to let a fully formed notion flop out of my head and thrash around on the desk for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do know a lot of folks who got COVID, though. Gratefully, I seem to have avoided it so far. Is this like the notion that &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/did-lead-poisoning-cause-downfall-of-roman-empire-the-jury-is-still-out/&quot;&gt;the Roman Empire collapsed due to lead poisoning&lt;/a&gt;? I do feel like there&#39;s a lot of stupidity out there right now, like more than I&#39;d expect. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a conspiracy theory or just cynicism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description
