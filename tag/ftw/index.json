Doesn&#39;t seem like a revolution in browsers or anything, other than what it already was.  But, everything seems tighter, quicker, slicker, and more like a polished product.  My CPU usage is flatter than ever before, and it actually looks like I&#39;ve got some free memory left over after running it for a few days.  And this is speaking as an infovore who regularly has a dozen or so tabs open, with a turnover of at least a hundred a day.  All the extensions I really care about still work, a few have been forced to work using <a href=\"http://users.blueprintit.co.uk/~dave/web/firefox/nightly\">Nightly Tester Tools</a>.  And, one that stopped working (SessionSaver) has now been rolled into the browser itself.
