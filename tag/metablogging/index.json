At this point, I&#39;ve got a bunch of in-memory post indexes,\ndate &amp; tag based archive pages, RSS feeds, and a handful of other templated\npages. I can push all the content to an Amazon S3 bucket <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/master/gulpfile.js#L32\">with one\ncommand</a>. </p>\n<p>Oh, and building the whole site only takes around 30 seconds.

That&#39;s just a handful of files, if\nall I&#39;m doing is publishing one new post.</p>\n<p>It also seems like this module uploads one file at a time.

At any rate, it&#8217;s tinkering I&#8217;ve been procrastinating for years now, so I&#8217;ve got plenty of ideas to chase down.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/08/microblogging-like-its-2002\r\n [2]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/09/separating-publishing-from-hosting-on-the-web\r\n [3]: https://tootr.s3.amazonaws.com/users/amazon/amzn1.account.AF5OSES2YSFJEKYBANBHRFB25RXQ/index.html\r\n [4]: https://lmorchard.github.io/tootr/\r\n [5]: http://s3.amazonaws.com\r\n",

It&#8217;s sometimes after Twitter or Facebook does something cruddy to remind me that I&#8217;m the product. Sometimes, it&#8217;s when jerks have the run of the place and no one can do anything about it. Often these things are highly correlated.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"silos--sovereignty\"><span id=\"Silos_Sovereignty\">Silos &amp; Sovereignty</span></h2>\n<p>To just build another silo would be a mistake. So, as usual, my thinking strays toward decentralization &amp; user sovereignty. That is, empower people to put their stuff in lots of different places online that treat them like royalty &#8211; often because they&#8217;re paying customers.</p>\n<p>Historically, this tends to offer a terrible experience. To write on your own piece of the web, for example, you have to rent a domain &amp; a server. Then, get some kind of publishing tool working. Oh, and be sure to keep everything updated &amp; running.</p>\n<p>All of this requires hours of study and tinkering better spent doing something else. You know, like the things that prompted you to have thoughts worth sharing in the first place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-great-big-block-party-on-the-web\"><span id=\"The_Great_Big_Block_Party_on_the_Web\">The Great Big Block Party on the Web</span></h2>\n<p>Still, circa 2002 or so, we had us a great big block party on the web. The experience was so compelling that plenty of full- and part-time geeks braved the tech gauntlet to participate in the emergent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere\">blogosphere</a>. Good times, fun hacks.</p>\n<p>But, some folks had notions to make this even easier &amp; more accessible &#8211; and thereby rope in a much broader swath of humanity. Ditch decentralization. Simplify discovery. Provide the servers and the software. Improve the on-ramps. Make it free-as-in-beer.</p>\n<p>And it worked. The network effects of throwing open the doors on massive party silos soon dwarfed our little hobby homesteads on the open web. By the time I get a proper blog running and build myself <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_blogging#B\">a blogroll</a>, you&#8217;ve already gotten on both Twitter and Facebook and started making fun of me with all your new friends.</p>\n<p>However much I might grouse about the fix we find ourselves in now, it&#8217;s undeniable that these social networking silos have had massive success in connecting people around the world. You know, that thing we always dreamed the Internet would do?</p>\n<h2 id=\"free-as-in-lunch\"><span id=\"Free_as_in_Lunch\">Free as in Lunch</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch\">There ain&#8217;t no such thing as a free lunch</a>, though. Servers, developers, and bandwidth all cost money. As it turns out, though, having all these people partying in one place generates a big steaming heap of attention &amp; data. Certain parties are willing to pay for (or semi-legally demand) access to this rich humus, because it helps their businesses grow.</p>\n<p>The unfortunate thing, though, is that this optimizes for treating people like organic waste. The only real concern is that you don&#8217;t raise too much of a stink and just keep stewing in the pile producing valuable nutrients.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what it means to be the product rather than the customer. You have little control or influence. Maybe, just maybe, if you and a bunch of other people shout loud &amp; long enough, they&#8217;ll turn &amp; aerate the compost. That may not accomplish what you hoped.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fair-trade\"><span id=\"Fair_Trade\">Fair Trade?</span></h2>\n<p>Most people seem okay with the trade, though. Putting up with monitoring &amp; marketing can be an acceptable cover charge, given the alternatives. I&#8217;m no exception: I&#8217;ve been complacent enough over the past decade &#8211; because I get to talk to family, friends, and interesting folks without yak shaving on my hobby server. (Not yak shaving about this particular thing, anyway.)</p>\n<p>But, I haven&#8217;t clicked on a banner in forever, and I&#8217;ve gotten really cynical about marketing in general. More often than not, an ad drives me to actively avoid the product. Seems like the silos really have to work to squeeze value out of me. Seriously, some days I feel like I&#8217;m pulling a con on every single free-beer service on the web.</p>\n<p>My hunch is that the party will wind down, someday. But, maybe not soon and maybe not for everyone: <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/20/technology/social/facebook-zuckerberg-5-billion/\">We still have a few billion people on the planet yet to get in the door.</a> Those folks get to carry my freeloading butt. But, I bet things will start to look less familiar as time goes on and the silos catch on and stop targeting me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"party-like-its-2002\"><span id=\"Party_Like_it8217s_2002\">Party Like it&#8217;s 2002?</span></h2>\n<p>Still, it feels like the stink from the pile is rising steadily. Fresh folks might keep it rolling, but maybe veterans and cynical newcomers will look for something different. We have ephemeral messaging apps like Snapchat, anonymous spew like Secret, and continual complaints about meddling with the news feed.</p>\n<p>People object when they notice the creepy guys wandering around with clipboards, eavesdropping on conversations and randomly rearranging furniture in the room. Nothing really new, but it isn&#8217;t going away. Maybe it&#8217;ll rise to some level of notice and snowball?</p>\n<p>I wonder if we&#8217;ll have an opportunity to revisit the Great Web Block Party of 2002? Could we convince more people to pay money and tolerate complexity &#8211; even just a little &#8211; in exchange for their own pieces of the web?</p>\n<p>Maybe. But, I think it will take a better balance of payment &amp; annoyance vs privacy &amp; sovereignty. It also wouldn&#8217;t hurt if it made a profit for some folks &#8211; even if only as some nice <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_business\">lifestyle businesses</a>. If I knew how to make that happen, though, I&#8217;d be doing it. That&#8217;s what keeps me at my day job &#8211; though it helps that my employer is looking at this stuff, <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/\">albeit as a non-profit</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course, us old web hackers could just end up the new ham radio enthusiasts. We&#8217;ll get up early for our swap meets and trade links.

It&#8217;s sometimes after Twitter or Facebook does something cruddy to remind me that I&#8217;m the product. Sometimes, it&#8217;s when jerks have the run of the place and no one can do anything about it. Often these things are highly correlated.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Silos_Sovereignty\">Silos & Sovereignty</span>\r\n\r\nTo just build another silo would be a mistake. So, as usual, my thinking strays toward decentralization & user sovereignty. That is, empower people to put their stuff in lots of different places online that treat them like royalty &#8211; often because they&#8217;re paying customers.\r\n\r\nHistorically, this tends to offer a terrible experience. To write on your own piece of the web, for example, you have to rent a domain & a server. Then, get some kind of publishing tool working. Oh, and be sure to keep everything updated & running.\r\n\r\nAll of this requires hours of study and tinkering better spent doing something else. You know, like the things that prompted you to have thoughts worth sharing in the first place.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"The_Great_Big_Block_Party_on_the_Web\">The Great Big Block Party on the Web</span>\r\n\r\nStill, circa 2002 or so, we had us a great big block party on the web. The experience was so compelling that plenty of full- and part-time geeks braved the tech gauntlet to participate in the emergent [blogosphere][2]. Good times, fun hacks.\r\n\r\nBut, some folks had notions to make this even easier & more accessible &#8211; and thereby rope in a much broader swath of humanity. Ditch decentralization. Simplify discovery. Provide the servers and the software. Improve the on-ramps. Make it free-as-in-beer.\r\n\r\nAnd it worked. The network effects of throwing open the doors on massive party silos soon dwarfed our little hobby homesteads on the open web. By the time I get a proper blog running and build myself [a blogroll][3], you&#8217;ve already gotten on both Twitter and Facebook and started making fun of me with all your new friends.\r\n\r\nHowever much I might grouse about the fix we find ourselves in now, it&#8217;s undeniable that these social networking silos have had massive success in connecting people around the world. You know, that thing we always dreamed the Internet would do?\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Free_as_in_Lunch\">Free as in Lunch</span>\r\n\r\n[There ain&#8217;t no such thing as a free lunch][4], though. Servers, developers, and bandwidth all cost money. As it turns out, though, having all these people partying in one place generates a big steaming heap of attention & data. Certain parties are willing to pay for (or semi-legally demand) access to this rich humus, because it helps their businesses grow.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate thing, though, is that this optimizes for treating people like organic waste. The only real concern is that you don&#8217;t raise too much of a stink and just keep stewing in the pile producing valuable nutrients.\r\n\r\nThat&#8217;s what it means to be the product rather than the customer. You have little control or influence. Maybe, just maybe, if you and a bunch of other people shout loud & long enough, they&#8217;ll turn & aerate the compost. That may not accomplish what you hoped.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Fair_Trade\">Fair Trade?</span>\r\n\r\nMost people seem okay with the trade, though. Putting up with monitoring & marketing can be an acceptable cover charge, given the alternatives. I&#8217;m no exception: I&#8217;ve been complacent enough over the past decade &#8211; because I get to talk to family, friends, and interesting folks without yak shaving on my hobby server. (Not yak shaving about this particular thing, anyway.)\r\n\r\nBut, I haven&#8217;t clicked on a banner in forever, and I&#8217;ve gotten really cynical about marketing in general. More often than not, an ad drives me to actively avoid the product. Seems like the silos really have to work to squeeze value out of me. Seriously, some days I feel like I&#8217;m pulling a con on every single free-beer service on the web.\r\n\r\nMy hunch is that the party will wind down, someday. But, maybe not soon and maybe not for everyone: [We still have a few billion people on the planet yet to get in the door.][5] Those folks get to carry my freeloading butt. But, I bet things will start to look less familiar as time goes on and the silos catch on and stop targeting me.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Party_Like_it8217s_2002\">Party Like it&#8217;s 2002?</span>\r\n\r\nStill, it feels like the stink from the pile is rising steadily. Fresh folks might keep it rolling, but maybe veterans and cynical newcomers will look for something different. We have ephemeral messaging apps like Snapchat, anonymous spew like Secret, and continual complaints about meddling with the news feed.\r\n\r\nPeople object when they notice the creepy guys wandering around with clipboards, eavesdropping on conversations and randomly rearranging furniture in the room. Nothing really new, but it isn&#8217;t going away. Maybe it&#8217;ll rise to some level of notice and snowball?\r\n\r\nI wonder if we&#8217;ll have an opportunity to revisit the Great Web Block Party of 2002? Could we convince more people to pay money and tolerate complexity &#8211; even just a little &#8211; in exchange for their own pieces of the web?\r\n\r\nMaybe. But, I think it will take a better balance of payment & annoyance vs privacy & sovereignty. It also wouldn&#8217;t hurt if it made a profit for some folks &#8211; even if only as some nice [lifestyle businesses][6]. If I knew how to make that happen, though, I&#8217;d be doing it. That&#8217;s what keeps me at my day job &#8211; though it helps that my employer is looking at this stuff, [albeit as a non-profit][7].\r\n\r\nOf course, us old web hackers could just end up the new ham radio enthusiasts. We&#8217;ll get up early for our swap meets and trade links. Meanwhile, the world will have moved on from the web and we&#8217;ll have discovered that AOL was just ahead of its time.\r\n\r\nThat&#8217;s a depressing thought. I think I&#8217;ll [go for a run][8], then return to tinkering to cheer myself up.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging\r\n [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere\r\n [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_blogging#B\r\n [4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch\r\n [5]: http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/20/technology/social/facebook-zuckerberg-5-billion/\r\n [6]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_business\r\n [7]: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/\r\n [8]: http://www.strava.com/athletes/6013128",

Someone form a startup and take my money to solve this, so I don&#8217;t have to. Even better, release some open source so I can host it myself and maybe even contribute some code. I&#8217;m thinking about doing some of this, but my lack of sustained attention span for projects is [well documented][9].\r\n\r\nBut, the important thing here is that it&#8217;s ***distributed*** and a *thing* that&#8217;s conventionally done out there on the web. This shouldn&#8217;t be constrained to a single vendor&#8217;s silo ever again, because that allowed a single vendor to kill it dead and I miss it terribly.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://pinterest.com/\r\n [2]: http://tumblr.com/\r\n [3]: http://www.buzzfeed.com/robf4/googles-lost-social-network\r\n [4]: http://decafbad.com/tt-rss/public.php?op=rss&id=-2&key=6fa5a3a996809d4df9a357bd7c62efc464c8d147\r\n [5]: http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:deusx/\r\n [6]: http://pinterest.com/lmorchard/feed.rss\r\n [7]: http://links.scripting.com/rss.xml\r\n [8]: http://waxy.org/links/index.xml\r\n [9]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast",

You see,\r\none of my hobbies is turning myself into a human content filter for\r\nfriends on the web.\r\n\r\nAnd, honestly, having my sharing habits shaken up by the\r\n[Readerpocalypse][] makes it fun again.\r\n\r\nThe image over to the right is an attempt I made to diagram some of my\r\nsocial media flow. It's incomplete, though: I'm a cheapsake and ran\r\nout of free objects in my diagram. So, I had to leave out at least a\r\nhalf-dozen more services and a dozen additional connections.\r\n([LucidChart][] is very nice, by the way.)\r\n\r\n[lucidchart]: http://www.lucidchart.com/\r\n\r\n## In other words, ifttt.com is awesome\r\n\r\nIn particular, I've finally spent some time with [ifttt.com][]. It's\r\nlike [Automator][] for the social web. It lets you [define event\r\ntriggers from one site that cause actions on another site][recipes]. \r\n\r\nSo, I've gone crazy and created a bunch of tasks that make things like\r\nthe following possible:\r\n\r\n* [Pinboard][] bookmarks based on favorites from\r\n  [Twitter][twitterfavs], [identi.ca][identicafavs], [YouTube][],\r\n  [Last.fm][], and my [Kindle][] highlights. I'm turning my\r\n  [Pinboard][] account into both my personal social media archive and\r\n  a Google Reader sharing replacement, and I don't even have to beg\r\n  for new features at [Pinboard][].\r\n\r\n* [Tumblr][] photo posts based on [Reddit up-votes][reddit], [Flickr\r\n  favorites][], and [Pinboard][] bookmarks tagged \"[to:tumblr][]\".\r\n  Since creating it, I've left my [Tumblr][] almost entirely\r\n  neglected—but now with [ifttt.com][], I can route almost every nifty\r\n  image I find over to that thing. It's the right side of my outboard\r\n  brain to the [Pinboard][] left.\r\n\r\n* Published items from from my private installation of [Tiny Tiny RSS][] \r\n  end up shared on [Pinboard][]. This pretty much scratches my itch\r\n  for feed reader sharing, since [Google nixed those features from\r\n  Reader][readerpocalypse].\r\n\r\n* Starred items from [tt-rss][tiny tiny rss] get sent to\r\n  [Instapaper][], so I can read them on my [Kindle][] later. If [email\r\n  delivery of documents start working][ipemail], then I'll have a\r\n  personal long-attention span newspaper delivered regularly to that\r\n  gadget.\r\n\r\n* Posts from [Google+][] get copied over to [Facebook][], because I\r\n  don't want to pick sides.\r\n\r\n* In fact, almost everything I do everywhere eventually ends up posted\r\n  to [Facebook][], because I almost never post anything in person over\r\n  there. I do have friends and family over there and respond to\r\n  comments, though.\r\n\r\n## What's the point?\r\n\r\nThe important principle here is that I'm lazy. If there's a single\r\nbutton to click somewhere that expresses my happiness about a thing,\r\nI'd like to click it and have that happiness shared and archived\r\nelsewhere without me doing much (or anything) more.

One of the main culprits that stole my sharing\nflow was <a href=\"http://reader.google.com\">Google Reader</a>: I went from using a quick bookmarklet to an\neven quicker icon-click in my feed reader. That meant I left most\nthings <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/untagged/\">untagged</a>, but I shared even more than before. Eventually,\nGoogle Reader released a bookmarklet for use off-site, which\nmeant I started sharing everything everywhere to Reader.</p>\n<p>I also found a replacement for my old del.icio.us network in Google\nReader&#39;s social features. I could follow people, and the stream of\nthings <em>they</em> shared and annotated turned into a great source of\nnews curated and pre-filtered by likeminded people.</p>\n<p>Well, as it turns out, Google&#39;s <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/new-in-reader-fresh-design-and-google.html\">recent changes</a> to Reader just\nremoved all of the above. In exchange, they added a couple of buttons\nto +1 and share items to Google+, which streamlines things for them\nand encourages more use of the new service.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/114487965928288927815/posts/fgscQet4kxh\">As I wrote</a> on Google+, the net result is nothing to stomp and\nshout about, but there&#39;s nothing there that makes me happier. As I\nplayed more, though, I came to realize that most of the value\nI derived from the service had evaporated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"item-centric-vs-people-centric-efficiency-vs-engagement\">Item-centric vs People-centric, Efficiency vs Engagement</h2>\n<p>There&#39;s a big difference between the way sharing happened on Google\nReader, and the way it happens now on Google+. The best way I can\nthink to explain is that the old way was item-centric and the new way\nis people-centric.  In other words, <em>people</em> seem to be the dominant\n<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/jyri/microblogging-tiny-social-objects-on-the-future-of-participatory-media\">social objects</a> in Google+, whereas Google Reader used to treat\n<em>items</em> that way.</p>\n<p>Before, we all gathered around the news. The headline and summary were\nprimary, and our comments were collected after the item. The result\nwas a de-duped stream of great news filtered through smart brains.\nEven if the people I followed never said a word, the fact that they&#39;d\nclicked &quot;share&quot; was value enough. In fact, it was better that\nway most of the time, because we all got out of the way of each other\nand the news.</p>\n<p>This, by the way, is what I loved about del.icio.us and now\n<a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">pinboard.in</a>: It&#39;s anti-social networking. We can provide\nlow-effort, intelligent inputs to build something useful for each\nother, but we&#39;re not there to assert a presence or distract each other\nfrom the things we each came to see.</p>\n<p>But now, that filtered news stream is gone. In its place, on a\ndifferent site entirely, removed from the flow of feeding on news, is\na highly-engaging flood of people babbling away, which occasionally\nincludes repeated shares of things that have bubbled up during the\nday.</p>\n<p>What&#39;s wrong with that, for me?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I don&#39;t want to wade through a heavily-padded, user-friendly flood\nof duplicated, echoed items.</li>\n<li>I don&#39;t want to engage with the people—at least, not when I&#39;m in a\nmood to feed on news. I want to catch up on what&#39;s been put out\ninto the infosphere already, and <em>then</em> start talking about it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The design of Google+—which has spilled over into the Google Reader\nface-lift—is about engagement and not fast &amp; efficient processing of\nthe day&#39;s news. Engagement in general puts a drag on the task—which\nfor me is like a <a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd\">GTD</a>, <a href=\"http://inboxzero.com/\">Inbox Zero</a>, headline skimming, pattern\nrecognition zen thing that might not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea.</p>\n<p>But, for all I know, avowed weirdo and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/10/11/allgrowedup\">info freako</a> that I am,\nthese changes may drive Google Reader growth through the roof for\nmainstream users.  But, it&#39;s no longer a product for me. The changes\nin sharing have removed most of the value for me, because I no longer\nhave the warp speed cruise through news that other people used to\npower for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"circles-point-the-wrong-way\">Circles point the wrong way</h2>\n<p>One of the things <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/100535338638690515335/posts/95ZsWiCG3xS\">Louis Gray touted about the new sharing\nfeatures</a> reads like so:</p>\n<blockquote>In Reader’s previous sharing model, as a follower of your\nitems, I would see every single item you shared, no matter what it was\nabout. Obviously, as I have different interests than you do, not\neverything you shared was something I cared about, which often led to\nreduced sharing of off-topic content. Now, you are more in control, so\nyou can share sports items to your sports circles, great recipes with\nyour foodies circle, or local news to family and friends. You can keep\nsharing, like you always have, but now, you can better select who sees\nwhat.</blockquote>\n\n<p>But, for this purpose, Circles point the wrong way.</p>\n<p>Circles on Google+ are lists of people controlled by me. They&#39;re not\ntopics—again, people-centric and not item-centric. Circles are a\ntargeting mechanism for sharing to people, and a filtering mechanism\nfor items from people.  That is, I can use a circle to set who sees\nsomething and I can decide who&#39;s stuff I see and when.</p>\n<p>But, things that Circles don&#39;t do include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Letting me follow Circles without the Circle-owner needing to manage\nmembership - eg. Don&#39;t make me send a message saying &quot;I am\ninterested in your ideas and would like to subscribe to your\nnewsletter&quot;. RSS doesn&#39;t work that way and it&#39;s better for it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Letting me and others filter for what gets sent to specific Circles -\neg. I&#39;m in both your &quot;scifi&quot; and &quot;politics&quot; circles, but just show\nme what you sent to your &quot;scifi&quot; circle.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Google Reader didn&#39;t have this to begin with, but what I&#39;m looking for\nis an equivalent to tagging on <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">pinboard.in</a>. For example, if you\nlike my taste in <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/t:scifi\">scifi</a> but could care less about my views in\n<a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/t:politics\">politics</a>, you can subscribe to just the tag feeds you want.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m happy to tag my shares with topics; that&#39;s beneficial to me for\nsearch later, and helps interested people besides. But, the last thing\nI want to do is manage subscriber lists. That doesn&#39;t scale. There&#39;s\nno way for you to even know I have &quot;scifi&quot; or &quot;politics&quot; Circles, and\nyou have no way to join either of them without asking for an add.</p>\n<p>Too much coordination, not enough benefit. I just can&#39;t see the value\nin people-centric Circles here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-things-broke-too\">Other things broke, too.</h2>\n<p>And beyond the fundamental shift in sharing and reading, these things\nhave broken for me now too:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The bookmarklet is dead, so there goes my off-site sharing.</li>\n<li>No sharing at all from the <a href=\"http://google.com/reader/i/\">mobile web version</a>, so there goes at\nleast half of my sharing on-site.</li>\n<li>Android apps like my favorite <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.noinnion.android.greader.readerpro&amp;hl=en\">gReader Pro</a> still think sharing\nworks, but they&#39;re just deluded and use an unsupported API anyway</li>\n<li>No more feed to Facebook, so there goes most of <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/lmorchard\">my Facebook\noutput</a>. (Though, that might be a boon some friends over there.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"now-what\">Now what?</h2>\n<p>The remaining value of Google Reader is as just a plain old hosted\nfeed reader—one of the last of them out there, in fact. The problem\nhere is that I&#39;m a weirdo who wrote <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764597582?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;c%0D%0Areative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0764597582\">a book on feeds and feed readers</a>,\nand so I&#39;m perfectly capable of providing the remaining\nvalue for myself.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m sure most people won&#39;t want to do that, which is probably why\n&quot;<a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/alternatives_to_google_reader.php\">you&#39;re not going anywhere</a>&quot;.

(My first\nwas a thing called <a href=\"http://newsclipper.sourceforge.net/\">News Clipper</a> in Perl from many, many moons\nago.)

I could follow people, and the stream of\r\nthings *they* shared and annotated turned into a great source of\r\nnews curated and pre-filtered by likeminded people.\r\n\r\nWell, as it turns out, Google's [recent changes][] to Reader just\r\nremoved all of the above. In exchange, they added a couple of buttons\r\nto +1 and share items to Google+, which streamlines things for them\r\nand encourages more use of the new service.\r\n\r\n[As I wrote][] on Google+, the net result is nothing to stomp and\r\nshout about, but there's nothing there that makes me happier. As I\r\nplayed more, though, I came to realize that most of the value\r\nI derived from the service had evaporated.\r\n\r\n[as i wrote]: https://plus.google.com/114487965928288927815/posts/fgscQet4kxh\r\n[recent changes]: http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/new-in-reader-fresh-design-and-google.html\r\n[less del.icio.us]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2010/12/18/less-del-icio-us-than-ever-before\r\n[untagged]: http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/untagged/\r\n\r\n## Item-centric vs People-centric, Efficiency vs Engagement\r\n\r\nThere's a big difference between the way sharing happened on Google\r\nReader, and the way it happens now on Google+. The best way I can\r\nthink to explain is that the old way was item-centric and the new way\r\nis people-centric.  In other words, *people* seem to be the dominant\r\n[social objects][] in Google+, whereas Google Reader used to treat\r\n*items* that way.\r\n\r\n[social objects]: http://www.slideshare.net/jyri/microblogging-tiny-social-objects-on-the-future-of-participatory-media\r\n\r\nBefore, we all gathered around the news. The headline and summary were\r\nprimary, and our comments were collected after the item. The result\r\nwas a de-duped stream of great news filtered through smart brains.\r\nEven if the people I followed never said a word, the fact that they'd\r\nclicked \"share\" was value enough. In fact, it was better that\r\nway most of the time, because we all got out of the way of each other\r\nand the news.\r\n\r\nThis, by the way, is what I loved about del.icio.us and now\r\n[pinboard.in][]: It's anti-social networking. We can provide\r\nlow-effort, intelligent inputs to build something useful for each\r\nother, but we're not there to assert a presence or distract each other\r\nfrom the things we each came to see.\r\n\r\n[pinboard.in]: http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\r\n\r\nBut now, that filtered news stream is gone. In its place, on a\r\ndifferent site entirely, removed from the flow of feeding on news, is\r\na highly-engaging flood of people babbling away, which occasionally\r\nincludes repeated shares of things that have bubbled up during the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWhat's wrong with that, for me?\r\n\r\n1. I don't want to wade through a heavily-padded, user-friendly flood\r\n   of duplicated, echoed items.\r\n1. I don't want to engage with the people—at least, not when I'm in a\r\n   mood to feed on news. I want to catch up on what's been put out\r\n   into the infosphere already, and *then* start talking about it.\r\n\r\nThe design of Google+—which has spilled over into the Google Reader\r\nface-lift—is about engagement and not fast & efficient processing of\r\nthe day's news. Engagement in general puts a drag on the task—which\r\nfor me is like a [GTD][], [Inbox Zero][], headline skimming, pattern\r\nrecognition zen thing that might not be everyone's cup of tea.\r\n\r\nBut, for all I know, avowed weirdo and [info freako][] that I am,\r\nthese changes may drive Google Reader growth through the roof for\r\nmainstream users.  But, it's no longer a product for me. The changes\r\nin sharing have removed most of the value for me, because I no longer\r\nhave the warp speed cruise through news that other people used to\r\npower for me.\r\n\r\n[gtd]: http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd\r\n[inbox zero]: http://inboxzero.com/\r\n[info freako]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/10/11/allgrowedup\r\n\r\n## Circles point the wrong way\r\n\r\nOne of the things [Louis Gray touted about the new sharing\r\nfeatures][touted] reads like so:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In Reader’s previous sharing model, as a follower of your\r\nitems, I would see every single item you shared, no matter what it was\r\nabout. Obviously, as I have different interests than you do, not\r\neverything you shared was something I cared about, which often led to\r\nreduced sharing of off-topic content. Now, you are more in control, so\r\nyou can share sports items to your sports circles, great recipes with\r\nyour foodies circle, or local news to family and friends. You can keep\r\nsharing, like you always have, but now, you can better select who sees\r\nwhat.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n[touted]: https://plus.google.com/100535338638690515335/posts/95ZsWiCG3xS\r\n\r\nBut, for this purpose, Circles point the wrong way.\r\n\r\nCircles on Google+ are lists of people controlled by me. They're not\r\ntopics—again, people-centric and not item-centric. Circles are a\r\ntargeting mechanism for sharing to people, and a filtering mechanism\r\nfor items from people.  That is, I can use a circle to set who sees\r\nsomething and I can decide who's stuff I see and when.\r\n\r\nBut, things that Circles don't do include:\r\n\r\n* Letting me follow Circles without the Circle-owner needing to manage\r\n  membership - eg. Don't make me send a message saying \"I am\r\n  interested in your ideas and would like to subscribe to your\r\n  newsletter\". RSS doesn't work that way and it's better for it.\r\n\r\n* Letting me and others filter for what gets sent to specific Circles -\r\n  eg. I'm in both your \"scifi\" and \"politics\" circles, but just show\r\n  me what you sent to your \"scifi\" circle.\r\n\r\nGoogle Reader didn't have this to begin with, but what I'm looking for\r\nis an equivalent to tagging on [pinboard.in][]. For example, if you\r\nlike my taste in [scifi][] but could care less about my views in\r\n[politics][], you can subscribe to just the tag feeds you want.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to tag my shares with topics; that's beneficial to me for\r\nsearch later, and helps interested people besides. But, the last thing\r\nI want to do is manage subscriber lists. That doesn't scale. There's\r\nno way for you to even know I have \"scifi\" or \"politics\" Circles, and\r\nyou have no way to join either of them without asking for an add.\r\n\r\nToo much coordination, not enough benefit. I just can't see the value\r\nin people-centric Circles here.\r\n\r\n[scifi]: http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/t:scifi\r\n[politics]: http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/t:politics\r\n\r\n## Other things broke, too.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond the fundamental shift in sharing and reading, these things\r\nhave broken for me now too:\r\n\r\n* The bookmarklet is dead, so there goes my off-site sharing.\r\n* No sharing at all from the [mobile web version][], so there goes at\r\n  least half of my sharing on-site.\r\n* Android apps like my favorite [gReader Pro][] still think sharing\r\n  works, but they're just deluded and use an unsupported API anyway\r\n* No more feed to Facebook, so there goes most of [my Facebook\r\n  output][]. (Though, that might be a boon some friends over there.)\r\n\r\n[greader pro]: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.noinnion.android.greader.readerpro&hl=en\r\n[my facebook output]: http://www.facebook.com/lmorchard\r\n\r\n## Now what?\r\n\r\nThe remaining value of Google Reader is as just a plain old hosted\r\nfeed reader—one of the last of them out there, in fact. The problem\r\nhere is that I'm a weirdo who wrote [a book on feeds and feed readers][],\r\nand so I'm perfectly capable of providing the remaining\r\nvalue for myself.\r\n\r\nI'm sure most people won't want to do that, which is probably why\r\n\"[you're not going anywhere][]\". But, there are alternatives even for\r\npeople who don't want to D.I.Y. entirely:\r\n\r\n* Dave Winer's [River2][] (also open source, in UserTalk on the [OPML\r\n  Editor][]) runs on my laptop and lets me circle back to the code\r\n  that ran my second-ever news reader, [Radio UserLand][].  (My first\r\n  was a thing called [News Clipper][] in Perl from many, many moons\r\n  ago.) And, of course, [River2][] is one of a suite of apps Dave's\r\n  working on to build a decentrallized network of feeds and outlines.\r\n\r\n* [NewsBlur][] looks mighty fine, and [the guy running it][] only asks\r\n  US$12-36 (your choice) for a year's worth of premium access.\r\n  Remember: if you're not the customer, you're the product. And, if\r\n  you want to try installing it, it's an [open source Django\r\n  site][newsblur-github]. While not yet very social, [NewsBlur][]'s\r\n  creator [has plans][] to head in that direction.\r\n\r\n* [Tiny Tiny RSS][] installed on my Wordpress-capable web server in\r\n  about 10 minutes, gobbled up my list of 800 feeds with no problem,\r\n  and appears to have 90% of what I wanted from Google Reader. Also,\r\n  it's [an open source PHP site][ttrss-github]. For sharing, [Tiny\r\n  Tiny RSS][] lets you \"publish\" shared items in an RSS feed—kind of\r\n  like the old [reBlog][] web app—and has some experimental\r\n  cross-instance sharing features.\r\n\r\nAt the end, the funny thing is that I've circled back to my old\r\ndel.icio.us habits and have started tagging items on [pinboard.in][]\r\nlike never before. I'm sure there aren't nearly as many people\r\nwatching me as before on either del.icio.us or Google Reader, but it's\r\na place to go at least.\r\n\r\nIt'll probably be recognized as an illness\r\nsomeday, but my sharing feels compulsive at this point and I get itchy\r\nwithout a good outlet.\r\n\r\n[the guy running it]: http://www.samuelclay.com/ \"Samuel Clay, that is\"\r\n[reblog]: http://reblog.org/\r\n[has plans]: http://blog.newsblur.com/post/11956240785/a-social-feed-reader\r\n[opml editor]: http://home.opml.org/\r\n[newsblur]: http://newsblur.com\r\n[newsblur-github]: https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur\r\n[ttrss-github]: https://github.com/gothfox/Tiny-Tiny-RSS\r\n[you're not going anywhere]: http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/alternatives_to_google_reader.php\r\n[a book on feeds and feed readers]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764597582?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&c%0D%0Areative=9325&creativeASIN=0764597582\r\n[radio userland]: http://radio.userland.com/\r\n[news clipper]: http://newsclipper.sourceforge.net/\r\n[river2]: http://river2.newsriver.org/\r\n[tiny tiny rss]: http://tt-rss.org/\r\n[mobile web version]: http://google.com/reader/i/\r\n[the nothing]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrG-lsrXKRM\r\n[no turkey]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cFHAJ5asMk\r\n[not going anywhere]: http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/alternatives_to_google_reader.php\r\n[rant]: http://brianshih.com/78073742\r\n\r\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=70: -->\r\n",

    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>My blog is now produced by <a href=\"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a>, with comments hosted by <a href=\"http://disqus.com/\">Disqus</a>.</em></p>\n<p>This blog has transitioned between a handful of publishing platforms -\nincluding Movable Type, blosxom, and Wordpress. Well, apparently, it&#39;s that\ntime again.  I&#39;ve been toying with making a change again for a few years,\nand finally just got all the pieces together over the past week. This blog\nis now just a pile of static files produced by <a href=\"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a>, and the comments\nare now hosted by <a href=\"http://disqus.com/\">Disqus</a>.</p>\n<p>This has a lot of interesting implications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I can neglect my server for long periods of time without worrying that my\nlong-outdated copy of Wordpress has been exploited. Really, there&#39;s no\nreason for me to have a full-featured CMS running here.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I could host my entire blog on Amazon S3 or something similar, and be\nmore neglectful by reducing active code even further. The only crappy\nthing is that I don&#39;t think I can send <code>decafbad.com</code> directly to S3, and\nwould need to redirect to a CNAME on a subdomain on <code>blog.decafbad.com</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I can edit my blog directly on GitHub and, assuming I get the webhooks\nset up, have my server rebuild the HTML automatically on a <code>git push</code>. I\ncould probably use <a href=\"http://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> and the Jekyll support there,\nbut I suspect I&#39;ll be doing some Weird Things that they won&#39;t handle.\n(And probably for good reason.) </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Since Disqus has all my comments now, I can stop worrying about running\nthat code on my server too. I&#39;m a little antsy about putting that in the\ncloud, but the escape routes are well lit and I should be able to replace\nit easily if I need to. Self-hosted, JS-include-based comments is a\nproject in my TODO list.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>My writing here is now all stored in individual text files, formatted with\nMarkdown, annotated with YAML metadata, and subject to revision control\nunder git. This combination feels like it has a lot of longevity and\npotential for survival even beyond this current experiment with <a href=\"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Writing, editing, and publishing entries here can now more closely match\nmy daily reality of living in MacVim and git. It sounds lame, but the\nnotion of swapping over to a Wordpress admin page and working in a\nbrowser textarea has often kept me from even starting a post.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But, some things are broken, now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.decafbad.com/commit/a79678828ab612c2edb8a8ac3f796199cb922a2e\">Fixed</a> <strike>No more tag pages. I don&#39;t think very many humans visit these pages, but\na lot of search engines do.</strike></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.decafbad.com/commit/a79678828ab612c2edb8a8ac3f796199cb922a2e\">Fixed</a> <strike>No more tag feeds. I expect to hear about this soon, since this blog gets\nsyndicated to Planet Mozilla via my &quot;mozilla&quot; tag feed.</strike></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>No more year / month archive pages or sidebar widget. Not sure how many\npeople actually stroll down memory lane here on my blog, but I do have a\n<a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/archives\">gigantor huge list of all my posts evar</a>, now.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A general lack of contextual links to related posts and such. Turns out\nthat running the LSI option on Jekyll is completely horrible.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Regeneration seems less-than-happy in general, and I wish it did\nconditional regneration. That is, only produce the HTML for things that\nneed it because dependencies have changed. No need to rebake the whole\nworld just because I changed one file.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bright side is that there are solutions to all the broken things, and\nnow I have something to tinker with again on my blog.  So, let me know if\nanything else looks broken, and hopefully this will get me spewing some\nmore words out onto this thing soon.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221397880\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.com/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/lmorchard.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.com/\">Les Orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221397880\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-08T17:45:54\">2011-06-08T17:45:54</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Testing a comment here on my new post.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221404263\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/bkclements.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">bkclements</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221404263\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-08T17:59:01\">2011-06-08T17:59:01</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Hi, did you happen to look at blogofile for similar functionality?\nI'm still trying to decide which way to  go.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>My blog is now produced by [Jekyll][], with comments hosted by [Disqus][].</em>\n\n[jekyll]: https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\n[disqus]: http://disqus.com/\n\nThis blog has transitioned between a handful of publishing platforms -\nincluding Movable Type, blosxom, and Wordpress. Well, apparently, it's that\ntime again.  I've been toying with making a change again for a few years,\nand finally just got all the pieces together over the past week. This blog\nis now just a pile of static files produced by [Jekyll][], and the comments\nare now hosted by [Disqus][].\n\n[pages]: http://pages.github.com/\n\nThis has a lot of interesting implications:\n\n* I can neglect my server for long periods of time without worrying that my\n  long-outdated copy of Wordpress has been exploited. Really, there's no\n  reason for me to have a full-featured CMS running here.\n\n* I could host my entire blog on Amazon S3 or something similar, and be\n  more neglectful by reducing active code even further. The only crappy\n  thing is that I don't think I can send `decafbad.com` directly to S3, and\n  would need to redirect to a CNAME on a subdomain on `blog.decafbad.com`.\n\n* I can edit my blog directly on GitHub and, assuming I get the webhooks\n  set up, have my server rebuild the HTML automatically on a `git push`. I\n  could probably use [GitHub Pages][pages] and the Jekyll support there,\n  but I suspect I'll be doing some Weird Things that they won't handle.\n  (And probably for good reason.) \n\n* Since Disqus has all my comments now, I can stop worrying about running\n  that code on my server too. I'm a little antsy about putting that in the\n  cloud, but the escape routes are well lit and I should be able to replace\n  it easily if I need to. Self-hosted, JS-include-based comments is a\n  project in my TODO list.\n\n* My writing here is now all stored in individual text files, formatted with\n  Markdown, annotated with YAML metadata, and subject to revision control\n  under git. This combination feels like it has a lot of longevity and\n  potential for survival even beyond this current experiment with [Jekyll][]\n\n* Writing, editing, and publishing entries here can now more closely match\n  my daily reality of living in MacVim and git. It sounds lame, but the\n  notion of swapping over to a Wordpress admin page and working in a\n  browser textarea has often kept me from even starting a post.\n\nBut, some things are broken, now:\n\n* [Fixed][tags] <strike>No more tag pages. I don't think very many humans visit these pages, but\n  a lot of search engines do.</strike>\n\n* [Fixed][tags] <strike>No more tag feeds. I expect to hear about this soon, since this blog gets\n  syndicated to Planet Mozilla via my \"mozilla\" tag feed.</strike>\n\n* No more year / month archive pages or sidebar widget. Not sure how many\n  people actually stroll down memory lane here on my blog, but I do have a\n  [gigantor huge list of all my posts evar][archives], now.\n\n* A general lack of contextual links to related posts and such. Turns out\n  that running the LSI option on Jekyll is completely horrible.\n\n* Regeneration seems less-than-happy in general, and I wish it did\n  conditional regneration. That is, only produce the HTML for things that\n  need it because dependencies have changed. No need to rebake the whole\n  world just because I changed one file.\n\n[tags]: https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.decafbad.com/commit/a79678828ab612c2edb8a8ac3f796199cb922a2e\n\nThe bright side is that there are solutions to all the broken things, and\nnow I have something to tinker with again on my blog.  So, let me know if\nanything else looks broken, and hopefully this will get me spewing some\nmore words out onto this thing soon.\n\n[archives]: http://decafbad.com/blog/archives\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221397880\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/lmorchard.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com/\">Les Orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221397880\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-08T17:45:54\">2011-06-08T17:45:54</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Testing a comment here on my new post.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221404263\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/bkclements.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">bkclements</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221404263\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-08T17:59:01\">2011-06-08T17:59:01</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Hi, did you happen to look at blogofile for similar functionality?\n\nI'm still trying to decide which way to  go.

    "html": "<p>It&#39;s plain to see that I&#39;ve not been a blogger for a long time.</p>\n<p>This place is a long-neglected ghost town that sees a begrudged entry every few months, when I happen to remember it still exists and I feel guilty for not feeding it with content. What I&#39;ve yet to figure out is if the cause is a matter of motivation, publishing tools, audience, or writing topics.</p>\n<p>Behold as I ramble on for many tens of words pondering the cobwebs here at 0xDECAFBAD.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"motivation\">Motivation</h2>\n<p>Other outlets have absorbed nearly all of my motivations that once prompted casual blogging. And those other outlets, in most cases, provide better rewards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For quick top-of-the-head thoughts and quips, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard\">Twitter</a> works best for the brain-spew and gets me feedback from interesting people faster than my spam-embattled comments here ever did.</li>\n<li>For sharing things I find on the web, <a href=\"http://delicious.com/deusx\">Delicious</a> took that job over years ago and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/shared/l.m.orchard\">Google Reader</a> has been angling for the job as well.</li>\n<li>For sharing code and projects, I&#39;ve started doing more and more over at <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/\">my GitHub account</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Quite awhile ago, I even went so far as to redirect the front page of my decafbad.com domain straight to a page that&#39;s nothing more than  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/lifestream\">a shell for a FriendFeed widget that aggregates my output from elsewhere</a>. It&#39;s kind of a cop-out, but if you want to see what I&#39;m really up to, that&#39;s a much better page than my stagnant blog index anyway.  I&#39;ve got a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/ffa/lmorchard\">local archive of my activity</a>, and have been meaning to make a self-hosted lifestream more front-and-center, but I&#39;ve been too busy to bother.</p>\n<h2 id=\"publishing-tools\">Publishing tools</h2>\n<p>In fact, I&#39;ve been thinking about killing my WordPress installation here altogether, and switching the blog over to a static fossil snapshot.  Since I rarely post, there&#39;s rarely a comment inbound here these days that&#39;s not trying to slip through an ad for pills or fake handbags. Thus, most of the CPU cycles on my web host are spent on busy work processing requests that will never amount to anything real. So, why bother having an actual PHP application running here?</p>\n<p>The one thing that I haven&#39;t done a lot of lately—and would like to carve out time to get back to—is some real long-form writing. You would think that that&#39;s where this WordPress thing would come in handy, but oddly it seems not to. I hate writing in textareas in browsers, haven&#39;t found a desktop blog client that I liked in years.</p>\n<p>So, because of the little things that annoy me, I stop writing before I start because the anticipated process to publish seems like a chore. I&#39;d much rather be writing in MacVim and checking text files into a git repository. Then, I could throw <a href=\"http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a> or something yak-shavingly homebrewed on top of post-receive hooks to do indexing magic and such in static HTML. You know, the stuff that took forever in MovableType back in the day, but decoupled from my actual writing process. </p>\n<p>Huh, now that I describe it, the above sounds like a chore too—but it would be a shiny new toy!  At that point, I wouldn&#39;t be blogging so much as publishing an archive of essays on the web.  But, at least I&#39;d know the format would be future-proof, the platform exploit-resistant, and the overall maintenance less worrisome.  If I had comments, I could even outsource them to another service and run periodic backups to be safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"audience\">Audience</h2>\n<p>But, beyond the mechanisms, there&#39;s who I imagine might be reading this stuff. I hold off on writing a lot of things that could be posted here because they&#39;re maybe not tech-nerdy enough. If it doesn&#39;t have at least one code example, I hesitate to share it here—and if I don&#39;t share it here, I probably don&#39;t share it anywhere.</p>\n<p>And then there&#39;s the thought that whatever I write here, no one will read it if it&#39;s too long.  This entry is mostly written to myself, and I expect a single-digit comment count—most likely zero.  I get the most feedback on the shortest things, which has ultimately lead to Twitter and its 140 character limit yielding some of my most rewarding interactions on the web in years. I post an essay here, and it&#39;s all crickets.</p>\n<p>The exceptions are where I post something really useful, like that article about <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2009/07/15/html5-drag-and-drop\">HTML 5 Drag &amp; Drop</a> or a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/09/01/writing-a-delicious-command-for-ubiquity\">Delicious command for Ubiquity</a>.  That is, of course, a clue if comments and feedback are what I&#39;m after.</p>\n<h2 id=\"writing-topics\">Writing topics</h2>\n<p>So, what could I be writing about these days? Let&#39;s see, I could write about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what I&#39;ve been up to at Mozilla since I started;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/homebrewing/\">brewing beer</a> and roasting coffee at home;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/4389264445/\">retro computing on my C64 and Amiga</a>;</li>\n<li>developing for Palm webOS;</li>\n<li>random thoughts on life;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Huh. That all sounds like a blog, and one I would read myself—though that last one sounds like <a href=\"http://deus-x.livejournal.com/\">my LiveJournal</a>, long neglected since I started dating my wife and got much less emo in general. We probably don&#39;t need to go there so much, but I could probably bore with more even-tempered philosophical expositions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-the-problem\">What&#39;s the problem?</h2>\n<p>I wonder what my real problem is, then? Is it really just a matter of <a href=\"http://www.dawsbrothers.com/2010/03/09/butt-in-the-seat-a-writers-technique/\">butt in the seat</a> that I&#39;m missing?  I write every day—in a paper journal, in wiki pages, in emails, to myself—I just don&#39;t write much here. Maybe all the above is just a collection of excuses.</p>\n<p>Lately, I&#39;ve had this notion that I should try writing and publishing for an earlier version of myself. That is: all these things I end up searching for and researching on the web, I should write them up in a way that I wish had been the first search result in Google. Whatever the topic, if a younger version of me wanted to find it, I should put it out there to be found. Never mind who else I think might read it or (not) comment on it.</p>\n<p>Write for myself, write what I&#39;d want to read—sounds pretty obvious when I put it out there like that. So, is that the deal? Who knows; we&#39;ll see if a change in perspective results in more happenings here.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090129\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ciarang.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=18910207650685d4592d9a6a71528180&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ciarang.com/\">CiaranG</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090129\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:04:04\">2010-03-10T19:04:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I write about stuff (including beer brewing, Amigas and less archaic techy stuff) mostly for the pleasure of my current self, and the amusement of my future self.</p>\n<p>I never considered writing for an earlier version of myself, but then I know for a fact he didn't have a time machine.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090132\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5441ca4708065da7e0467e1470c49653&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\">Carter Rabasa</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090132\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:19:19\">2010-03-10T19:19:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I long ago gave up on the idea of regular blogging.

I don't know how I ended up here, but it looks like last month was the seventh anniversary of my first comment:</p>\n<p>http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/02/20/ooodae</p>\n<p>\"Newly Digital in 1983\" is still one of my favorite stories ever.  You also got me interested in ifiction and flash fiction. (I ended up publishing a few stories on 365tomorrows and Ficlets.)  And this month I'm joining the Mozilla Corporation, partly because I want to work with you and other hackers whose work has influenced me over the years.  Your audience may be small, but we're devoted!  :)</p>\n<p>I moved my own technical blogging to Jekyll recently.  There's a bit less guilt about slow update schedules when I think of it more like a static collection of articles than an online journal.  (And yeah, using a real editor and version control makes it much easier to get longer pieces done.)  I use Planet Venus for my personally-hosted lifestream, though these days most of my friends get my aggregated data via Facebook or Buzz.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090136\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/danmactough.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">danmactough</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090136\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:27:53\">2010-03-10T19:27:53</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I've never used my blog as much as you've used yours -- I've never really been a blogger at all, honestly.</p>\n<p>I like posting code snippets. Maybe I'll check out github at some point, but I've got a 2-year-old now. He's way more fun and interesting than Python or whatever. (I guess that could be interpreted as implying that my wife is NOT more fun and interesting than those things. Rather than explain why that is not the case, I'll just say that we've been together forever, and I love her very much.)</p>\n<p>At any rate, I thought your post merited at least one comment pondering why the commenter does not blog (anymore).</p>\n<p>For my part, it has a lot to do with privacy, I think. I knew before I ever installed blosxom that I didn't want to be a \"blogger.\" I had no interest in sharing my deep thoughts about life, politics, or anything else. I enjoy talking with people; it's not an antisocial thing. It's just that I don't know what long-term ramifications there may be to such free expression. Likewise, you won't see pictures of me and my family generally available on Flickr or Picasa (there may be a handful). Facebook is nothing to me except somewhere to echo my Twitter stream, such as it is (and I've stopped doing that). Brightkite -- forget it! My last.fm profile is about as intimate as I get online.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking about shutting down my WP installation. I really don't use it. The only thing I really use my VPS for is my web-based feed reader.</p>\n<p>All of these blogging, microblogging, and social networking services -- especially the social networking services -- are really interesting to me, though. I will keep hanging around the periphery of them, dipping in a toe here and there.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090137\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://wambatech.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3ba9f5af09024586154461580b546479&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://wambatech.com\">bud</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:44:56\">2010-03-10T19:44:56</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Les I've followed this for a while.

I don't mean explaining simple HTML \"Hello World\", but why not summaries or highlights of languages you know? </p>\n<p>You could point out differences between the languages, maybe reasons certain applications are written in one instead of another?

I always wondered if it got many reads, but it was one of my own favorites to write since it was the sort of thing I liked to see on others' blogs.</p>\n<p>Oh, and welcome to Mozilla! I'm back out to Mountain View pretty regularly, so we'll have to hang out sometime.  Might have to pick your brain about Jekyll and how you like mobile hacking.</p>\n<p>@Dan: I'm a bit weird, since most of my friends since the age of 8 have been behind computers, modems, or the internet. And now, my job is almost entirely on the net since I'm telecommuting from my basement 3000 miles away from HQ. So, it's pretty natural for me to live online.</p><p>Still, I have gotten more and more private. My LiveJournal has some entries that I'd never write now, and I'll probably never post religious / political stuff here because it's not worth the debate or potential life / career damage.</p>\n<p>So... yeah, I'll probably never again be a blogger, per se.

    "body": "It's plain to see that I've not been a blogger for a long time.\r\n\r\nThis place is a long-neglected ghost town that sees a begrudged entry every few months, when I happen to remember it still exists and I feel guilty for not feeding it with content. What I've yet to figure out is if the cause is a matter of motivation, publishing tools, audience, or writing topics.\r\n\r\nBehold as I ramble on for many tens of words pondering the cobwebs here at 0xDECAFBAD.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nOther outlets have absorbed nearly all of my motivations that once prompted casual blogging. And those other outlets, in most cases, provide better rewards:\r\n\r\n* For quick top-of-the-head thoughts and quips, [Twitter](http://twitter.com/lmorchard) works best for the brain-spew and gets me feedback from interesting people faster than my spam-embattled comments here ever did.\r\n* For sharing things I find on the web, [Delicious](http://delicious.com/deusx) took that job over years ago and [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/l.m.orchard) has been angling for the job as well.\r\n* For sharing code and projects, I've started doing more and more over at [my GitHub account](http://github.com/lmorchard/).\r\n\r\nQuite awhile ago, I even went so far as to redirect the front page of my decafbad.com domain straight to a page that's nothing more than  [a shell for a FriendFeed widget that aggregates my output from elsewhere](http://decafbad.com/blog/lifestream). It's kind of a cop-out, but if you want to see what I'm really up to, that's a much better page than my stagnant blog index anyway.  I've got a [local archive of my activity](http://decafbad.com/ffa/lmorchard), and have been meaning to make a self-hosted lifestream more front-and-center, but I've been too busy to bother.\r\n\r\n## Publishing tools\r\n\r\nIn fact, I've been thinking about killing my WordPress installation here altogether, and switching the blog over to a static fossil snapshot.  Since I rarely post, there's rarely a comment inbound here these days that's not trying to slip through an ad for pills or fake handbags. Thus, most of the CPU cycles on my web host are spent on busy work processing requests that will never amount to anything real. So, why bother having an actual PHP application running here?\r\n\r\nThe one thing that I haven't done a lot of lately—and would like to carve out time to get back to—is some real long-form writing. You would think that that's where this WordPress thing would come in handy, but oddly it seems not to. I hate writing in textareas in browsers, haven't found a desktop blog client that I liked in years.\r\n\r\nSo, because of the little things that annoy me, I stop writing before I start because the anticipated process to publish seems like a chore. I'd much rather be writing in MacVim and checking text files into a git repository. Then, I could throw [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) or something yak-shavingly homebrewed on top of post-receive hooks to do indexing magic and such in static HTML. You know, the stuff that took forever in MovableType back in the day, but decoupled from my actual writing process. \r\n\r\nHuh, now that I describe it, the above sounds like a chore too—but it would be a shiny new toy!  At that point, I wouldn't be blogging so much as publishing an archive of essays on the web.  But, at least I'd know the format would be future-proof, the platform exploit-resistant, and the overall maintenance less worrisome.  If I had comments, I could even outsource them to another service and run periodic backups to be safe.\r\n\r\n## Audience\r\n\r\nBut, beyond the mechanisms, there's who I imagine might be reading this stuff. I hold off on writing a lot of things that could be posted here because they're maybe not tech-nerdy enough. If it doesn't have at least one code example, I hesitate to share it here—and if I don't share it here, I probably don't share it anywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the thought that whatever I write here, no one will read it if it's too long.  This entry is mostly written to myself, and I expect a single-digit comment count—most likely zero.  I get the most feedback on the shortest things, which has ultimately lead to Twitter and its 140 character limit yielding some of my most rewarding interactions on the web in years. I post an essay here, and it's all crickets.\r\n\r\nThe exceptions are where I post something really useful, like that article about [HTML 5 Drag & Drop](http://decafbad.com/blog/2009/07/15/html5-drag-and-drop) or a [Delicious command for Ubiquity](http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/09/01/writing-a-delicious-command-for-ubiquity).  That is, of course, a clue if comments and feedback are what I'm after.\r\n\r\n## Writing topics\r\n\r\nSo, what could I be writing about these days? Let's see, I could write about:\r\n\r\n* what I've been up to at Mozilla since I started;\r\n* [brewing beer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/homebrewing/) and roasting coffee at home;\r\n* [retro computing on my C64 and Amiga](http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/4389264445/);\r\n* developing for Palm webOS;\r\n* random thoughts on life;\r\n\r\nHuh. That all sounds like a blog, and one I would read myself—though that last one sounds like [my LiveJournal](http://deus-x.livejournal.com/), long neglected since I started dating my wife and got much less emo in general. We probably don't need to go there so much, but I could probably bore with more even-tempered philosophical expositions.\r\n\r\n## What's the problem?\r\n\r\nI wonder what my real problem is, then? Is it really just a matter of [butt in the seat](http://www.dawsbrothers.com/2010/03/09/butt-in-the-seat-a-writers-technique/) that I'm missing?  I write every day—in a paper journal, in wiki pages, in emails, to myself—I just don't write much here. Maybe all the above is just a collection of excuses.\r\n\r\nLately, I've had this notion that I should try writing and publishing for an earlier version of myself. That is: all these things I end up searching for and researching on the web, I should write them up in a way that I wish had been the first search result in Google. Whatever the topic, if a younger version of me wanted to find it, I should put it out there to be found. Never mind who else I think might read it or (not) comment on it.\r\n\r\nWrite for myself, write what I'd want to read—sounds pretty obvious when I put it out there like that. So, is that the deal? Who knows; we'll see if a change in perspective results in more happenings here.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090129\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ciarang.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=18910207650685d4592d9a6a71528180&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ciarang.com/\">CiaranG</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090129\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:04:04\">2010-03-10T19:04:04</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I write about stuff (including beer brewing, Amigas and less archaic techy stuff) mostly for the pleasure of my current self, and the amusement of my future self.</p>\n\n<p>I never considered writing for an earlier version of myself, but then I know for a fact he didn't have a time machine.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090132\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5441ca4708065da7e0467e1470c49653&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\">Carter Rabasa</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090132\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:19:19\">2010-03-10T19:19:19</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I long ago gave up on the idea of regular blogging.

(And yeah, using a real editor and version control makes it much easier to get longer pieces done.)  I use Planet Venus for my personally-hosted lifestream, though these days most of my friends get my aggregated data via Facebook or Buzz.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090136\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/danmactough.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">danmactough</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090136\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:27:53\">2010-03-10T19:27:53</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I've never used my blog as much as you've used yours -- I've never really been a blogger at all, honestly.</p>\n\n<p>I like posting code snippets. Maybe I'll check out github at some point, but I've got a 2-year-old now. He's way more fun and interesting than Python or whatever. (I guess that could be interpreted as implying that my wife is NOT more fun and interesting than those things. Rather than explain why that is not the case, I'll just say that we've been together forever, and I love her very much.)</p>\n\n<p>At any rate, I thought your post merited at least one comment pondering why the commenter does not blog (anymore).</p>\n\n<p>For my part, it has a lot to do with privacy, I think. I knew before I ever installed blosxom that I didn't want to be a \"blogger.\" I had no interest in sharing my deep thoughts about life, politics, or anything else. I enjoy talking with people; it's not an antisocial thing. It's just that I don't know what long-term ramifications there may be to such free expression. Likewise, you won't see pictures of me and my family generally available on Flickr or Picasa (there may be a handful). Facebook is nothing to me except somewhere to echo my Twitter stream, such as it is (and I've stopped doing that). Brightkite -- forget it! My last.fm profile is about as intimate as I get online.</p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking about shutting down my WP installation. I really don't use it. The only thing I really use my VPS for is my web-based feed reader.</p>\n\n<p>All of these blogging, microblogging, and social networking services -- especially the social networking services -- are really interesting to me, though. I will keep hanging around the periphery of them, dipping in a toe here and there.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090137\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://wambatech.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3ba9f5af09024586154461580b546479&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://wambatech.com\">bud</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:44:56\">2010-03-10T19:44:56</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Les I've followed this for a while.

The past self thing is really thinking that someone like me might come along and appreciate what I tossed onto the web.  Beyond that, I like writing and can't think of better any better topics than writing about the other stuff I like doing.</p>\n\n<p>@Carter: I think my main source of lament here is that I'm a writer who never seems to write on his own site. I feel like I should be publishing more about the stuff I do. But, yeah, this place isn't really the center of my online universe anymore.</p>\n\n<p>@Matt: Huh, you know, that <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital\" rel=\"nofollow\">Newly Digital in 1983</a> post was one of my quieter ones in terms of feedback. I always wondered if it got many reads, but it was one of my own favorites to write since it was the sort of thing I liked to see on others' blogs.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and welcome to Mozilla! I'm back out to Mountain View pretty regularly, so we'll have to hang out sometime.  Might have to pick your brain about Jekyll and how you like mobile hacking.</p>\n\n<p>@Dan: I'm a bit weird, since most of my friends since the age of 8 have been behind computers, modems, or the internet. And now, my job is almost entirely on the net since I'm telecommuting from my basement 3000 miles away from HQ. So, it's pretty natural for me to live online.</p><p>Still, I have gotten more and more private. My LiveJournal has some entries that I'd never write now, and I'll probably never post religious / political stuff here because it's not worth the debate or potential life / career damage.</p>\n\n<p>So... yeah, I'll probably never again be a blogger, per se. I don't feel like having a diary online so much as a place where I publish interesting things.</p>\n\n<p>I think really my thing here is I call myself a writer, so I should probably be doing more of it. :)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090139\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/danmactough.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">danmactough</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090139\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T20:17:10\">2010-03-10T20:17:10</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Regarding publishing interesting things -- I'm totally with you there.

    "html": "<p>I&#39;m no longer at Yahoo! and I no longer work on <a href=\"http://delicious.com\">Delicious</a>, but I&#39;m still a huge supporter.  And, since I&#39;m pretty sure everyone over there is either burnt out or still insanely busy at the moment, it might be awhile before anyone tells the full story of what this relaunch offers.  As it is, even I only know a bit of what all went into this effort.</p>\n<p>So, off the top of my head, I thought I might point out <strong>just a few</strong> of the easily-missed improvements the new site offers beyond the great new love-it-or-hate-it visual redesign that seems to have occupied most of the discussion I&#39;ve seen so far:</p>\n<p><strong>Search works and is incredibly fast.</strong>  In fact, search may really be the real star of the redesign show here—especially since del.icio.us often took 30 seconds or more for a simple search, rendering it all but useless.  Today, though, it&#39;s at ludicrous speed in comparison—and so finally, the real power of search applied to social bookmarking might start to shine with the critical mass of content found by real people using Delicious.</p>\n<p>To scratch my own itch, I&#39;ve created <a href=\"http://mycroft.mozdev.org/developer/devlist.html?email=l.m.orchard%40pobox.com\">an unofficial OpenSearch search engine plugin for Delicious</a> on Mycroft.  Though I think it comes along with <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/tools\">the browser extensions</a>, I&#39;ve yet to find this for <a href=\"http://mycroft.mozdev.org/developer/hosting.html\">autodiscovery</a> from the site itself.</p>\n<p><strong>The notes field in bookmarks has been expanded from 255 to 1000 characters.</strong>  Yes, this means that you can now include long running quotes from pages, or complete paragraphs of rambling discourse. </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/feeds\">The feeds have all been overhauled and reorganized</a>.</strong>  An attempt at backward compatibility was made, but the old feed URLs are all deprecated.  Replacing these, there&#39;s now <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/feeds\">a common and consistent URL namespace for feeds across formats</a>.  </p>\n<p>Almost all RSS feeds have <a href=\"http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/\">JSONP</a> counterparts, and further feed formats could be considered.  Additionally, the old mix of RSS 1.0 and 2.0 has been dropped in favor of RSS 2.0 format across the board to support podcast and media enclosure elements consistently.  The <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/tools\">linkrolls, tagrolls, network badges, and tagometers</a> now all use the new JSONP feeds—and the widgets can be examined as example code in using the feeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Tag bundles can now be viewed as combined bookmark views, complete with feeds.</strong>  This augments bundles from a simple visual organization tool to a more powerful content aggregation function.  Personally, I never had much use for tag bundles until now, but since they can actually be used to partition tags and bookmarks I might actually take the time to use them.  Check out these example URLs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://delicious.com/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign\">http://delicious.com/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign\">http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bundles now work for tags, network contacts, and subscriptions.</strong>  This means, for example, that you can partition your network contacts into topical groups.  From there, you can subscribe to those partitioned bookmarks in different folders in readers, or use the bundled bookmark views in mashups through JSON feeds.  Check out these example URLs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://delicious.com/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard\">http://delicious.com/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard\">http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Network member and fan feeds now include the date when the contact was added.</strong>  Pro tip: Subscribe to fan feeds to see when new people have started following your bookmarks.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/api\">Several previously undocumented parts of the V1 API have now been documented</a>.</strong>  In particular, the following new parameter combinations have been used with the browser extensions for primitive bookmark sync:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?hashes\">https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?hashes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?meta=yes\">https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?meta=yes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?fromdt=%7BDT%7D&amp;todt=%7BDT%7D\">https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?fromdt={DT}&amp;todt={DT}</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?start=%7B##%7D&amp;results=%7B##%7D\">https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?start={##}&amp;results={##}</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The posts/all API URL works again for users with large collections.</strong>  With my 11k+ bookmarks, del.icio.us was keeling over with the attempt to assemble and deliver my entire collection with a posts/all call.  Now, however, Delicious 2.0 appears able to handle this call for my account.</p>\n<p><strong>Easter eggs have been rotated and recalibrated.</strong> No, I&#39;m not going to tell you what or where or how many they are.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085469\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085469\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-05T02:31:52\">2008-08-05T02:31:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n<p>Since I’m pretty sure everyone over there is either burnt out or still insanely busy at the moment, it might be awhile before anyone tells the full story of what this relaunch offers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Admit it, Les, you just got impatient after building a bunch of shiny toys that no one at Yahoo! seemed to be coming forth to tell the world about them. :) (I would be miffed too.)</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085470\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.yining.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cd8af1a8b7c1cfdca49fb19d4a98a7bc&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.yining.org\">Yining</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085470\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-05T06:51:44\">2008-08-05T06:51:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>one thing in the new version that disappoints me is the tab-to-complete feature is gone.

    "body": "I'm no longer at Yahoo! and I no longer work on [Delicious](http://delicious.com), but I'm still a huge supporter.  And, since I'm pretty sure everyone over there is either burnt out or still insanely busy at the moment, it might be awhile before anyone tells the full story of what this relaunch offers.  As it is, even I only know a bit of what all went into this effort.\r\n\r\nSo, off the top of my head, I thought I might point out **just a few** of the easily-missed improvements the new site offers beyond the great new love-it-or-hate-it visual redesign that seems to have occupied most of the discussion I've seen so far:\r\n\r\n**Search works and is incredibly fast.**  In fact, search may really be the real star of the redesign show here—especially since del.icio.us often took 30 seconds or more for a simple search, rendering it all but useless.  Today, though, it's at ludicrous speed in comparison—and so finally, the real power of search applied to social bookmarking might start to shine with the critical mass of content found by real people using Delicious.\r\n\r\nTo scratch my own itch, I've created [an unofficial OpenSearch search engine plugin for Delicious](http://mycroft.mozdev.org/developer/devlist.html?email=l.m.orchard%40pobox.com) on Mycroft.  Though I think it comes along with [the browser extensions](http://delicious.com/help/tools), I've yet to find this for [autodiscovery](http://mycroft.mozdev.org/developer/hosting.html) from the site itself.\r\n\r\n**The notes field in bookmarks has been expanded from 255 to 1000 characters.**  Yes, this means that you can now include long running quotes from pages, or complete paragraphs of rambling discourse. \r\n\r\n**[The feeds have all been overhauled and reorganized](http://delicious.com/help/feeds).**  An attempt at backward compatibility was made, but the old feed URLs are all deprecated.  Replacing these, there's now [a common and consistent URL namespace for feeds across formats](http://delicious.com/help/feeds).  \r\n\r\nAlmost all RSS feeds have [JSONP](http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/) counterparts, and further feed formats could be considered.  Additionally, the old mix of RSS 1.0 and 2.0 has been dropped in favor of RSS 2.0 format across the board to support podcast and media enclosure elements consistently.  The [linkrolls, tagrolls, network badges, and tagometers](http://delicious.com/help/tools) now all use the new JSONP feeds—and the widgets can be examined as example code in using the feeds.\r\n\r\n**Tag bundles can now be viewed as combined bookmark views, complete with feeds.**  This augments bundles from a simple visual organization tool to a more powerful content aggregation function.  Personally, I never had much use for tag bundles until now, but since they can actually be used to partition tags and bookmarks I might actually take the time to use them.  Check out these example URLs:\r\n\r\n* [http://delicious.com/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign](http://delicious.com/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign)\r\n* [http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign](http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign)\r\n\r\n**Bundles now work for tags, network contacts, and subscriptions.**  This means, for example, that you can partition your network contacts into topical groups.  From there, you can subscribe to those partitioned bookmarks in different folders in readers, or use the bundled bookmark views in mashups through JSON feeds.  Check out these example URLs:\r\n\r\n* [http://delicious.com/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard](http://delicious.com/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard)\r\n* [http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard](http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard)\r\n\r\n**Network member and fan feeds now include the date when the contact was added.**  Pro tip: Subscribe to fan feeds to see when new people have started following your bookmarks.\r\n\r\n**[Several previously undocumented parts of the V1 API have now been documented](http://delicious.com/help/api).**  In particular, the following new parameter combinations have been used with the browser extensions for primitive bookmark sync:\r\n\r\n* https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?hashes\r\n* https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?meta=yes\r\n* https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?fromdt={DT}&todt={DT}\r\n* https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?start={##}&results={##}\r\n\r\n**The posts/all API URL works again for users with large collections.**  With my 11k+ bookmarks, del.icio.us was keeling over with the attempt to assemble and deliver my entire collection with a posts/all call.  Now, however, Delicious 2.0 appears able to handle this call for my account.\r\n\r\n**Easter eggs have been rotated and recalibrated.** No, I'm not going to tell you what or where or how many they are.\r\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085469\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085469\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-05T02:31:52\">2008-08-05T02:31:52</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n  <p>Since I’m pretty sure everyone over there is either burnt out or still insanely busy at the moment, it might be awhile before anyone tells the full story of what this relaunch offers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Admit it, Les, you just got impatient after building a bunch of shiny toys that no one at Yahoo! seemed to be coming forth to tell the world about them. :) (I would be miffed too.)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085470\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.yining.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cd8af1a8b7c1cfdca49fb19d4a98a7bc&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.yining.org\">Yining</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085470\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-05T06:51:44\">2008-08-05T06:51:44</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>one thing in the new version that disappoints me is the tab-to-complete feature is gone.

    "html": "<p>I use <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> to write for this blog, and I don&#39;t think I could write much online without it.  (Of course, that&#39;s not saying much lately—but nevermind that for now.)</p>\n<p>Although I do appreciate all the effort put toward enhancing <code>&lt;textareas&gt;</code> on the web, I&#39;m not a fan of WYSIWYG writing interfaces.  They hide too much in an effort to make things &quot;easy&quot;—yet, for all that ease, they make me miss <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordperfect#Reveal_codes\">Reveal Codes</a> in WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  Hell, I wish I could write books using <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> instead of Microsoft Word.  (And, yeah, I know that some O&#39;Reilly authors have written books in <a href=\"http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html\">perlpod</a>—but that&#39;s a bit too far even for me.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think the issue is that it really bothers me to compose HTML in the same mental context as writing prose—HTML is too much like code.  Coding and <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prosing\">prosing</a> are two different modes for me, and I don&#39;t like the constant context-switching thrash.  (And, yes, I&#39;ve just learned today that <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prosing\">prosing</a> is a word.)</p>\n<p>So, apropos of this, there&#39;s been a <a href=\"http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2520\">thread</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001116.html\">blogophere</a> lately <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2008/05/a-million-littl.html\">naysaying</a> non-HTML, wiki-text, and <a href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/SmartAscii\">smart-ASCII</a> formats.  They seem to be mostly attacking the idea from a technical perspective, where it&#39;s more like a usability problem to me.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t see where Jeff Atwood&#39;s &quot;<a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001116.html\">Is HTML a Humane Markup Language?</a>&quot; makes the case for HTML as humane.  As far as I can tell, the inhumanity is that markup schemes are harder to keep track of than HTML.  Yet, there&#39;s a kind of coder macho thing going on there that&#39;s decidedly not humane—i.e. real programmers should be fine with getting their eyes poked by angle brackets on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I do agree that some of these formats are horrendous.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page\">Wikipedia markup</a> and <a href=\"http://www.phpbb.com/community/faq.php?mode=bbcode\">BBCode</a> are nasty in particular.  Though, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page\">Wikipedia markup</a> at least has some semantic purpose beyond HTML.  But, I can&#39;t follow from that to seeing how the whole idea is wrong.  </p>\n<p>I used <a href=\"http://textile.thresholdstate.com/\">Textile</a> for awhile, and then switched to <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> when it came around.  At this point, I&#39;ve been using <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> since it came out in 2004.  I now plug <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> into everything I can where I&#39;ll be doing any writing.  There&#39;s a version of <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> in just about every language known to the web these days—you can even find <a href=\"http://attacklab.net/showdown/\">Markdown in Javascript</a>.  I write notes to myself in <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a>, even when there&#39;s no URL to view it.  I&#39;ve even used <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> semi-consciously when writing by hand in a paper journal.</p>\n<p>Perhaps I&#39;ve said too much.  </p>\n<p>Anyway, I&#39;ll expend as many brain cells as it takes to not need to compose raw HTML by hand in the course of writing.  As it happens, I can usually just use <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a>, so those brain cells were spent years ago.  And thus, I feel I&#39;ve saved more brain cells in avoiding coding/<a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prosing\">prosing</a> thrash. So, it could just be personal preference, but I agree with the reasons why <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhyDoesntWikiDoHtml\">the original wiki doesn&#39;t use HTML</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085294\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://megalar.890m.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=750dbcc9cc192bfad37a3daa4edf139e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://megalar.890m.com/blog/\">megalar</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085294\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-05-18T22:19:07\">2008-05-18T22:19:07</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I couldn't agree more on this dude.

    "body": "I use [Markdown][] to write for this blog, and I don't think I could write much online without it.  (Of course, that's not saying much lately—but nevermind that for now.)\r\n\r\nAlthough I do appreciate all the effort put toward enhancing `<textareas>` on the web, I'm not a fan of WYSIWYG writing interfaces.  They hide too much in an effort to make things \"easy\"—yet, for all that ease, they make me miss [Reveal Codes][rc] in WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  Hell, I wish I could write books using [Markdown][] instead of Microsoft Word.  (And, yeah, I know that some O'Reilly authors have written books in [perlpod][]—but that's a bit too far even for me.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think the issue is that it really bothers me to compose HTML in the same mental context as writing prose—HTML is too much like code.  Coding and [prosing][] are two different modes for me, and I don't like the constant context-switching thrash.  (And, yes, I've just learned today that [prosing][] is a word.)\r\n\r\nSo, apropos of this, there's been a [thread][amd1] in the [blogophere][amd2] lately [naysaying][amd3] non-HTML, wiki-text, and [smart-ASCII][smartascii] formats.  They seem to be mostly attacking the idea from a technical perspective, where it's more like a usability problem to me.\r\n\r\nI don't see where Jeff Atwood's \"[Is HTML a Humane Markup Language?][ja]\" makes the case for HTML as humane.  As far as I can tell, the inhumanity is that markup schemes are harder to keep track of than HTML.  Yet, there's a kind of coder macho thing going on there that's decidedly not humane—i.e. real programmers should be fine with getting their eyes poked by angle brackets on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I do agree that some of these formats are horrendous.  [Wikipedia markup][wpm] and [BBCode][] are nasty in particular.  Though, [Wikipedia markup][wpm] at least has some semantic purpose beyond HTML.  But, I can't follow from that to seeing how the whole idea is wrong.  \r\n\r\nI used [Textile][] for awhile, and then switched to [Markdown][] when it came around.  At this point, I've been using [Markdown][] since it came out in 2004.  I now plug [Markdown][] into everything I can where I'll be doing any writing.  There's a version of [Markdown][] in just about every language known to the web these days—you can even find [Markdown in Javascript][showdown].  I write notes to myself in [Markdown][], even when there's no URL to view it.  I've even used [Markdown][] semi-consciously when writing by hand in a paper journal.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I've said too much.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll expend as many brain cells as it takes to not need to compose raw HTML by hand in the course of writing.  As it happens, I can usually just use [Markdown][], so those brain cells were spent years ago.  And thus, I feel I've saved more brain cells in avoiding coding/[prosing][] thrash. So, it could just be personal preference, but I agree with the reasons why [the original wiki doesn't use HTML][wiki].\r\n\r\n[ja]: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001116.html\r\n[wiki]: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhyDoesntWikiDoHtml\r\n[perlpod]: http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html\r\n[smartascii]: http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/SmartAscii\r\n[textile]: http://textile.thresholdstate.com/ \r\n[markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\r\n[bbcode]: http://www.phpbb.com/community/faq.php?mode=bbcode\r\n[wpm]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page\r\n[amd3]: http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2008/05/a-million-littl.html\r\n[amd2]: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001116.html\r\n[amd1]: http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2520\r\n[shdh]: http://superhappydevhouse.org/SuperHappyDevHouse25\r\n[rc]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordperfect#Reveal_codes\r\n[prosing]: http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prosing\r\n[showdown]: http://attacklab.net/showdown/\r\n[yak shaving]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yak_shaving\r\n[bucket]: http://decafbad.com/bucket/\r\n\r\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085294\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://megalar.890m.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=750dbcc9cc192bfad37a3daa4edf139e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://megalar.890m.com/blog/\">megalar</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085294\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-05-18T22:19:07\">2008-05-18T22:19:07</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I couldn't agree more on this dude.

    "html": "<p>I should elaborate on what I mean by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/218773732\">tags in Twitter</a>, since I got a few head-scratching responses.</p>\n<p>No, fitting tags into the 140 characters for a message won't work.  And, no, tagging every tweet as you go is a horrible approach - no one will do it.  What I've thought might work, though, are <i>sticky tags</i>.</p>\n<p>Sticky tags would persist from update to update.  From the web UI, you could drop \"work\" or \"gnomedex\" or \"l:95051 beer concert somerandomband\" into an additional tags field and all tweets from then on will gain those tags until you empty the tag field.</p>\n<p>There could be shortcut commands to change or clear tags - ala \"d someone\" for direct messaging.  This would be especially useful while out and about and mobile.  Say you text \"t bus commute\" to Twitter when you get on the bus for home, then anything you might emit from then on, until you change the tags, gets tagged with \"bus\" and \"commute\".</p>\n<p>Then, you and others could follow this particular thread of tweets via <a href=\"http://twitter.com/yourname/commute\">http://twitter.com/yourname/commute</a> - or even with tag intersections ala delicious: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/yourname/commute+bus\">http://twitter.com/yourname/commute+bus</a>.</p>\n<p>Going to be at SxSW for awhile?

I don't want features added just for coolness sake or whatever.</p>\n<p>But, I can see a set of problems with the Twitter experience that might be helped with something that adds a bit more context - and something like tags seems like a lightweight and somewhat simple way to do it.  Making them sticky helps make them less cumbersome to use.</p>\n<p>I'd really like to be able to pick and choose the sorts of updates I receive from people I follow, across different means of receiving them.  For example, I might not want to get all of someone's random ponderings on my phone, but I'd like to get pinged when they start talking about when they're leaving for the party tonight.  If they switch to a new set of tags I'm watching for, this can happen.</p>\n<p>Or, maybe after a Hack Day London, I'd like to go back and see what the chatter was about - ie. I can <em>see</em> what went on via the hackdaylondon tag on Flickr, and I'd like something like that for Twitter.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085870\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.elroyjetson.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4a34cf8d239b6589024fc004cfdad5b8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.elroyjetson.org\">Elroy Jetson</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085870\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-08-22T17:48:55\">2007-08-22T17:48:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I have to agree that having tags would make it nice to filter the wheat from the chafe.

This would be especially useful while out and about and mobile.  Say you text \"t bus commute\" to Twitter when you get on the bus for home, then anything you might emit from then on, until you change the tags, gets tagged with \"bus\" and \"commute\".</p>\r\n<p>Then, you and others could follow this particular thread of tweets via <a href=\"http://twitter.com/yourname/commute\">http://twitter.com/yourname/commute</a> - or even with tag intersections ala delicious: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/yourname/commute+bus\">http://twitter.com/yourname/commute+bus</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Going to be at SxSW for awhile?

I don't want titles, comments, or extended entries - that's what a blog is for.  I don't want features added just for coolness sake or whatever.</p>\n\n<p>But, I can see a set of problems with the Twitter experience that might be helped with something that adds a bit more context - and something like tags seems like a lightweight and somewhat simple way to do it.  Making them sticky helps make them less cumbersome to use.</p>\n\n<p>I'd really like to be able to pick and choose the sorts of updates I receive from people I follow, across different means of receiving them.  For example, I might not want to get all of someone's random ponderings on my phone, but I'd like to get pinged when they start talking about when they're leaving for the party tonight.  If they switch to a new set of tags I'm watching for, this can happen.</p>\n\n<p>Or, maybe after a Hack Day London, I'd like to go back and see what the chatter was about - ie. I can <em>see</em> what went on via the hackdaylondon tag on Flickr, and I'd like something like that for Twitter.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085870\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.elroyjetson.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4a34cf8d239b6589024fc004cfdad5b8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.elroyjetson.org\">Elroy Jetson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085870\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-08-22T17:48:55\">2007-08-22T17:48:55</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I have to agree that having tags would make it nice to filter the wheat from the chafe.

For instance, consider both <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/services/api/auth.spec.html\">Flickr&#39;s</a> and <a href=\"http://upcoming.org/services/api/token_auth.php\">Upcoming&#39;s</a> 3rd party token-based authentication / authorization schemes.</p>\n<p>In particular, I&#39;m looking at things like del.icio.us&#39; own Daily Blog Post and others.

We could come up with a cleverly confusing buzzword acronym like Atom Pull Publishing. You just periodically poll a feed and import the items. Actually, this is kind of what Google Reader is doing. They've even got a namespace in their atom for expressing the original id and the source feed. Perhaps I should write a drupal module.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084471\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084471\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-12T19:01:45\">2007-03-12T19:01:45</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>@ian: Hmm, yeah, that does sound like the least complicated way to get outside content pulled into a blog without releasing the blog's login details.

For what it's worth, the Vienna team is working on BlogLines integration.</p>\n\n<p>@jose: Not sure when you tried Vienna last - it seems to have improved markedly, though that might just be my mileage with the MacBook Pro now.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085601\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e3b46099c3fd3844c4539b27f143fd97&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\">Michal Migurski</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085601\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-03T08:17:14\">2007-01-03T08:17:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I almost feel bad for wanting to switch. =)</p>\n\n<p>Vienna is <em>really good</em>.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085602\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7b3073e125f3ac8f09130950ef5d7790&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\">brian cors</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085602\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-03T16:45:29\">2007-01-03T16:45:29</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I checked out Vienna today a bit, and it's mucho nice.</p>\n\n<p>However, the one thing that I use the most on NNW is the ability to sync to NewsGator.

Something similar might be nice here, Les, as your titleless posts don't have a visible (clickable) permalink.  The comments link provides a way to get the permalink, but it's not exactly the same.  </p>\n<p>Having the permalink in Bloglines makes the title less important- all the posts appear in order, so the title only helps with skimming.  As these are 'asides', I skimming the body is just as quick.  I am curious about other aggregators.  It's been ages since I've used a desktop three-paned aggreagtor, such as NNW; I'd guess it's like having an email in your inbox with no subject.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087096\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087096\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-16T14:15:49\">2006-08-16T14:15:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Asides are something I've been trying to sort out for awhile.

Something similar might be nice here, Les, as your titleless posts don't have a visible (clickable) permalink.

As these are 'asides', I skimming the body is just as quick.  I am curious about other aggregators.  It's been ages since I've used a desktop three-paned aggreagtor, such as NNW; I'd guess it's like having an email in your inbox with no subject.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087096\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087096\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-16T14:15:49\">2006-08-16T14:15:49</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Asides are something I've been trying to sort out for awhile.

    "html": "<p>Listening to this <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2006/02/12/530652.aspx\">podcast about OPML and Reading Lists</a> and enjoying the various perspectives on RSS, OPML, and Semantic Web tech.  It&#39;s also the first time I&#39;ve heard Danny Ayers&#39; voice, so that was pretty cool after having been a textual blog acquaintance for a few years now.  As for the rest of the guys on the call, I&#39;m not quite as familiar with all of them yet, but I&#39;ll be adding them to my Reading Lists shortly.</p>\n<p>Apropos of this podcast, I&#39;ve lately gotten a bit of a fresh take on the RSS/OPML versus XHTML versus Semantic Web tech merry-go-round.  Here&#39;s the basic gist:  Invest time into tools that solve problems first and formats that enable possibilities second, if you want to get any attention and subsequent help.</p>\n<p>And then I say &quot;tools&quot;, I don&#39;t mean a GraphViz construct that makes really cool charts for people willing to chase down and install the dependencies.  No, I mean something like the OPML Editor.  The OPML Editor comes in a single package, and you launch it from a single icon.  The OPML Editor is <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty piece of software</a> that&#39;s nonetheless helping me achieve some practical goals that I&#39;ve heretofore been vaguely stymied in reaching.  The OPML Editor is making me think more favorably about OPML, <i>despite</i> OPML being <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty format</a>.</p>\n<p>The utility of the OPML Editor is giving me the motivation to build filters and workarounds to transmute OPML into XOXO and RDF formats, but only when the need arises.  I could also see putting an OPML-to-triples bridge in front of a semweb crawler or tool.  And, there&#39;s no reason why outlines in the OPML Editor couldn&#39;t be rendered in XOXO and RDF formats by the tool itself, if there&#39;s something useful around to consume it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I&#39;ve done enough with RDF and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo_outliner_experiment\">XOXO</a> to see the clear potential in both.  With enough RDF data around, you can turn the whole wide web into a single massively networked database ripe for the querying thanks to a uniform data model and clear specs for representation of that model.  With XOXO and microformats, you get a <a href=\"http://www.sudoku.com/\">Sudoku-esque</a> solution to providing both human and machine readable data in the same format and file, while sterring close to the inherent design principles of the web.</p>\n<p>The problem with these formats, though, is that they open potential avenues but don&#39;t provide value until there&#39;s some foot traffic on the avenues.  This is just establishing a world in which there can exist both chickens and eggs, but not doing much with respect to concrete instantiations of poultry.\nNow, to be fair, there have been efforts to make practical usage of RDF (see: <a href=\"http://musicbrainz.org/\">MusicBrainz</a>) and these are early days for microformats.  But, I think a lot more effort needs to be given toward making useful, personally rewarding tools - and less effort given toward expressing awe toward the potentials given by formats and models.  You can have both, but you&#39;ve got to pick one to start with.</p>\n<p>And, the reason you need to make tools first that use formats second is attention.  (That&#39;s been a buzzword lately, hasn&#39;t it?)  You need attention if you want adoption and help.  And, you can get attention - and subsequent help - by scratching someone&#39;s itch.</p>\n<p>Now, some people&#39;s itches are scratched by the fun of abstract symbol manipulation and the perception of elegance.  Others&#39; itches are scratched by getting work done, like writing or organizing thoughts or expanding awareness of more information sources.  Personally, I&#39;ve got itches of both of these varieties.  The problem is that there are many fewer people with itches in that first category.  And, no offense to anyone, that seems to be the bulk of the RDF and XOXO fanbase at the moment.  For the second category, even if things are shitty, smoke a bit and catch on fire - as long as some work gets done at the end of the day, there&#39;s a lot of tolerance to go around and a lot of motivation to pitch in to improve the situation.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I firmly believe that ATOM, RDF, and XHTML-based microformats trounce OPML, RSS, and the like in terms of clear definition, affordance in manipulation, and technical elegance.  But, OPML and RSS are still winning in the world because the tools using these formats are scratching some damn annoying itches.  And, though towers built atop shitty tools and formats seem Jenga-shaky, somehow they never quite come crashing down.

    "body": "Listening to this <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2006/02/12/530652.aspx\">podcast about OPML and Reading Lists</a> and enjoying the various perspectives on RSS, OPML, and Semantic Web tech.  It's also the first time I've heard Danny Ayers' voice, so that was pretty cool after having been a textual blog acquaintance for a few years now.  As for the rest of the guys on the call, I'm not quite as familiar with all of them yet, but I'll be adding them to my Reading Lists shortly.\r\n\r\nApropos of this podcast, I've lately gotten a bit of a fresh take on the RSS/OPML versus XHTML versus Semantic Web tech merry-go-round.  Here's the basic gist:  Invest time into tools that solve problems first and formats that enable possibilities second, if you want to get any attention and subsequent help.\r\n\r\nAnd then I say \"tools\", I don't mean a GraphViz construct that makes really cool charts for people willing to chase down and install the dependencies.  No, I mean something like the OPML Editor.  The OPML Editor comes in a single package, and you launch it from a single icon.  The OPML Editor is <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty piece of software</a> that's nonetheless helping me achieve some practical goals that I've heretofore been vaguely stymied in reaching.  The OPML Editor is making me think more favorably about OPML, <i>despite</i> OPML being <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty format</a>.\r\n\r\nThe utility of the OPML Editor is giving me the motivation to build filters and workarounds to transmute OPML into XOXO and RDF formats, but only when the need arises.  I could also see putting an OPML-to-triples bridge in front of a semweb crawler or tool.  And, there's no reason why outlines in the OPML Editor couldn't be rendered in XOXO and RDF formats by the tool itself, if there's something useful around to consume it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I've done enough with RDF and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo_outliner_experiment\">XOXO</a> to see the clear potential in both.  With enough RDF data around, you can turn the whole wide web into a single massively networked database ripe for the querying thanks to a uniform data model and clear specs for representation of that model.  With XOXO and microformats, you get a <a href=\"http://www.sudoku.com/\">Sudoku-esque</a> solution to providing both human and machine readable data in the same format and file, while sterring close to the inherent design principles of the web.\r\n\r\nThe problem with these formats, though, is that they open potential avenues but don't provide value until there's some foot traffic on the avenues.  This is just establishing a world in which there can exist both chickens and eggs, but not doing much with respect to concrete instantiations of poultry.\r\nNow, to be fair, there have been efforts to make practical usage of RDF (see: <a href=\"http://musicbrainz.org/\">MusicBrainz</a>) and these are early days for microformats.  But, I think a lot more effort needs to be given toward making useful, personally rewarding tools - and less effort given toward expressing awe toward the potentials given by formats and models.  You can have both, but you've got to pick one to start with.\r\n\r\nAnd, the reason you need to make tools first that use formats second is attention.  (That's been a buzzword lately, hasn't it?)  You need attention if you want adoption and help.  And, you can get attention - and subsequent help - by scratching someone's itch.\r\n\r\nNow, some people's itches are scratched by the fun of abstract symbol manipulation and the perception of elegance.  Others' itches are scratched by getting work done, like writing or organizing thoughts or expanding awareness of more information sources.  Personally, I've got itches of both of these varieties.  The problem is that there are many fewer people with itches in that first category.  And, no offense to anyone, that seems to be the bulk of the RDF and XOXO fanbase at the moment.  For the second category, even if things are shitty, smoke a bit and catch on fire - as long as some work gets done at the end of the day, there's a lot of tolerance to go around and a lot of motivation to pitch in to improve the situation.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I firmly believe that ATOM, RDF, and XHTML-based microformats trounce OPML, RSS, and the like in terms of clear definition, affordance in manipulation, and technical elegance.  But, OPML and RSS are still winning in the world because the tools using these formats are scratching some damn annoying itches.  And, though towers built atop shitty tools and formats seem Jenga-shaky, somehow they never quite come crashing down.  Maybe they will come crashing down someday, but we seem to be getting work done in the meantime.\r\n\r\nSo, to wrap up:  My take on this whole mess is that your format will gain adoption to the degree that the tools producing it help people get work done.  I can't find tools today for RDF and XOXO that are as rewardingly useful as the OPML Editor has become.  When that happens, the story may change.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: metablogging rdf semweb webdev opml rss syndication microformats xoxo podcasting -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086877\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e377f3e2140297d32460ae9a4b38ff98&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086877\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-14T02:32:49\">2006-02-14T02:32:49</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>There's a lot to be said for rough consensus and running code, and there's a lot more running code that speaks OPML than there is that speaks XOXO or RDF.

Angling anxiously for advice? The Internet Oracle can help! Like all famous oracles, the Internet Oracle is omniscient, and will provide some answer to your question. In return, the Oracle may require that you perform a small service ...</blockquote>\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://cgi.cs.indiana.edu/~oracle/index.cgi\">Internet Oracle</a></small>\n\n<p>Does anyone out there remember / still participate in the Internet Oracle?</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>:  I see the rest of what I&#39;d tried writing here didn&#39;t make it into the post.  Anyway, what I meant to say was that the Internet Oracle was one of my first brushes with the fact that there were <em>people</em> out there on that Internet.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;d been dealing with FTP servers and Archie and reading Usenet archives, but I&#39;d not yet logged on to IRC for the first time.  I&#39;d already had experience with chatting and message bases via dial-up BBSes, but this Internet thing was something altogether more.  So, the Oracle was the first experience I had of sending something out into the void, and getting not an automated response but a wittily-crafted response from an obviously real person.</p>\n<!-- tags: metablogging oracle internet retro -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087074\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.lostfocus.de/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9e1f36d2a869f4ab38f107ea8aa94899&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.lostfocus.de/\">Dominik</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087074\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-26T06:03:34\">2005-10-26T06:03:34</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I do remember, but it has been ages..</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087075\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fa15e41d4cf102273b0e8f209c52c288&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\">Dorothea Salo</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087075\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-26T11:10:05\">2005-10-26T11:10:05</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>The Internet Oracle got me through many, many (okay, about fifteen) nights on the Very Late Shift at the computer helpdesk, back when I was a wee undergrad...</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087077\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.flashesofpanic.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=389cfea59d2aef782293c210a5d96bb2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.flashesofpanic.com\">pjm</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087077\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-26T13:00:52\">2005-10-26T13:00:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I'm actually still on the Oracle's mailing list.

Angling anxiously for advice? The Internet Oracle can help! Like all famous oracles, the Internet Oracle is omniscient, and will provide some answer to your question. In return, the Oracle may require that you perform a small service ...</blockquote>\r\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://cgi.cs.indiana.edu/~oracle/index.cgi\">Internet Oracle</a></small>\r\n\r\nDoes anyone out there remember / still participate in the Internet Oracle?\r\n\r\n**Update**:  I see the rest of what I'd tried writing here didn't make it into the post.  Anyway, what I meant to say was that the Internet Oracle was one of my first brushes with the fact that there were *people* out there on that Internet.  \r\n\r\nI'd been dealing with FTP servers and Archie and reading Usenet archives, but I'd not yet logged on to IRC for the first time.  I'd already had experience with chatting and message bases via dial-up BBSes, but this Internet thing was something altogether more.  So, the Oracle was the first experience I had of sending something out into the void, and getting not an automated response but a wittily-crafted response from an obviously real person.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: metablogging oracle internet retro -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087074\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.lostfocus.de/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9e1f36d2a869f4ab38f107ea8aa94899&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.lostfocus.de/\">Dominik</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087074\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-26T06:03:34\">2005-10-26T06:03:34</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I do remember, but it has been ages..</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087075\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fa15e41d4cf102273b0e8f209c52c288&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\">Dorothea Salo</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087075\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-26T11:10:05\">2005-10-26T11:10:05</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>The Internet Oracle got me through many, many (okay, about fifteen) nights on the Very Late Shift at the computer helpdesk, back when I was a wee undergrad...</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087077\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.flashesofpanic.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=389cfea59d2aef782293c210a5d96bb2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.flashesofpanic.com\">pjm</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087077\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-26T13:00:52\">2005-10-26T13:00:52</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I'm actually still on the Oracle's mailing list.

    "html": "<p>Well, of course I&#39;ve lapsed pretty much right back into silence after <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/12/redesigninprogress\" title=\"Redesign in progress (or, no need to adjust your set) » Archive » Blog » 0xDECAFBAD\">having shaken this place up</a> and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/13/hacking-rss-and-atom-is-out\" title=\"Hacking RSS and Atom is out! » Archive » Blog » 0xDECAFBAD\">having announced the arrival of the book</a>.</p>\n<p>The culprit, of course, is <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html\" title=\"yak shaving\">yak shaving</a>.  Again.  True, life itself has been pretty busy lately.  The days are booked, the weekends have been filling up--and in spare moments I&#39;ve been obsessed with <a href=\"http://www.hulkgames.com/us/\" title=\"THE INCREDIBLE HULK: ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION\">jumping from building to building</a>.  But, when it comes down to me and a pile of code on the screen, I find myself in ever further depths of recursion.</p>\n<p>For instance, I keep meaning to get down to posting some <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Asides\">lightweight &quot;asides&quot;</a> in place of my old <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/08/12/quick-and-random-thoughts\">&quot;quick bullets&quot;</a> posts I was doing.  But, of course, before I do that, I want to do some <a href=\"http://www.kottke.org/03/11/kottke-redesign\">Kottkesque template mungeing</a> to more properly present these smaller bits.  </p>\n<p>And, though I&#39;m actually most of the way done making another rev to the theme here, I also want to fold my linkblog back into the site.  The absence of these <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/12/redesigninprogress#comment-1850\">has already been noticed</a>, so I&#39;d like to give those a proper treatment.</p>\n<p>In addition, I still mean to start pimping my new book a bit; maybe even starting tonight.  I&#39;ve got a notion to post teasers highlighting a few of my favorite things.  And then, of course, there&#39;s the <a href=\"http://www.hackingfeeds.com/blog/\">neglected companion site</a> on which I&#39;ve yet to spend much time at all.  But I&#39;ve got grand plans, including some which go beyond the book itself and toward making <a href=\"http://www.hackingfeeds.com/blog/\">hackingfeeds.com</a> a regularly updated and relevant resource.</p>\n<p>Speaking of that...  I&#39;ve also continued working a bit with some feed hacks since finishing the book.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/feedspool/\">FeedSpool</a> is one of these: I&#39;ve revived some of FeedReactor&#39;s old code--this time aiming for a much higher degree of simplicity, trying to stick with standard Python modules, and dumping the database altogether.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to make a more formal announcement about this thing, once it&#39;s a bit more in usable shape.  In a nutshell:  It polls feeds and downloads the data.  New entries are split out into individual files, like an email or usenet spool.  That&#39;s it.  Other programs are expected to do the clever bits.</p>\n<p>And, to go along with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/feedspool/\">FeedSpool</a>, I&#39;ve been toying with building a Spotlight importer for OS X Tiger which indexes RSS and Atom feeds and entries.  Not in Subversion yet, and not nearly ready for public consumption, but it&#39;s been pretty fun to play with.  (And I totally forgot just how many feeds I have lying around on my hard drive!)</p>\n<p>Anyway, that&#39;s enough for now.  Time to post this and get to thinking about what I want to post next!</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083237\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083237\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-23T02:03:28\">2005-09-23T02:03:28</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Just a quick note that as of this writing, neither the feeds (ironic!) nor commenting works at hackingfeeds.com.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083238\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083238\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-23T02:18:02\">2005-09-23T02:18:02</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Aristotle:  Thanks for the note!

    "body": "Well, of course I've lapsed pretty much right back into silence after [having shaken this place up][redesign] and [having announced the arrival of the book][book].\r\n\r\nThe culprit, of course, is [yak shaving][yak].  Again.  True, life itself has been pretty busy lately.  The days are booked, the weekends have been filling up--and in spare moments I've been obsessed with [jumping from building to building][hulk].  But, when it comes down to me and a pile of code on the screen, I find myself in ever further depths of recursion.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I keep meaning to get down to posting some [lightweight \"asides\"][asides] in place of my old [\"quick bullets\"][quick] posts I was doing.  But, of course, before I do that, I want to do some [Kottkesque template mungeing][kottke] to more properly present these smaller bits.  \r\n\r\nAnd, though I'm actually most of the way done making another rev to the theme here, I also want to fold my linkblog back into the site.  The absence of these [has already been noticed][noticed], so I'd like to give those a proper treatment.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I still mean to start pimping my new book a bit; maybe even starting tonight.  I've got a notion to post teasers highlighting a few of my favorite things.  And then, of course, there's the [neglected companion site][hackingfeeds] on which I've yet to spend much time at all.  But I've got grand plans, including some which go beyond the book itself and toward making [hackingfeeds.com][hackingfeeds] a regularly updated and relevant resource.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of that...  I've also continued working a bit with some feed hacks since finishing the book.  \r\n\r\n[FeedSpool][feedspool] is one of these: I've revived some of FeedReactor's old code--this time aiming for a much higher degree of simplicity, trying to stick with standard Python modules, and dumping the database altogether.  \r\n\r\nI've been meaning to make a more formal announcement about this thing, once it's a bit more in usable shape.  In a nutshell:  It polls feeds and downloads the data.  New entries are split out into individual files, like an email or usenet spool.  That's it.  Other programs are expected to do the clever bits.\r\n\r\nAnd, to go along with [FeedSpool][feedspool], I've been toying with building a Spotlight importer for OS X Tiger which indexes RSS and Atom feeds and entries.  Not in Subversion yet, and not nearly ready for public consumption, but it's been pretty fun to play with.  (And I totally forgot just how many feeds I have lying around on my hard drive!)\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's enough for now.  Time to post this and get to thinking about what I want to post next!\r\n\r\n[feedspool]: http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/feedspool/\r\n[quick]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/08/12/quick-and-random-thoughts\r\n[noticed]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/12/redesigninprogress#comment-1850\r\n[kottke]: http://www.kottke.org/03/11/kottke-redesign\r\n[asides]: http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Asides\r\n[hackingfeeds]: http://www.hackingfeeds.com/blog/\r\n[book]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/13/hacking-rss-and-atom-is-out \"Hacking RSS and Atom is out! » Archive » Blog » 0xDECAFBAD\"\r\n[redesign]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/12/redesigninprogress \"Redesign in progress (or, no need to adjust your set) » Archive » Blog » 0xDECAFBAD\"\r\n[yak]: http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html \"yak shaving\"\r\n[hulk]: http://www.hulkgames.com/us/ \"THE INCREDIBLE HULK: ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION\"\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083237\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083237\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-23T02:03:28\">2005-09-23T02:03:28</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Just a quick note that as of this writing, neither the feeds (ironic!) nor commenting works at hackingfeeds.com.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083238\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083238\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-23T02:18:02\">2005-09-23T02:18:02</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Aristotle:  Thanks for the note!

Finally, after a bit of a weekend sprint during which I mangled the default theme a bit to my liking and installed a few plugins, I figured that I&#39;d just throw the switch tonight and deal with the fallout as it arrives.</p>\n<p>For now, it&#39;s bedtime.

    "body": "Hi there.  If things around here are looking or acting a bit wonky, it's because I'm in the middle of my belated site overhaul I meant to do back in May.  It was preempted by [the book][book], something about which I want to gush in detail very shortly.\r\n\r\nIn between bouts of actually being busy, I've been yak shaving around the idea of executing this overhaul--making lists, researching sites I like, installing WordPress on my laptop.  Finally, after a bit of a weekend sprint during which I mangled the default theme a bit to my liking and installed a few plugins, I figured that I'd just throw the switch tonight and deal with the fallout as it arrives.\r\n\r\nFor now, it's bedtime.  But, just for The Girl, here's me with the new book!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/09/IMG_3562.JPG\" target=\"_new\"><img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/09/IMG_3562_th.JPG\" /></a><br />\r\n\r\n[book]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/0764597582/\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088745\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=abfc88b96ae18c85ba7aac3bded2ec5e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/\">Ryan Tomayko</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088745\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-13T07:59:13\">2005-09-13T07:59:13</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Looks great!</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088746\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088746\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-13T11:23:34\">2005-09-13T11:23:34</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Awesome, now get back to posting on a regular basis! ;)</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088747\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.skippy.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1a320ac7f6818504df79fe42fc6b84a9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.skippy.net/\">skippy</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088747\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-13T13:14:17\">2005-09-13T13:14:17</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Welcome to WordPress!
