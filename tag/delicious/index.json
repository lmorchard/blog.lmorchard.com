But, none of that says they&#39;ve found a home or that it will be easy to transplant if they do. In the meantime, there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty and probably only an overworked skeleton crew left onboard.</p>\n<p>Much of Delicious now depends on home-grown technology that is shared by many other Yahoo! properties. This should not be a surprise: Beyond the money, <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2005/12/09/yahoo-acquires-delicious/\">that was kind of the point of selling to Yahoo! in particular</a>. As a major search company in 2005, they presumably had the indexing mojo help scale it up. So, transferring the site to a new technology stack will definitely figure into the value proposition of anyone looking to take over Delicious. </p>\n<p>In short, any buyers of Delicious will have their hands full—probably more so than Yahoo! did when they first bought it. Don&#39;t hold your breath for a bright future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-cares\">Who cares?</h2>\n<p>What it comes down to this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you use Delicious regularly, you care about your bookmarks. </li>\n<li>If you&#39;re part of an interest group, you care about their bookmarks and they about yours.</li>\n<li>If you&#39;re a random web surfer, you care about finding things relevant to your interests.</li>\n<li>If you&#39;re Yahoo!—well, I would have thought you cared about building a human-powered index of the web, but who knows where your collective heads are at these days.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The important thing is that no owners of Delicious will care in particular about #1 and #2—that is, your bookmarks and those of your colleagues. If they care about anything, it&#39;s the overall value of a well-indexed set of web resources to #3 and how they can monetize that.</p>\n<p>In other words: If they can&#39;t figure out how to monetize the aggregate index, <a href=\"http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Why_Back_Up%3F\">don&#39;t expect them to start caring about your data</a>.

Also, hosting is getting cheaper every day. Gamers host servers for themselves and their friends, so why not start thinking about hosting a social bookmarking server for interesting people by invite?

What made Delicious hard is what made it interesting, and it&#39;s possible that no one service will ever again reach a critical mass in social bookmarking.</p>\n<p>But, I don&#39;t think Delicious could have scaled up forever and stayed interesting.

All of these bookmarks would be somehow merged to produce intelligent data.\nKind of what Automattic does with WordPress.org and WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>Aside, this new Delicious system should have a more \"sharing\" side with ability for networkers to comment on each bookmark, \"redeli\" the bookmark (like retweet), etc... Unite bookmark and twitter functions - What Yahoo! should have try to developp during these past five years and failed to.\nI already tried to find some link posted in the past in my Twitter stream, and it made me really angry and frustrated. And I didn't succeed. Twitter is nice but still has a too bad signal-to-noise ratio : Tweets are way too much passing, impossible to organized, and replies are not enough differentiated from normal tweet.</p>\n<p>What could be an ideal way to go is a WordPress plugin. Based on already there custom post type system, tags system, comments sytem...\nWordPress is already a successful product, widely used. It would make easier the process of leaving current doomed delicious to a decentralized system.</p>\n<p>And Automattic should integrate this plugin to their WordPress.com blogs. They even would not have to buy Delicious to Yahoo!, just spread the word and invite people to subscribe to their service and import their delicious data.</p>\n<p>Finally, imagine that Automattic creates a subdomain of wordpress.com where all the data (bookmarks and data) would be gathered. The plugin on self hosted blogs would propose to the owner to share his personal bookmarks data with this website via an API.\nA network could be based on wordpress.com optional subscription.</p>\n<p>I don't have any personal or business interest in Automattic (just a WordPress user) but it seems the perfect way to go.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087684\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087684\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T16:49:26\">2010-12-20T16:49:26</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>@Rogers: Yeah, I totally glossed over the horrors of sysadmin work and security.

There are interesting alternatives that don't involve handing everything over to someone who doesn't actually care about you and your stuff.\r\n\r\nAnd, if it turns out that social bookmarking settles down into a small but highly involved niche of curators, so much the better that they keep their own lights on.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087678\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://workbench.cadenhead.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=70fe121c9172e9882762d7f28f233567&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://workbench.cadenhead.org/\">Rogers Cadenhead</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087678\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T05:44:29\">2010-12-20T05:44:29</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hosting is cheap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Running web applications on your own server securely and reliably is expensive, assuming you value your own time.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087680\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bb266673ec59acafd5d3ed68238551a5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">JB</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087680\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T10:05:58\">2010-12-20T10:05:58</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I really like this article.\r\nThere should indeed be a system where you can self-host your bookmarks with some CMS and a centralized site for less techy people. All of these bookmarks would be somehow merged to produce intelligent data.\r\nKind of what Automattic does with WordPress.org and WordPress.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside, this new Delicious system should have a more \"sharing\" side with ability for networkers to comment on each bookmark, \"redeli\" the bookmark (like retweet), etc... Unite bookmark and twitter functions - What Yahoo! should have try to developp during these past five years and failed to.\r\nI already tried to find some link posted in the past in my Twitter stream, and it made me really angry and frustrated. And I didn't succeed. Twitter is nice but still has a too bad signal-to-noise ratio : Tweets are way too much passing, impossible to organized, and replies are not enough differentiated from normal tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What could be an ideal way to go is a WordPress plugin. Based on already there custom post type system, tags system, comments sytem...\r\nWordPress is already a successful product, widely used. It would make easier the process of leaving current doomed delicious to a decentralized system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Automattic should integrate this plugin to their WordPress.com blogs. They even would not have to buy Delicious to Yahoo!, just spread the word and invite people to subscribe to their service and import their delicious data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, imagine that Automattic creates a subdomain of wordpress.com where all the data (bookmarks and data) would be gathered. The plugin on self hosted blogs would propose to the owner to share his personal bookmarks data with this website via an API.\r\nA network could be based on wordpress.com optional subscription.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't have any personal or business interest in Automattic (just a WordPress user) but it seems the perfect way to go.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087684\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087684\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T16:49:26\">2010-12-20T16:49:26</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@Rogers: Yeah, I totally glossed over the horrors of sysadmin work and security.

So, I suspect this means I&#39;m not <em>entirely</em> opposed to the sentiment in <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a>, because I don&#39;t think tags work everywhere their use is attempted.</p>\n<p>The rest of this entry elaborates on the above.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>From Cathy Marshall&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Have I convinced you that tags aren't all they've cracked up to be? I hope I have, but nonetheless there's a lingering fascination. Surely there's something to be done about tags: we don't want to just turn up our noses at Mr. Weinberger's argument.</blockquote>\n\n<p>From Mark Bernstein&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.markbernstein.org/Jan09/InTEKKATags.html\">In TEKKA: Tags</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\nThe study could be repeated on more images, and in additional contexts. It might be bad luck. But if it’s a repeatable result — and I think we all know it is — then we’re going to have to rethink a lot of our Web 2.0 rhetoric. Folksonomy is an illusion.</blockquote>\n\n<p>From my <a href=\"http://delicious.com/url/125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd#item-125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd972759\">bookmark on Delicious</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>If you can get past the rambling paragraphs of awkward fun-poking at tags interspersed with library science / web 2.0 / cultural references—as well as a discovery of what, you know, Flickr is all about—there's a well-embellished and obsessively-assembled statistical analysis of tags vs title vs notes in finding photos featuring tourist heel-spinning on the testicles of a bull mosaic in Milan. My impression is that she's missed the point of tags, but I'm having trouble reducing the impression to a critique.</blockquote>\n\n<p>It might be that I&#39;m intimidated by the writing in <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> or by the fact that a lot of work was done to produce numbers I can&#39;t dispute.  Either way, I have neither the time to produce a counter-study nor the wherewithal to extract and refute points in that article with precision.  So, I&#39;m just going to throw my impressions out there and hope they coalesce.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tags are extremely useful to me.<ul>\n<li>I&#39;ve been using tags on Delicious since shortly after the site was created.  </li>\n<li>To date, <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/deusx\">I&#39;ve saved 11825 bookmarks and spawned 6069 tags</a>.  (More on that ratio later.)  </li>\n<li>Tags have worked very well for me, both in later finding my own saved resources and in finding aggregates of others&#39;.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Flickr is not the poster child of tagging—Delicious is.  <ul>\n<li>On Flickr, I&#39;ve found tags occasionally interesting, but not incredibly so.  More a curiosity than a killer feature, really.  (More on that in a bit, too.)</li>\n<li>To be honest, I&#39;ve not found a great deal of use for tags around Web 2.0 properties beyond Delicious, folksonomy hype notwithstanding.  </li>\n<li>Fun fact: When I worked on Delicious, we disliked the term &quot;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy\">folksonomy</a>&quot; and tried never to use it in serious discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The places where I&#39;ve found tags useful are text-heavy, where the full text is either not indexed or not displayed in results when using search.<ul>\n<li>Consider magazine articles or blog posts bookmarked on Delicious.</li>\n<li>Those bookmarks are subject to the character limits of title or description fields.  </li>\n<li>Far more often than on Flickr, there is information in tags not present in a bookmark&#39;s title or description.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>On Delicious, the use of bookmarklets and extensions is the primary source of new bookmarks.  <ul>\n<li>These tools tend to produce a title based on the original bookmarked page and, when present, a description summarized from the page contents by way of highlighted text.</li>\n<li>With this in mind, consider that tags often make up the <strong>sole intentional contribution</strong> made to the bookmark by the person saving it.  <ul>\n<li>Beyond the choice to save the bookmark in the first place, that is.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Whereas on Flickr, the effort is spent on title and, sometimes, the description.  Beyond that point, tags are an afterthought, at best.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The user interface of tagging is near effortless versus, say, formal taxonomies or nested folders.  <ul>\n<li>Even the much-debated choice of the big, fat space bar as a delimiter supports minimal effort.</li>\n<li>Minimal effort lowers mental cost, which promotes more noise, but also encourages more input (or  any input) and thus more signal overall.</li>\n<li>People have limited attention span budgets from which useful metadata can be solicited.  Tagging lowers the budget requirement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The reason why I have generated a ratio of 1 new tag for every 2 bookmarks is that I use tags in a way akin to free association, made possible by the low cost of tagging.  <ul>\n<li><strong>This is a feature, not a bug.</strong></li>\n<li>I have many, many tags used only once and never again—some of them are, in fact, jokes.  </li>\n<li>But, I have generated some tags that I&#39;ve come to adopt more heavily, most of which proved surprisingly useful over months or years of recurrence.</li>\n<li>As for those tags I&#39;ve never used again: They cost nothing, can be hidden below visibility thresholds, and can be merged later into more appropriate tags if I care to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And, there&#39;s where I run out of steam.  For the conclusion, go back to the beginning of this entry.  Biased though I might be, I think Delicious is the place to study tagging, and there they&#39;re of great use.  This is where I think <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> misses the value, despite the volume of writing and data.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086340\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086340\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-18T07:40:08\">2009-01-18T07:40:08</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>In addition Flickr's tagging implementation has always been non-optimal because there is a 1-to-1-to-1 relationship of object (photo) - tag - tagger.

So at least you are in agreement on this.</p>\n<p>But let's dig a bit further what is she saying and what you are saying. I have too tagged a lot of stuff with another service similar to del.icio.us. The result is that no, it is not useful to find something quickly, and I would even go further that I don't even find my own stuff. What I do though on a regular basis is to reduce my own stuff by changing the tags for a set a of pages for example if there are économie, economie, economy, business, I might finally reduce it to one tag \"économie\". What I would really wish is that I could do a hierarchy of these. For example sometimes I tag Japan and Tokyo, what I wish is that in my own hierarchy when I tag Tokyo, the system assumed Japan.</p>\n<p>On Flickr it really depends on what we are looking for, but I'm using flickr for finding images for specific location and for specific creative commons licenses. In both cases, these metadata depends on an ontology (taxonomy, structured schemas, $ORGANIZATIONSYSTEM)</p>\n<p>geolocation… the ontology is the map, a well defined system where you can pinpoint an image somewhere and get the real lat/long values. </p>\n<p>licenses… a controlled vocabulary of different type of licenses.</p>\n<p>The debate is not about \"do tags suck\" but do they work? And indeed they are not really efficient compared to other methods. It's cool they exist, but they should not be here to justify that ontology sucks either. Every community which is in a need of achieving a specific repetitive task comes one day or the other to structured data organization.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086344\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.ethanhein.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4c0a6f9419c7bce70e889b6115e9bb77&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.ethanhein.com\">Ethan</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086344\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-19T02:33:33\">2009-01-19T02:33:33</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Very often, the suggested tags on a new Delicious post inspire my personal informational ontology.

I find tags on Delicious just as useful for finding <em>others'</em> bookmarks, too.</p>\n<p>I assume that many others use tags much like I do—especially the people bookmarking things I find interesting.  On Delicious, something akin to lightweight communities emerge based around bottom-up tags. </p>\n<p>I am no library scientist—but, if you've got a community with a collection to organize, I don't think you really need tags.  That community probably already has a notion of categories worth extracting in a more formal top-down process.  </p>\n<p>As for repeating the study, I probably won't be the person to do it.  But, for a quick example that I'd suggest is par for the course, take a look at <a href=\"http://delicious.com/url/125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd\" rel=\"nofollow\">the bookmarks for the article in question</a>.  </p>\n<p>Of the 18 bookmarks, 10 have notes. That page only shows the most common title, but I'd be surprised if any of the 18 have a title other than \"Do Tags Work?\"  That leaves the tags.  Of the top 10 tags, only one appears in the title (\"tags\").  The word \"folksonomy\" appears in none of the descriptions.  There's also \"socialsoftware\" used 3 times, which appears neither in title or description, nor in the original article itself.

Meaning tags work as intended, at least for me on Delicious.  I suspect they work for others too, since they keep tagging things in ways that I keep finding them.</p>\n<p>You wrote about another service, but I didn't—I'm writing about tags on Delicious.  I don't know what the thing they call tags looks like on that other unnamed service.  </p>\n<p>This is part of the reason behind my mild disdain for the term \"folksonomy\":  Delicious didn't introduce tagging to start a best practice for Web 2.0 at large—tagging was introduced as a site feature for Delicious.  Attempts to clone that feature elsewhere have been uneven in results, despite having had a term coined and a body of hype spun around it.</p>\n<p>Tagging is like a salt water fish that lots of people thought was pretty and they started trying to stick in fresh water tanks.  I don't think it thrives everywhere people have tried to stick it and not everyone who's tried to clone tagging has gotten all the important parts right.</p>\n<p>On Flickr, I've asserted that tags aren't that useful.  Machine tags like geo tags are a big exception though.  Otherwise, they have a wealth of other tools for finding things beyond tags, whereas on Delicious they're the only game in town.</p>\n<p>I guess my main point is this:  In my experience, tags work.  On Delicious.  Where they're largely agreed to have been cloned from.  Elsewhere, I think there have been transcription errors and misinterpretations that give the concept a dubious reputation. </p>\n<p>I'm not sure what you mean about tags being not really efficient compared to other methods.  Tags are a way to get people to provide metadata useful in emergent classification that would otherwise have not been supplied at all.  I think they're efficient at that.</p>\n<p>Many people just punt when faced with sorting a new resource into a formal category or folder structure.

    "body": "For the \"<a href=\"delicious.com/tag/tl;dr\">too long</a>; <a href=\"http://delicious.com/tag/tldr\">didn't read</a>\" crowd:\r\n\r\n* I've <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/deusx\">been using a lot of tags on Delicious</a> over a relatively long time, so they seem very useful to me.\r\n* Delicious encourages the use of tags through UI convention and tool usage patterns, whereas Flickr presents no particular bias toward collecting tags from users.\r\n* Since title and description attract more contribution effort from users on Flickr than on Delicious, it's natural that search over those fields will be more productive than for tags.\r\n* Search on Delicious doesn't have access to the complete text of the bookmarked resource, and often tags will contain information missing from the supplied title or description.\r\n* All told, tags on Delicious are more essential than tags on Flickr.\r\n* In conclusion, I think <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> misses the value of tags, as I know them, by focusing on Flickr.\r\n\r\nOf course, I don't really care what this means for folksonomy and the rest of Web 2.0—tags work for me on Delicious.  So, I suspect this means I'm not *entirely* opposed to the sentiment in <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a>, because I don't think tags work everywhere their use is attempted.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this entry elaborates on the above.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nFrom Cathy Marshall's <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a>:\r\n<blockquote>Have I convinced you that tags aren't all they've cracked up to be? I hope I have, but nonetheless there's a lingering fascination. Surely there's something to be done about tags: we don't want to just turn up our noses at Mr. Weinberger's argument.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFrom Mark Bernstein's <a href=\"http://www.markbernstein.org/Jan09/InTEKKATags.html\">In TEKKA: Tags</a>:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThe study could be repeated on more images, and in additional contexts. It might be bad luck. But if it’s a repeatable result — and I think we all know it is — then we’re going to have to rethink a lot of our Web 2.0 rhetoric. Folksonomy is an illusion.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFrom my <a href=\"http://delicious.com/url/125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd#item-125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd972759\">bookmark on Delicious</a>:\r\n<blockquote>If you can get past the rambling paragraphs of awkward fun-poking at tags interspersed with library science / web 2.0 / cultural references—as well as a discovery of what, you know, Flickr is all about—there's a well-embellished and obsessively-assembled statistical analysis of tags vs title vs notes in finding photos featuring tourist heel-spinning on the testicles of a bull mosaic in Milan. My impression is that she's missed the point of tags, but I'm having trouble reducing the impression to a critique.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt might be that I'm intimidated by the writing in <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> or by the fact that a lot of work was done to produce numbers I can't dispute.  Either way, I have neither the time to produce a counter-study nor the wherewithal to extract and refute points in that article with precision.  So, I'm just going to throw my impressions out there and hope they coalesce.\r\n\r\n* Tags are extremely useful to me.\r\n    * I've been using tags on Delicious since shortly after the site was created.  \r\n    * To date, <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/deusx\">I've saved 11825 bookmarks and spawned 6069 tags</a>.  (More on that ratio later.)  \r\n    * Tags have worked very well for me, both in later finding my own saved resources and in finding aggregates of others'.\r\n* Flickr is not the poster child of tagging—Delicious is.  \r\n    * On Flickr, I've found tags occasionally interesting, but not incredibly so.  More a curiosity than a killer feature, really.  (More on that in a bit, too.)\r\n    * To be honest, I've not found a great deal of use for tags around Web 2.0 properties beyond Delicious, folksonomy hype notwithstanding.  \r\n    * Fun fact: When I worked on Delicious, we disliked the term \"[folksonomy][]\" and tried never to use it in serious discussion.\r\n* The places where I've found tags useful are text-heavy, where the full text is either not indexed or not displayed in results when using search.\r\n    * Consider magazine articles or blog posts bookmarked on Delicious.\r\n    * Those bookmarks are subject to the character limits of title or description fields.  \r\n    * Far more often than on Flickr, there is information in tags not present in a bookmark's title or description.\r\n* On Delicious, the use of bookmarklets and extensions is the primary source of new bookmarks.  \r\n    * These tools tend to produce a title based on the original bookmarked page and, when present, a description summarized from the page contents by way of highlighted text.\r\n    * With this in mind, consider that tags often make up the **sole intentional contribution** made to the bookmark by the person saving it.  \r\n        * Beyond the choice to save the bookmark in the first place, that is.\r\n    * Whereas on Flickr, the effort is spent on title and, sometimes, the description.  Beyond that point, tags are an afterthought, at best.\r\n* The user interface of tagging is near effortless versus, say, formal taxonomies or nested folders.  \r\n    * Even the much-debated choice of the big, fat space bar as a delimiter supports minimal effort.\r\n    * Minimal effort lowers mental cost, which promotes more noise, but also encourages more input (or  any input) and thus more signal overall.\r\n    * People have limited attention span budgets from which useful metadata can be solicited.  Tagging lowers the budget requirement.\r\n* The reason why I have generated a ratio of 1 new tag for every 2 bookmarks is that I use tags in a way akin to free association, made possible by the low cost of tagging.  \r\n    * **This is a feature, not a bug.**\r\n    * I have many, many tags used only once and never again—some of them are, in fact, jokes.  \r\n    * But, I have generated some tags that I've come to adopt more heavily, most of which proved surprisingly useful over months or years of recurrence.\r\n    * As for those tags I've never used again: They cost nothing, can be hidden below visibility thresholds, and can be merged later into more appropriate tags if I care to do so.\r\n\r\nAnd, there's where I run out of steam.  For the conclusion, go back to the beginning of this entry.  Biased though I might be, I think Delicious is the place to study tagging, and there they're of great use.  This is where I think <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> misses the value, despite the volume of writing and data.\r\n\r\n[folksonomy]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086340\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086340\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-18T07:40:08\">2009-01-18T07:40:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>In addition Flickr's tagging implementation has always been non-optimal because there is a 1-to-1-to-1 relationship of object (photo) - tag - tagger.

So at least you are in agreement on this.</p>\n\n<p>But let's dig a bit further what is she saying and what you are saying. I have too tagged a lot of stuff with another service similar to del.icio.us. The result is that no, it is not useful to find something quickly, and I would even go further that I don't even find my own stuff. What I do though on a regular basis is to reduce my own stuff by changing the tags for a set a of pages for example if there are économie, economie, economy, business, I might finally reduce it to one tag \"économie\". What I would really wish is that I could do a hierarchy of these. For example sometimes I tag Japan and Tokyo, what I wish is that in my own hierarchy when I tag Tokyo, the system assumed Japan.</p>\n\n<p>On Flickr it really depends on what we are looking for, but I'm using flickr for finding images for specific location and for specific creative commons licenses. In both cases, these metadata depends on an ontology (taxonomy, structured schemas, $ORGANIZATIONSYSTEM)</p>\n\n<p>geolocation… the ontology is the map, a well defined system where you can pinpoint an image somewhere and get the real lat/long values. </p>\n\n<p>licenses… a controlled vocabulary of different type of licenses.</p>\n\n<p>The debate is not about \"do tags suck\" but do they work? And indeed they are not really efficient compared to other methods. It's cool they exist, but they should not be here to justify that ontology sucks either. Every community which is in a need of achieving a specific repetitive task comes one day or the other to structured data organization.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086344\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.ethanhein.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4c0a6f9419c7bce70e889b6115e9bb77&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.ethanhein.com\">Ethan</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086344\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-19T02:33:33\">2009-01-19T02:33:33</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Very often, the suggested tags on a new Delicious post inspire my personal informational ontology.

And if they would work for Delicious, someone somewhere is probably emulating them with specially-formed tags to varying degrees of success. Eventually we might have discovered those uses and wrapped a feature around them. (see also: for:* and system:media:*)</p>\n\n<p>Actually, one area where I think Flickr has done better with tagging is in machine tags.  There was some disagreement about that even on the Delicious team—pitting it against simplicity of tags—but I thought there was something there worth exploring.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086347\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086347\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-19T02:41:29\">2009-01-19T02:41:29</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@Mark: Not primarily as a personal mnemonic—I probably should have expanded more on the social aspects.  I find tags on Delicious just as useful for finding <em>others'</em> bookmarks, too.</p>\n\n<p>I assume that many others use tags much like I do—especially the people bookmarking things I find interesting.  On Delicious, something akin to lightweight communities emerge based around bottom-up tags. </p>\n\n<p>I am no library scientist—but, if you've got a community with a collection to organize, I don't think you really need tags.  That community probably already has a notion of categories worth extracting in a more formal top-down process.  </p>\n\n<p>As for repeating the study, I probably won't be the person to do it.  But, for a quick example that I'd suggest is par for the course, take a look at <a href=\"http://delicious.com/url/125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd\" rel=\"nofollow\">the bookmarks for the article in question</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Of the 18 bookmarks, 10 have notes. That page only shows the most common title, but I'd be surprised if any of the 18 have a title other than \"Do Tags Work?\"  That leaves the tags.  Of the top 10 tags, only one appears in the title (\"tags\").  The word \"folksonomy\" appears in none of the descriptions.  There's also \"socialsoftware\" used 3 times, which appears neither in title or description, nor in the original article itself.  I think this shows better use of tags than the example used from Flickr.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086348\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086348\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-19T03:12:10\">2009-01-19T03:12:10</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@karl: I wrote that tags are useful for finding both mine <em>and</em> others' bookmarks.  Meaning tags work as intended, at least for me on Delicious.  I suspect they work for others too, since they keep tagging things in ways that I keep finding them.</p>\n\n<p>You wrote about another service, but I didn't—I'm writing about tags on Delicious.  I don't know what the thing they call tags looks like on that other unnamed service.  </p>\n\n<p>This is part of the reason behind my mild disdain for the term \"folksonomy\":  Delicious didn't introduce tagging to start a best practice for Web 2.0 at large—tagging was introduced as a site feature for Delicious.  Attempts to clone that feature elsewhere have been uneven in results, despite having had a term coined and a body of hype spun around it.</p>\n\n<p>Tagging is like a salt water fish that lots of people thought was pretty and they started trying to stick in fresh water tanks.  I don't think it thrives everywhere people have tried to stick it and not everyone who's tried to clone tagging has gotten all the important parts right.</p>\n\n<p>On Flickr, I've asserted that tags aren't that useful.  Machine tags like geo tags are a big exception though.  Otherwise, they have a wealth of other tools for finding things beyond tags, whereas on Delicious they're the only game in town.</p>\n\n<p>I guess my main point is this:  In my experience, tags work.  On Delicious.  Where they're largely agreed to have been cloned from.  Elsewhere, I think there have been transcription errors and misinterpretations that give the concept a dubious reputation. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what you mean about tags being not really efficient compared to other methods.  Tags are a way to get people to provide metadata useful in emergent classification that would otherwise have not been supplied at all.  I think they're efficient at that.</p>\n\n<p>Many people just punt when faced with sorting a new resource into a formal category or folder structure.  I suppose that filters out all but the conscientious, leaving better quality results.

There's <a href=\"http://delicious.com/blech/tagging\" rel=\"nofollow\">my bookmarks tagged 'tagging'</a>, I suppose. I've only just noticed this has related tags- that's a nice touch I'd never really spotted.)</p>\n\n<p>On a side note, I love machine tags in Flickr, mainly because they're hidden from the user by default. (They've got a lot more useful now that there are specialised methods in the API, too.) I mused on Twitter last week that neither Delicious nor a third party has done anything with the loose convention of via: or cite: tags that some people use.

Single tags don't solve this and tagging in general kind of shrugs on the issue—though tag intersections involving many tags help disambiguate intended meaning.

For instance, I wouldn't tag this with \"tags\" but instead with \"tagging debate\", \"tagging meta\", or similar. That would allow a visitor to this site to find every similar discussion. The \"tags\" tag might include a lot of things that someone wasn't looking for, such as a comparison of tagging services.</p>\n\n<p>This could also be tagged with the name of the person who wrote the link so the visitors could find discussions involving that person.</p>\n\n<p>For how I do things, my tag cloud is at my name's link.</p>\n\n<p>Note the tags with [name topic], such as \"obama cabinet\". Anyone who sees that should realize right away what it involves. And, someone looking for specific Obama information can scan the tags starting with his name for subtopics. Note also the tags about themes, such as \"mean spirited\", which refers to an \"argument\" some people make. And, click a tag like \"bill richardson\" to see how I make some sense of large numbers of posts: many of the lists with a large number of posts are preceded by a summary linking to individual posts.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: that doesn't represent all the content at my site because I switched from MT to Drupal a couple months ago and only a fraction of thousands of posts is tagged. There are also a few hundred tags that aren't shown; I need to figure out how to show lots of tags.)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

    "html": "<p>After writing up my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/09/01/writing-a-delicious-command-for-ubiquity\">first stab at a Delicious command for Ubiquity</a>, I planned to continue revising it based on feedback and to work on exploring more of what Ubiquity enables.  I started looking into writing my own nouns for tag suggestions, as well as playing with page load and browser startup hooks.  And, I also started poking at a little bit of deeper extension development, which took up most of my time today.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/UbiquityCommands/\">updated my UbiquityCommands</a> page and checked in my latest revision of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/hgwebdir.cgi/UbiquityCommands/file/tip/delicious.ubiq.js\">the Delicious command</a>.  </p>\n<p>The main new feature is a status bar item reporting bookmarks for the current page:</p>\n<p><img style=\"padding: 0.25em\" src=\"http://decafbad.com/2008/ubiq-del-status.jpg\" />&nbsp;<img style=\"padding: 0.25em\" src=\"http://decafbad.com/2008/ubiq-del-tip.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see above, the command now comes with a status bar panel powered by the <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/feeds\">Delicious URL info JSON feed</a>, providing bookmarking info on every page visited.  It shows a bookmark count, a tooltip with further information, and sends the user to the URL info page on Delicious when clicked.  It mostly works, but it could use some looking at.  This is my first time really cracking open the hood on Firefox and XUL, and so I&#39;m feeling around in the dark.</p>\n<p>Specifically, I&#39;m using Ubiquity&#39;s page load hook—but I&#39;m also trying to augment that by tracking tab selection events, in order to keep the status bar info updated for the active tab.  But then, that leads me to trying to track new windows, to attach the tab selection event handler for every newly opened window.  Or I could just be barking up the wrong tree entirely.  At any rate, the code is probably brain-dead dumb, so I hope someone can clue me into a better way.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088289\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ef1b5a29836fa211b938d8ccbbd3e0a1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/\">Gen Kanai</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088289\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-07T08:10:39\">2008-09-07T08:10:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Les, you may want to let R/RW know about your new command.</p>\n<p>http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_ultimate_list_of_custom_ubiquity_verbs.php</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088292\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://abcdefu.wordpress.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=af8b180d6d4092fb42fe6b5e0b21536c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://abcdefu.wordpress.com/\">Abimanyu Raja</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088292\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-07T08:55:52\">2008-09-07T08:55:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I disagree...

    "body": "After writing up my [first stab at a Delicious command for Ubiquity][first], I planned to continue revising it based on feedback and to work on exploring more of what Ubiquity enables.  I started looking into writing my own nouns for tag suggestions, as well as playing with page load and browser startup hooks.  And, I also started poking at a little bit of deeper extension development, which took up most of my time today.\r\n\r\nI've [updated my UbiquityCommands][ub] page and checked in my latest revision of [the Delicious command][cmd].  \r\n\r\nThe main new feature is a status bar item reporting bookmarks for the current page:\r\n\r\n<img style=\"padding: 0.25em\" src=\"http://decafbad.com/2008/ubiq-del-status.jpg\" />&nbsp;<img style=\"padding: 0.25em\" src=\"http://decafbad.com/2008/ubiq-del-tip.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nAs you can see above, the command now comes with a status bar panel powered by the [Delicious URL info JSON feed][urlinfo], providing bookmarking info on every page visited.  It shows a bookmark count, a tooltip with further information, and sends the user to the URL info page on Delicious when clicked.  It mostly works, but it could use some looking at.  This is my first time really cracking open the hood on Firefox and XUL, and so I'm feeling around in the dark.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'm using Ubiquity's page load hook—but I'm also trying to augment that by tracking tab selection events, in order to keep the status bar info updated for the active tab.  But then, that leads me to trying to track new windows, to attach the tab selection event handler for every newly opened window.  Or I could just be barking up the wrong tree entirely.  At any rate, the code is probably brain-dead dumb, so I hope someone can clue me into a better way.\r\n\r\n[urlinfo]: http://delicious.com/help/feeds\r\n[cmd]: http://decafbad.com/hgwebdir.cgi/UbiquityCommands/file/tip/delicious.ubiq.js\r\n[ub]: http://decafbad.com/UbiquityCommands/\r\n[first]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/09/01/writing-a-delicious-command-for-ubiquity\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088289\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ef1b5a29836fa211b938d8ccbbd3e0a1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/\">Gen Kanai</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088289\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-07T08:10:39\">2008-09-07T08:10:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Les, you may want to let R/RW know about your new command.</p>\n\n<p>http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_ultimate_list_of_custom_ubiquity_verbs.php</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088292\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://abcdefu.wordpress.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=af8b180d6d4092fb42fe6b5e0b21536c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://abcdefu.wordpress.com/\">Abimanyu Raja</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088292\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-07T08:55:52\">2008-09-07T08:55:52</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I disagree...

But, how that I think about it I wonder if I should make those work together.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088314\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://FromTheGut.us\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3be27db3db50892929ef892ab04621a4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://FromTheGut.us\">Frank</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088314\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-09T17:40:39\">2008-09-09T17:40:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hello, </p>\n\n<p>I was wondering if there was any chance you could put together a post annotating/explaining the changes/additions to your improved Delicious command.

    "html": "<p>In my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/08/31/ubiquity-cracks-open-personal-mashup-tinkering\" title=\"Ubiquity cracks open personal mashup tinkering\">last post</a>, I got all fluffy about how cool <a href=\"http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/\">Ubiquity</a> is but didn&#39;t share any code to prove the point.  As it happens, I have come up with at least one useful command that I&#39;m starting to use habitually in posting bookmarks to Delicious.  You can <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/UbiquityCommands/\">subscribe to my command</a> or <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/hg/UbiquityCommands/file/tip/delicious.ubiq.js\">check out the full source</a>—this post will serve as a dissection of the thing.  Since this will be fairly lengthy, follow along after the jump.</p>\n<p>Oh, and it&#39;s been awhile since I posted something this in-depth around here, so feel free to let me know how this first draft works.  And, bug reports and patches are of course welcome.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>To begin, consider the following code starting off the command source code:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\n/**\n * share-on-delicious - an Ubiquity command for sharing bookmarks on\n * delicious.com\n *\n * l.m.orchard@pobox.com\n * http://decafbad.com/\n * Share and Enjoy!\n */\nvar uext = Application.extensions.get('ubiquity@labs.mozilla.com');\n\nvar cookie_mgr = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/cookiemanager;1\"]\n    .getService(Components.interfaces.nsICookieManager);\n</pre>\n\n<p>The first thing to note here is that a short header comment introduces the command.  This isn&#39;t required, but it&#39;s a good idea.  It&#39;s also something you can&#39;t really do with bookmarklets.  On the other hand, Greasemonkey user scripts expect metadata about the script to be provided here, but Ubiquity doesn&#39;t use this convention.</p>\n<p>Second, notice that the code accesses some chrome-level resources.  Again, this is something unavailable to bookmarklets and Greasemonkey user scripts.  Just take a look at the <a href=\"http://developer.mozilla.org/en/FUEL\">FUEL library documentation</a> to get a quick sense of what&#39;s available using that simplified API, not to mention what&#39;s available using the lower-level browser APIs.</p>\n<p>Now, check out this next chunk of code, which begins the construction of an Ubiquity command:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"13\">\nCmdUtils.CreateCommand({\n\n    name:        \n        'share-on-delicious',\n    icon:\n        'http://delicious.com/favicon.ico',\n    description: \n        'Share the current page as a bookmark on delicious.com',\n    help:        \n        'Select text on the page to use as notes, or enter your own ' + \n        'text after the command word.  You can also assign tags to the '+ \n        'bookmark with the \"tagged\" modifier, and alter the bookmark ' + \n        'default page title with the \"entitled\" modifier.  Note that ' + \n        'you must also already be logged in at delicious.com to use ' +\n        'this command.',\n\n    homepage:   \n        'http://decafbad.com',\n    author: { \n        name: 'Leslie Michael Orchard', \n        email: 'l.m.orchard@pobox.com' \n    },\n    license:\n        'MPL/GPL/LGPL',\n</pre>\n\n<p>Whereas Greasemonkey scripts support metadata in the header comment, the Ubiquity command script API works a little differently.  </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hg.toolness.com/ubiquity-firefox/file/tip/ubiquity/chrome/content/cmdutils.js\"><code>CmdUtils</code> module</a> provided by Ubiquity offers a <code>CreateCommand</code> function, which expects an object as a parameter.  The object literal whose construction is begun in the code above serves as a self-contained package for the command, bearing metadata describing the command as well as containing all the code necessary to implement it.</p>\n<p>So, in the above code block, you can see the machine-readable description of the command—including a command name, display icon, home page URL, author information, and license.  The command name (<code>share-on-delicious</code>) will be used by the Ubiquity command parser, but the rest of the description will also be used in the list of commands available to the user, invoked by the <code>command-list</code> command, like so:</p>\n<img src=\"/2008/ubiq-share-on-delicious-list.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333; margin: 0.25em; padding: 0.25em\" />\n\n<p>Moving along, this next chunk of code introduces the first functional bits of the command:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"37\">\n    takes: { notes: noun_arb_text },\n    modifiers: { \n        tagged:  noun_arb_text,\n        entitled: noun_arb_text\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>Like smart keyword shortcut bookmarks, Ubiquity commands accept user-supplied input.  But, what&#39;s unique to Ubiquity is that it employs a parser whose goal is to support something approximating natural language.  At present, this results in commands that support a single primary argument—declared above with the <code>takes</code> property—and any number of additional keyword modifiers—declared above by the <code>modifiers</code> property.</p>\n<p>For the command under construction here, this establishes a pattern something like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>share-on-delicious {notes} [tagged {tags} entitled {title}]</code></pre>\n<p>Content for the <code>{notes}</code> argument can either be typed directly by hand, or it can be supplied by text highlighted on the page.  To use highlighted text, you can either issue the command alone, or use the word <code>this</code> for the <code>{notes}</code> argument before including further modifiers.</p>\n<p>The modifiers <code>tagged</code> and <code>entitled</code> are optional, and can be used in any order.  Each of these keywords signifies the start of a different argument—which unfortunately can collide with the literal data supplied for notes, which will hopefully be a rare occurrence.</p>\n<p>All of this adds up command invocations including the following:</p>\n<pre><code>share-on-delicious\nshare-on-delicious I really like this page tagged nifty amusing\nshare-on-delicious this entitled This bookmark has no tags\nsh this tagged osx software apple entitled This is good OS X software</code></pre>\n<p>That last example is important—since I have no other commands starting with &quot;<code>sh</code>&quot;, I can abbreviate the full command.  Ubiquity only requires enough of a command name to disambiguate it within your collection of commands.</p>\n<p>Another thing to note is the use of the constant value <code>noun_arb_text</code>, which declares that these arguments should expect any arbitrary text as input.  </p>\n<p>This facility is not exploited for the present command, but Ubiquity defines <a href=\"http://hg.toolness.com/ubiquity-firefox/file/tip/ubiquity/chrome/content/nlparser/en/nountypes.js\">noun types</a>.  These include concepts such as plain text, dates, address book contacts, browser tabs, bookmark tags, and more.  You can define your own noun types, as well as implement suggestion schemes that help guide the user toward constructing useful input values in the command interface.  You can <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1_Author_Tutorial#Introduction_to_Noun_Types\">read more about this</a> in the official author tutorial.</p>\n<p>Next up is a quick bit of command-specific configuration:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"42\">\n    /**\n     * Command configuration settings.\n     */\n    _config: {\n        // Base URL for the delicious v1 API\n        api_base:      'https://api.del.icio.us',\n\n        // Domain and name of the delicious login session cookie.\n        cookie_domain: '.delicious.com',\n        cookie_name:   '_user'\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>Since this command will be posting to Delicious via the V1 API, it&#39;s handy to declare the base URL for the API in an easily changed spot.  That way, you could change this value later on to point the command at another implementation of the API.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this command will employ a little-known authentication trick supported by the Delicious API that accepts the user&#39;s login cookie set by the Delicious website—this &quot;cookie god&quot; auth is used by the official Delicious addon for Firefox.  It&#39;s handy for piggybacking on the website login and removing the need to ask the user for their username and password again and possibly storing it in an insecure manner.</p>\n<p>In fact, this next chunk of code defines a utility method to rummage through the cookie jar:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"53\">\n    /**\n     * Dig up the Delicious login session cookie.\n     */\n    _getUserCookie: function() {\n        var iter = cookie_mgr.enumerator;\n        while (iter.hasMoreElements()) {\n            var cookie = iter.getNext();\n            if( cookie instanceof Components.interfaces.nsICookie && \n                cookie.host.indexOf(this._config.cookie_domain) != -1 && \n                cookie.name == this._config.cookie_name) {\n                return decodeURIComponent(cookie.value);\n            }\n        }\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>The method defined above, <code>._getUserCookie()</code>, uses the browser&#39;s cookie manager and the values defined in the previous configuration section to find the login session cookie set for Delicious.  Take note that this is far beyond the allowed capabilities of bookmarklets and Greasemoney user scripts—this is digging straight into the browser itself, skipping past the usual content-space security restrictions.  </p>\n<p>In other words: In Ubiquity, <em>the gun is loaded</em> and you should be careful.  </p>\n<p>Moving along, consider this next utility method:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"67\">\n    /**\n     * Given input data and modifiers, attempt to assemble data necessary to\n     * post a bookmark.\n     */\n    _extractBookmarkData: function(input_obj, mods) {\n        return {\n            _user:\n                this._getUserCookie(),\n            url:\n                context.focusedWindow.location,\n            description:\n                mods.entitled.text || context.focusedWindow.document.title,\n            extended: \n                input_obj.text,\n            tags:\n                mods.tagged.text\n        };\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>Named <code>._extractBookmarkData()</code>, this utility method accepts the results of Ubiquity&#39;s parser interpreting the primary argument and modifier arguments supplied by the user.  Using these data structures, it attempts to build a structure representing the fields of a Delicious bookmark.</p>\n<p>The <code>_user</code> field is used for authentication via the site login cookie.  The <code>url</code> is set from the location bar of the current page.  The <code>description</code>, or title, field of the bookmark is taken from either the <code>entitled</code> modifier or the title of the current page.  The <code>tags</code>, if any, come from the <code>tagged</code> modifier.  And, finally, the <code>extended</code> notes for the bookmark are taken from the primary input argument of the command.</p>\n<p>As you&#39;ll see shortly, this utility method will be used in both the preview and the execution of the command.</p>\n<p>Next, there&#39;s one more utility method to cover:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"85\">\n    /**\n     * Given an object, build a URL query string\n     */\n    _buildQueryString: function(data) {\n        var qs = [];\n        for (k in data) if (data[k]) \n            qs.push( encodeURIComponent(k) + '=' + \n                encodeURIComponent(data[k]) );\n        return qs.join('&');\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>In anticipation of using the Delicious V1 API, the <code>._buildQueryString()</code> method accepts an object and constructs a URL query string from the encoded properties of the object.  This will be paired with the <code>._extractBookmarkData()</code> method to supply data for API calls.</p>\n<p>Moving along, it&#39;s time to start digging into the meat of this Ubiquity command:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"95\">\n    /**\n     * Present a preview of the bookmark under construction during the course\n     * of composing the command.\n     */\n    preview: function(pblock, input_obj, mods) {\n\n        var bm          = this._extractBookmarkData(input_obj, mods);\n        var user_cookie = this._getUserCookie();\n        var user_name   = (user_cookie) ? user_cookie.split(' ')[0] : '';\n\n        var ns = { user_name: user_name, bm: bm };\n        var tmpl;\n</pre>\n\n<p>With this code, the implementation of command method <code>.preview()</code> has begun.  This method is used by Ubiquity to generate a live preview of the command.  Called with a DOM node (<code>pblock</code>) and partially completed command input (<code>input_obj</code> and <code>mods</code>), this method is expected to build a representation of the command&#39;s results in the DOM node.  As the user types, this method will be called over and over again, ideally offering feedback as the user composes a command.</p>\n<p>Continuing on, consider this next chunk of code checking the validity of command input:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"107\">\n        if (!user_name) {\n\n            // If there's no user name, there's no login, so this command won't work. \n            tmpl = [ \n                '<p style=\"color: #d44\">No active user found - log in at ', \n                '<img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\n                '<b><a style=\"color: #3774D0\" href=\"http://delicious.com\">delicious.com</a></b> ', \n                'to use this command.</p>'\n            ].join('');\n\n        } else if (!bm.description) {\n\n            // If there's no title, then this is an error too.\n            tmpl = [ \n                '<p style=\"color: #d44\">A title is required for bookmarks on ', \n                '<img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\n                '<b><a style=\"color: #3774D0\" href=\"http://delicious.com\">delicious.com</a></b> ', \n                '</p>'\n            ].join('');\n</pre>\n\n<p>This chunk of code first checks for a user name, which can be extracted from a valid Delicious login cookie, if one was found.  If not found, the command will fail—so the preview built here will instruct the user to login at Delicious before going further.</p>\n<p>The second precondition for using the command is that the bookmark has been given a title.  By default, this is the title of the current page—but, some pages don&#39;t offer titles.  So, an error needs to be flagged if the user hasn&#39;t manually supplied a title in this case.</p>\n<p>Finally, notice in both of these error cases, a string of HTML is composed in the variable <code>tmpl</code>.  This will be used at the end of the method to populate the DOM node passed in as <code>pblock</code>.</p>\n<p>Now, assuming that all the command&#39;s prerequisites have been met, it&#39;s time to try constructing a proper preview for the results of this command: </p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"126\">\n        } else {\n\n            // Attempt to construct a vaguely delicious-esque preview of a bookmark.\n            tmpl = [ \n                '<style type=\"text/css\">',\n                    '.preview a { color: #3774D0 }',\n                    '.del-bookmark { font: 12px arial; color: #ddd; background: #eee; line-height: 1.25em }',\n                    '.del-bookmark a.title { color: #1259C7 }',\n                    '.del-bookmark .full-url { color: #396C9B; font-size: 12px; display: block; padding: 0.25em 0 }',\n                    '.del-bookmark .notes { color: #4D4D4D }',\n                    '.del-bookmark .tags { color: #787878; padding-top: 0.25em; text-align: right }',\n                '</style>',\n                '<div class=\"preview\">',\n                    '<p>Share a bookmark at <img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\n                        '<b><a href=\"http://delicious.com/${user_name}\">delicious.com/${user_name}</a></b>:</p>',\n                    '<div class=\"del-bookmark\">',\n                        '<div style=\"padding: 1em;\">',\n                        '<a class=\"title\" href=\"${bm.url}\">${bm.description}</a>',\n                        '<a class=\"full-url\" href=\"${bm.url}\">${bm.url}</a>',\n                        bm.extended ? \n                            '<div class=\"notes\">${bm.extended}</div>' : '',\n                        bm.tags ?\n                            '<div class=\"tags\"><span>tags:</span> ${bm.tags}</div>' : '',\n                    '</div>',\n                '</div>'\n            ].join(\"\\n\");\n\n        }\n\n        pblock.innerHTML = CmdUtils.renderTemplate(tmpl, ns);\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>Building on the notion that previews are built in a DOM node, the code above uses both CSS and HTML to assemble a quick-and-dirty facsimile of a Delicious bookmark—which will be rendered like this:</p>\n<img src=\"/2008/ubiq-share-on-delicious-preview.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333; margin: 0.25em; padding: 0.25em\" />\n\n<p>Also note that Ubiquity provides a template engine for use in generating content—namely the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/JavaScriptTemplates\">JavaScript Templates</a> engine from the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/TrimPath\">TrimPath</a> project.  This engine may eventually be replaced with another, but the notion is that Ubiquity will provide tools to more easily generate previews and more.</p>\n<p>The conclusion of the <code>.preview()</code> method uses the template engine with a call to <code>CmdUtils.renderTemplate()</code> to inject content into the preview element by way of the <code>.innerHTML</code> property.</p>\n<p>Now that the preview is out of the way, it&#39;s time to get down to implementing the execution of the command:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"157\">    \n    /**\n     * Attempt to use the delicious v1 API to post a bookmark using the \n     * command input\n     */\n    execute: function(input_obj, mods) {\n        var bm          = this._extractBookmarkData(input_obj, mods);\n        var user_cookie = this._getUserCookie();\n        var user_name   = (user_cookie) ? user_cookie.split(' ')[0] : '';\n\n        if (!user_name) {\n            // If there's no user name, there's no login, so this command won't work. \n            displayMessage('No active user found - log in at delicious.com ' +\n                'to use this command.');\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        if (!bm.description) {\n            // If there's no title, somehow, then this is an error too.\n            displayMessage(\"A title is required for bookmarks at delicious.com\");\n            return false;\n        }\n</pre>\n\n<p>Mirroring the <code>.preview()</code> method, the <code>.execute()</code> method first checks for validity of the arguments given by the user.  A missing user name or title result in a notification that the command has failed.</p>\n<p>But, if the arguments are all valid, it&#39;s time to actually issue a request to the Delicious V1 API:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"178\">\n        var path = '/v1/posts/add';\n        var url  = this._config.api_base + path;\n\n        var req = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/xmlextras/xmlhttprequest;1\"].\n            createInstance();\n\n        req.open('POST', url, true);\n\n        req.onload = function(ev) { \n            displayMessage('Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n                'shared at delicious.com/' + user_name);\n        }\n\n        req.onerror = function(ev) { \n            displayMessage('ERROR: Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n                ' NOT shared on delicious.com/' + user_name);\n        }\n</pre>\n\n<p>Using the base URL for the Delicious API declared earlier in the configuration section, the <code>.execute()</code> method constructs an API URL for the <code>/v1/posts/add</code> method.  Then, it creates an instance of <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> from the browser to be used in sending the API request.  Event handlers are registered with the object to present notifications to the user indicating whether or not the API request was successful.</p>\n<p>At long last, it&#39;s time to wrap up this method and make the API request:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"195\">\n        req.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Basic Y29va2llOmNvb2tpZQ=='); // btoa('cookie:cookie')\n\n        var mediator = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/appshell/window-mediator;1\"].\n            getService(Components.interfaces.nsIWindowMediator);\n        var win = mediator.getMostRecentWindow(null);\n        var user_agent = win.navigator.userAgent + \";Ubiquity-share-on-delicious\";\n\n        req.setRequestHeader(\"User-Agent\", user_agent);      \n\n        req.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');\n        req.send(this._buildQueryString(bm));\n    },\n\n    EOF:null // I hate trailing commas\n});\n</pre>\n\n<p>The login cookie authentication supported by the Delicious V1 API is triggered by supplying a user name / password pair of <code>cookie</code>, which is done by setting the <code>Authorization</code> request header.  The login cookie is then expected to be passed in as the POST variable <code>_user</code>, which is done in the <code>._extractBookmarkData()</code> utility method.</p>\n<p>Another bit here that shows more access of browser resources is the construction of a unique User-Agent header for this API call based on the browser&#39;s own User-Agent string, something that&#39;s suggested in the guidelines for using the Delicious API.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <code>.execute()</code> method—and the command itself—is wrapped up with by sending off the bookmark data encoded as POST form variables with the <code>._buildQueryString()</code> utility method.</p>\n<p>And, that&#39;s it—a command-driven Delicious browser extension in a little over 200 lines of code.  There&#39;s still more to be done to really make this thing full-featured, but I think this shows off the basic features of Ubiquity.  I&#39;m hoping to dig in deeper and explore further, taking a look at running Greasemonkey-style code at <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1_Author_Tutorial#Running_on_page_load_and_startup\">browser startup and page load</a>, as well as playing with some more browser chrome features.  </p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085986\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0a9ab4b71ce193e98b7284ca257e327&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\">Jason Clark</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085986\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-01T14:47:35\">2008-09-01T14:47:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>First off-  fantastic post.  Great to see a lengthy post here again, although I'm one to talk.  This is an excellent introduction to Ubiquity command development, and tres useful to boot.</p>\n<p>I'm wondering why you chose to construct and post the XMLHttpRequest manually instead of using jQuery, which is included with Ubiquity.  I don't know that there's any benefit other than some simplicity, but I took a crack at converting your code to use jQuery, which works nicely.  In the 'execute' function, replace everything after \"var url  = this._config.api_base + path;\" with this (hope code blocks work in comments):</p>\n<p><code>\nvar win = context.focusedWindow;\nvar user_agent = win.navigator.userAgent + \";Ubiquity-share-on-delicious\";</code></p>\n<pre><code>    jQuery.ajax({\ntype: \"POST\",\nurl: url,\ndata: this._buildQueryString(bm),\nusername: \"cookie\",\npassword: \"cookie\",\nbeforeSend: function( req ) {\nreq.setRequestHeader(\"User-Agent\", user_agent); \n},\nerror: function() {\ndisplayMessage('ERROR: Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n' NOT shared on delicious.com/' + user_name);\n},\nsuccess: function() {\ndisplayMessage('Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n'shared at delicious.com/' + user_name);\n},\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, with both versions of the code, I'm seeing some unexpected behavior around authentication.  Assume I'm logged in to delicious, with \"stay logged in\" checked, and I restart my browser.  Trying to post with the command fails with a 401 unauthorized, even though I can see the cookie was sent (via Live HTTP Headers extension).  Going to delicious.com shows me logged in, and once I've viewed the site, the command works.  Except that now I can't reproduce; but I know it happened because I've got the headers.  At any rate, it is working nicely, but the previous failure is bugging me... feel like I'm overlooking something.  </p>\n<p>Thanks again for an awesome post.  Hope to see more of the same.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085988\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e799a79441c7543be48562403411cd13&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Ryan Scott Scheel</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085988\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-01T15:07:01\">2008-09-01T15:07:01</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>You should be helping with the documentation, if you aren't already.

    "body": "In my [last post][last], I got all fluffy about how cool [Ubiquity][] is but didn't share any code to prove the point.  As it happens, I have come up with at least one useful command that I'm starting to use habitually in posting bookmarks to Delicious.  You can [subscribe to my command][subs] or [check out the full source][source]—this post will serve as a dissection of the thing.  Since this will be fairly lengthy, follow along after the jump.\r\n\r\nOh, and it's been awhile since I posted something this in-depth around here, so feel free to let me know how this first draft works.  And, bug reports and patches are of course welcome.\r\n\r\n[ubiquity]: http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/\r\n[last]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/08/31/ubiquity-cracks-open-personal-mashup-tinkering \"Ubiquity cracks open personal mashup tinkering\"\r\n[subs]: http://decafbad.com/UbiquityCommands/\r\n[source]: http://decafbad.com/hg/UbiquityCommands/file/tip/delicious.ubiq.js\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nTo begin, consider the following code starting off the command source code:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\n/**\r\n * share-on-delicious - an Ubiquity command for sharing bookmarks on\r\n * delicious.com\r\n *\r\n * l.m.orchard@pobox.com\r\n * http://decafbad.com/\r\n * Share and Enjoy!\r\n */\r\nvar uext = Application.extensions.get('ubiquity@labs.mozilla.com');\r\n\r\nvar cookie_mgr = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/cookiemanager;1\"]\r\n    .getService(Components.interfaces.nsICookieManager);\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe first thing to note here is that a short header comment introduces the command.  This isn't required, but it's a good idea.  It's also something you can't really do with bookmarklets.  On the other hand, Greasemonkey user scripts expect metadata about the script to be provided here, but Ubiquity doesn't use this convention.\r\n\r\nSecond, notice that the code accesses some chrome-level resources.  Again, this is something unavailable to bookmarklets and Greasemonkey user scripts.  Just take a look at the [FUEL library documentation][fuel] to get a quick sense of what's available using that simplified API, not to mention what's available using the lower-level browser APIs.\r\n\r\n[fuel]: http://developer.mozilla.org/en/FUEL\r\n\r\nNow, check out this next chunk of code, which begins the construction of an Ubiquity command:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"13\">\r\nCmdUtils.CreateCommand({\r\n    \r\n    name:        \r\n        'share-on-delicious',\r\n    icon:\r\n        'http://delicious.com/favicon.ico',\r\n    description: \r\n        'Share the current page as a bookmark on delicious.com',\r\n    help:        \r\n        'Select text on the page to use as notes, or enter your own ' + \r\n        'text after the command word.  You can also assign tags to the '+ \r\n        'bookmark with the \"tagged\" modifier, and alter the bookmark ' + \r\n        'default page title with the \"entitled\" modifier.  Note that ' + \r\n        'you must also already be logged in at delicious.com to use ' +\r\n        'this command.',\r\n\r\n    homepage:   \r\n        'http://decafbad.com',\r\n    author: { \r\n        name: 'Leslie Michael Orchard', \r\n        email: 'l.m.orchard@pobox.com' \r\n    },\r\n    license:\r\n        'MPL/GPL/LGPL',\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nWhereas Greasemonkey scripts support metadata in the header comment, the Ubiquity command script API works a little differently.  \r\n\r\nThe [`CmdUtils` module][cmdutils] provided by Ubiquity offers a `CreateCommand` function, which expects an object as a parameter.  The object literal whose construction is begun in the code above serves as a self-contained package for the command, bearing metadata describing the command as well as containing all the code necessary to implement it.\r\n\r\nSo, in the above code block, you can see the machine-readable description of the command—including a command name, display icon, home page URL, author information, and license.  The command name (`share-on-delicious`) will be used by the Ubiquity command parser, but the rest of the description will also be used in the list of commands available to the user, invoked by the `command-list` command, like so:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/2008/ubiq-share-on-delicious-list.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333; margin: 0.25em; padding: 0.25em\" />\r\n\r\n[cmdutils]: http://hg.toolness.com/ubiquity-firefox/file/tip/ubiquity/chrome/content/cmdutils.js\r\n\r\nMoving along, this next chunk of code introduces the first functional bits of the command:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"37\">\r\n    takes: { notes: noun_arb_text },\r\n    modifiers: { \r\n        tagged:  noun_arb_text,\r\n        entitled: noun_arb_text\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nLike smart keyword shortcut bookmarks, Ubiquity commands accept user-supplied input.  But, what's unique to Ubiquity is that it employs a parser whose goal is to support something approximating natural language.  At present, this results in commands that support a single primary argument—declared above with the `takes` property—and any number of additional keyword modifiers—declared above by the `modifiers` property.\r\n\r\nFor the command under construction here, this establishes a pattern something like the following:\r\n\r\n    share-on-delicious {notes} [tagged {tags} entitled {title}]\r\n\r\nContent for the `{notes}` argument can either be typed directly by hand, or it can be supplied by text highlighted on the page.  To use highlighted text, you can either issue the command alone, or use the word `this` for the `{notes}` argument before including further modifiers.\r\n\r\nThe modifiers `tagged` and `entitled` are optional, and can be used in any order.  Each of these keywords signifies the start of a different argument—which unfortunately can collide with the literal data supplied for notes, which will hopefully be a rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nAll of this adds up command invocations including the following:\r\n\r\n    share-on-delicious\r\n    share-on-delicious I really like this page tagged nifty amusing\r\n    share-on-delicious this entitled This bookmark has no tags\r\n    sh this tagged osx software apple entitled This is good OS X software\r\n\r\nThat last example is important—since I have no other commands starting with \"`sh`\", I can abbreviate the full command.  Ubiquity only requires enough of a command name to disambiguate it within your collection of commands.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is the use of the constant value `noun_arb_text`, which declares that these arguments should expect any arbitrary text as input.  \r\n\r\nThis facility is not exploited for the present command, but Ubiquity defines [noun types][noun].  These include concepts such as plain text, dates, address book contacts, browser tabs, bookmark tags, and more.  You can define your own noun types, as well as implement suggestion schemes that help guide the user toward constructing useful input values in the command interface.  You can [read more about this][noun_tut] in the official author tutorial.\r\n\r\n[noun]: http://hg.toolness.com/ubiquity-firefox/file/tip/ubiquity/chrome/content/nlparser/en/nountypes.js\r\n[noun_tut]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1_Author_Tutorial#Introduction_to_Noun_Types\r\n\r\nNext up is a quick bit of command-specific configuration:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"42\">\r\n    /**\r\n     * Command configuration settings.\r\n     */\r\n    _config: {\r\n        // Base URL for the delicious v1 API\r\n        api_base:      'https://api.del.icio.us',\r\n\r\n        // Domain and name of the delicious login session cookie.\r\n        cookie_domain: '.delicious.com',\r\n        cookie_name:   '_user'\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nSince this command will be posting to Delicious via the V1 API, it's handy to declare the base URL for the API in an easily changed spot.  That way, you could change this value later on to point the command at another implementation of the API.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this command will employ a little-known authentication trick supported by the Delicious API that accepts the user's login cookie set by the Delicious website—this \"cookie god\" auth is used by the official Delicious addon for Firefox.  It's handy for piggybacking on the website login and removing the need to ask the user for their username and password again and possibly storing it in an insecure manner.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this next chunk of code defines a utility method to rummage through the cookie jar:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"53\">\r\n    /**\r\n     * Dig up the Delicious login session cookie.\r\n     */\r\n    _getUserCookie: function() {\r\n        var iter = cookie_mgr.enumerator;\r\n        while (iter.hasMoreElements()) {\r\n            var cookie = iter.getNext();\r\n            if( cookie instanceof Components.interfaces.nsICookie && \r\n                cookie.host.indexOf(this._config.cookie_domain) != -1 && \r\n                cookie.name == this._config.cookie_name) {\r\n                return decodeURIComponent(cookie.value);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe method defined above, `._getUserCookie()`, uses the browser's cookie manager and the values defined in the previous configuration section to find the login session cookie set for Delicious.  Take note that this is far beyond the allowed capabilities of bookmarklets and Greasemoney user scripts—this is digging straight into the browser itself, skipping past the usual content-space security restrictions.  \r\n\r\nIn other words: In Ubiquity, *the gun is loaded* and you should be careful.  \r\n\r\nMoving along, consider this next utility method:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"67\">\r\n    /**\r\n     * Given input data and modifiers, attempt to assemble data necessary to\r\n     * post a bookmark.\r\n     */\r\n    _extractBookmarkData: function(input_obj, mods) {\r\n        return {\r\n            _user:\r\n                this._getUserCookie(),\r\n            url:\r\n                context.focusedWindow.location,\r\n            description:\r\n                mods.entitled.text || context.focusedWindow.document.title,\r\n            extended: \r\n                input_obj.text,\r\n            tags:\r\n                mods.tagged.text\r\n        };\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nNamed `._extractBookmarkData()`, this utility method accepts the results of Ubiquity's parser interpreting the primary argument and modifier arguments supplied by the user.  Using these data structures, it attempts to build a structure representing the fields of a Delicious bookmark.\r\n\r\nThe `_user` field is used for authentication via the site login cookie.  The `url` is set from the location bar of the current page.  The `description`, or title, field of the bookmark is taken from either the `entitled` modifier or the title of the current page.  The `tags`, if any, come from the `tagged` modifier.  And, finally, the `extended` notes for the bookmark are taken from the primary input argument of the command.\r\n\r\nAs you'll see shortly, this utility method will be used in both the preview and the execution of the command.\r\n\r\nNext, there's one more utility method to cover:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"85\">\r\n    /**\r\n     * Given an object, build a URL query string\r\n     */\r\n    _buildQueryString: function(data) {\r\n        var qs = [];\r\n        for (k in data) if (data[k]) \r\n            qs.push( encodeURIComponent(k) + '=' + \r\n                encodeURIComponent(data[k]) );\r\n        return qs.join('&');\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of using the Delicious V1 API, the `._buildQueryString()` method accepts an object and constructs a URL query string from the encoded properties of the object.  This will be paired with the `._extractBookmarkData()` method to supply data for API calls.\r\n\r\nMoving along, it's time to start digging into the meat of this Ubiquity command:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"95\">\r\n    /**\r\n     * Present a preview of the bookmark under construction during the course\r\n     * of composing the command.\r\n     */\r\n    preview: function(pblock, input_obj, mods) {\r\n\r\n        var bm          = this._extractBookmarkData(input_obj, mods);\r\n        var user_cookie = this._getUserCookie();\r\n        var user_name   = (user_cookie) ? user_cookie.split(' ')[0] : '';\r\n\r\n        var ns = { user_name: user_name, bm: bm };\r\n        var tmpl;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nWith this code, the implementation of command method `.preview()` has begun.  This method is used by Ubiquity to generate a live preview of the command.  Called with a DOM node (`pblock`) and partially completed command input (`input_obj` and `mods`), this method is expected to build a representation of the command's results in the DOM node.  As the user types, this method will be called over and over again, ideally offering feedback as the user composes a command.\r\n\r\nContinuing on, consider this next chunk of code checking the validity of command input:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"107\">\r\n        if (!user_name) {\r\n\r\n            // If there's no user name, there's no login, so this command won't work. \r\n            tmpl = [ \r\n                '<p style=\"color: #d44\">No active user found - log in at ', \r\n                '<img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\r\n                '<b><a style=\"color: #3774D0\" href=\"http://delicious.com\">delicious.com</a></b> ', \r\n                'to use this command.</p>'\r\n            ].join('');\r\n\r\n        } else if (!bm.description) {\r\n\r\n            // If there's no title, then this is an error too.\r\n            tmpl = [ \r\n                '<p style=\"color: #d44\">A title is required for bookmarks on ', \r\n                '<img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\r\n                '<b><a style=\"color: #3774D0\" href=\"http://delicious.com\">delicious.com</a></b> ', \r\n                '</p>'\r\n            ].join('');\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThis chunk of code first checks for a user name, which can be extracted from a valid Delicious login cookie, if one was found.  If not found, the command will fail—so the preview built here will instruct the user to login at Delicious before going further.\r\n\r\nThe second precondition for using the command is that the bookmark has been given a title.  By default, this is the title of the current page—but, some pages don't offer titles.  So, an error needs to be flagged if the user hasn't manually supplied a title in this case.\r\n\r\nFinally, notice in both of these error cases, a string of HTML is composed in the variable `tmpl`.  This will be used at the end of the method to populate the DOM node passed in as `pblock`.\r\n\r\nNow, assuming that all the command's prerequisites have been met, it's time to try constructing a proper preview for the results of this command: \r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"126\">\r\n        } else {\r\n\r\n            // Attempt to construct a vaguely delicious-esque preview of a bookmark.\r\n            tmpl = [ \r\n                '<style type=\"text/css\">',\r\n                    '.preview a { color: #3774D0 }',\r\n                    '.del-bookmark { font: 12px arial; color: #ddd; background: #eee; line-height: 1.25em }',\r\n                    '.del-bookmark a.title { color: #1259C7 }',\r\n                    '.del-bookmark .full-url { color: #396C9B; font-size: 12px; display: block; padding: 0.25em 0 }',\r\n                    '.del-bookmark .notes { color: #4D4D4D }',\r\n                    '.del-bookmark .tags { color: #787878; padding-top: 0.25em; text-align: right }',\r\n                '</style>',\r\n                '<div class=\"preview\">',\r\n                    '<p>Share a bookmark at <img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\r\n                        '<b><a href=\"http://delicious.com/${user_name}\">delicious.com/${user_name}</a></b>:</p>',\r\n                    '<div class=\"del-bookmark\">',\r\n                        '<div style=\"padding: 1em;\">',\r\n                        '<a class=\"title\" href=\"${bm.url}\">${bm.description}</a>',\r\n                        '<a class=\"full-url\" href=\"${bm.url}\">${bm.url}</a>',\r\n                        bm.extended ? \r\n                            '<div class=\"notes\">${bm.extended}</div>' : '',\r\n                        bm.tags ?\r\n                            '<div class=\"tags\"><span>tags:</span> ${bm.tags}</div>' : '',\r\n                    '</div>',\r\n                '</div>'\r\n            ].join(\"\\n\");\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        pblock.innerHTML = CmdUtils.renderTemplate(tmpl, ns);\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nBuilding on the notion that previews are built in a DOM node, the code above uses both CSS and HTML to assemble a quick-and-dirty facsimile of a Delicious bookmark—which will be rendered like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/2008/ubiq-share-on-delicious-preview.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333; margin: 0.25em; padding: 0.25em\" />\r\n\r\nAlso note that Ubiquity provides a template engine for use in generating content—namely the [JavaScript Templates][jst] engine from the [TrimPath][] project.  This engine may eventually be replaced with another, but the notion is that Ubiquity will provide tools to more easily generate previews and more.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the `.preview()` method uses the template engine with a call to `CmdUtils.renderTemplate()` to inject content into the preview element by way of the `.innerHTML` property.\r\n\r\n[jst]: http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/JavaScriptTemplates\r\n[trimpath]: http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/TrimPath\r\n\r\nNow that the preview is out of the way, it's time to get down to implementing the execution of the command:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"157\">    \r\n    /**\r\n     * Attempt to use the delicious v1 API to post a bookmark using the \r\n     * command input\r\n     */\r\n    execute: function(input_obj, mods) {\r\n        var bm          = this._extractBookmarkData(input_obj, mods);\r\n        var user_cookie = this._getUserCookie();\r\n        var user_name   = (user_cookie) ? user_cookie.split(' ')[0] : '';\r\n\r\n        if (!user_name) {\r\n            // If there's no user name, there's no login, so this command won't work. \r\n            displayMessage('No active user found - log in at delicious.com ' +\r\n                'to use this command.');\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (!bm.description) {\r\n            // If there's no title, somehow, then this is an error too.\r\n            displayMessage(\"A title is required for bookmarks at delicious.com\");\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nMirroring the `.preview()` method, the `.execute()` method first checks for validity of the arguments given by the user.  A missing user name or title result in a notification that the command has failed.\r\n\r\nBut, if the arguments are all valid, it's time to actually issue a request to the Delicious V1 API:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"178\">\r\n        var path = '/v1/posts/add';\r\n        var url  = this._config.api_base + path;\r\n\r\n        var req = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/xmlextras/xmlhttprequest;1\"].\r\n            createInstance();\r\n\r\n        req.open('POST', url, true);\r\n\r\n        req.onload = function(ev) { \r\n            displayMessage('Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \r\n                'shared at delicious.com/' + user_name);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        req.onerror = function(ev) { \r\n            displayMessage('ERROR: Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \r\n                ' NOT shared on delicious.com/' + user_name);\r\n        }\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nUsing the base URL for the Delicious API declared earlier in the configuration section, the `.execute()` method constructs an API URL for the `/v1/posts/add` method.  Then, it creates an instance of `XMLHttpRequest` from the browser to be used in sending the API request.  Event handlers are registered with the object to present notifications to the user indicating whether or not the API request was successful.\r\n\r\nAt long last, it's time to wrap up this method and make the API request:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"195\">\r\n        req.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Basic Y29va2llOmNvb2tpZQ=='); // btoa('cookie:cookie')\r\n\r\n        var mediator = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/appshell/window-mediator;1\"].\r\n            getService(Components.interfaces.nsIWindowMediator);\r\n        var win = mediator.getMostRecentWindow(null);\r\n        var user_agent = win.navigator.userAgent + \";Ubiquity-share-on-delicious\";\r\n\r\n        req.setRequestHeader(\"User-Agent\", user_agent);      \r\n\r\n        req.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');\r\n        req.send(this._buildQueryString(bm));\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    EOF:null // I hate trailing commas\r\n});\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe login cookie authentication supported by the Delicious V1 API is triggered by supplying a user name / password pair of `cookie`, which is done by setting the `Authorization` request header.  The login cookie is then expected to be passed in as the POST variable `_user`, which is done in the `._extractBookmarkData()` utility method.\r\n\r\nAnother bit here that shows more access of browser resources is the construction of a unique User-Agent header for this API call based on the browser's own User-Agent string, something that's suggested in the guidelines for using the Delicious API.\r\n\r\nFinally, the `.execute()` method—and the command itself—is wrapped up with by sending off the bookmark data encoded as POST form variables with the `._buildQueryString()` utility method.\r\n\r\nAnd, that's it—a command-driven Delicious browser extension in a little over 200 lines of code.  There's still more to be done to really make this thing full-featured, but I think this shows off the basic features of Ubiquity.  I'm hoping to dig in deeper and explore further, taking a look at running Greasemonkey-style code at [browser startup and page load][load], as well as playing with some more browser chrome features.  \r\n\r\n[load]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1_Author_Tutorial#Running_on_page_load_and_startup\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085986\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0a9ab4b71ce193e98b7284ca257e327&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\">Jason Clark</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085986\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-01T14:47:35\">2008-09-01T14:47:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>First off-  fantastic post.  Great to see a lengthy post here again, although I'm one to talk.  This is an excellent introduction to Ubiquity command development, and tres useful to boot.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering why you chose to construct and post the XMLHttpRequest manually instead of using jQuery, which is included with Ubiquity.  I don't know that there's any benefit other than some simplicity, but I took a crack at converting your code to use jQuery, which works nicely.  In the 'execute' function, replace everything after \"var url  = this._config.api_base + path;\" with this (hope code blocks work in comments):</p>\n\n<p><code>\n        var win = context.focusedWindow;\n        var user_agent = win.navigator.userAgent + \";Ubiquity-share-on-delicious\";</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>    jQuery.ajax({\n      type: \"POST\",\n      url: url,\n      data: this._buildQueryString(bm),\n      username: \"cookie\",\n      password: \"cookie\",\n      beforeSend: function( req ) {\n        req.setRequestHeader(\"User-Agent\", user_agent); \n      },\n      error: function() {\n        displayMessage('ERROR: Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n            ' NOT shared on delicious.com/' + user_name);\n      },\n      success: function() {\n        displayMessage('Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n            'shared at delicious.com/' + user_name);\n      },\n    });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Also, with both versions of the code, I'm seeing some unexpected behavior around authentication.  Assume I'm logged in to delicious, with \"stay logged in\" checked, and I restart my browser.  Trying to post with the command fails with a 401 unauthorized, even though I can see the cookie was sent (via Live HTTP Headers extension).  Going to delicious.com shows me logged in, and once I've viewed the site, the command works.  Except that now I can't reproduce; but I know it happened because I've got the headers.  At any rate, it is working nicely, but the previous failure is bugging me... feel like I'm overlooking something.  </p>\n\n<p>Thanks again for an awesome post.  Hope to see more of the same.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085988\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e799a79441c7543be48562403411cd13&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Ryan Scott Scheel</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085988\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-01T15:07:01\">2008-09-01T15:07:01</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>You should be helping with the documentation, if you aren't already.

    "html": "<p>I&#39;m no longer at Yahoo! and I no longer work on <a href=\"http://delicious.com\">Delicious</a>, but I&#39;m still a huge supporter.  And, since I&#39;m pretty sure everyone over there is either burnt out or still insanely busy at the moment, it might be awhile before anyone tells the full story of what this relaunch offers.  As it is, even I only know a bit of what all went into this effort.</p>\n<p>So, off the top of my head, I thought I might point out <strong>just a few</strong> of the easily-missed improvements the new site offers beyond the great new love-it-or-hate-it visual redesign that seems to have occupied most of the discussion I&#39;ve seen so far:</p>\n<p><strong>Search works and is incredibly fast.</strong>  In fact, search may really be the real star of the redesign show here—especially since del.icio.us often took 30 seconds or more for a simple search, rendering it all but useless.  Today, though, it&#39;s at ludicrous speed in comparison—and so finally, the real power of search applied to social bookmarking might start to shine with the critical mass of content found by real people using Delicious.</p>\n<p>To scratch my own itch, I&#39;ve created <a href=\"http://mycroft.mozdev.org/developer/devlist.html?email=l.m.orchard%40pobox.com\">an unofficial OpenSearch search engine plugin for Delicious</a> on Mycroft.  Though I think it comes along with <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/tools\">the browser extensions</a>, I&#39;ve yet to find this for <a href=\"http://mycroft.mozdev.org/developer/hosting.html\">autodiscovery</a> from the site itself.</p>\n<p><strong>The notes field in bookmarks has been expanded from 255 to 1000 characters.</strong>  Yes, this means that you can now include long running quotes from pages, or complete paragraphs of rambling discourse. </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/feeds\">The feeds have all been overhauled and reorganized</a>.</strong>  An attempt at backward compatibility was made, but the old feed URLs are all deprecated.  Replacing these, there&#39;s now <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/feeds\">a common and consistent URL namespace for feeds across formats</a>.  </p>\n<p>Almost all RSS feeds have <a href=\"http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/\">JSONP</a> counterparts, and further feed formats could be considered.  Additionally, the old mix of RSS 1.0 and 2.0 has been dropped in favor of RSS 2.0 format across the board to support podcast and media enclosure elements consistently.  The <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/tools\">linkrolls, tagrolls, network badges, and tagometers</a> now all use the new JSONP feeds—and the widgets can be examined as example code in using the feeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Tag bundles can now be viewed as combined bookmark views, complete with feeds.</strong>  This augments bundles from a simple visual organization tool to a more powerful content aggregation function.  Personally, I never had much use for tag bundles until now, but since they can actually be used to partition tags and bookmarks I might actually take the time to use them.

    "body": "I'm no longer at Yahoo! and I no longer work on [Delicious](http://delicious.com), but I'm still a huge supporter.  And, since I'm pretty sure everyone over there is either burnt out or still insanely busy at the moment, it might be awhile before anyone tells the full story of what this relaunch offers.  As it is, even I only know a bit of what all went into this effort.\r\n\r\nSo, off the top of my head, I thought I might point out **just a few** of the easily-missed improvements the new site offers beyond the great new love-it-or-hate-it visual redesign that seems to have occupied most of the discussion I've seen so far:\r\n\r\n**Search works and is incredibly fast.**  In fact, search may really be the real star of the redesign show here—especially since del.icio.us often took 30 seconds or more for a simple search, rendering it all but useless.  Today, though, it's at ludicrous speed in comparison—and so finally, the real power of search applied to social bookmarking might start to shine with the critical mass of content found by real people using Delicious.\r\n\r\nTo scratch my own itch, I've created [an unofficial OpenSearch search engine plugin for Delicious](http://mycroft.mozdev.org/developer/devlist.html?email=l.m.orchard%40pobox.com) on Mycroft.  Though I think it comes along with [the browser extensions](http://delicious.com/help/tools), I've yet to find this for [autodiscovery](http://mycroft.mozdev.org/developer/hosting.html) from the site itself.\r\n\r\n**The notes field in bookmarks has been expanded from 255 to 1000 characters.**  Yes, this means that you can now include long running quotes from pages, or complete paragraphs of rambling discourse. \r\n\r\n**[The feeds have all been overhauled and reorganized](http://delicious.com/help/feeds).**  An attempt at backward compatibility was made, but the old feed URLs are all deprecated.  Replacing these, there's now [a common and consistent URL namespace for feeds across formats](http://delicious.com/help/feeds).  \r\n\r\nAlmost all RSS feeds have [JSONP](http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/) counterparts, and further feed formats could be considered.  Additionally, the old mix of RSS 1.0 and 2.0 has been dropped in favor of RSS 2.0 format across the board to support podcast and media enclosure elements consistently.  The [linkrolls, tagrolls, network badges, and tagometers](http://delicious.com/help/tools) now all use the new JSONP feeds—and the widgets can be examined as example code in using the feeds.\r\n\r\n**Tag bundles can now be viewed as combined bookmark views, complete with feeds.**  This augments bundles from a simple visual organization tool to a more powerful content aggregation function.  Personally, I never had much use for tag bundles until now, but since they can actually be used to partition tags and bookmarks I might actually take the time to use them.  Check out these example URLs:\r\n\r\n* [http://delicious.com/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign](http://delicious.com/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign)\r\n* [http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign](http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/britta/bundle:art%2Fdesign)\r\n\r\n**Bundles now work for tags, network contacts, and subscriptions.**  This means, for example, that you can partition your network contacts into topical groups.  From there, you can subscribe to those partitioned bookmarks in different folders in readers, or use the bundled bookmark views in mashups through JSON feeds.  Check out these example URLs:\r\n\r\n* [http://delicious.com/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard](http://delicious.com/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard)\r\n* [http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard](http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard)\r\n\r\n**Network member and fan feeds now include the date when the contact was added.**  Pro tip: Subscribe to fan feeds to see when new people have started following your bookmarks.\r\n\r\n**[Several previously undocumented parts of the V1 API have now been documented](http://delicious.com/help/api).**  In particular, the following new parameter combinations have been used with the browser extensions for primitive bookmark sync:\r\n\r\n* https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?hashes\r\n* https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?meta=yes\r\n* https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?fromdt={DT}&todt={DT}\r\n* https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?start={##}&results={##}\r\n\r\n**The posts/all API URL works again for users with large collections.**  With my 11k+ bookmarks, del.icio.us was keeling over with the attempt to assemble and deliver my entire collection with a posts/all call.  Now, however, Delicious 2.0 appears able to handle this call for my account.\r\n\r\n**Easter eggs have been rotated and recalibrated.** No, I'm not going to tell you what or where or how many they are.\r\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085469\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085469\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-05T02:31:52\">2008-08-05T02:31:52</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n  <p>Since I’m pretty sure everyone over there is either burnt out or still insanely busy at the moment, it might be awhile before anyone tells the full story of what this relaunch offers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Admit it, Les, you just got impatient after building a bunch of shiny toys that no one at Yahoo! seemed to be coming forth to tell the world about them. :) (I would be miffed too.)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085470\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.yining.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cd8af1a8b7c1cfdca49fb19d4a98a7bc&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.yining.org\">Yining</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085470\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-05T06:51:44\">2008-08-05T06:51:44</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>one thing in the new version that disappoints me is the tab-to-complete feature is gone.

I&#39;m suddenly inspired to break blog-radio-silence and get it out of my head.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/let-the-microblogs-bloom\">Let the microblogs bloom - RussellBeattie.com</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Once this is widely accepted (and I'm sure there are many that would argue with me), the thing that will separate these types of services won't be whether they stay up (ala Twitter), but how fast your subscription messages are updated. Some services might be smaller or offer more features but not update as quickly whereas others will pride themselves on being as close to real-time as possible. The key is that it's all about messaging, not publishing. (Oh, and this also facilitates federation as well, but that's another topic).</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also: <a href=\"http://randomfoo.net/blog/id/4182\">Rearchitecting Twitter: Brought to You By the 17th Letter of the Alphabet - random($foo)</a></p>\n<p>One of the problems it seems most modern web apps face is the tendency to want to do everything all at once, and all in the same code that responds directly to a user.  Because, while you&#39;re in there building a user interface, it&#39;s <em>easy</em> to implement everything else that needs to happen in that same UI module or library.</p>\n<p>Someone wants to post a bookmark?  Someone wants to post a message?  Well, of course you want the system to cross-reference and deliver that new piece of User Generated Content through every permutation of tag, recipient, keyword, and notification channel supported by your system.  </p>\n<p><strong>But</strong>, do you <em>really</em> have to do everything all at once—while the person who generated that content is tapping his or her foot, waiting for the web interface to respond with feedback?  Are all of these things immediately vital to the person watching the browser spin, <em>right now</em>?  </p>\n<p>No.  Your user wants to get on with things.  He or she wants to see the submitted content get accepted and, as feedback and confirmation, see it reflected in a personal view immediately.  Does it matter—to <em>this person</em>, at <em>this moment</em>—whether it shows up <em>simultaneously</em> in a friend&#39;s inbox, the public timeline, a global tag page, or even an RSS or Atom feed?</p>\n<p>Again, no, simultaneity doesn&#39;t really matter—because no human beings actually appreciate it.  Instead, imagine a ripple effect of concentric social and attention contexts with associated people spreading out from the original submission.  (This probably rates the creation of a diagram someday.)  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>To make the person who&#39;s submitting something happy, offer feedback visible in their own personal context in under 50-200 milliseconds.  (That is, less than half-a-second at worst, in people terms.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The next person to delight is someone following the first person&#39;s published content—and humanly speaking, delays of <em>tens of thousands of milliseconds</em> can be acceptable here.  (That is, 1-10 seconds at worst, in people terms.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Finally, you can start worrying about strangers, allowing the content to propagate to tag pages, keyword tracking pages, and other public views—and I&#39;d assert that delays of <em>hundreds of thousands of milliseconds</em> are acceptable here.  (That is, 1-2 minutes at worst, in people terms.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea here is that the social structure can help you scale, while still delighting people.  Even with these delays, the system is still better at getting the word out than the original content creator would be at notifying all the others involved with an out-of-band system like IM or email.  And that&#39;s at worst—on most good days, all the delays should tend to be on the order of seconds or less.</p>\n<p>And how do you do all of this?  Use queues.  Sure, the original submission of content can and should be done all at once—just enough to get the content into the user&#39;s collection.  Then, queue a job for further processing and get out of the way.  In fact, just queue one job from the user interface—the processor of <em>that</em> queue can then queue further jobs for all the other individual processing tasks that are likely susceptible to plenty of parallel processing and horizontal scaling.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the original user creating content has been thanked for their submission and life goes on.  In fact, their life may include going on to submit many more pieces of content in rapid succession, thanks to your delightfully responsive web user interface.  </p>\n<p>And, in the end, that&#39;s really the purpose of a web-based content creation interface—accepting something as quickly as possible to make the user happy enough to continue submitting more.  The other part of the user interface, retrieval, serves simply to get the original content distributed as fast as can be reasonably expected.</p>\n<p>Now, preparing for fast retrieval is another story.  The flip side to processing queues are message inboxes—expect content duplicated everywhere and fetched simply, rather than using cleverly expressed SQL joins that bring a system to its knees.  But, that&#39;s another post altogether. :)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083313\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://fatalerror.in\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=15516fd23722eeca86b8ea91738eea4b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://fatalerror.in\">shyam</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083313\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-04T21:12:46\">2008-07-04T21:12:46</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Interesting bits of conversation happening all over the place regarding queues and the irony of it all - the much maligned Java has had workqueues since the early days.</p>\n<p>What everyone will learn, rather painfully in in cases like Twitter, is that all data is not created, consumed or processed equally.

I think it's often a matter of developers not wanting to (and/or being politically unable to) venture into what they consider the sysadmin's domain. Take the way-too-common case of apps that make the client wait while it does housekeeping. Why isn't this in a cron job? One reason is maybe this is KewlOSSBlogWikiPackage and it's simpler to say \"just untar the package under htdocs and you're done\" instead of saying \"also, unpack these scripts in a non-servable area and set them up to run hourly, but not all at the same time; stagger them a little.

    "body": "This is a blog post I've had simmering in my brainmeats for well over a year or two.  I'm suddenly inspired to break blog-radio-silence and get it out of my head.\r\n\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/let-the-microblogs-bloom\">Let the microblogs bloom - RussellBeattie.com</a>:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Once this is widely accepted (and I'm sure there are many that would argue with me), the thing that will separate these types of services won't be whether they stay up (ala Twitter), but how fast your subscription messages are updated. Some services might be smaller or offer more features but not update as quickly whereas others will pride themselves on being as close to real-time as possible. The key is that it's all about messaging, not publishing. (Oh, and this also facilitates federation as well, but that's another topic).</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSee also: <a href=\"http://randomfoo.net/blog/id/4182\">Rearchitecting Twitter: Brought to You By the 17th Letter of the Alphabet - random($foo)</a>\r\n\r\nOne of the problems it seems most modern web apps face is the tendency to want to do everything all at once, and all in the same code that responds directly to a user.  Because, while you're in there building a user interface, it's *easy* to implement everything else that needs to happen in that same UI module or library.\r\n\r\nSomeone wants to post a bookmark?  Someone wants to post a message?  Well, of course you want the system to cross-reference and deliver that new piece of User Generated Content through every permutation of tag, recipient, keyword, and notification channel supported by your system.  \r\n\r\n**But**, do you *really* have to do everything all at once—while the person who generated that content is tapping his or her foot, waiting for the web interface to respond with feedback?  Are all of these things immediately vital to the person watching the browser spin, *right now*?  \r\n\r\nNo.  Your user wants to get on with things.  He or she wants to see the submitted content get accepted and, as feedback and confirmation, see it reflected in a personal view immediately.  Does it matter—to *this person*, at *this moment*—whether it shows up *simultaneously* in a friend's inbox, the public timeline, a global tag page, or even an RSS or Atom feed?\r\n\r\nAgain, no, simultaneity doesn't really matter—because no human beings actually appreciate it.  Instead, imagine a ripple effect of concentric social and attention contexts with associated people spreading out from the original submission.  (This probably rates the creation of a diagram someday.)  \r\n\r\n* To make the person who's submitting something happy, offer feedback visible in their own personal context in under 50-200 milliseconds.  (That is, less than half-a-second at worst, in people terms.)\r\n\r\n* The next person to delight is someone following the first person's published content—and humanly speaking, delays of *tens of thousands of milliseconds* can be acceptable here.  (That is, 1-10 seconds at worst, in people terms.)\r\n\r\n* Finally, you can start worrying about strangers, allowing the content to propagate to tag pages, keyword tracking pages, and other public views—and I'd assert that delays of *hundreds of thousands of milliseconds* are acceptable here.  (That is, 1-2 minutes at worst, in people terms.)\r\n\r\nThe idea here is that the social structure can help you scale, while still delighting people.  Even with these delays, the system is still better at getting the word out than the original content creator would be at notifying all the others involved with an out-of-band system like IM or email.  And that's at worst—on most good days, all the delays should tend to be on the order of seconds or less.\r\n\r\nAnd how do you do all of this?  Use queues.  Sure, the original submission of content can and should be done all at once—just enough to get the content into the user's collection.  Then, queue a job for further processing and get out of the way.  In fact, just queue one job from the user interface—the processor of *that* queue can then queue further jobs for all the other individual processing tasks that are likely susceptible to plenty of parallel processing and horizontal scaling.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the original user creating content has been thanked for their submission and life goes on.  In fact, their life may include going on to submit many more pieces of content in rapid succession, thanks to your delightfully responsive web user interface.  \r\n\r\nAnd, in the end, that's really the purpose of a web-based content creation interface—accepting something as quickly as possible to make the user happy enough to continue submitting more.  The other part of the user interface, retrieval, serves simply to get the original content distributed as fast as can be reasonably expected.\r\n\r\nNow, preparing for fast retrieval is another story.  The flip side to processing queues are message inboxes—expect content duplicated everywhere and fetched simply, rather than using cleverly expressed SQL joins that bring a system to its knees.  But, that's another post altogether. :)\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083313\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://fatalerror.in\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=15516fd23722eeca86b8ea91738eea4b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://fatalerror.in\">shyam</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083313\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-04T21:12:46\">2008-07-04T21:12:46</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Interesting bits of conversation happening all over the place regarding queues and the irony of it all - the much maligned Java has had workqueues since the early days.</p>\n\n<p>What everyone will learn, rather painfully in in cases like Twitter, is that all data is not created, consumed or processed equally.

One reason is maybe this is KewlOSSBlogWikiPackage and it's simpler to say \"just untar the package under htdocs and you're done\" instead of saying \"also, unpack these scripts in a non-servable area and set them up to run hourly, but not all at the same time; stagger them a little. And run them with the same UID your web server is running as\". But we end up with a lot of apps that (badly) reimplement basic tools their OS ships with in the first place.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083327\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1d7a7610cb0f02de44be3c4186f82ac3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083327\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-28T21:23:06\">2008-07-28T21:23:06</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I wonder if you're still setting the bar too high for low-priority connections.

The smiley was neither ironic nor sarcastic.  Something big I helped launch has been stirring an interesting discussion, however tangential my blame in the making.  </p>\n<p>Vanity and Carly Simon aside, I know I'm not the main perpetrator of JSON.  I just couldn't resist an opportunity to be a smart ass.  For that I have a <em>sincere</em> apology.  I should probably strike it or delete it now that the giddiness of a major launch and a lot of attention has subsided.</p>\n<p>But seriously, what I meant above is not that this is <em>your</em> issue, per se.  This post is really more directed at some comments on your blog post, in bulk.  </p>\n<p>Our particular intentions behind using JSON here do not necessarily map to anyone else's expectation from a web service or standards-driven perspective.  It seems like a lot of people are looking at this JSON data since its early release, divorced from it's main consumer:  The Tagometer JS include.  It works for that purpose - and incidentally might help others - but we're not working very hard to support other uses.</p>\n<p>Apropos of that, I don't particularly buy the hyperbole about JSON being XML's superior in the general case.  JSON's a brilliant hack, but it's got issues.  And seriously, if anyone thinks that adding and removing script tags on the fly in a browser DOM is the best overall way to go about things...  they should be strung up.  It just so happens that right now, it's the only way to do some things.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090837\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://bon.gs\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e8bc54082f8f4894f625bb229265b9bd&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://bon.gs\">timb</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090837\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-21T11:22:52\">2006-12-21T11:22:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>hooray, i'm glad to see the json url feed.</p>\n<p>however, i shouldn't have to generate the md5s of the urls i am interested in... i should just be able to give it the actual urls.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090838\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jm3.net/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/jm3.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jm3.net/\">John Manoogian III (jm3)</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090838\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-30T02:28:08\">2006-12-30T02:28:08</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>mmmmm, swilling the liquid core...!</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

The smiley was neither ironic nor sarcastic.  Something big I helped launch has been stirring an interesting discussion, however tangential my blame in the making.  </p>\n\n<p>Vanity and Carly Simon aside, I know I'm not the main perpetrator of JSON.  I just couldn't resist an opportunity to be a smart ass.  For that I have a <em>sincere</em> apology.  I should probably strike it or delete it now that the giddiness of a major launch and a lot of attention has subsided.</p>\n\n<p>But seriously, what I meant above is not that this is <em>your</em> issue, per se.  This post is really more directed at some comments on your blog post, in bulk.  </p>\n\n<p>Our particular intentions behind using JSON here do not necessarily map to anyone else's expectation from a web service or standards-driven perspective.  It seems like a lot of people are looking at this JSON data since its early release, divorced from it's main consumer:  The Tagometer JS include.  It works for that purpose - and incidentally might help others - but we're not working very hard to support other uses.</p>\n\n<p>Apropos of that, I don't particularly buy the hyperbole about JSON being XML's superior in the general case.  JSON's a brilliant hack, but it's got issues.  And seriously, if anyone thinks that adding and removing script tags on the fly in a browser DOM is the best overall way to go about things...  they should be strung up.  It just so happens that right now, it's the only way to do some things.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090837\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://bon.gs\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e8bc54082f8f4894f625bb229265b9bd&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://bon.gs\">timb</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090837\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-21T11:22:52\">2006-12-21T11:22:52</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>hooray, i'm glad to see the json url feed.</p>\n\n<p>however, i shouldn't have to generate the md5s of the urls i am interested in... i should just be able to give it the actual urls.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090838\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.jm3.net/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/jm3.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.jm3.net/\">John Manoogian III (jm3)</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090838\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-30T02:28:08\">2006-12-30T02:28:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>mmmmm, swilling the liquid core...!</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

    "body": "So, now that I've had [a brief bit][bb] of [serial enthusiasm](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast) in discovering this whole [microID][] / [claimID][] thing, all it's ended up with in practical terms is [a list of links in my sidebar](http://decafbad.com/blog/#claimid).  So, with that and fully understanding that it's early days yet for [claimID][], I have to ask myself:  What does this do that I couldn't have done with a tagged set of [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/deusx) bookmarks?  Of course, bookmarks on [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/deusx) don't enjoy any sort of [microID][] verification, but that could change - either through features implemented there directly or through a sidecar service.  My [original gripe](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/17/dont-ask-me-who-i-am) was about both machines *and* people finding out about me from a central source.  So far [claimID][] seems to be good for just people finding out about me.\r\n\r\nBy the way, this is not criticism or a put-down of [claimID][] - this is me thinking out loud and puzzling it out.\r\n\r\n*Update:*  Although, I certainly understand the utility of [microID][] in replacing [blog posts like this one](http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron/2006/08/for_technorati.html).\r\n\r\n[bb]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/18/see-also\r\n[microid]: http://microid.org/\r\n[claimid]: http://claimid.org/\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083474\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://chimprawk.blogspot.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=77afe52123d8667fe867cf1a707e397b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://chimprawk.blogspot.com\">Fred</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083474\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-20T18:01:06\">2006-08-20T18:01:06</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>These are really quite valid questions, and stuff as important as identity does deserve our puzzling.

I would contend that FOAF's expressivity actually relies far, far more, simply on XML's ability to namespace things, and thus allow for extensions.  Something that a simple XML dialect would also have, but with the added bonus of an infinitely simpler parser, fewer confused programmers, and quite a bit less bandwidth consumed.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085270\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://tantek.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02cd45622e90350cc061aaaa02229195&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://tantek.com/\">Tantek Çelik</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085270\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-20T07:22:55\">2006-08-20T07:22:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Indeed Les, this is exactly what <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard\" rel=\"nofollow\">hCard</a> solves on the Web with the minimum of duplication of data into hidden places and mimetype hackery/configuration (problems of the other approaches mentioned).</p>\n<p>You can either use a 3rd party service like claimID as mentioned to claim your various profiles on the Web, or you can simply continue to publish your profile information on your about or author page, simply add just a bit of hCard markup, and use <a href=\"http://www.gmpg.org/xfn/and/#idconsolidation\" rel=\"nofollow\">XFN Identity Consolidation</a> (rel=\"me\") to turn your about page into your consolidated identity hub.</p>\n<p>While services will undoubtedly continue to ask you a hundred profile questions, the better ones will do something as simple as use the simple open source <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/hkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">hKit Microformats Toolkit</a> by <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drew McLellan</a> to let you simply enter your hCard URL and fill out all the questions automatically from that.</p>\n<p>And the best services will help you, the user, keep your profile as portable as you would like it, by marking it up with hCard as well.  Already, profiles on numerous services, in addition to the abovementioned claimID, like <a href=\"http://flickr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flickr</a> and <a href=\"http://technorati.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Technorati</a> are marked up with hCard and thus ready for reuse with services that use hKit.</p>\n<p>Finally, some have brought up \"extensibility\" as something that is desirable yet recent lessons have taught us that in terms of standards and interoperability, the opposite is true.  The more well-defined not-infinitely-extensible a standard is, the sooner implementers know they are \"done\" implementing it (interoperably even!), and the less chance there is of a zillion non-interoperable extensions randomly emerging (i.e. Tower of Babel problem) which then cause headaches not only for all implementers, but users as well as the users then have to contend with their data not quite working interoperably across all the different services that all support slightly different sets of incompatible/non-interoperable extensions.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085272\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://macgirvin.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=74685c9f342f159611317a68c2655218&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://macgirvin.com\">Mike Macgirvin</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085272\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-22T20:38:14\">2006-08-22T20:38:14</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with Steve. Who am I? It depends. Who are you, and based on that - what do I wish you to know about me? Who are my friends? Same thing. Even if I wanted to divulge them, I then need to  respect their privacy wishes and decide if they want you to know that they are a friend of mine (or not) and how they came to be tagged as friends. A web service which tries to consolidate all of this info is presented with too many privacy conflicts to ever get it right (IMAO). I can recall this concept being tried by a hundred different companies (not to mention open source projects) going back to the early 90's. It was never an issue of technology. The hurdles are primarily social and revolve around trust and privacy - and delegation of these rights to third parties in language even my mother would understand.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085274\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dekoration.cc\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f67e69a66a666638b4e3ba3b9fa68eda&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dekoration.cc\">Wohnaccessoires</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085274\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-16T22:04:59\">2007-03-16T22:04:59</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>But you’re forgetting that a lot of people, myself included, like to represent themselves in different ways on different sites.

Indeed, they also help considerably with the problem of expressing this kind of machine-readable data in HTML. But \"FOAF would be a lot more useful if it didn’t rely on RDF.\" - the power, the expressivity of FOAF comes from RDF. </p>\n\n<p>I suspect Bob (like Mad William) may be assuming RDF (including FOAF) has to mean RDF/XML. But RDF is a model, it doesn't have to serialize to XML, there are other formats - including HTML (via <a href=\"http://research.talis.com/2005/erdf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">eRDF</a>). Note too that microformats like XFN and hCard can be interpreted as RDF (including FOAF terms as appropriate) with <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/spec\" rel=\"nofollow\">GRDDL</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(Incidentally I got to this post before even looking in my personal agg via Marc Canter's on <a href=\"http://planetweb20.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planet Web 2.0</a>)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085268\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e664d95e68ab4e364b35fabb89c8fdee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Steve</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085268\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-19T17:37:36\">2006-08-19T17:37:36</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>But you're forgetting that a lot of people, myself included, like to represent themselves in different ways on different sites.

I would contend that FOAF's expressivity actually relies far, far more, simply on XML's ability to namespace things, and thus allow for extensions.  Something that a simple XML dialect would also have, but with the added bonus of an infinitely simpler parser, fewer confused programmers, and quite a bit less bandwidth consumed.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085270\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://tantek.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02cd45622e90350cc061aaaa02229195&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://tantek.com/\">Tantek Çelik</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085270\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-20T07:22:55\">2006-08-20T07:22:55</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Indeed Les, this is exactly what <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard\" rel=\"nofollow\">hCard</a> solves on the Web with the minimum of duplication of data into hidden places and mimetype hackery/configuration (problems of the other approaches mentioned).</p>\n\n<p>You can either use a 3rd party service like claimID as mentioned to claim your various profiles on the Web, or you can simply continue to publish your profile information on your about or author page, simply add just a bit of hCard markup, and use <a href=\"http://www.gmpg.org/xfn/and/#idconsolidation\" rel=\"nofollow\">XFN Identity Consolidation</a> (rel=\"me\") to turn your about page into your consolidated identity hub.</p>\n\n<p>While services will undoubtedly continue to ask you a hundred profile questions, the better ones will do something as simple as use the simple open source <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/hkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">hKit Microformats Toolkit</a> by <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drew McLellan</a> to let you simply enter your hCard URL and fill out all the questions automatically from that.</p>\n\n<p>And the best services will help you, the user, keep your profile as portable as you would like it, by marking it up with hCard as well.  Already, profiles on numerous services, in addition to the abovementioned claimID, like <a href=\"http://flickr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flickr</a> and <a href=\"http://technorati.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Technorati</a> are marked up with hCard and thus ready for reuse with services that use hKit.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, some have brought up \"extensibility\" as something that is desirable yet recent lessons have taught us that in terms of standards and interoperability, the opposite is true.  The more well-defined not-infinitely-extensible a standard is, the sooner implementers know they are \"done\" implementing it (interoperably even!), and the less chance there is of a zillion non-interoperable extensions randomly emerging (i.e. Tower of Babel problem) which then cause headaches not only for all implementers, but users as well as the users then have to contend with their data not quite working interoperably across all the different services that all support slightly different sets of incompatible/non-interoperable extensions.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085272\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://macgirvin.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=74685c9f342f159611317a68c2655218&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://macgirvin.com\">Mike Macgirvin</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085272\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-22T20:38:14\">2006-08-22T20:38:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with Steve. Who am I? It depends. Who are you, and based on that - what do I wish you to know about me? Who are my friends? Same thing. Even if I wanted to divulge them, I then need to  respect their privacy wishes and decide if they want you to know that they are a friend of mine (or not) and how they came to be tagged as friends. A web service which tries to consolidate all of this info is presented with too many privacy conflicts to ever get it right (IMAO). I can recall this concept being tried by a hundred different companies (not to mention open source projects) going back to the early 90's. It was never an issue of technology. The hurdles are primarily social and revolve around trust and privacy - and delegation of these rights to third parties in language even my mother would understand.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085274\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://dekoration.cc\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f67e69a66a666638b4e3ba3b9fa68eda&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://dekoration.cc\">Wohnaccessoires</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085274\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-16T22:04:59\">2007-03-16T22:04:59</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>But you’re forgetting that a lot of people, myself included, like to represent themselves in different ways on different sites.
