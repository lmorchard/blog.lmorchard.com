    "summary": "\n\n<p>In my thinking about things <a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/\">IndieWeb</a> and user-supported cloud infrastructure, I’ve had a couple of notions bouncing around in my head that might help clarify some “products” I’d like to build if and when I have time. I guess this would be good to blog about, so maybe someone else can steal my ideas (if they’re any good). Because, after all, much of this is sourced from material I’ve stolen from guys like <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">Dave Winer</a>. </p>",
