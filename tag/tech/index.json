Mouse &amp; keyboard &amp; headphones are also easy—USB cables come in long lengths and Bluetooth is a thing.</p>\n<p>No, the hard part was the monitor. I had been gaming on a 2012 15&quot; MacBook Pro—which was physically convenient but lacking in performance. A gaming PC solves the latter, but no one seems to sell 15&quot; standalone monitors equivalent to my laptop screen. That was when I discovered <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Laptop-to-Desktop-Conversion/\">an Instructable article</a> about how to turn an old laptop into a desktop panel. <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch/#Laptop_decapitation\">That gave me ideas</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-10---artisanal-acrylic\">Version 1.0 - Artisanal Acrylic</h2>\n<p>Turns out, there are <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/usr/chinatobby2011\">vendors on eBay</a> who offer complete kits for hooking a laptop display panel up to a PC. They just don&#39;t come with any kind of enclosure like your typical computer monitor. So, <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/02/10/building-my-couch-computing-station/\">I ordered one of those kits and tried handcrafting a case</a>. It turned out crude yet functional:</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8439217201/in/photolist-5m6a-dRKcfR-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRk8-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"First fully assembled power-on of my DIY monitor\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/8439217201_6eea54c3e5_z.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"First fully assembled power-on of my DIY monitor\"></a></p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8447859933/in/photolist-5m6a-dRKcfR-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRk8-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"Rear view #2 of DIY monitor and IKEA DAVE\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/8447859933_c1bf2c05aa_z.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Rear view #2 of DIY monitor and IKEA DAVE\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"version-11---custom-picture-frame\">Version 1.1 - Custom Picture Frame</h2>\n<p>I used that first version for a year in my living room. It was ugly &amp; heavy &amp; awkward. Happily, I fell upon <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Raspberry-Pi-Media-Panel-fka-Digita/?ALLSTEPS\">this Instructables article</a> that pointed me to <a href=\"http://www.americanframe.com/\">American Frame</a>. They&#39;ll produce a rectangular picture frame in just about any custom size you&#39;d like—height, width, <em>and</em> depth.</p>\n<p>So, I ordered a nice matte black metal frame close to the size of my display panel. I ended up with this:</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/12222356524/in/photolist-dRKcfR-7aTRk8-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-5m6a-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"Updated Couch PC monitor\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/12222356524_fcbd4cf0b4_z.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"Updated Couch PC monitor\"></a></p>\n<p>Sleeker and lighter. The back of the picture frame was just <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foamcore\">foamcore</a> and I used double-sided tape on the monitor arm and all the electronics. Luckily, the panel and all were light enough for these hacks. But, it kind of fell apart across two house moves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-12---mic-stands--laser-cutters-ftw\">Version 1.2 - Mic Stands &amp; Laser Cutters FTW</h2>\n<p>I decided I wanted to minimize things. The Ikea Dave laptop stand seemed a bit much, especially when I needed to move it around—or hide it when company came over.</p>\n<p>Last year, I (finally) got a membership at <a href=\"https://www.i3detroit.org/\">i3Detroit</a>. I skilled up on laser cutters and <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/2016/08/29/gamechord/\">made a DIY keypad that I showed off at the Detroit Maker Faire</a>. Things that, you know, <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/topic/i3detroit-public/Qv1P91ySqWo/discussion\">I should have done years ago at the start of this whole DIY monitor project</a>—rather than cutting things by hand and with a Dremel.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I discovered that there&#39;s a such thing as <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2jccG5D\">a VESA mount</a> for <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2jcc93M\">microphone stands</a>. I bought those and threw in an <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2j1YpeM\">adapter</a> &amp; a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2j1VYZq\">gooseneck</a>—all of which let me strip my rig down like so:</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/32182700386/in/datetaken/\" title=\"20170109_221645\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/32182700386_4320d2a1d0_z.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"800\" alt=\"20170109_221645\"></a></p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/31845156280/in/datetaken/\" title=\"20170109_221722\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/31845156280_d16551c8df_z.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"800\" alt=\"20170109_221722\"></a></p>\n<p>By this point, the double-sided tape and the foamcore just weren&#39;t up to the task.

This layout has places to bolt in all of the electronic components of the monitor—driver board, button panel, and power supply. It&#39;s also got a proper 75/100 VESA mount that accepts <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2iYwbAU\">10mm thumbscrew bolts</a> through the mic stand plate.</p>\n<p>The main thing that worked out better than I expected is this: <img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/nuts.png\" style=\"width: 1.5em\"></p>\n<p>The two 1.5mm layers have rectangular cut-outs. Each of those trap a 3mm thick hexogonal M4 nut and act as wrenches. The 2.5mm layers have holes for bolts.

Though there is <a href=\"http://www.i3detroit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a friendly hackerspace</a> suitably equipped nearby, I wanted to see what I could prototype by hand. So, I went to Home Depot and bought <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100542281/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=acrylic&storeId=10051#.URcEEZykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">4 polystyrene panels</a>, <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-203040434/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=dremel&storeId=10051#.URcW75ykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">a Dremel tool</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202519358/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=acrylic+cutter&storeId=10051#.URcXIJykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">an acrylic cutter</a>.</p>\n<p>With lots of trial and error, and truly awful manufacturing tolerances, I came up with a crude design consisting of 6 stacked layers bolted together with machine screws:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Back layer with VESA mounting holes and an exit for the LVDS cable.</li>\n<li>Layer with VESA mounting holes and a pocket to route the LVDS cable.</li>\n<li>Layer behind the LCD with pocket for LVDS cable and heads of VESA mount bolts.</li>\n<li>Strips across the top and sides to hold the LCD panel.</li>\n<li>More strips across the top and sides to hold the LCD panel.</li>\n<li>Strips across the top and sides, covering the bezel area of the LCD panel.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I made a ton of measurements and little indecipherable sketches in my grid-lined Moleskine, but those were mostly crap. No battle plan survives contact with the enemy, and all that. In the end, I just flew by the seat of my pants and hacked away.</p>\n<p>This process taught me that a Dremel (in my hands, at least) is absolutely no substitute for a laser cutter. I <em>really</em> didn&#8217;t anticipate just how horrible I&#8217;d be at cutting this stuff. Trying to cut just-right shapes out of the polystyrene turned into a dismal, stinky mess. But luckily, all the material I thought I&#8217;d wasted turned out to be perfect for cutting out as strips for the bezel and sides.</p>\n<p>So, in lieu of a diagram, how about some pictures?</p>\n<div style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.29.331.jpg\"><img title=\"Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench\" alt=\"Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.29.331-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a little trick I worked out in this construction process: I used squares of electrical tape to retain the machine screws, so that I could flip the thing around while I was assembling layers on top before threading on the nuts. And speaking of that, here are the rest of the pieces in place:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_850\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-00.36.29.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-850\" title=\"Further layers bolted into the stack\" alt=\"Further layers bolted into the stack\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-00.36.29-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Further layers bolted into the stack\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The middle two layers cradling the sides of the LCD panel alternate between long sides / short top and long top / short sides, providing a bit more stability in the way they overlap. The top layer is long sides / short top, with a bit more width to cover the 5mm or so of the LCD panel&#8217;s bezel area.</p>\n<p>Immediately behind the LCD panel is a layer with a cut-out to provide space for machine screws for the VESA mount, and a pocket through which to route the LVDS cable to the control board. And the final two layers form the actual VESA mount and complete the exit route for the LVDS cable.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.44.09.jpg\"><img title=\"Video control board bolted onto the back\" alt=\"Video control board bolted onto the back\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.44.09-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Video control board bolted onto the back\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>And finally, here&#8217;s the video control board on the back. Rather than make a full box for the board, I just sandwiched it with machine screws between acrylic layers and nylon spacers. Then, I bolted that whole mess onto the back layers.</p>\n<p>Midway through this process, I switched from Home Depot to <a href=\"http://frentzandsons.com/content/default.htm\">a family-owned hardware store</a> a few blocks from my house. I think they recognize me as a regular now after repeat visits for Dremel bits, screws, and a pile of other miscellanea.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mounting-the-mess-to-the-dave\"><span id=\"Mounting_the_mess_to_the_DAVE\">Mounting the mess to the DAVE</span></h3>\n<p>The VideoSecu VESA mount went onto the IKEA DAVE rather crudely with a pair of long wood screws. It feels pretty solid, but the screws stab treacherously out through the bottom. I&#8217;ll need to address that someday, probably after they stab me in the kneecaps.</p>\n<p>And, as it turns out, the control board placement was a mistake. Once I got the VESA arm screwed onto the IKEA DAVE, there wasn&#8217;t enough room to connect the power and an HDMI cable to the board. Or rather, there was just enough room to do so and inadvertently destroy an HDMI cable after a few hours of the monitor&#8217;s weight resting on it. I guess the good news is that the cable went before the solder joints on the jack failed. Herp, derp.</p>\n<p>So, I bought a new HDMI cable, unbolted the board, and stuck it onto the back with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Z4A8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00004Z4A8&linkCode=as2&tag=0xdecafbad01-20\" target=\"_blank\">double sided tape</a>. Here&#8217;s what the back looks like now:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_826\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-05-00.28.14.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-826\" title=\"LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE\" alt=\"LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-05-00.28.14-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE, featuring bonus <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/cheddars/\" target=\"_blank\">Cheddars</a> appearance\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>I also used the same tape to attach the button board to the front of the enclosure.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_853\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.20.43.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-853\" alt=\"Button board on front\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.20.43-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Button board on front\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Overall, this thing works pretty much exactly as I&#8217;d imagined it. I <a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/p/z3mE\" target=\"_blank\">built a PC</a> in a <a href=\"http://icrontic.com/article/fractal-design-node-304-case-review\" target=\"_blank\">Fractal Node 304</a> mini-ITX case, and hid that under the coffee table. I bundled the cables together and used velcro wraps to bind them to the DAVE, and <a href=\"http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/rabbit-proofing.html#cords\" target=\"_blank\">some spiral wraps to bunny-proof</a> them as much as possible.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_855\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.38.29.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-855\" alt=\"Cheddars just loves my new couch PC\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.38.29-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/cheddars/\" target=\"_blank\">Cheddars</a> just loves my new couch PC.

I slipped a bit with the acrylic cutter and left some obvious gouges, and the layers have a grubby patina of scratches just from clumsy handling throughout the process. Basically, it&#8217;s very, very obviously hand-made by a guy who writes software for a living and hasn&#8217;t touched a power tool for more than 5 minutes since high school shop class.</p>\n<p>But, I think some really valuable things came out of this first attempt: It took me a bit to work through how to mount the LCD panel and route the cable out the back in a way that didn&#8217;t put stress on the wires or the connectors. There was a lot of fudge factor in getting the VESA mount alignment just right. And, there was also that HDMI cable I wrecked by botching the control board placement. Beyond all that, though, the basic idea worked.</p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;m already thinking about v2.0 and making friends over at <a href=\"http://www.i3detroit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">i3Detroit</a> who can drive <a href=\"http://i3detroit.com/wi/index.php?title=Laser_Cutting_and_Etching\" target=\"_blank\">a laser cutter</a>. I&#8217;m checking out <a href=\"http://www.ponoko.com/starter-kits/inkscape\" target=\"_blank\">Inkscape and Ponoko</a>. I&#8217;d also like to find some better materials &#8211; maybe aluminum for the front bezel and back panel, and maybe drop a layer from the stack. It would be really nice to get a much cleaner look and drop some weight. Also, an upgrade to this cheap VESA mount would be keen &#8211; I can&#8217;t <em>quite</em> get all the adjustments I&#8217;d like.</p>\n<p>Overall, this thing works, and that makes me pretty happy. In the beginning, I had really hoped to just find someone else had made this exact thing &#8211; maybe on Thingiverse. But, no such luck. This <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Laptop-to-Desktop-Conversion/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Laptop-to-Desktop&#8221; Instructable</a> is pretty close, but not entirely what I needed. I guess DIY high-res LCD monitors are just not a thing. But, maybe this post and a possible v2.0 post in the future might come in handy for someone else.</p>\n",

So, I went to Home Depot and bought <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100542281/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=acrylic&storeId=10051#.URcEEZykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">4 polystyrene panels</a>, <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-203040434/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=dremel&storeId=10051#.URcW75ykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">a Dremel tool</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202519358/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=acrylic+cutter&storeId=10051#.URcXIJykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">an acrylic cutter</a>.\r\n\r\nWith lots of trial and error, and truly awful manufacturing tolerances, I came up with a crude design consisting of 6 stacked layers bolted together with machine screws:\r\n\r\n1.  Back layer with VESA mounting holes and an exit for the LVDS cable.\r\n2.  Layer with VESA mounting holes and a pocket to route the LVDS cable.\r\n3.  Layer behind the LCD with pocket for LVDS cable and heads of VESA mount bolts.\r\n4.  Strips across the top and sides to hold the LCD panel.\r\n5.  More strips across the top and sides to hold the LCD panel.\r\n6.  Strips across the top and sides, covering the bezel area of the LCD panel.\r\n\r\nI made a ton of measurements and little indecipherable sketches in my grid-lined Moleskine, but those were mostly crap. No battle plan survives contact with the enemy, and all that. In the end, I just flew by the seat of my pants and hacked away.\r\n\r\nThis process taught me that a Dremel (in my hands, at least) is absolutely no substitute for a laser cutter. I *really* didn&#8217;t anticipate just how horrible I&#8217;d be at cutting this stuff. Trying to cut just-right shapes out of the polystyrene turned into a dismal, stinky mess. But luckily, all the material I thought I&#8217;d wasted turned out to be perfect for cutting out as strips for the bezel and sides.\r\n\r\nSo, in lieu of a diagram, how about some pictures?\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.29.331.jpg\"><img title=\"Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench\" alt=\"Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.29.331-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench.\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nHere&#8217;s a little trick I worked out in this construction process: I used squares of electrical tape to retain the machine screws, so that I could flip the thing around while I was assembling layers on top before threading on the nuts. And speaking of that, here are the rest of the pieces in place:\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_850\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-00.36.29.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-850\" title=\"Further layers bolted into the stack\" alt=\"Further layers bolted into the stack\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-00.36.29-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    Further layers bolted into the stack\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThe middle two layers cradling the sides of the LCD panel alternate between long sides / short top and long top / short sides, providing a bit more stability in the way they overlap. The top layer is long sides / short top, with a bit more width to cover the 5mm or so of the LCD panel&#8217;s bezel area.\r\n\r\nImmediately behind the LCD panel is a layer with a cut-out to provide space for machine screws for the VESA mount, and a pocket through which to route the LVDS cable to the control board. And the final two layers form the actual VESA mount and complete the exit route for the LVDS cable.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.44.09.jpg\"><img title=\"Video control board bolted onto the back\" alt=\"Video control board bolted onto the back\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.44.09-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    Video control board bolted onto the back\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nAnd finally, here&#8217;s the video control board on the back. Rather than make a full box for the board, I just sandwiched it with machine screws between acrylic layers and nylon spacers. Then, I bolted that whole mess onto the back layers.\r\n\r\nMidway through this process, I switched from Home Depot to [a family-owned hardware store][7] a few blocks from my house. I think they recognize me as a regular now after repeat visits for Dremel bits, screws, and a pile of other miscellanea.\r\n\r\n### <span id=\"Mounting_the_mess_to_the_DAVE\">Mounting the mess to the DAVE</span>\r\n\r\nThe VideoSecu VESA mount went onto the IKEA DAVE rather crudely with a pair of long wood screws. It feels pretty solid, but the screws stab treacherously out through the bottom. I&#8217;ll need to address that someday, probably after they stab me in the kneecaps.\r\n\r\nAnd, as it turns out, the control board placement was a mistake. Once I got the VESA arm screwed onto the IKEA DAVE, there wasn&#8217;t enough room to connect the power and an HDMI cable to the board. Or rather, there was just enough room to do so and inadvertently destroy an HDMI cable after a few hours of the monitor&#8217;s weight resting on it. I guess the good news is that the cable went before the solder joints on the jack failed. Herp, derp.\r\n\r\nSo, I bought a new HDMI cable, unbolted the board, and stuck it onto the back with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Z4A8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00004Z4A8&linkCode=as2&tag=0xdecafbad01-20\" target=\"_blank\">double sided tape</a>. Here&#8217;s what the back looks like now:\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_826\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-05-00.28.14.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-826\" title=\"LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE\" alt=\"LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-05-00.28.14-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE, featuring bonus <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/cheddars/\" target=\"_blank\">Cheddars</a> appearance\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nI also used the same tape to attach the button board to the front of the enclosure.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_853\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.20.43.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-853\" alt=\"Button board on front\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.20.43-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    Button board on front\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nOverall, this thing works pretty much exactly as I&#8217;d imagined it. I <a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/p/z3mE\" target=\"_blank\">built a PC</a> in a <a href=\"http://icrontic.com/article/fractal-design-node-304-case-review\" target=\"_blank\">Fractal Node 304</a> mini-ITX case, and hid that under the coffee table. I bundled the cables together and used velcro wraps to bind them to the DAVE, and <a href=\"http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/rabbit-proofing.html#cords\" target=\"_blank\">some spiral wraps to bunny-proof</a> them as much as possible.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_855\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.38.29.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-855\" alt=\"Cheddars just loves my new couch PC\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.38.29-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/cheddars/\" target=\"_blank\">Cheddars</a> just loves my new couch PC. Or, maybe she wants dinner.\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n### <span id=\"What8217s_next\">What&#8217;s next?</span>\r\n\r\nThis monitor is ugly if you look at it too closely. I slipped a bit with the acrylic cutter and left some obvious gouges, and the layers have a grubby patina of scratches just from clumsy handling throughout the process. Basically, it&#8217;s very, very obviously hand-made by a guy who writes software for a living and hasn&#8217;t touched a power tool for more than 5 minutes since high school shop class.\r\n\r\nBut, I think some really valuable things came out of this first attempt: It took me a bit to work through how to mount the LCD panel and route the cable out the back in a way that didn&#8217;t put stress on the wires or the connectors. There was a lot of fudge factor in getting the VESA mount alignment just right. And, there was also that HDMI cable I wrecked by botching the control board placement. Beyond all that, though, the basic idea worked.\r\n\r\nSo, I&#8217;m already thinking about v2.0 and making friends over at <a href=\"http://www.i3detroit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">i3Detroit</a> who can drive <a href=\"http://i3detroit.com/wi/index.php?title=Laser_Cutting_and_Etching\" target=\"_blank\">a laser cutter</a>. I&#8217;m checking out <a href=\"http://www.ponoko.com/starter-kits/inkscape\" target=\"_blank\">Inkscape and Ponoko</a>. I&#8217;d also like to find some better materials &#8211; maybe aluminum for the front bezel and back panel, and maybe drop a layer from the stack. It would be really nice to get a much cleaner look and drop some weight. Also, an upgrade to this cheap VESA mount would be keen &#8211; I can&#8217;t *quite* get all the adjustments I&#8217;d like.\r\n\r\nOverall, this thing works, and that makes me pretty happy. In the beginning, I had really hoped to just find someone else had made this exact thing &#8211; maybe on Thingiverse. But, no such luck. This <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Laptop-to-Desktop-Conversion/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Laptop-to-Desktop&#8221; Instructable</a> is pretty close, but not entirely what I needed. I guess DIY high-res LCD monitors are just not a thing. But, maybe this post and a possible v2.0 post in the future might come in handy for someone else.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch\r\n [2]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch#Laptop_decapitation\r\n [3]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2a-pc.png\r\n [4]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-23.33.12.jpg\r\n [5]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ID7QNI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000ID7QNI&linkCode=as2&tag=0xdecafbad01-20 \"VideoSecu Articulating TV Wall Mount Bracket for VESA 100 LCD LED Flat Screen Monitor TV 1E9\"\r\n [6]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ID7QNI/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000ID7QNI&linkCode=as2&tag=0xdecafbad01-20\r\n [7]: http://frentzandsons.com/content/default.htm",

(Maybe I&#8217;ll come back to this post with a drawing.)</p>\n<p>I would think that a high degree of freedom of choice would leave you quite free to change your mind later. But, I could imagine reworking that <a href=\"http://www.bigmessowires.com/2009/02/02/wire-wrap-photos/\">Big Mess &#8216;o Wires</a> would be a huge pain.

But, that&#8217;s tinfoil-hat territory, and I could rant all day.</p>\n<p>Android seems to be doing well, and it&#8217;s <em>mostly</em> open. I&#8217;ve switched device vendors a few times, and all my apps have survived the changes. I&#8217;ve flashed my own choice of firmware on a few of my phones, and have been pleased. I have a sense of deeper choices available, should I ever want to chase after them.</p>\n<p>Palm&#8217;s webOS devices were <em>crazy</em> open—not open source per se, but <a href=\"http://webos.org/2009/06/10/palm-pre-konami-code-dev-mode/\">you could unlock root with the Konami code</a> and <a href=\"http://www.webos-internals.org/wiki/Applying_Patches\">apply patches to core applications</a>.

Really, I just think it&#8217;s very important to have a sense of your choices and freedoms when you accept technology into your life.

So far, so good.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Changing_your_mind\">Changing your mind</span>\r\n\r\nBut, what about after you&#8217;ve made your choices about choices—can you change your mind later?\r\n\r\n*   Can you take your tools with you to a new ecosystem? \r\n*   If you can&#8217;t take them with, can you find alternatives?\r\n*   Are your thoughts and work expressed in ways that leave you free to change tools?\r\n*   Can you take possession of the thoughts you&#8217;ve poured into a tool or service?\r\n*   What happens when your relied-upon experts go out of business?\r\n*   Or, better yet, [what happens when they cash out to Google or Facebook or Yahoo][11]?\r\n*   Do you own the device in your hand? Or, have you just gotten a limited license to use it?\r\n\r\nAnd, this is probably overly clever, but when I write &#8220;change your mind&#8221; I mean both:\r\n\r\n1.  reconsidering your decisions and\r\n2.  *altering your cognitive system*. \r\n\r\nBecause, as I&#8217;ve written before, these things are [cognitive prosthetics][12]—they&#8217;re a part of your thinking apparatus. Again, it goes back to how much time you&#8217;re willing to devote to [sharpening your saw][13] with intentional use of technology.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I resist the notion of allowing parts of my extended mind to be controlled more by third-party experts than me. Even if I choose *for now* to leave myself in their hands, I want clearly marked exits and an escape plan.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Intersection_of_axes\">Intersection of axes</span>\r\n\r\nSo, if freedom {of,from} choice and freedom to change my mind are [orthogonal][2], what does that look like? (Maybe I&#8217;ll come back to this post with a drawing.)\r\n\r\nI would think that a high degree of freedom of choice would leave you quite free to change your mind later. But, I could imagine reworking that [Big Mess &#8216;o Wires][14] would be a huge pain. So, I probably wouldn&#8217;t use a [BMOW][14] as my daily workstation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some of the best designed systems [are trending][15] toward [hoods welded shut][16]. Shouldn&#8217;t it be possible to start from a product of expert design (an iPhone, for instance), only later to pop the cover off (literally or virtually) and do your own thing? There are jailbreaks—but why are you in a jail? And, doesn&#8217;t it seem like they&#8217;d make it airtight if they could?\r\n\r\nIs it just that [app pirates are ruining it for the rest of us][17]? I mean, it&#8217;s mighty convenient to have your customers [locked in the trunk][18]: It&#8217;s harder for them to hurt themselves or the upholstery, and they can&#8217;t easily wander off if you make some turns they don&#8217;t like. But, that&#8217;s tinfoil-hat territory, and I could rant all day.\r\n\r\nAndroid seems to be doing well, and it&#8217;s *mostly* open. I&#8217;ve switched device vendors a few times, and all my apps have survived the changes. I&#8217;ve flashed my own choice of firmware on a few of my phones, and have been pleased. I have a sense of deeper choices available, should I ever want to chase after them.\r\n\r\nPalm&#8217;s webOS devices were *crazy* open—not open source per se, but [you could unlock root with the Konami code][19] and [apply patches to core applications][20]. Alas, webOS crashed and burned at HP. My hunch is that [being open isn&#8217;t what did them in][21], though.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a> (disclaimer: my employer) is headed into that webOS territory with [FirefoxOS][22]. In that currently-coalescing ecosystem, the [apps come from the open web][23], aren&#8217;t gate-kept by a single <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"marketplace\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/Marketplace?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">marketplace</a>, and can even run on non-FirefoxOS devices. I suspect it won&#8217;t be as slick an ecosystem as Apple&#8217;s, [because the loosely-coupled gates will let in more dirt][24]. But, it will be high on the freedom-to-change axis, and the quality of freedom-from-choice options will limited only by the talent of the designers involved.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</span>\r\n\r\nSo, I didn&#8217;t *really* mean to write an advertisement for [FirefoxOS][22]—I work for <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a> because I love the mission, I&#8217;m not trying to shill. Really, I just think it&#8217;s very important to have a sense of your choices and freedoms when you accept technology into your life. And, of course, I have some very strong opinions, but this post and the one before it are intended as more about choice in general than my own choices or angst. If you&#8217;re happy with your choices, even upon close examination, then that&#8217;s great—just keep your wits about you.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/24/freedom-of-from-choice\r\n [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality\r\n [3]: http://store.apple.com/\r\n [4]: https://www.system76.com/\r\n [5]: http://newegg.com\r\n [6]: http://www.gentoo.org/\r\n [7]: http://freebsd.org\r\n [8]: http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/05/homebrewed-cpu/\r\n [9]: http://www.bigmessowires.com/2008/11/28/microsoft-basic/\r\n [10]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdcKwOo7dmM\r\n [11]: http://techland.time.com/2012/07/20/why-google-or-facebook-buying-your-favorite-startup-means-its-probably-toast/\r\n [12]: http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/out-of-our-brains/\r\n [13]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/24/freedom-of-from-choice#p[HIgHca]\r\n [14]: http://www.bigmessowires.com/2009/02/02/wire-wrap-photos/\r\n [15]: http://tech.slashdot.org/story/04/03/04/1337259/your-future-cars-hood-will-be-welded-shut\r\n [16]: http://www.netc.org/openoptions/background/roadster.html\r\n [17]: http://www.imore.com/jailbreak-app-piracy-cost-theft\r\n [18]: http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/07/06/theMicroChannelArchitectur.html\r\n [19]: http://webos.org/2009/06/10/palm-pre-konami-code-dev-mode/\r\n [20]: http://www.webos-internals.org/wiki/Applying_Patches\r\n [21]: http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3062611/palm-webos-hp-inside-story-pre-postmortem\r\n [22]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS\r\n [23]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/apps\r\n [24]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/24/freedom-of-from-choice#p[OtoFoc]",

There&#8217;s a spectrum of choice to be had here, too. But, even with <a href=\"https://www.homebrewing.org/2-Hearted-Clone_p_518.html\">a kit</a>, the process is much more involved than just ordering a pint. I also have <a href=\"http://rogueestate.com/\">friends who are great cooks</a>. When we all get together, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/k1ds3ns4t10n/6114071558/\">it&#8217;s a party</a>.</p>\n<p>But, that party is <em>about</em> the food and drink, about sharing the process and the product. It&#8217;s not a simple date night: The choices are the focus as much as the participants. It&#8217;s a chance to show off and try new things, become experts ourselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"power-and-ease-of-use\"><span id=\"Power_and_ease_of_use\">Power and ease of use</span></h2>\n<p>Where am I going with this? Well, <a href=\"http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/todaysPodcast\">Dave Winer said this in a podcast</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In software, the tricky parts are where the power comes from, and the ease of use comes from where you limit the amount of options. The more limited the options, the easier it is, but the less powerful it is. It&#8217;s just an engineering tradeoff there. It&#8217;s like the tradeoff between heat and motion in physics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The folks at Apple are masters of tasting menus and wine pairings when it comes to consumer electronics. You pick Apple because you don&#8217;t want to think about most of the choices. They have experts in various forms of design, and their products are elegant, beautiful, and generally work great together. It&#8217;s blindingly obvious from their bank balance that this is something people are more than happy to pay for.</p>\n<p>Why? Because you have better things to do with your time than to futz with impedance mismatches and arcane interfaces. You know, like do the things for which you bought the gadgets in the first place (eg. work, play, communicate, etc).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, you have something like the Linux ecosystem. Therein, many others have made choices for you. But, all the choices are still open to you—and many <em>must</em> be made by you. The result is kind of a mess at times, with little or no top-down unifying vision. But, the grit and the loose coupling between the parts are the stuff of freedom. Freedom of choice is dirty and complex, especially when lots of players are involved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"choose-not-to-decide-or-diy\"><span id=\"Choose_not_to_decide_or_DIY\">Choose not to decide, or DIY</span></h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=OnxkfLe4G74#t=70s\">If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice</a>—you&#8217;ve just chosen to let an expert make most of the choices for you.</p>\n<p>What happens when disagree with some of those choices? If you&#8217;re lucky, you can ask for substitutions (or tweak some options). But, you might have to go to a different restaurant (ie. another manufacturer). If you&#8217;re really unlucky, you&#8217;ll find that you disagree with <em>almost all of the restaurants and manufacturers</em>. Sometimes, we just grin and bear it, because switching is too inconvenient.</p>\n<p>And beyond switching, do-it-yourself is just plain hard. You can crawl up the spectrum toward greater freedom-of-choice—but that demands greater knowledge, skill, and attention. You have to discover the choices, make them, and then track what you&#8217;ve done. In fact, it rises to the level of a <em>hobby</em> at a certain point, and you spend as much time (or more) on the infrastructure as the things it&#8217;s there to support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sharpen-the-saw\"><span id=\"Sharpen_the_saw\">Sharpen the saw</span></h2>\n<p>Here, I guess, it&#8217;s a personal decision: How much time are you willing to spend on the devices through which you do your thinking? Because, that&#8217;s what computers, tablets, smartphones, and software are: They&#8217;re <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/out-of-our-brains/\">cognitive prosthetics</a>, addons to your brain that expand your capabilities to think, remember, and communicate. How comfortable are you with the choices made by your chosen experts in shaping the patterns of your mind?</p>\n<p>Me, I&#8217;ve been a hobbyist in this field since very shortly after I learned how to read. My take on the power / ease-of-use spectrum was best put by Doug Engelbart, who asked &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.dougengelbart.org/history/pix.html#6a\">Would you rather ride a tricycle or a bicycle to get across town?</a>&#8221; I&#8217;d rather have the freedom to program and recombine (and crash and twist my ankle), than take on an extra stabilizing wheel or slow down.</p>\n<p>But, even if you&#8217;re not willing to rise to the level of cognitive prosthetics hobbyist, think about <a href=\"https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits-habit7.php\">sharpening the saw</a>. Have you ever tried meditation? Written a journal? Taken training? Practiced a skill? Have you ever taken a critical look at the technology in your life and considered how it&#8217;s serving you and your mind? It&#8217;s all in the same category, to me. It&#8217;s an effort, and it takes time—but it&#8217;s self-investment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"food-for-thought\"><span id=\"Food_for_thought\">Food for thought</span></h2>\n<p>In my head, earlier versions of this were more judgmental: <em>Holy crap how can so many people be so passive about the technology in their lives</em>?</p>\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s obvious: <em>People don&#8217;t have time for this crap. You&#8217;re the weirdo who&#8217;s been doing it almost since birth.</em></p>\n<p>Still, just like attention to diet and exercise (of which I need more, myself), I think intentional use of technology is crucial. Take stock of your choices and freedoms. Be mindful of where you are on the freedom-of / freedom-from spectrum.</p>\n<p>Do your gadgets and services make you more free and capable in ways about which you care? Have you given up things you&#8217;d rather not have given up (eg. time, cost, privacy, flexibility, lock-in, reliability, longevity)? Do you trust what your chosen experts are doing for you, are they working for your interests?</p>\n<p>Of course, in my personal life, it&#8217;s a hobby. And it&#8217;s my job. And I spend way more time on mindful technology than I should, versus mindful eating and living. <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/17/on-the-other-end-of-a-self-imposed-death-march-project\">Like I said</a>, I need to work on that. But, hopefully, I&#8217;ve managed to lay out some ideas in this post about freedom, choice, and technology without coming off as a total angry nerd.</p>\n",

Sometimes, we just grin and bear it, because switching is too inconvenient.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond switching, do-it-yourself is just plain hard. You can crawl up the spectrum toward greater freedom-of-choice—but that demands greater knowledge, skill, and attention. You have to discover the choices, make them, and then track what you&#8217;ve done. In fact, it rises to the level of a *hobby* at a certain point, and you spend as much time (or more) on the infrastructure as the things it&#8217;s there to support.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Sharpen_the_saw\">Sharpen the saw</span>\r\n\r\nHere, I guess, it&#8217;s a personal decision: How much time are you willing to spend on the devices through which you do your thinking? Because, that&#8217;s what computers, tablets, smartphones, and software are: They&#8217;re [cognitive prosthetics][8], addons to your brain that expand your capabilities to think, remember, and communicate. How comfortable are you with the choices made by your chosen experts in shaping the patterns of your mind?\r\n\r\nMe, I&#8217;ve been a hobbyist in this field since very shortly after I learned how to read. My take on the power / ease-of-use spectrum was best put by Doug Engelbart, who asked &#8220;[Would you rather ride a tricycle or a bicycle to get across town?][9]&#8221; I&#8217;d rather have the freedom to program and recombine (and crash and twist my ankle), than take on an extra stabilizing wheel or slow down.\r\n\r\nBut, even if you&#8217;re not willing to rise to the level of cognitive prosthetics hobbyist, think about [sharpening the saw][10]. Have you ever tried meditation? Written a journal? Taken training? Practiced a skill? Have you ever taken a critical look at the technology in your life and considered how it&#8217;s serving you and your mind? It&#8217;s all in the same category, to me. It&#8217;s an effort, and it takes time—but it&#8217;s self-investment.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Food_for_thought\">Food for thought</span>\r\n\r\nIn my head, earlier versions of this were more judgmental: *Holy crap how can so many people be so passive about the technology in their lives*?\r\n\r\nOf course, it&#8217;s obvious: *People don&#8217;t have time for this crap. You&#8217;re the weirdo who&#8217;s been doing it almost since birth.*\r\n\r\nStill, just like attention to diet and exercise (of which I need more, myself), I think intentional use of technology is crucial. Take stock of your choices and freedoms. Be mindful of where you are on the freedom-of / freedom-from spectrum.\r\n\r\nDo your gadgets and services make you more free and capable in ways about which you care? Have you given up things you&#8217;d rather not have given up (eg. time, cost, privacy, flexibility, lock-in, reliability, longevity)? Do you trust what your chosen experts are doing for you, are they working for your interests?\r\n\r\nOf course, in my personal life, it&#8217;s a hobby. And it&#8217;s my job. And I spend way more time on mindful technology than I should, versus mindful eating and living. [Like I said][11], I need to work on that. But, hopefully, I&#8217;ve managed to lay out some ideas in this post about freedom, choice, and technology without coming off as a total angry nerd.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://www.google.com/search?q=tasting+menu\r\n [2]: http://www.alphadictionary.com/goodword/word/zymurgy\r\n [3]: https://www.homebrewing.org/2-Hearted-Clone_p_518.html\r\n [4]: http://rogueestate.com/\r\n [5]: http://www.flickr.com/photos/k1ds3ns4t10n/6114071558/\r\n [6]: http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/todaysPodcast\r\n [7]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=OnxkfLe4G74#t=70s\r\n [8]: http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/out-of-our-brains/\r\n [9]: http://www.dougengelbart.org/history/pix.html#6a\r\n [10]: https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits-habit7.php\r\n [11]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/17/on-the-other-end-of-a-self-imposed-death-march-project",

    "summary": "\n\n<p>Freedom <em>of</em> choice and freedom <em>from</em> choice lay on a spectrum. And, in technology, it&#x2019;s no coincidence that more choice tends to be messier and complex, less choice tends to be cleaner and simple. It&#x2019;s a trade-off between what you choose and what you leave up to an expert.</p>\n"
