It's extremely bugful, but it might do interesting things for Firefox and Safari users.\r\n\r\n[se]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\r\n[re]:http://decafbad.com/2006/11/XoxoOutliner/README.html\r\n[demo]: http://decafbad.com/2006/11/XoxoOutliner/\r\n[lots]: http://decafbad.com/trac/changeset/765\r\n[time]: http://decafbad.com/trac/timeline\r\n[wo]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/06/xoxooutliner-rewrite-coming-now-with-event-delegation\r\n[xo]: http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\r\n[st]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/03/25/about-xoxooutliner \n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087237\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://vdm.cc/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a4dae25fe0faeec4f9ff1ad769a52b36&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://vdm.cc/\">Vincent D Murphy</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087237\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-12T09:14:26\">2006-11-12T09:14:26</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Wow!</p>\n\n<p>This thing is such an improvement.

    "html": "<p>Listening to this <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2006/02/12/530652.aspx\">podcast about OPML and Reading Lists</a> and enjoying the various perspectives on RSS, OPML, and Semantic Web tech.  It&#39;s also the first time I&#39;ve heard Danny Ayers&#39; voice, so that was pretty cool after having been a textual blog acquaintance for a few years now.  As for the rest of the guys on the call, I&#39;m not quite as familiar with all of them yet, but I&#39;ll be adding them to my Reading Lists shortly.</p>\n<p>Apropos of this podcast, I&#39;ve lately gotten a bit of a fresh take on the RSS/OPML versus XHTML versus Semantic Web tech merry-go-round.  Here&#39;s the basic gist:  Invest time into tools that solve problems first and formats that enable possibilities second, if you want to get any attention and subsequent help.</p>\n<p>And then I say &quot;tools&quot;, I don&#39;t mean a GraphViz construct that makes really cool charts for people willing to chase down and install the dependencies.  No, I mean something like the OPML Editor.  The OPML Editor comes in a single package, and you launch it from a single icon.  The OPML Editor is <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty piece of software</a> that&#39;s nonetheless helping me achieve some practical goals that I&#39;ve heretofore been vaguely stymied in reaching.  The OPML Editor is making me think more favorably about OPML, <i>despite</i> OPML being <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty format</a>.</p>\n<p>The utility of the OPML Editor is giving me the motivation to build filters and workarounds to transmute OPML into XOXO and RDF formats, but only when the need arises.  I could also see putting an OPML-to-triples bridge in front of a semweb crawler or tool.  And, there&#39;s no reason why outlines in the OPML Editor couldn&#39;t be rendered in XOXO and RDF formats by the tool itself, if there&#39;s something useful around to consume it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I&#39;ve done enough with RDF and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo_outliner_experiment\">XOXO</a> to see the clear potential in both.  With enough RDF data around, you can turn the whole wide web into a single massively networked database ripe for the querying thanks to a uniform data model and clear specs for representation of that model.  With XOXO and microformats, you get a <a href=\"http://www.sudoku.com/\">Sudoku-esque</a> solution to providing both human and machine readable data in the same format and file, while sterring close to the inherent design principles of the web.</p>\n<p>The problem with these formats, though, is that they open potential avenues but don&#39;t provide value until there&#39;s some foot traffic on the avenues.  This is just establishing a world in which there can exist both chickens and eggs, but not doing much with respect to concrete instantiations of poultry.\nNow, to be fair, there have been efforts to make practical usage of RDF (see: <a href=\"http://musicbrainz.org/\">MusicBrainz</a>) and these are early days for microformats.  But, I think a lot more effort needs to be given toward making useful, personally rewarding tools - and less effort given toward expressing awe toward the potentials given by formats and models.  You can have both, but you&#39;ve got to pick one to start with.</p>\n<p>And, the reason you need to make tools first that use formats second is attention.  (That&#39;s been a buzzword lately, hasn&#39;t it?)  You need attention if you want adoption and help.  And, you can get attention - and subsequent help - by scratching someone&#39;s itch.</p>\n<p>Now, some people&#39;s itches are scratched by the fun of abstract symbol manipulation and the perception of elegance.  Others&#39; itches are scratched by getting work done, like writing or organizing thoughts or expanding awareness of more information sources.  Personally, I&#39;ve got itches of both of these varieties.  The problem is that there are many fewer people with itches in that first category.  And, no offense to anyone, that seems to be the bulk of the RDF and XOXO fanbase at the moment.  For the second category, even if things are shitty, smoke a bit and catch on fire - as long as some work gets done at the end of the day, there&#39;s a lot of tolerance to go around and a lot of motivation to pitch in to improve the situation.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I firmly believe that ATOM, RDF, and XHTML-based microformats trounce OPML, RSS, and the like in terms of clear definition, affordance in manipulation, and technical elegance.  But, OPML and RSS are still winning in the world because the tools using these formats are scratching some damn annoying itches.  And, though towers built atop shitty tools and formats seem Jenga-shaky, somehow they never quite come crashing down.  Maybe they will come crashing down someday, but we seem to be getting work done in the meantime.</p>\n<p>So, to wrap up:  My take on this whole mess is that your format will gain adoption to the degree that the tools producing it help people get work done.  I can&#39;t find tools today for RDF and XOXO that are as rewardingly useful as the OPML Editor has become.  When that happens, the story may change.</p>\n<!-- tags: metablogging rdf semweb webdev opml rss syndication microformats xoxo podcasting -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086877\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e377f3e2140297d32460ae9a4b38ff98&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086877\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-14T02:32:49\">2006-02-14T02:32:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>There's a lot to be said for rough consensus and running code, and there's a lot more running code that speaks OPML than there is that speaks XOXO or RDF.

In this way of working the note contents are maintained as external files, and Tinderbox is used to show their relationships:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>http://lee-phillips.org/osx/tinderbox/tinderext/index.html</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lately I've been thinking that I would like to write notes using templates (Cheetah, etc.) and store their attributes in a standard database, then have .dot files produced by a python program to visualize relationships. All open-source, and portable to any unix-style system. HTML export would almost come free, using one of python's many web frameworks.

    "html": "<p>So, I guess there was a bit of an extended kerfluffle over the weekend.  And as these things usually do, it started out from a very cool idea: You can build a web directory as an outline of links, with some nodes &quot;farmed out&quot; to outlines hosted elsewhere—all through the magic of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion\">transclusion</a>.  </p>\n<p>For example, say you want to host a directory of resources on web development.  But, you might like to let me maintain the section on web syndication feeds.  Well, I can toss you a URL to my outline of RSS and Atom links, and you can just pull it into a branch of your &quot;superset&quot; outline—kind of like an RSS subscription, really.  Whenever I change my outline, yours will automatically get updated with my work.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine this going off into infinity in both directions:  Outlines including outlines including outlines.  Outlines included by outlines included by outlines.  It&#39;s a world-wide outline.</p>\n<p>So, anyway, <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/29/opml-an-awesome-experiment/\">TechCrunch&#39;s brainstorm</a> lead to <a href=\"http://archive.scripting.com/2005/09/29#When:7:36:29AM\">Dave Winer&#39;s kudos</a> and <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/29.html#a11295\">Scoble&#39;s OPML evangelism and an implementation challenge</a>.    But, to this, <a href=\"http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&amp;entry=3305486922\">James Robertson responded by calling OPML a &quot;really, really crappy format&quot;</a>.</p>\n<p>From this ensued a splattering of posts in various places chiming in on both sides:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://brainwagon.org/archives/2005/09/30/1610/\">OPML is a sucky and under-specified format, with implementations subject to approval by one guy</a>.</li>\n<li>OPML is a working format already in use by lots of code, <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/30.html#a11296\">so offer something better or shut up</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/10/01/put-up-or-shut-up/\">Shelley Powers of Burningbird says</a> that the &quot;put up or shut up&quot; attitude is wrong, that it&#39;s &quot;bad technology&quot;.  And, though I do agree with her, the problem is that the usual suspects involved in these sorts of kerfluffles fall on two sides:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We want to see good, well-specified agreements before we code something useful.</li>\n<li>We want working, useful code that we&#39;ll agree is good when we see it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While group #1 is willing to talk/shout things out and reach consensus ahead of time, group #2 wants to forge ahead with machines in motion and reach consensus through popular implementation.  So, members of group #2 will <em>never</em> take group #1 seriously until they&#39;ve &quot;put up&quot;, because that&#39;s <em>their</em> process.</p>\n<p>Personally, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/12/13/oooced\">I sympathize with the dirty ways of group #2</a>.  But, I&#39;ve become convinced that what group #1 does is best over the long term, as some of the early successes of group #2 may become tottering unbalanced stacks of plates later on.</p>\n<p>So...  What to do?  Bah, I don&#39;t know.  But, against my better judgement, I feel like <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/02/web-directories-with-xoxo-and-xsl\">I have an idea or two to &quot;put up&quot;</a>.  </p>\n<p>In the meantime: Members of group #1, stop arguing with members of group #2—you&#39;re not speaking in quite the same languages, and you&#39;re not going to convert anyone.  Just nod &amp; smile, walk away and come up with a better idea, come back and show why it&#39;s better.</p>\n<p>(Oh yeah, and whatever happened to <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/04/16/opml-vs-oml\">OML replacing OPML</a>?)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084228\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.voidstar.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ce83a8e239c0cfce3488d3fec4d5d8de&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.voidstar.com\">Julian Bond</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084228\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-03T07:50:53\">2005-10-03T07:50:53</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Both groups are right.

It is indeed neat. But I'm still struggling to see the point. Does it just re-invent Gopher? Then there's the inspired chaos of it all. At least with something like DMOZ, Yahoo, Wikipedia, the hierarchy has some formalised structure and editors (perhaps community editors). An open mesh of decentralised outlines is going to have lots of dead ends and missing cross links. Perhaps that's just an artifact of the browser Apps we've seen so far and the breadcrumb approach being used. Perhaps it doesn't matter.</p>\n<p>And finally, I'd love to see an OPML browser app written in PHP.

But I have a slightly different take on what that means.</p>\n<p>When group 2 people ask for working code, they aren't asking simply for \"working code\". (Such as your XOXO &amp; XSL thing) They're thinking of an entire <em>system</em> of real users, a real application (need / problem to be solved) etc.</p>\n<p>The reason Dave Winer and OPML will win this, is because Winer really <em>wants</em> shared outlining on the internet. And he knows \"why\" he wants it. He has a vision, and a passion for it. He knows what he wants to do with it. He knows how to make interesting applications with like-minded collaborators. </p>\n<p>You can come up with a \"better\" format than OPML. You might be able to knock off better code overnight. But you do it for a \"lark\" or for some principle of \"doing it properly\".</p>\n<p>Winer doesn't care if its \"crappy\". He just has a drive to make something happen, and OPML is the simplest thing that can possibly work to do that. </p>\n<p>I think that's exactly the right thing to bet on.</p>\n<p>When you say \"I’ve become convinced that what group #1 does is best over the long term, as some of the early successes of group #2 may become tottering unbalanced stacks of plates later on.\"</p>\n<p>I'd be interested in some real world examples. As I see it, \"worse is better\" is the golden rule of computer history, in the long as well as short term.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084232\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084232\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-10T11:34:30\">2005-10-10T11:34:30</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Phil:  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/03/27/oooofc\" rel=\"nofollow\">I've watched Dave's push for shared outlining</a> for awhile now, and certainly he's been working towards it for much longer than I've been watching.  </p>\n<p>And, though it's gotten some mileage through Dave's sheer exuberance and people infected by his cool ideas, it's never quite caught on.  Instead, things like wikis and <a href=\"http://www.jotlive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JotSpotLive</a> and <a href=\"http://www.backpackit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backpack</a> and <a href=\"http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SubEthaEdit</a> have been capturing the users.</p>\n<p>And now, this latest push doesn't look so much like shared outlining <em>per se</em>, but more like a new attempt at <a href=\"http://dmoz.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DMOZ</a>.  And since Google's pretty much <a href=\"http://www.webworkshop.net/dmoz-2005.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">driven a stake into DMOZ</a>, my further interest in Gopher NG is really just a sometimes-interesting problem.  </p>\n<p>I could see some people joining Dave's World Outline effort to get some buzz in their interest niches—trying to be first to get their constituent URLs placed in the new, distributed OPML DMOZ-killer.  And it might be nifty for awhile, but I doubt it'll take hold.</p>\n<p>But as for real world examples of shared outlining, in the particular form Dave's pushing right now... Look at just about anyone's blogroll.  They're almost all in XOXO form <em>right now</em>.  That's the thing:  XOXO is just an HTML list.  It's so unexciting as to be unremarkable—<em>but they're everywhere, right now</em>.  Hell, even OPML has to get converted to XOXO to be used with web browsers—unless you're falling back to some ugly form of tables-as-list.</p>\n<p>XOXO is actually the simplest thing that can possibly work, <em>and people are using and have been using it all along</em>.  I think that's the right thing to bet on, versus OPML.  It doesn't need any evangelism or adoption efforts, other than maybe to remind people of that what they're already using is itself a viable format.  <strong>That's the only reason XOXO has a name.</strong></p>\n<p>I've <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo-outliner-experiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">already shown an in-browser XOXO editor prototype</a>—and believe me, that was easier to implement reliably than anything I've tried with OPML.  I could turn that into a full flown app given sustained free time and interest.

    "body": "So, I guess there was a bit of an extended kerfluffle over the weekend.  And as these things usually do, it started out from a very cool idea: You can build a web directory as an outline of links, with some nodes \"farmed out\" to outlines hosted elsewhere—all through the magic of [transclusion][trans].  \r\n\r\nFor example, say you want to host a directory of resources on web development.  But, you might like to let me maintain the section on web syndication feeds.  Well, I can toss you a URL to my outline of RSS and Atom links, and you can just pull it into a branch of your \"superset\" outline—kind of like an RSS subscription, really.  Whenever I change my outline, yours will automatically get updated with my work.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine this going off into infinity in both directions:  Outlines including outlines including outlines.  Outlines included by outlines included by outlines.  It's a world-wide outline.\r\n\r\nSo, anyway, [TechCrunch's brainstorm][tech] lead to [Dave Winer's kudos][dwk] and [Scoble's OPML evangelism and an implementation challenge][scoble].    But, to this, [James Robertson responded by calling OPML a \"really, really crappy format\"][jr].\r\n\r\nFrom this ensued a splattering of posts in various places chiming in on both sides:\r\n\r\n  1. [OPML is a sucky and under-specified format, with implementations subject to approval by one guy][bw].\r\n  2. OPML is a working format already in use by lots of code, [so offer something better or shut up][scob2].\r\n\r\nNow, [Shelley Powers of Burningbird says][sh] that the \"put up or shut up\" attitude is wrong, that it's \"bad technology\".  And, though I do agree with her, the problem is that the usual suspects involved in these sorts of kerfluffles fall on two sides:\r\n\r\n  1. We want to see good, well-specified agreements before we code something useful.\r\n  1. We want working, useful code that we'll agree is good when we see it.\r\n\r\nWhile group #1 is willing to talk/shout things out and reach consensus ahead of time, group #2 wants to forge ahead with machines in motion and reach consensus through popular implementation.  So, members of group #2 will *never* take group #1 seriously until they've \"put up\", because that's *their* process.\r\n\r\nPersonally, [I sympathize with the dirty ways of group #2][dirt].  But, I've become convinced that what group #1 does is best over the long term, as some of the early successes of group #2 may become tottering unbalanced stacks of plates later on.\r\n\r\nSo...  What to do?  Bah, I don't know.  But, against my better judgement, I feel like [I have an idea or two to \"put up\"][idea].  \r\n\r\nIn the meantime: Members of group #1, stop arguing with members of group #2—you're not speaking in quite the same languages, and you're not going to convert anyone.  Just nod & smile, walk away and come up with a better idea, come back and show why it's better.\r\n\r\n(Oh yeah, and whatever happened to [OML replacing OPML][oml]?)\r\n\r\n[idea]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/02/web-directories-with-xoxo-and-xsl\r\n[oml]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/04/16/opml-vs-oml\r\n[dirt]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/12/13/oooced\r\n[sh]: http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/10/01/put-up-or-shut-up/\r\n[bw]: http://brainwagon.org/archives/2005/09/30/1610/\r\n[trans]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion\r\n[scob2]: http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/30.html#a11296\r\n[jr]: http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&entry=3305486922\r\n[dwk]: http://archive.scripting.com/2005/09/29#When:7:36:29AM\r\n[tech]: http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/29/opml-an-awesome-experiment/\r\n[scoble]: http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/29.html#a11295\r\n[xoxo]: http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084228\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.voidstar.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ce83a8e239c0cfce3488d3fec4d5d8de&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.voidstar.com\">Julian Bond</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084228\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-03T07:50:53\">2005-10-03T07:50:53</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Both groups are right.

It is indeed neat. But I'm still struggling to see the point. Does it just re-invent Gopher? Then there's the inspired chaos of it all. At least with something like DMOZ, Yahoo, Wikipedia, the hierarchy has some formalised structure and editors (perhaps community editors). An open mesh of decentralised outlines is going to have lots of dead ends and missing cross links. Perhaps that's just an artifact of the browser Apps we've seen so far and the breadcrumb approach being used. Perhaps it doesn't matter.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, I'd love to see an OPML browser app written in PHP. Perhaps I'll write one.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084230\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.synaesmedia.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=248a3c4ba8f2972427222d46954f9c1c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.synaesmedia.net\">phil jones</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084230\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-10T04:06:28\">2005-10-10T04:06:28</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I'm definitely a group #2 person. But I have a slightly different take on what that means.</p>\n\n<p>When group 2 people ask for working code, they aren't asking simply for \"working code\". (Such as your XOXO &amp; XSL thing) They're thinking of an entire <em>system</em> of real users, a real application (need / problem to be solved) etc.</p>\n\n<p>The reason Dave Winer and OPML will win this, is because Winer really <em>wants</em> shared outlining on the internet. And he knows \"why\" he wants it. He has a vision, and a passion for it. He knows what he wants to do with it. He knows how to make interesting applications with like-minded collaborators. </p>\n\n<p>You can come up with a \"better\" format than OPML. You might be able to knock off better code overnight. But you do it for a \"lark\" or for some principle of \"doing it properly\".</p>\n\n<p>Winer doesn't care if its \"crappy\". He just has a drive to make something happen, and OPML is the simplest thing that can possibly work to do that. </p>\n\n<p>I think that's exactly the right thing to bet on.</p>\n\n<p>When you say \"I’ve become convinced that what group #1 does is best over the long term, as some of the early successes of group #2 may become tottering unbalanced stacks of plates later on.\"</p>\n\n<p>I'd be interested in some real world examples. As I see it, \"worse is better\" is the golden rule of computer history, in the long as well as short term.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084232\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084232\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-10T11:34:30\">2005-10-10T11:34:30</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Phil:  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/03/27/oooofc\" rel=\"nofollow\">I've watched Dave's push for shared outlining</a> for awhile now, and certainly he's been working towards it for much longer than I've been watching.  </p>\n\n<p>And, though it's gotten some mileage through Dave's sheer exuberance and people infected by his cool ideas, it's never quite caught on.  Instead, things like wikis and <a href=\"http://www.jotlive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JotSpotLive</a> and <a href=\"http://www.backpackit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backpack</a> and <a href=\"http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SubEthaEdit</a> have been capturing the users.</p>\n\n<p>And now, this latest push doesn't look so much like shared outlining <em>per se</em>, but more like a new attempt at <a href=\"http://dmoz.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DMOZ</a>.  And since Google's pretty much <a href=\"http://www.webworkshop.net/dmoz-2005.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">driven a stake into DMOZ</a>, my further interest in Gopher NG is really just a sometimes-interesting problem.  </p>\n\n<p>I could see some people joining Dave's World Outline effort to get some buzz in their interest niches—trying to be first to get their constituent URLs placed in the new, distributed OPML DMOZ-killer.  And it might be nifty for awhile, but I doubt it'll take hold.</p>\n\n<p>But as for real world examples of shared outlining, in the particular form Dave's pushing right now... Look at just about anyone's blogroll.  They're almost all in XOXO form <em>right now</em>.  That's the thing:  XOXO is just an HTML list.  It's so unexciting as to be unremarkable—<em>but they're everywhere, right now</em>.  Hell, even OPML has to get converted to XOXO to be used with web browsers—unless you're falling back to some ugly form of tables-as-list.</p>\n\n<p>XOXO is actually the simplest thing that can possibly work, <em>and people are using and have been using it all along</em>.  I think that's the right thing to bet on, versus OPML.  It doesn't need any evangelism or adoption efforts, other than maybe to remind people of that what they're already using is itself a viable format.  <strong>That's the only reason XOXO has a name.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo-outliner-experiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">already shown an in-browser XOXO editor prototype</a>—and believe me, that was easier to implement reliably than anything I've tried with OPML.  I could turn that into a full flown app given sustained free time and interest.
