I'd kill for self-service checkouts, but as far as I know they don't exist yet (in the UK). In fact, I can't quite work out how they'd work without folk 'forgetting' to scan half their shop and leaving with a bag full of stolen goods.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084908\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084908\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-03T01:29:29\">2005-11-03T01:29:29</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Just once I'd like to use one of them without human intervention.

I often go too quick for it and get the dreaded \"take last item out of bag and scan it\" then have to argue with the person over-seeing it that indeed it beeped and was scanned. I used to be a cashier though. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there are of course those people that have all produce and are forced to look up the codes. Some stores I've been in are good enough to have stickers on the produce with the codes but that seems to be rarely the case these days.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084910\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8157a5907b244071cda98ba5aa7a9635&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084910\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-03T15:26:07\">2005-11-03T15:26:07</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Yeah, I fear that these systems are unmaintainable because they try to do too much, specifically catch someone shoplifting.  So you get those various alerts driven by unexpected weight changes in your bag, for reasons unknown.
