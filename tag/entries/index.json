But, that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing: Some features steal attention from others that are more important. Some could be spun off into add-ons, which are getting easier to make.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>Feel free to comment on this blog post. But, if you feel strongly about these features, you might get a better discussion with more people on <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_thread/thread/fa6f83e781b962a4\">this thread from the <code>mozilla.dev.apps.firefox</code> newsgroup (in Google Groups)</a>.</em></p>\n<p style=\"display: block; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; float:right;\">\n<a style=\"display: block;\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/4925985819/\" title=\"Phone Don't Work No More by Thomas Hawk, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4925985819_9ccbb166f7.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Phone Don't Work No More\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/4925985819/\">Phone Don't Work No More</a> by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/\">Thomas Hawk</a>\n</p>\n\n<p>When&#39;s the last time you used a pay phone? For me, it&#39;s been over a decade—which is about how long I&#39;ve had a cell phone.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/nyregion/19phones.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print\">pay phones have been disappearing</a> for awhile now. Why? Because pay phones are expensive to keep in working order. If more and more people have wireless phones, it&#39;s less likely that any particular pay phone will result in value for the phone company.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-what\">So what?</h3>\n<p>The reason I&#39;m thinking about this is that I&#39;m troubled by a few bugs I ran into in Bugzilla:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622051\">Remove support for microsummaries</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622045\">Remove smart bookmarks support</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622047\">Remove support for tagging bookmarks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049\">Get rid of livemark support</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Are these like pay phones? </p>\n<p>Each one requires engineering effort to keep working from release to release in Firefox. Some of them have issues in performance and functionality that could use some attention. And, the introduction of <a href=\"https://services.mozilla.com/\">Firefox Sync</a>, for example, introduces some new complexities in tracking changes.</p>\n<p>But, do any of these features provide enough value to justify continued attention?</p>\n<h3 id=\"microsummaries\">Microsummaries</h3>\n<p>Ever heard of <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries\">microsummaries</a>? I have, and I thought they&#39;d be neat. I installed a plugin on my blog to offer a microsummary, and I tried hacking them into Delicious at one point during a Hack Day. </p>\n<p>That was about 4 years ago, and I haven&#39;t thought about them much since. Sounds like a pay phone to me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"smart-bookmarks\">Smart Bookmarks</h3>\n<p>I always wondered how those out-of-box &quot;Recently Bookmarked&quot;, &quot;Recent Tags&quot;, and &quot;Most Visited&quot; folders worked in Firefox. Turns out that you can bookmark <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Places_query_uris\">queries against the internal Places database</a> as a persistent search folder. Seems pretty keen.</p>\n<p>But, I&#39;ve been using Firefox for years and only just learned about this in the past month. The feature&#39;s not very exposed, and it&#39;s not obvious how to use it. In fact, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622045#c0\">the bug to remove it might list the clearest hints on using it</a>.</p>\n<p>Seems like it might be a good feature to jettison into an add-on, like a pay phone to play with in your basement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tagging-bookmarks\">Tagging Bookmarks</h3>\n<p>This is a no-brainer for me: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470037857?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;%0D%0Acreative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470037857\">I like tagging my bookmarks</a>. The problem is that I&#39;ve exceeded 16,000 bookmarks. It&#39;s been years since any browser coped well with my corpus of bookmarks—that&#39;s one of the reasons I started really liking Delicious.</p>\n<p>However, tagging bookmarks in Firefox is kind of rough. The UI isn&#39;t awesome, and the database supporting it could use some work. Rather than improve things, though, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622047\">bug 622047</a> proposes removing the functionality altogether.</p>\n<p>Here, I&#39;m conflicted: I don&#39;t use tags in Firefox, because I don&#39;t use bookmarks in Firefox. If they worked better, I might use them. Instead, I use <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">pinboard.in</a> or a private Delicious clone of my own that copes with my scale—in fact, I got to this scale because those services handle it. So, usage data from me would support the feature&#39;s removal despite what I think I&#39;d like to see.</p>\n<p>But, does my <em>suspicion</em> that I would use a feature justify someone else&#39;s time in making it better? I don&#39;t think I can ask for that with a straight face. </p>\n<p>Put another way, I could see how that pay phone they removed from the corner gas station could someday come in handy, but should I expect the phone company to keep it clear of graffiti until I come along with quarters?</p>\n<h3 id=\"livemarks\">Livemarks</h3>\n<p>Live Bookmarks (or Livemarks) are bookmark folders whose contents are generated from RSS and Atom feeds periodically polled by Firefox. They&#39;re feed subscriptions, built into the browser.</p>\n<p>So, when I saw <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049\" title=\"Get rid of livemark support\">bug 622049</a>, my first thought was &quot;<strong>Hey! I&#39;m using those!</strong>&quot; </p>\n<p>I just spent a week building an <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/27/introducing-fireriver-a-river-of-news-for-firefox-4\">add-on powered by Livemarks</a>. I&#39;ve been using <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireriver/\">Fireriver</a> on a daily basis, and I&#39;ve been thinking about trying more experiments. But, if livemarks are going away, then <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c11\">I&#39;m working toward a dead end</a>.</p>\n<p>Like tagging bookmarks, the UI and feed polling code behind livemarks could use some work. My add-on was an attempt to improve the interface, but I did <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=629742\">report a bug</a> on performance issues raised by my import of around 700 subscriptions from Google Reader. That&#39;s just one more strike against livemarks for <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049\" title=\"Get rid of livemark support\">bug 622049</a>.</p>\n<p>In the end, if livemarks go away <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/shared/l.m.orchard\">I&#39;d still have Google Reader</a>. I&#39;ll have blown a week or so on this add-on, though I did learn some interesting things. And, if Google Reader goes away, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764597582?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;c%0D%0Areative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0764597582\">it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve never written a feed reader before</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, this one bothers me the most, in terms of what I want to see for the web itself. <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/27/what-should-be-done-about-feeds-in-browsers\">This is better explored in another blog post</a>, but I want my browser to do more of the surfing for me. I think of bookmarks as long-term relationships to web resources—and livemarks turn those static links into live updates. I can think of a lot of uses for this functionality built into the browser, rather than delegated to <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848\">lobster traps</a> and content silos.</p>\n<p>But, livemarks do complicate things for Firefox engineers. They don&#39;t interact well with Sync, and the feed polling code has cases where it can really drag down the whole browser. And, of course, livemarks aren&#39;t good for much when a laptop&#39;s closed or if Firefox isn&#39;t running. Granted, the former happens more often than the latter for me, but we&#39;re not talking about an always-on server here in any case.</p>\n<p>Are livemarks a pay phone feature? Personally, I don&#39;t think so. I think Firefox is diminished if it loses this feature, rather than taking it further.</p>\n<p>Although I&#39;m reticent to do so, I might just rebuild livemarks in some form with an add-on if they go away. The good news is that add-ons are getting easier to write, which also deserves its own blog post. The bad news is, I might not have time or motivation to do the work myself. But, either, I&#39;m not all that comfortable clamoring for other people&#39;s time for this <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c11\">beyond registering my disagreement</a> and <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c14\">backing off</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Most of these things do indeed look like pay phones to me. Most of them seem not to offer enough value to pay for upkeep. </p>\n<p>Livemarks are the exception, in my mind, but I don&#39;t have answers as to how to fix their flaws. Maybe they&#39;re inherently doomed in the face of ubiquitous computing, maybe they&#39;re just in need of a better execution. But, I won&#39;t expect other busy engineers to drop what they&#39;re doing to come up with those answers in the meantime.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>Feel free to comment on this blog post.

I have bookmarks going back over a decade. Until about a year ago, they were a huge mess and nearly impossible to deal with. The big problem was that the folders were too restrictive and, so, the placement of many bookmarks was pretty arbitrary. So, I finally decided to go through every bookmark, delete all the useless stuff (the vast majority of bookmarks), and attach one or more tag to each bookmark. It took about a week. The result: the organization system now makes sense, and I have few enough bookmarks that I actually use them quite a lot. The problem is that the interface is designed for folders and not tags. I cannot drill down tags like I can with folders. Tags don’t appear in the bookmarks menu like folders. I had to create smart bookmarks to work around this limitation. Even with these artificial limitations in the interface, tags are <em>much</em> more humane than folders.</p>\n<p>My suggestion: deprecate folders altogether. In a future version of Firefox, migrate everyone to tags by converting them to tags. Moreover, fix the interface so as to make sense for tags instead of folders. Do that, and you’ll find that people start using tags. I agree that it’s kind of overkill to have both folders and tags. But the solution is to get rid of the archaic system of forced hierarchy (folders) and give tags the chance they deserve (by greatly improving the tagging interface).</p></div>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085116\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085116\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T07:40:18\">2011-02-07T07:40:18</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>FWIW, if I used bookmarks in Firefox, this is exactly what I'd do.

I don't know where it would show up in my web browser.  I had to Google to find The MozillaWiki describing them as \"Microsummaries are better for labeling bookmarks than static page titles, because they give users quicker access to the most interesting information behind a bookmark, and they give web sites a way to notify users of updates and entice them to revisit the site.\"  If you have your bookmarks open constantly, and are monitoring something, then sure that would be helpful.  But usually if we want real-time monitoring of something, there are other methods that we use.  We have moved to increasing screen real-estate, making tabs into just icons and hiding the bookmark toolbar.  </p>\n<p>I never got the hang of LiveMarks in the browser.  That definitely has a lot to do with UI.  But trying to turn a web browser into a full-fledged feed-reader, as part of the core technology, isn't the right direction.  There are addons, websites, and stand-alone readers that do a much better job.  The more RSS feeds you subscribe to, it quickly overwhelms the basics.  Personally, I do like having the little orange button in my URL bar to subscribe (I have it auto-routing to Google Reader), but that's mostly because it provides a fast way to subscribe instead of me hunting for a link.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Smart Bookmarks and Tags have a lot of potential, especially as the volume of bookmarks grows.  I don't use either of them, but I wouldn't want to see them gone.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085135\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ff6fac10b30d4f19bc083164c4c9b328&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Gruber</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085135\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T14:35:08\">2011-02-07T14:35:08</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>One more thing, I wonder if these arguments against these \"pay phones\" could/will also be made for Panorama and Tab Groups, I personally wouldn't shed a tear for it.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085138\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5406d41679a6d770aac64a86a1d1c815&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">augustm</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085138\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T19:16:39\">2011-02-07T19:16:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Firstly SQL has been broken in Firefox 3.6.x and 4.0b since the summer.\nIt makes searching on tags in bookmarks almost impossible. \nSo tags are mostly broken.

It's somewhat difficult to create microsummaries or smart bookmarks (as a user, without the web site supporting it).  Tags are easy to create, but are presented everywhere as a single list, which makes large numbers of them infeasible (rather than something closer to a tag cloud).  Livemarks... well, they basically have no useful way of showing the summary, just... half a headline :p  Only if it actually opened the feed preview page rather than a useless dropdown...</p>\n<p>As I understand it, it's mostly things getting cut to make the release, then... well, just getting dropped on the floor once the release is out, really.

It sat in my wallet for years until the day my cellphone battery died and all I had was my WIFI iPad. I looked up her phone number in my contacts and called her from the nearest payphone though it was a struggle to find the payphone in one of the most modern building complexes here in Tokyo.</p>\n<p>Another payphone story that came to mind was shortly after the recent Earthquake. Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people walked home. Some walking several hours. In my short walk to camp out a nearby friend's house, I saw people queuing up for payphones after their mobile phones had become unusable due to the mobile network congestion. The line to use the payphone was hundreds of people long. I'm sure that the maximum queue length at that phone in the previous 10 years was 2 people. This experience changed my mind. </p>\n<p>There are much fewer payphones than their heyday 15 years ago when we had payphones with ISDN jacks to plug in your laptop. It is difficult to find one now. Also, payphones are clunky and in Tokyo at least, very reliable. They are going to work, if nothing else works.</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>Pay phones have been disappearing, and so might some Firefox features. But, that's not necessarily a bad thing: Some features steal attention from others that are more important. Some could be spun off into add-ons, which are getting easier to make.</em>\r\n\r\n**Update:** <em>Feel free to comment on this blog post.

For me, it's been over a decade—which is about how long I've had a cell phone.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, [pay phones have been disappearing][pay phones disappear] for awhile now. Why? Because pay phones are expensive to keep in working order. If more and more people have wireless phones, it's less likely that any particular pay phone will result in value for the phone company.\r\n\r\n[pay phones disappear]: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/nyregion/19phones.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print\r\n\r\n### So what?\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm thinking about this is that I'm troubled by a few bugs I ran into in Bugzilla:\r\n\r\n* [Remove support for microsummaries](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622051)\r\n* [Remove smart bookmarks support](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622045)\r\n* [Remove support for tagging bookmarks](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622047)\r\n* [Get rid of livemark support](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049)\r\n\r\nAre these like pay phones? \r\n\r\nEach one requires engineering effort to keep working from release to release in Firefox. Some of them have issues in performance and functionality that could use some attention. And, the introduction of [Firefox Sync][], for example, introduces some new complexities in tracking changes.\r\n\r\n[Firefox Sync]: https://services.mozilla.com/\r\n\r\nBut, do any of these features provide enough value to justify continued attention?\r\n\r\n### Microsummaries\r\n\r\nEver heard of [microsummaries][]? I have, and I thought they'd be neat. I installed a plugin on my blog to offer a microsummary, and I tried hacking them into Delicious at one point during a Hack Day. \r\n\r\nThat was about 4 years ago, and I haven't thought about them much since. Sounds like a pay phone to me.\r\n\r\n[microsummaries]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries\r\n\r\n### Smart Bookmarks\r\n\r\nI always wondered how those out-of-box \"Recently Bookmarked\", \"Recent Tags\", and \"Most Visited\" folders worked in Firefox. Turns out that you can bookmark [queries against the internal Places database][placesuri] as a persistent search folder. Seems pretty keen.\r\n\r\n[placesuri]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Places_query_uris\r\n\r\nBut, I've been using Firefox for years and only just learned about this in the past month. The feature's not very exposed, and it's not obvious how to use it. In fact, [the bug to remove it might list the clearest hints on using it](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622045#c0).\r\n\r\nSeems like it might be a good feature to jettison into an add-on, like a pay phone to play with in your basement.\r\n\r\n### Tagging Bookmarks\r\n\r\nThis is a no-brainer for me: [I like tagging my bookmarks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470037857?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&%0D%0Acreative=9325&creativeASIN=0470037857). The problem is that I've exceeded 16,000 bookmarks. It's been years since any browser coped well with my corpus of bookmarks—that's one of the reasons I started really liking Delicious.\r\n\r\nHowever, tagging bookmarks in Firefox is kind of rough. The UI isn't awesome, and the database supporting it could use some work. Rather than improve things, though, [bug 622047](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622047) proposes removing the functionality altogether.\r\n\r\nHere, I'm conflicted: I don't use tags in Firefox, because I don't use bookmarks in Firefox. If they worked better, I might use them. Instead, I use [pinboard.in](http://pinboard.in/u:deusx) or a private Delicious clone of my own that copes with my scale—in fact, I got to this scale because those services handle it. So, usage data from me would support the feature's removal despite what I think I'd like to see.\r\n\r\nBut, does my *suspicion* that I would use a feature justify someone else's time in making it better? I don't think I can ask for that with a straight face. \r\n\r\nPut another way, I could see how that pay phone they removed from the corner gas station could someday come in handy, but should I expect the phone company to keep it clear of graffiti until I come along with quarters?\r\n\r\n### Livemarks\r\n\r\nLive Bookmarks (or Livemarks) are bookmark folders whose contents are generated from RSS and Atom feeds periodically polled by Firefox. They're feed subscriptions, built into the browser.\r\n\r\nSo, when I saw [bug 622049][], my first thought was \"**Hey! I'm using those!**\" \r\n\r\nI just spent a week building an [add-on powered by Livemarks][fireriver]. I've been using [Fireriver](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireriver/) on a daily basis, and I've been thinking about trying more experiments. But, if livemarks are going away, then [I'm working toward a dead end][deadend].\r\n\r\n[deadend]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c11\r\n[fireriver]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/27/introducing-fireriver-a-river-of-news-for-firefox-4\r\n\r\nLike tagging bookmarks, the UI and feed polling code behind livemarks could use some work. My add-on was an attempt to improve the interface, but I did [report a bug][bug 629742] on performance issues raised by my import of around 700 subscriptions from Google Reader. That's just one more strike against livemarks for [bug 622049][].\r\n\r\n[bug 629742]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=629742\r\n[bug 622049]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049 \"Get rid of livemark support\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, if livemarks go away [I'd still have Google Reader][mygr]. I'll have blown a week or so on this add-on, though I did learn some interesting things. And, if Google Reader goes away, [it's not like I've never written a feed reader before][rssbook].\r\n\r\n[mygr]: http://www.google.com/reader/shared/l.m.orchard\r\n[rssbook]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764597582?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&c%0D%0Areative=9325&creativeASIN=0764597582\r\n\r\nStill, this one bothers me the most, in terms of what I want to see for the web itself. [This is better explored in another blog post][browserfeeds], but I want my browser to do more of the surfing for me. I think of bookmarks as long-term relationships to web resources—and livemarks turn those static links into live updates. I can think of a lot of uses for this functionality built into the browser, rather than delegated to [lobster traps][] and content silos.\r\n\r\n[browserfeeds]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/27/what-should-be-done-about-feeds-in-browsers\r\n[lobster traps]: http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848\r\n\r\nBut, livemarks do complicate things for Firefox engineers. They don't interact well with Sync, and the feed polling code has cases where it can really drag down the whole browser. And, of course, livemarks aren't good for much when a laptop's closed or if Firefox isn't running. Granted, the former happens more often than the latter for me, but we're not talking about an always-on server here in any case.\r\n\r\nAre livemarks a pay phone feature? Personally, I don't think so. I think Firefox is diminished if it loses this feature, rather than taking it further.\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm reticent to do so, I might just rebuild livemarks in some form with an add-on if they go away. The good news is that add-ons are getting easier to write, which also deserves its own blog post. The bad news is, I might not have time or motivation to do the work myself. But, either, I'm not all that comfortable clamoring for other people's time for this [beyond registering my disagreement](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c11) and [backing off](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c14).\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nMost of these things do indeed look like pay phones to me. Most of them seem not to offer enough value to pay for upkeep. \r\n\r\nLivemarks are the exception, in my mind, but I don't have answers as to how to fix their flaws. Maybe they're inherently doomed in the face of ubiquitous computing, maybe they're just in need of a better execution. But, I won't expect other busy engineers to drop what they're doing to come up with those answers in the meantime.\r\n\r\n**Update:** <em>Feel free to comment on this blog post.

I have bookmarks going back over a decade. Until about a year ago, they were a huge mess and nearly impossible to deal with. The big problem was that the folders were too restrictive and, so, the placement of many bookmarks was pretty arbitrary. So, I finally decided to go through every bookmark, delete all the useless stuff (the vast majority of bookmarks), and attach one or more tag to each bookmark. It took about a week. The result: the organization system now makes sense, and I have few enough bookmarks that I actually use them quite a lot. The problem is that the interface is designed for folders and not tags. I cannot drill down tags like I can with folders. Tags don’t appear in the bookmarks menu like folders. I had to create smart bookmarks to work around this limitation. Even with these artificial limitations in the interface, tags are <em>much</em> more humane than folders.</p>\n\n<p>My suggestion: deprecate folders altogether. In a future version of Firefox, migrate everyone to tags by converting them to tags. Moreover, fix the interface so as to make sense for tags instead of folders. Do that, and you’ll find that people start using tags. I agree that it’s kind of overkill to have both folders and tags. But the solution is to get rid of the archaic system of forced hierarchy (folders) and give tags the chance they deserve (by greatly improving the tagging interface).</p></div>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085116\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085116\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T07:40:18\">2011-02-07T07:40:18</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>FWIW, if I used bookmarks in Firefox, this is exactly what I'd do.

I still don't have a clue whether it's working or not.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085128\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0f0f4e5c8446a0f6fd5bd888760eee02&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Benedikt P.</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085128\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T12:55:49\">2011-02-07T12:55:49</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>My bookmarks are organized in a rather flat manner with little to no sub-folders.Being able to tag a bookmark and search and save the searchs (Smartbookmarks?) are much more useful to me.

I don't know where it would show up in my web browser.  I had to Google to find The MozillaWiki describing them as \"Microsummaries are better for labeling bookmarks than static page titles, because they give users quicker access to the most interesting information behind a bookmark, and they give web sites a way to notify users of updates and entice them to revisit the site.\"  If you have your bookmarks open constantly, and are monitoring something, then sure that would be helpful.  But usually if we want real-time monitoring of something, there are other methods that we use.  We have moved to increasing screen real-estate, making tabs into just icons and hiding the bookmark toolbar.  </p>\n\n<p>I never got the hang of LiveMarks in the browser.  That definitely has a lot to do with UI.  But trying to turn a web browser into a full-fledged feed-reader, as part of the core technology, isn't the right direction.  There are addons, websites, and stand-alone readers that do a much better job.  The more RSS feeds you subscribe to, it quickly overwhelms the basics.  Personally, I do like having the little orange button in my URL bar to subscribe (I have it auto-routing to Google Reader), but that's mostly because it provides a fast way to subscribe instead of me hunting for a link.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, Smart Bookmarks and Tags have a lot of potential, especially as the volume of bookmarks grows.  I don't use either of them, but I wouldn't want to see them gone.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085135\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ff6fac10b30d4f19bc083164c4c9b328&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Gruber</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085135\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T14:35:08\">2011-02-07T14:35:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>One more thing, I wonder if these arguments against these \"pay phones\" could/will also be made for Panorama and Tab Groups, I personally wouldn't shed a tear for it.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085138\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5406d41679a6d770aac64a86a1d1c815&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">augustm</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085138\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T19:16:39\">2011-02-07T19:16:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Firstly SQL has been broken in Firefox 3.6.x and 4.0b since the summer.\nIt makes searching on tags in bookmarks almost impossible. \nSo tags are mostly broken.

It's somewhat difficult to create microsummaries or smart bookmarks (as a user, without the web site supporting it).  Tags are easy to create, but are presented everywhere as a single list, which makes large numbers of them infeasible (rather than something closer to a tag cloud).  Livemarks... well, they basically have no useful way of showing the summary, just... half a headline :p  Only if it actually opened the feed preview page rather than a useless dropdown...</p>\n\n<p>As I understand it, it's mostly things getting cut to make the release, then... well, just getting dropped on the floor once the release is out, really.  There's never a focus on polishing things.  But that's pretty much true of all the projects I've looked close enough at, sadly.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder which ones would be next?  Devtools, with the backend sticking around for Firebug? More changes to the URL display on hovering links?

It sat in my wallet for years until the day my cellphone battery died and all I had was my WIFI iPad. I looked up her phone number in my contacts and called her from the nearest payphone though it was a struggle to find the payphone in one of the most modern building complexes here in Tokyo.</p>\n\n<p>Another payphone story that came to mind was shortly after the recent Earthquake. Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people walked home. Some walking several hours. In my short walk to camp out a nearby friend's house, I saw people queuing up for payphones after their mobile phones had become unusable due to the mobile network congestion. The line to use the payphone was hundreds of people long. I'm sure that the maximum queue length at that phone in the previous 10 years was 2 people. This experience changed my mind. </p>\n\n<p>There are much fewer payphones than their heyday 15 years ago when we had payphones with ISDN jacks to plug in your laptop. It is difficult to find one now. Also, payphones are clunky and in Tokyo at least, very reliable. They are going to work, if nothing else works.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>Browsers need help doing a better job using feeds for discovery, aggregation, and publishing on the web to keep us from swimming into self-destructing lobster traps.</em></p>\n<p>Last week, I wrote <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967\">some blog posts</a> about <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967\">Bug 578967</a>, wherein the feed auto-discovery icon in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">Firefox 4</a> has been moved off the URL bar and hidden by default. I support that decision of <a href=\"http://planet.firefox.com/ux/\">the UX team</a>, because <a href=\"https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/\">that feed button is a slacker</a>. And even if it does get used, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/what-happened-to-feed-autodiscovery-in-firefox-4#serving\">I&#39;m not a fan of what it does anyway</a>.</p>\n<p>But, I&#39;ve got lots more rattling around in my head about this stuff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-the-point-of-feeds\">What&#39;s the point of feeds?</h3>\n<p>Feeds—that&#39;s RSS and Atom and maybe even JSON—let robots pull lots of stuff from a bunch of places and pile it all together in one spot for your perusal, analysis, and remixing pleasure. Feed readers and news aggregators do the surfing for you, so you don&#39;t have to.</p>\n<p>But, Twitter and Facebook and others have managed to make <em>the people themselves</em> all gather in one spot. So, to see what those people are saying and doing, you just have to go <em>there</em>—kind of like what feeds promised, right? Only, you go <em>there</em> rather than all that stuff coming <em>here</em>.</p>\n<p>The problem is, even if the logo says it <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dunstan/524137648/\">loves you</a>, the people who made it say that <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/\">won&#39;t always stay in charge</a>. And, someday, when whomever&#39;s left rides off into the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/\">sunset</a>, you&#39;ll learn how much <a href=\"http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Why_Back_Up%3F\">they didn&#39;t care about you</a> in the end.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/herzogbr/2261662706/\" title=\"Flickr Loves You by herzogbr, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2003/2261662706_db086ea4bb_m.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"64\" alt=\"Flickr Loves You\" /></a> <strong style=\"font-size: 200%; padding: 0.5em;\">vs</strong> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/en-us/flickr-yahoo-logo.png\" height=\"50\" style=\"padding: 7px; background: #fff\"></a></p>\n\n<p>For some people and some places, that&#39;s no big tragedy. It&#39;s just a party; you go home when it&#39;s over. You made memories, you hope to find some of those people again elsewhere. <a href=\"http://blog.pownce.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-hello-six-apart/\">Pownce croaked</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/09/six-apart-shuts-down-vox/\">so did Vox</a>, but who cares? There&#39;s always Twitter next door for the afterparty.</p>\n<p>But, what if a world you lived in <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2444\">evaporated while you were on vacation elsewhere for the holidays</a>? I guess you could say that was just a game and, again, who cares?</p>\n<p>What if <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a> went away just like that? People are not only partying there—they&#39;re leaving their visual memories at the coat check. Things are a little more real there, by some definitions thereof.</p>\n<p>What if you never swam into that <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848\">lobster trap</a>, though? What if your words and images and creations were borrowed and copied, but never wholly kept in someone else&#39;s bucket? What if <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a> were just like <a href=\"http://google.com\">Google Search</a>? That is, a collector and an index—but never the host—of photos and conversations?</p>\n<p>Feeds can help make that happen, but not by themselves.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-feeds-belong-in-the-browser\">Do feeds belong in the browser?</h3>\n<p>Well, yeah. Would sites like Twitter and Facebook have been as successful if feeds worked better in the browser? I think so. But, by working better, I don&#39;t just mean improvements to that funky blue thing that showed up in the location bar every now and then. No, I mean all of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Discovery</strong> — help me find and follow interesting people and things</li>\n<li><strong>Aggregation</strong> — give me one spot where what I find and follow is delivered to me</li>\n<li><strong>Publishing</strong> — enable me to post things where people (and their agents) can find and follow</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To me, this is where Twitter and Facebook are totally nailing it. But, much of this can happen in the browser, and I think more of it should. Projects like <a href=\"http://www.rockmelt.com/\">RockMelt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flock.com/\">Flock</a> have seemed promising to me in this context, but have yet to really thrill me. I don&#39;t think they go far enough.</p>\n<p>There is a point where the rubber (client) meets the road (server)—but that point can live <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/howToShareABucketOnS3.html\">so much farther down the stack than it does now</a>. Mind you, I don&#39;t want a revival of <a href=\"http://www.zisman.ca/netgold/\">Netscape Gold</a> as such—but recall that <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm\">&quot;the first browser was an editor, it was a writer as well as a reader&quot;</a>.</p>\n<p>We need some services and hosts out there as rendezvous points for our browsers and agents, but we really don&#39;t need any of those services to collapse into <a href=\"http://buddycloud.com/cms/content/we-are-aol-days-social-networking\">the next all-encompassing AOL-style singularity</a>. There&#39;s money to be made there, but most of us are the product.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whose-job-is-it-anyway\">Whose job is it anyway?</h3>\n<p>I&#39;d like to see my employer, Mozilla, do more with feeds in the browser—and I suspect we will. <a href=\"http://mozillalabs.com/blog/2010/03/online-identity-concept-series/\">Mozilla Labs has had some interesting Concept Series topics</a>, and I look forward to seeing some of those things get pursued further. If I can carve out the time, I wouldn&#39;t mind helping.</p>\n<p>Something I find interesting about feed auto-discovery—the thing that started this latest round of buzz—is that it didn&#39;t originate with browser makers. <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery\">RSS auto-discovery</a> was itself discovered <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/31/oooago\">by bloggers</a>, way back in 2002. It wasn&#39;t until we sussed out the details of that <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links\">HTML link tag</a> and shoved it into our pages that browsers like Firefox started looking for it.</p>\n<p>Hell, even though <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss#History\">RSS started with Netscape</a>, it took <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss.html\">Dave Winer and UserLand and friends running with it</a> to keep it alive and kicking. Now, Dave&#39;s <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/krocCamenProvesRssIsVeryMu.html\">suggested forking an open source browser</a> to show Mozilla how it&#39;s done. I support the sentiment, but there are easier ways to go about this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"making-it-your-job\">Making it your job</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply\">Christopher Blizzard</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>We created add-ons with the original Firefox as a way to be able to say “no” in a constructive manner. If you want something that you think is important to you, you can make an add-on.</blockquote>\n\n<p>That could be taken as a cop-out, but it&#39;s not. With the efforts behind <a href=\"https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/\">Jetpack</a>—now just <em>the</em> <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/12/09/announcing-add-on-sdk-1-0b1/\">Add-on SDK</a>—building add-ons for Firefox is being made easier. Rather than dealing with a morass of XUL and obscure APIs that I know has scared me personally away all these years, you can now do most everything you&#39;d like though <a href=\"https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/sdk/1.0b1/docs/#package/addon-kit\">much-simplified JavaScript APIs</a> and HTML/CSS.</p>\n<p>In other words, if you are a web developer—albeit a fairly advanced one—you can make an add-on for Firefox. Hopefully, as the Add-on SDK advances, the bar to participation will continue to drop.</p>\n<h3 id=\"to-be-continued\">To be continued</h3>\n<p>I&#39;m running out of steam and it&#39;s time for bed, so I think I&#39;ll just trail off for now. I do have a bit more in me, though. The next thing is about taking my own advice in that last section and making some of this <em>my</em> job to fix.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086137\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=52674e2ce2d7671878b26ed534b0c662&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Majken \"Lucy\" Connor</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T06:38:04\">2011-01-27T06:38:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Yay!</p>\n<p>Feeds are soo soo soooo great, but not as live bookmarks. Google Reader is the place to be in terms of functionality, but there's no reason I have to put everything through google.</p>\n<p>When I find a site I like, why should I have to go to it to check for new content? A feed reader brings it to <em>me</em> AND it remembers where I was. I've been trying to get my kids hooked on it, though they seem to forget about it.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the kids, their teachers are getting all technical and they post the homework online, but I've been pulling my hair out for 2 years trying to get them to do it in a way that enables feeds. Several nights it happened that they didn't write down what they had and then we had to remember to check periodically because the homework wasn't updated right away.  </p>\n<p>Right now they're sent home with books with it all written down and I'm supposed to sign that I saw it, but who remembers to look at a book all the time? It's such a complicated process - kids have to write it down in the first place, then one of us has to remember to show it to me. FEEDS!!! No one has to remember, it just shows up where I'm already looking!</p>\n<p>So glad you're on board.</p></div>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086159\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086159\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T20:54:22\">2011-01-27T20:54:22</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Not sure if the homework lists online are behind a login or not, but if it's in HTML we can hack a feed out of it :)</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086141\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=adfd6aa4efe2aa64f5e091abf07f2766&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Bee</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086141\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T08:13:46\">2011-01-27T08:13:46</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>\"Discovery — help me find and follow interesting people and things\nAggregation — give me one spot where what I find and follow is delivered to me\nPublishing — enable me to post things where people (and their agents) can find and follow\"\n..

Not every P is online at all times, so we need store-and-forward services. Some P's have multiple devices and agents, and most of those are behind firewalls and NAT.

Or, at least, finding someone to run it for you who cares about keeping it up, whether through direct payment or other direct incentive (ie. they're family or friends). Otherwise, you still have the problem where what they care about doesn't match what you care about (eg. ad supported services).\n</p><p>But, with the way the user agent picture is splitting up across devices (eg. the cloud, ambient computing), I don't think Firefox will ever be the server.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>Browsers need help doing a better job using feeds for discovery, aggregation, and publishing on the web to keep us from swimming into self-destructing lobster traps.</em>\r\n\r\nLast week, I wrote [some blog posts](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discovery icon in [Firefox 4](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been moved off the URL bar and hidden by default. I support that decision of [the UX team](http://planet.firefox.com/ux/), because [that feed button is a slacker](https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/). And even if it does get used, [I'm not a fan of what it does anyway](http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/what-happened-to-feed-autodiscovery-in-firefox-4#serving).\r\n\r\nBut, I've got lots more rattling around in my head about this stuff.\r\n\r\n### What's the point of feeds?\r\n\r\nFeeds—that's RSS and Atom and maybe even JSON—let robots pull lots of stuff from a bunch of places and pile it all together in one spot for your perusal, analysis, and remixing pleasure. Feed readers and news aggregators do the surfing for you, so you don't have to.\r\n\r\nBut, Twitter and Facebook and others have managed to make *the people themselves* all gather in one spot. So, to see what those people are saying and doing, you just have to go *there*—kind of like what feeds promised, right? Only, you go *there* rather than all that stuff coming *here*.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, even if the logo says it [loves you](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dunstan/524137648/), the people who made it say that [won't always stay in charge](http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/). And, someday, when whomever's left rides off into the [sunset](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/), you'll learn how much [they didn't care about you](http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Why_Back_Up%3F) in the end.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/herzogbr/2261662706/\" title=\"Flickr Loves You by herzogbr, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2003/2261662706_db086ea4bb_m.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"64\" alt=\"Flickr Loves You\" /></a> <strong style=\"font-size: 200%; padding: 0.5em;\">vs</strong> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/en-us/flickr-yahoo-logo.png\" height=\"50\" style=\"padding: 7px; background: #fff\"></a></p>\r\n\r\nFor some people and some places, that's no big tragedy. It's just a party; you go home when it's over. You made memories, you hope to find some of those people again elsewhere. [Pownce croaked](http://blog.pownce.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-hello-six-apart/), and [so did Vox](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/09/six-apart-shuts-down-vox/), but who cares? There's always Twitter next door for the afterparty.\r\n\r\nBut, what if a world you lived in [evaporated while you were on vacation elsewhere for the holidays](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2444)? I guess you could say that was just a game and, again, who cares?\r\n\r\nWhat if [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) went away just like that? People are not only partying there—they're leaving their visual memories at the coat check. Things are a little more real there, by some definitions thereof.\r\n\r\nWhat if you never swam into that [lobster trap](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848), though? What if your words and images and creations were borrowed and copied, but never wholly kept in someone else's bucket? What if [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) were just like [Google Search](http://google.com)? That is, a collector and an index—but never the host—of photos and conversations?\r\n\r\nFeeds can help make that happen, but not by themselves.\r\n\r\n### Do feeds belong in the browser?\r\n\r\nWell, yeah. Would sites like Twitter and Facebook have been as successful if feeds worked better in the browser? I think so. But, by working better, I don't just mean improvements to that funky blue thing that showed up in the location bar every now and then. No, I mean all of the following:\r\n\r\n* **Discovery** — help me find and follow interesting people and things\r\n* **Aggregation** — give me one spot where what I find and follow is delivered to me\r\n* **Publishing** — enable me to post things where people (and their agents) can find and follow\r\n\r\nTo me, this is where Twitter and Facebook are totally nailing it. But, much of this can happen in the browser, and I think more of it should. Projects like [RockMelt](http://www.rockmelt.com/) and [Flock](http://www.flock.com/) have seemed promising to me in this context, but have yet to really thrill me. I don't think they go far enough.\r\n\r\nThere is a point where the rubber (client) meets the road (server)—but that point can live [so much farther down the stack than it does now](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/howToShareABucketOnS3.html). Mind you, I don't want a revival of [Netscape Gold](http://www.zisman.ca/netgold/) as such—but recall that [\"the first browser was an editor, it was a writer as well as a reader\"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm).\r\n\r\nWe need some services and hosts out there as rendezvous points for our browsers and agents, but we really don't need any of those services to collapse into [the next all-encompassing AOL-style singularity](http://buddycloud.com/cms/content/we-are-aol-days-social-networking). There's money to be made there, but most of us are the product.\r\n\r\n### Whose job is it anyway?\r\n\r\nI'd like to see my employer, Mozilla, do more with feeds in the browser—and I suspect we will. [Mozilla Labs has had some interesting Concept Series topics](http://mozillalabs.com/blog/2010/03/online-identity-concept-series/), and I look forward to seeing some of those things get pursued further. If I can carve out the time, I wouldn't mind helping.\r\n\r\nSomething I find interesting about feed auto-discovery—the thing that started this latest round of buzz—is that it didn't originate with browser makers. [RSS auto-discovery](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery) was itself discovered [by bloggers](http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/31/oooago), way back in 2002. It wasn't until we sussed out the details of that [HTML link tag](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links) and shoved it into our pages that browsers like Firefox started looking for it.\r\n\r\nHell, even though [RSS started with Netscape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss#History), it took [Dave Winer and UserLand and friends running with it](http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss.html) to keep it alive and kicking. Now, Dave's [suggested forking an open source browser](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/krocCamenProvesRssIsVeryMu.html) to show Mozilla how it's done. I support the sentiment, but there are easier ways to go about this.\r\n\r\n### Making it your job\r\n\r\n[Christopher Blizzard](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply):\r\n<blockquote>We created add-ons with the original Firefox as a way to be able to say “no” in a constructive manner. If you want something that you think is important to you, you can make an add-on.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat could be taken as a cop-out, but it's not. With the efforts behind [Jetpack](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/)—now just *the* [Add-on SDK](http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/12/09/announcing-add-on-sdk-1-0b1/)—building add-ons for Firefox is being made easier. Rather than dealing with a morass of XUL and obscure APIs that I know has scared me personally away all these years, you can now do most everything you'd like though [much-simplified JavaScript APIs](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/sdk/1.0b1/docs/#package/addon-kit) and HTML/CSS.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if you are a web developer—albeit a fairly advanced one—you can make an add-on for Firefox. Hopefully, as the Add-on SDK advances, the bar to participation will continue to drop.\r\n\r\n### To be continued\r\n\r\nI'm running out of steam and it's time for bed, so I think I'll just trail off for now. I do have a bit more in me, though. The next thing is about taking my own advice in that last section and making some of this *my* job to fix.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086137\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=52674e2ce2d7671878b26ed534b0c662&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Majken \"Lucy\" Connor</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T06:38:04\">2011-01-27T06:38:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Yay!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feeds are soo soo soooo great, but not as live bookmarks.

Whats your opinion on FF (and other browsers) handling of the direct feed url?\r\nI've long wanted browsers to back off from forcing their own baked-in handling (stylesheets, functionality etc).\r\nI've just wanted the simple alert dialog (now standardized for all alerts like geolocation, passwords etc) to appear when necessary before the browser takes over (Like you include with Fireriver auto-discovery).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The obvious example is when a feed specifies its own XSL stylesheet but FF ignores this instruction and the sniffer only cares about the presence of the &lt;rss or &lt;feed element before treating this &#039;document&#039; differently than any other XML document.  This can be overcome with some hacks but that is a moot point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally, the browser will adhere to the content publisher&#039;s (or feed generator&#039;s) instructions on how to handle the presentation of the data.  That plus XSLT is a W3C standard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Definitely interested in your thoughts on this angle of the &quot;feeds in browser&quot; discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sull</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086158\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086158\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T20:52:52\">2011-01-27T20:52:52</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/02/firefox-20-breaks-client-side-xsl-for-rss-and-atom-feeds\" rel=\"nofollow\">I'm not a fan of the built-in stylesheet for feeds</a>.

You send a message to a server, which then sends it to their server, and eventually their mail client picks it up. There are intermediaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BitTorrent relies on trackers (ie. rendezvous points) before you can start transferring chunks, though the distributed hash stuff helps get away from that. But, if all that were easy (including discovery), it would have taken off long, long ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can't go P2P for everything, at least not easily. Not every P is online at all times, so we need store-and-forward services. Some P's have multiple devices and agents, and most of those are behind firewalls and NAT. So, we need servers out there as accessible fixed points that are (mostly) always available. We can try to build P2P meshes that do the same thing, but servers are simpler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, yeah, I do believe that running your own server is the ultimate solution. Or, at least, finding someone to run it for you who cares about keeping it up, whether through direct payment or other direct incentive (ie. they're family or friends). Otherwise, you still have the problem where what they care about doesn't match what you care about (eg. ad supported services).\r\n</p><p>But, with the way the user agent picture is splitting up across devices (eg. the cloud, ambient computing), I don't think Firefox will ever be the server. Even if you connect user agents together with something like Jabber/XMPP, you still need a server out there—though at least that's pushing things in the right direction, since an XMPP server can be agnostic about the messages that go through it</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do have another blog post rattling around in my head about hosting.

This post discusses how you can still use feed auto-discovery, even restoring the icon to the toolbar with a few clicks and a drag.</em></p>\n<p>There&#39;s <a href=\"http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply\">a brouhaha</a> about <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967\">Bug 578967</a>, wherein the feed auto-discover icon in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a> has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, <em>and</em> a Mozilla employee—I&#39;ve got at least a few opinions.</p>\n<p>This post is one of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967\">several on this subject</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feeds-are-too-ubiquitous-to-need-an-indicator\">Feeds are too ubiquitous to need an indicator</h3>\n<p>Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it&#39;s simpler to assume every site has one, rather than keeping an un-lit indicator around to tell you when one&#39;s missing. So, Firefox 4 has an option in the bookmark menu to subscribe to the current page:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-002.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-00.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\n\n<p>The only indicator of a missing feed is that the menu item greys out. Since feeds are everywhere, you should feel comfortable reaching for that subscription menu whenever you like. Of course, this assumes that subscribing to a page falls into the same thought process as bookmarking it—but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an unreasonable notion.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you didn&#39;t know that subscribing to a page was possible—or if you worry there might be people (ie. the potential readers of your feeds) who are in that position—this change may seem problematic. </p>\n<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an unreasonable notion, either. But, I&#39;ll get back to that in a future post.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-feed-icon-isnt-dead-its-just-hiding\">The feed icon isn&#39;t dead, it&#39;s just hiding</h3>\n<p>Even with the new bookmark menu item, the feed subscription button is still available and ready to return to your toolbar in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a>.</p>\n<p>First, right-click somewhere in the empty space of your Firefox 4 toolbar. Try somewhere after the tabs, or somewhere between the toolbar buttons. <a href=\"http://blog.fligtar.com/2011/01/16/how-to-customize-firefox-4s-ui/\">This is how it works on Windows</a>, and this is what it looks like on my Mac:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"220\" height=\"161\" />\n\n<p>Click Customize, and you&#39;ll get a panel like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-01.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\n\n<p>This lets you customize which buttons and controls appear on the toolbar. If you scroll down in the panel, you&#39;ll see a &quot;<strong>Subscribe</strong>&quot; button. Drag that from the panel to a position in the toolbar, and you&#39;ll get a result like this:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-02.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-02.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\n\n<p>Click &quot;<strong>Done</strong>&quot;, and your browser should end up like this:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-03.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-03.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"203\" />\n\n<p>I took my browser screenshots with <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/15/mozillaPleaseKeepTheRssIco.html\">Dave Winer&#39;s screenshot of the old Firefox feed icon</a> for comparison. The result is different, but not radically so. It even enables and darkens when you visit a site with a feed:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-04.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-04.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"271\" />\n\n<p>The main difference is that Dave&#39;s screenshot is the default in Firefox 3.6, whereas mine is the result of the last few screenshots of toolbar customization in Firefox 4 beta 9. That customization is easy, if you know it&#39;s possible—but the worry is, as they say: out of sight, out of mind. </p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082410\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e0ad94a966cfab0b02d938e4bf9cd1c1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\">Felix Pleșoianu</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082410\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T08:00:44\">2011-01-16T08:00:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I have to take issue with some of your points, based on my personal experience. :)</p>\n<p>\"Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it’s simpler to assume every site has one,\"</p>\n<p>Um, no. I follow a hundred webcomics, and while the situation has gotten better recently, many of them still don't have a feed. That's not unique to webcomics, either. Lack of a newsfeed is common enough that being able to tell at first glace is very useful. Heck, many people, even website owners, are ignorant of RSS. More about that in a moment.</p>\n<p>Besides, the feed button serves a second purpose, which is to allow easy access to the feed. Just as I don't want to hunt for an \"RSS\" or \"XML\" link inside the website, I don't want to hunt for it in the browser's interface.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, many people still don't know about RSS. That big prominent orange icon is a big auto-discovery feature, not just in the technical sense, but also because a newbie could see it and click it out of curiosity, and thus learn about feeds. I had to explain what RSS is to someone whose browser didn't have one, and that proved to be quite difficult.</p>\n<p>Of course, all this talk is for nothing as the decision has already been made but, you know.

This could make it a lot easier to work with semi-social sites like del.icio.us and Bloglines.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>The feed button is not dead; it's just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it's not pulling its weight up front. This post discusses how you can still use feed auto-discovery, even restoring the icon to the toolbar with a few clicks and a drag.</em>\r\n\r\nThere's [a brouhaha](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discover icon in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, *and* a Mozilla employee—I've got at least a few opinions.\r\n\r\nThis post is one of [several on this subject](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967).\r\n\r\n### Feeds are too ubiquitous to need an indicator\r\n\r\nFeeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it's simpler to assume every site has one, rather than keeping an un-lit indicator around to tell you when one's missing. So, Firefox 4 has an option in the bookmark menu to subscribe to the current page:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-002.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-00.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\r\n\r\nThe only indicator of a missing feed is that the menu item greys out. Since feeds are everywhere, you should feel comfortable reaching for that subscription menu whenever you like. Of course, this assumes that subscribing to a page falls into the same thought process as bookmarking it—but I don't think that's an unreasonable notion.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you didn't know that subscribing to a page was possible—or if you worry there might be people (ie. the potential readers of your feeds) who are in that position—this change may seem problematic. \r\n\r\nI don't think that's an unreasonable notion, either. But, I'll get back to that in a future post.\r\n\r\n### The feed icon isn't dead, it's just hiding\r\n\r\nEven with the new bookmark menu item, the feed subscription button is still available and ready to return to your toolbar in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/).\r\n\r\nFirst, right-click somewhere in the empty space of your Firefox 4 toolbar. Try somewhere after the tabs, or somewhere between the toolbar buttons. [This is how it works on Windows](http://blog.fligtar.com/2011/01/16/how-to-customize-firefox-4s-ui/), and this is what it looks like on my Mac:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"220\" height=\"161\" />\r\n\r\nClick Customize, and you'll get a panel like this:\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-01.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThis lets you customize which buttons and controls appear on the toolbar. If you scroll down in the panel, you'll see a \"**Subscribe**\" button. Drag that from the panel to a position in the toolbar, and you'll get a result like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-02.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-02.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\r\n\r\nClick \"**Done**\", and your browser should end up like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-03.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-03.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"203\" />\r\n\r\nI took my browser screenshots with [Dave Winer's screenshot of the old Firefox feed icon](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/15/mozillaPleaseKeepTheRssIco.html) for comparison. The result is different, but not radically so. It even enables and darkens when you visit a site with a feed:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-04.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-04.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"271\" />\r\n\r\nThe main difference is that Dave's screenshot is the default in Firefox 3.6, whereas mine is the result of the last few screenshots of toolbar customization in Firefox 4 beta 9. That customization is easy, if you know it's possible—but the worry is, as they say: out of sight, out of mind. \r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082410\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e0ad94a966cfab0b02d938e4bf9cd1c1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\">Felix Pleșoianu</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082410\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T08:00:44\">2011-01-16T08:00:44</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I have to take issue with some of your points, based on my personal experience. :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it’s simpler to assume every site has one,\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Um, no. I follow a hundred webcomics, and while the situation has gotten better recently, many of them still don't have a feed. That's not unique to webcomics, either. Lack of a newsfeed is common enough that being able to tell at first glace is very useful. Heck, many people, even website owners, are ignorant of RSS. More about that in a moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, the feed button serves a second purpose, which is to allow easy access to the feed. Just as I don't want to hunt for an \"RSS\" or \"XML\" link inside the website, I don't want to hunt for it in the browser's interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, many people still don't know about RSS. That big prominent orange icon is a big auto-discovery feature, not just in the technical sense, but also because a newbie could see it and click it out of curiosity, and thus learn about feeds. I had to explain what RSS is to someone whose browser didn't have one, and that proved to be quite difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, all this talk is for nothing as the decision has already been made but, you know.

A built-in HTTP server would be a good start (is there one yet?), plus support for (say) Atom protocol for shoving data out. This could make it a lot easier to work with semi-social sites like del.icio.us and Bloglines. It's notable that these kind of tools have traditionally been very server-driven, with browsers playing (limited) catch up with plugins.

    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>The feed button is not dead; it&#39;s just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it&#39;s not pulling its weight. This post talks about why things have changed.</em></p>\n<p>There&#39;s <a href=\"http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply\">a brouhaha</a> about <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967\">Bug 578967</a>, wherein the feed auto-discover icon in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a> has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, <em>and</em> a Mozilla employee—I&#39;ve got at least a few opinions.</p>\n<p>This post is one of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967\">several on this subject</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defaults-are-hard-to-pare-down\">Defaults are hard to pare down</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/how-to-use-feed-auto-discovery-in-firefox-4\">feed icon still lives</a> in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a>; it&#39;s just not there by default any more. But, if you look at the controls available in <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png\">the toolbar customization panel</a>, you&#39;ll notice a <em>lot</em> of things that don&#39;t show up by default—there are a lot of things in there, period.</p>\n<p>This is the dilemma for <a href=\"http://planet.firefox.com/ux/\">the Firefox User Experience team at Mozilla</a>: Like it or not, one of the main themes of this next generation of browsers is minimalism—faster, smaller, less browser to get in the way of what you&#39;re browsing. Yet, at the same time, Firefox 4 has the features of Firefox 3.6 and more.</p>\n<p>You can&#39;t just cram it all in there, so what gets prime real estate by default? People say it&#39;s just a few pixels, that feed button—but is it so much more important than anything else that could go there? And before you answer, consider that not just for your personal use, but for the 100&#39;s of millions of people using Firefox. How do you check your own biases and make a decision on that scale? You could make an educated guess, make a gut check. A lot of brilliant design happens that way.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/\">gather some telemetry from beta installs to see what people really use</a>. Looking at a heatmap of clicks, the feed button is an absolute stinker. This isn&#39;t a random whim of the UX team—seriously, it&#39;s an <strong>order of magnitude</strong> less used than anything else in the toolbar (notice the one black spot):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/heatmap.png\" alt=\"heatmap.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"75\" /></a></p>\n<p>There have been comments dismissing the validity of that heatmap study. But, as far as I can tell, none of them really stick. So, for the sake of argument and a shorter blog post, let&#39;s assume barely anyone is using the feed icon and that it&#39;s not pulling its weight in this new age of browser minimalism.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that Firefox isn&#39;t the only browser to deprioritize the feed button: <em>Google Chrome doesn&#39;t even have a feed button at all</em>, and for many people that&#39;s the gold standard for minimal browser UI:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-chrome.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-chrome.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\n\n<p><a name=\"serving\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"serving-the-users\">Serving the users</h3>\n<p>Let&#39;s hammer on the point of disuse some more—what&#39;s the payoff for clicking that thing, anyway?</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-styling.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-styling.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" />\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>+1 — You get an option to create a <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/livebookmarks.html\">Live Bookmark</a>, which is really handy for things like Bugzilla searches or light headline reading. (I like those so much that I tried building them on the server at Delicious once, but we never quite worked it out at scale.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>0 — You get a list of sites to which Firefox will delegate subscription, if you happen to have <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM:window.navigator.registerContentHandler\">installed a content handler</a>. Useful if you know what it&#39;s about; a mystery if you don&#39;t—not much more useful than a bookmarklet, to me.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>-1 — You get a plainly-styled version of what you were probably already looking at on a site, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/02/firefox-20-breaks-client-side-xsl-for-rss-and-atom-feeds\">something I criticized back in 2006</a>, like some are criticizing the feed icon change now.  (At the time, I was working for <a href=\"http://organic.com\">a marketing company</a>, and the change cost me days trying to incorporate branding in feeds on <a href=\"http://www.jeep.com/en/autoshow/feeds/jeep-all.xml\">a client&#39;s site</a>. I think we gave up after a bit, but I suspect that <a href=\"http://feedburner.com\">FeedBurner</a> built a nice business routing around that change.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#39;s been status quo for years, and it&#39;s less than compelling—I&#39;ve even had people ask me if they broke the page when the button was clicked on accident.</p>\n<p>So, given little reward for clicking that feed icon, <em>pushing it into the background in <strong>its current state</strong> is a service to the users of Firefox<em>. In other words, that feed button has to get a lot more interesting if it&#39;s going to serve alongside UI all-stars like <strong>Back</strong>, <strong>Reload</strong>, and **Location</em></em>. </p>\n<p>Hell, even with Firebug installed, I use <strong>View Source</strong> more than the feed button these days, and I&#39;ve never stuck <em>that</em> on the toolbar.</p>\n<h3 id=\"leading-the-web\">Leading the web</h3>\n<p>The most compelling response I&#39;ve seen to the &quot;removal&quot; of the feed auto-discovery button is the challenge that Mozilla and other browser makers should be <em>improving</em> feed-related features, rather than pushing them into the background. With this, I wholeheartedly agree—but I&#39;m not entirely sure what to do about it.</p>\n<p>So, there&#39;s a balance here: Make the <strong>experience of the web better</strong> by improving how Firefox handles what&#39;s already out there, and <strong>make the web itself better</strong> by building more powerful and enabling technologies into Firefox and other products. In the best of times, Mozilla can do and has done both at once. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL\">WebGL</a> and technologies associated with HTML5 represent great examples of this.</p>\n<p>But, alas, syndication feeds in the browser have stagnated. The feed button has been a weak feature <em>for years</em>. In the meantime, other things have taken priority in the Firefox project. The rise of Twitter and Facebook and more complex applications on the web have reduced the need for most people to interact directly with feeds, so demands for attention to the feed button haven&#39;t exactly topped the charts in comparison to things like <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/The%20Adobe%20Flash%20plugin%20has%20crashed\">making sure Flash doesn&#39;t crash the browser</a> and <a href=\"http://arewefastyet.com/\">getting super fast</a> for everything else. </p>\n<h3 id=\"ship-it\">Ship it!</h3>\n<p>In the end, Mozilla has a browser to ship. The decision on the feed button <em>has been made</em> and, believe it or not, with a great deal of thought behind it. </p>\n<p>I know that this is the first time many people have heard of this change, but many already have heard and have given the UX team a number of earsful. Coming in at this late stage and requesting—nay <strong>demanding</strong>—a reversal of that decision will do nothing but piss off all the people who&#39;ve been banging away at this and many other things up to now. They&#39;re people who&#39;ve worked hard, stayed up late—and the last thing anyone wants to do is rehash every conversation ever about the topic.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089393\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=478a310fc648c632ba1a3c120437289b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jacques</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089393\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T07:22:31\">2011-01-16T07:22:31</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I understand that we always try to enhance UI of any software and that it takes a lot of time and discussions to make decisions.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>The feed button is not dead; it's just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it's not pulling its weight. This post talks about why things have changed.</em>\r\n\r\nThere's [a brouhaha](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discover icon in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, *and* a Mozilla employee—I've got at least a few opinions.\r\n\r\nThis post is one of [several on this subject](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967).\r\n\r\n### Defaults are hard to pare down\r\n\r\nThe [feed icon still lives](http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/how-to-use-feed-auto-discovery-in-firefox-4) in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/); it's just not there by default any more. But, if you look at the controls available in [the toolbar customization panel](http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png), you'll notice a *lot* of things that don't show up by default—there are a lot of things in there, period.\r\n\r\nThis is the dilemma for [the Firefox User Experience team at Mozilla](http://planet.firefox.com/ux/): Like it or not, one of the main themes of this next generation of browsers is minimalism—faster, smaller, less browser to get in the way of what you're browsing. Yet, at the same time, Firefox 4 has the features of Firefox 3.6 and more.\r\n\r\nYou can't just cram it all in there, so what gets prime real estate by default? People say it's just a few pixels, that feed button—but is it so much more important than anything else that could go there? And before you answer, consider that not just for your personal use, but for the 100's of millions of people using Firefox. How do you check your own biases and make a decision on that scale? You could make an educated guess, make a gut check. A lot of brilliant design happens that way.\r\n\r\nYou can also [gather some telemetry from beta installs to see what people really use](https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/). Looking at a heatmap of clicks, the feed button is an absolute stinker. This isn't a random whim of the UX team—seriously, it's an **order of magnitude** less used than anything else in the toolbar (notice the one black spot):\r\n\r\n[<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/heatmap.png\" alt=\"heatmap.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"75\" />](https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/)\r\n\r\nThere have been comments dismissing the validity of that heatmap study. But, as far as I can tell, none of them really stick. So, for the sake of argument and a shorter blog post, let's assume barely anyone is using the feed icon and that it's not pulling its weight in this new age of browser minimalism.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that Firefox isn't the only browser to deprioritize the feed button: *Google Chrome doesn't even have a feed button at all*, and for many people that's the gold standard for minimal browser UI:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-chrome.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-chrome.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\r\n\r\n<a name=\"serving\"></a>\r\n### Serving the users\r\n\r\nLet's hammer on the point of disuse some more—what's the payoff for clicking that thing, anyway?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-styling.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-styling.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" />\r\n\r\n* +1 — You get an option to create a [Live Bookmark](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/livebookmarks.html), which is really handy for things like Bugzilla searches or light headline reading. (I like those so much that I tried building them on the server at Delicious once, but we never quite worked it out at scale.)\r\n\r\n* 0 — You get a list of sites to which Firefox will delegate subscription, if you happen to have [installed a content handler](https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM:window.navigator.registerContentHandler). Useful if you know what it's about; a mystery if you don't—not much more useful than a bookmarklet, to me.\r\n\r\n* -1 — You get a plainly-styled version of what you were probably already looking at on a site, [something I criticized back in 2006](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/02/firefox-20-breaks-client-side-xsl-for-rss-and-atom-feeds), like some are criticizing the feed icon change now.  (At the time, I was working for [a marketing company](http://organic.com), and the change cost me days trying to incorporate branding in feeds on [a client's site](http://www.jeep.com/en/autoshow/feeds/jeep-all.xml). I think we gave up after a bit, but I suspect that [FeedBurner](http://feedburner.com) built a nice business routing around that change.)\r\n\r\nThat's been status quo for years, and it's less than compelling—I've even had people ask me if they broke the page when the button was clicked on accident.\r\n\r\nSo, given little reward for clicking that feed icon, *pushing it into the background in **its current state** is a service to the users of Firefox*. In other words, that feed button has to get a lot more interesting if it's going to serve alongside UI all-stars like **Back**, **Reload**, and **Location**. \r\n\r\nHell, even with Firebug installed, I use **View Source** more than the feed button these days, and I've never stuck *that* on the toolbar.\r\n\r\n### Leading the web\r\n\r\nThe most compelling response I've seen to the \"removal\" of the feed auto-discovery button is the challenge that Mozilla and other browser makers should be *improving* feed-related features, rather than pushing them into the background. With this, I wholeheartedly agree—but I'm not entirely sure what to do about it.\r\n\r\nSo, there's a balance here: Make the **experience of the web better** by improving how Firefox handles what's already out there, and **make the web itself better** by building more powerful and enabling technologies into Firefox and other products. In the best of times, Mozilla can do and has done both at once. [WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) and technologies associated with HTML5 represent great examples of this.\r\n\r\nBut, alas, syndication feeds in the browser have stagnated. The feed button has been a weak feature *for years*. In the meantime, other things have taken priority in the Firefox project. The rise of Twitter and Facebook and more complex applications on the web have reduced the need for most people to interact directly with feeds, so demands for attention to the feed button haven't exactly topped the charts in comparison to things like [making sure Flash doesn't crash the browser](https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/The%20Adobe%20Flash%20plugin%20has%20crashed) and [getting super fast](http://arewefastyet.com/) for everything else. \r\n\r\n### Ship it!\r\n\r\nIn the end, Mozilla has a browser to ship. The decision on the feed button *has been made* and, believe it or not, with a great deal of thought behind it. \r\n\r\nI know that this is the first time many people have heard of this change, but many already have heard and have given the UX team a number of earsful. Coming in at this late stage and requesting—nay **demanding**—a reversal of that decision will do nothing but piss off all the people who've been banging away at this and many other things up to now. They're people who've worked hard, stayed up late—and the last thing anyone wants to do is rehash every conversation ever about the topic.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089393\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=478a310fc648c632ba1a3c120437289b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Jacques</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089393\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T07:22:31\">2011-01-16T07:22:31</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I understand that we always try to enhance UI of any software and that it takes a lot of time and discussions to make decisions.

    "html": "<p><em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Don&#39;t depend on Delicious; host your own, pay for it elsewhere, or hope for the best. Use real-time feeds to stitch the bookmarking diaspora back together into topical aggregate indexes.</em></p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2010/12/18/less-del-icio-us-than-ever-before\">the last entry</a>, I wrote about why my use of Delicious has dropped over time, and what I&#39;ve been missing as a result. In short, I think there&#39;s place for something like Delicious, and I&#39;d like to get back to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> See also, &quot;<a href=\"http://uniquehazards.tumblr.com/post/2377362882/we-can-save-delicious-but-probably-not-in-the-way-you\">We can save Delicious, but probably not in the way you think</a>&quot; from Stephen Hood, one of my former Delicious co-workers. He covers some more good angles I didn&#39;t get around to here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"active-thoughts\">Active thoughts</h2>\n<p>So, it&#39;s true <a href=\"http://blog.delicious.com/\">Yahoo! announced</a> that they&#39;re &quot;actively thinking about the future of Delicious&quot; and that &quot;we believe there is a home outside the company&quot;. But, none of that says they&#39;ve found a home or that it will be easy to transplant if they do. In the meantime, there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty and probably only an overworked skeleton crew left onboard.</p>\n<p>Much of Delicious now depends on home-grown technology that is shared by many other Yahoo! properties. This should not be a surprise: Beyond the money, <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2005/12/09/yahoo-acquires-delicious/\">that was kind of the point of selling to Yahoo! in particular</a>.

All of these bookmarks would be somehow merged to produce intelligent data.\nKind of what Automattic does with WordPress.org and WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>Aside, this new Delicious system should have a more \"sharing\" side with ability for networkers to comment on each bookmark, \"redeli\" the bookmark (like retweet), etc... Unite bookmark and twitter functions - What Yahoo! should have try to developp during these past five years and failed to.\nI already tried to find some link posted in the past in my Twitter stream, and it made me really angry and frustrated. And I didn't succeed. Twitter is nice but still has a too bad signal-to-noise ratio : Tweets are way too much passing, impossible to organized, and replies are not enough differentiated from normal tweet.</p>\n<p>What could be an ideal way to go is a WordPress plugin. Based on already there custom post type system, tags system, comments sytem...\nWordPress is already a successful product, widely used. It would make easier the process of leaving current doomed delicious to a decentralized system.</p>\n<p>And Automattic should integrate this plugin to their WordPress.com blogs. They even would not have to buy Delicious to Yahoo!, just spread the word and invite people to subscribe to their service and import their delicious data.</p>\n<p>Finally, imagine that Automattic creates a subdomain of wordpress.com where all the data (bookmarks and data) would be gathered. The plugin on self hosted blogs would propose to the owner to share his personal bookmarks data with this website via an API.\nA network could be based on wordpress.com optional subscription.</p>\n<p>I don't have any personal or business interest in Automattic (just a WordPress user) but it seems the perfect way to go.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087684\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087684\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T16:49:26\">2010-12-20T16:49:26</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>@Rogers: Yeah, I totally glossed over the horrors of sysadmin work and security.

But, none of that says they've found a home or that it will be easy to transplant if they do. In the meantime, there's a lot of uncertainty and probably only an overworked skeleton crew left onboard.\r\n\r\nMuch of Delicious now depends on home-grown technology that is shared by many other Yahoo! properties. This should not be a surprise: Beyond the money, [that was kind of the point of selling to Yahoo! in particular][sellyahoo].

There are interesting alternatives that don't involve handing everything over to someone who doesn't actually care about you and your stuff.\r\n\r\nAnd, if it turns out that social bookmarking settles down into a small but highly involved niche of curators, so much the better that they keep their own lights on.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087678\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://workbench.cadenhead.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=70fe121c9172e9882762d7f28f233567&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://workbench.cadenhead.org/\">Rogers Cadenhead</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087678\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T05:44:29\">2010-12-20T05:44:29</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hosting is cheap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Running web applications on your own server securely and reliably is expensive, assuming you value your own time.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087680\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bb266673ec59acafd5d3ed68238551a5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">JB</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087680\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T10:05:58\">2010-12-20T10:05:58</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I really like this article.\r\nThere should indeed be a system where you can self-host your bookmarks with some CMS and a centralized site for less techy people. All of these bookmarks would be somehow merged to produce intelligent data.\r\nKind of what Automattic does with WordPress.org and WordPress.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside, this new Delicious system should have a more \"sharing\" side with ability for networkers to comment on each bookmark, \"redeli\" the bookmark (like retweet), etc... Unite bookmark and twitter functions - What Yahoo! should have try to developp during these past five years and failed to.\r\nI already tried to find some link posted in the past in my Twitter stream, and it made me really angry and frustrated. And I didn't succeed. Twitter is nice but still has a too bad signal-to-noise ratio : Tweets are way too much passing, impossible to organized, and replies are not enough differentiated from normal tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What could be an ideal way to go is a WordPress plugin. Based on already there custom post type system, tags system, comments sytem...\r\nWordPress is already a successful product, widely used. It would make easier the process of leaving current doomed delicious to a decentralized system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Automattic should integrate this plugin to their WordPress.com blogs. They even would not have to buy Delicious to Yahoo!, just spread the word and invite people to subscribe to their service and import their delicious data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, imagine that Automattic creates a subdomain of wordpress.com where all the data (bookmarks and data) would be gathered. The plugin on self hosted blogs would propose to the owner to share his personal bookmarks data with this website via an API.\r\nA network could be based on wordpress.com optional subscription.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't have any personal or business interest in Automattic (just a WordPress user) but it seems the perfect way to go.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087684\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087684\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-12-20T16:49:26\">2010-12-20T16:49:26</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@Rogers: Yeah, I totally glossed over the horrors of sysadmin work and security.

    "html": "<p><em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/firefox-sync-appengine\">I built an implementation</a> of the <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Sync/1.0/API\">Firefox Sync server API</a> for <a href=\"http://appengine.google.com/\">Google App Engine</a>.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\" style=\"float: right; padding: 0 0 0em 0em; display: block; text-decoration: none; border: none\"><img src=\"http://mozcom-cdn.mozilla.net/img/firefox/sync/sync-background.png\" style=\"border: none\" /></a></p>\n<p>To celebrate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_%28United_States%29\">Independence Day</a>, I figured I might take a shot at liberating <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\">Firefox Sync</a> from the tyranny of <a href=\"https://services.mozilla.com/\">Mozilla&#39;s servers</a>. </p>\n<p>Thus, over the past few days, I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/firefox-sync-appengine\">built a sync server</a> using the <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Sync/1.0/API\">1.0 Sync API</a>, hosted on <a href=\"http://appengine.google.com/\">Google App Engine</a>.</p>\n<p>I lied about the <em>tyranny</em> thing, though—I just wanted to say something clever about the holiday. In reality, with respect to <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\">Firefox Sync</a>, Mozilla has done all of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Published <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Sync/1.0/API\">the Sync API spec</a>;</li>\n<li>Released <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/services/sync-server/\">the source code for the server used in-house</a>;</li>\n<li>Explicitly included the option to use a custom server when setting up sync in the browser.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This means that, although Mozilla offers servers to go along with <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\">Firefox Sync</a>, you&#39;re totally free to take your data elsewhere. Since your sync data is encrypted and practically opaque to the server, there&#39;s no direct profit for Mozilla in offering free sync hosting—not even through any clandestine data mining for devious purposes. It&#39;s just that sync makes Firefox a better browser, and <em>somebody</em> has to run some servers to make it work.</p>\n<p>So, there&#39;s every incentive to make it easy for you to switch sync providers and <em>stop freeloading</em> on Mozilla&#39;s servers. Building a server on <a href=\"http://appengine.google.com/\">Google App Engine</a> means I can freeload on <em>Google&#39;s</em> servers!</p>\n<p>I kid, of course. No one&#39;s really complaining about freeloaders, and App Engine has quotas in place to head off any serious mooching—which is why I&#39;m not telling you where to find <em>my</em> sync server deployed on Google App Engine, by the way. </p>\n<p>No, I did this because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firefox Sync and Google App Engine are interesting and important technologies;</li>\n<li>I&#39;ve already done a bit of work on the PHP-based Firefox Sync server at Mozilla;</li>\n<li>I really wanted to take a break from PHP and spend some time with my old friend Python.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are, of course, a number of bugs in this server. But, it seems to be working between a number of machines and browser profiles I have at home. Things are really in need of optimization, it suffers from my inexperience with App Engine, and I keep running into those aforementioned App Engine resource limits—especially when updating or deleting large numbers of items (ie. 1000&#39;s to 10000&#39;s of items).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/firefox-sync-appengine\"><em>Pull requests and issue reports on GitHub are welcome!</em></a></p>\n<p>A next step I&#39;d like to take with this thing is to revisit another old friend, the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer\">desktop web app server</a>. (Also known as the <a href=\"http://www.scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/04/desktopWebsites.html#4\">desktop website</a>.) It seems to me that it would be interesting to scale this server down to a household appliance—say, just for use by my wife and I.</p>\n<p>I&#39;d be especially happy if the work I&#39;m doing for a Google-hosted app could be self-hosted at home. Seeing as the development environment for App Engine runs on my laptop, I&#39;m willing to bet I can hack the whole shebang into a simple, special-purpose app to download and double-click on a home desktop PC for use as your sync hub.</p>\n<p>Anyway, <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/firefox-sync-appengine\">check it out</a> and let me know what you think.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088097\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://coffeeonthekeyboard.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8371744716a9335eb3dcae228fd9d996&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://coffeeonthekeyboard.com/\">James Socol</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088097\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-07-06T01:28:02\">2010-07-06T01:28:02</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Assuming you already had a network and a Mac Mini or something at home, it would be pretty interesting to run your own small Sync server just to keep your home computers together.

    "body": "<em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> [I built an implementation][impl] of the [Firefox Sync server API][api10] for [Google App Engine][appengine].</em>\r\n\r\n[impl]: http://github.com/lmorchard/firefox-sync-appengine\r\n[api10]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Sync/1.0/API\r\n[appengine]: http://appengine.google.com/\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\" style=\"float: right; padding: 0 0 0em 0em; display: block; text-decoration: none; border: none\"><img src=\"http://mozcom-cdn.mozilla.net/img/firefox/sync/sync-background.png\" style=\"border: none\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTo celebrate [Independence Day][july4], I figured I might take a shot at liberating [Firefox Sync][sync] from the tyranny of [Mozilla's servers][servers]. \r\n\r\nThus, over the past few days, I've [built a sync server][impl] using the [1.0 Sync API][api10], hosted on [Google App Engine][appengine].\r\n\r\nI lied about the *tyranny* thing, though—I just wanted to say something clever about the holiday. In reality, with respect to [Firefox Sync][sync], Mozilla has done all of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Published [the Sync API spec][api10];\r\n2. Released [the source code for the server used in-house][sync-server];\r\n3. Explicitly included the option to use a custom server when setting up sync in the browser.\r\n\r\nThis means that, although Mozilla offers servers to go along with [Firefox Sync][sync], you're totally free to take your data elsewhere. Since your sync data is encrypted and practically opaque to the server, there's no direct profit for Mozilla in offering free sync hosting—not even through any clandestine data mining for devious purposes. It's just that sync makes Firefox a better browser, and *somebody* has to run some servers to make it work.\r\n\r\nSo, there's every incentive to make it easy for you to switch sync providers and *stop freeloading* on Mozilla's servers. Building a server on [Google App Engine][appengine] means I can freeload on *Google's* servers!\r\n\r\nI kid, of course. No one's really complaining about freeloaders, and App Engine has quotas in place to head off any serious mooching—which is why I'm not telling you where to find *my* sync server deployed on Google App Engine, by the way. \r\n\r\nNo, I did this because:\r\n\r\n* Firefox Sync and Google App Engine are interesting and important technologies;\r\n* I've already done a bit of work on the PHP-based Firefox Sync server at Mozilla;\r\n* I really wanted to take a break from PHP and spend some time with my old friend Python.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, a number of bugs in this server. But, it seems to be working between a number of machines and browser profiles I have at home. Things are really in need of optimization, it suffers from my inexperience with App Engine, and I keep running into those aforementioned App Engine resource limits—especially when updating or deleting large numbers of items (ie. 1000's to 10000's of items).\r\n\r\n[*Pull requests and issue reports on GitHub are welcome!*][impl]\r\n\r\nA next step I'd like to take with this thing is to revisit another old friend, the [desktop web app server][desktopserver]. (Also known as the [desktop website][dw].) It seems to me that it would be interesting to scale this server down to a household appliance—say, just for use by my wife and I.\r\n\r\nI'd be especially happy if the work I'm doing for a Google-hosted app could be self-hosted at home. Seeing as the development environment for App Engine runs on my laptop, I'm willing to bet I can hack the whole shebang into a simple, special-purpose app to download and double-click on a home desktop PC for use as your sync hub.\r\n\r\nAnyway, [check it out][impl] and let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n[dw]: http://www.scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/04/desktopWebsites.html#4\r\n[dave]: http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html\r\n[desktopserver]: http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer\r\n[sync-server]: http://hg.mozilla.org/services/sync-server/\r\n[july4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_%28United_States%29\r\n[sync]: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\r\n[servers]: https://services.mozilla.com/\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088097\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://coffeeonthekeyboard.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8371744716a9335eb3dcae228fd9d996&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://coffeeonthekeyboard.com/\">James Socol</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088097\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-07-06T01:28:02\">2010-07-06T01:28:02</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Assuming you already had a network and a Mac Mini or something at home, it would be pretty interesting to run your own small Sync server just to keep your home computers together.

    "html": "<p>I&#39;ve lived a very focused life. <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital\">From very early on</a>, I&#39;ve been learning to make computers do things.</p>\n<p>And being as introspective as I am, I like spending time considering how I got here.  I suppose this is nostalgia, but I like to think of it as recentering and recapitulation. Contemplating the story so far, as a means to consider the story yet to come.</p>\n<p>One huge benefit of this habit is that I&#39;ve become ever more appreciative of today.  It&#39;s easy to forget, but we&#39;re living in the future these days—at least, with respect to <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital\">who I was in 1983</a>.</p>\n<p>No flying cars yet, but for US$55 I was able to <a href=\"http://www.jbrain.net/products/uIEC%7B47%7DSD.html\">buy a tiny gadget called a uIED/SD</a> that gives a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64\">Commodore 64</a> access to modern SD cards for storage.  And, of course, I have <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2503\">Jason Scott&#39;s review of the more general-use FC5025 5.25? Floppy to USB Adapter</a> to blame in getting me started on this current mini-obsession.</p>\n<p>You want to talk about a magical device? Screw the iPad—this is magic.  </p>\n<p>This is what it looks like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/4486021528/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/4486021528_ce7ff4fc35.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<!--more-->To put that in context, take a look at this thing alongside the [Commodore 1541][1541] drives it emulates:\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/4486021636/in/photostream/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4033/4486021636_1b132686b4.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" alt=\"C64 + uIEC/SD\" /></a></p>\n<p>If my math is right—and it often isn&#39;t—plonking a 1GB card into this thing is the equivalent of over 5700 old-school floppies.  That&#39;s nearly incomprehensible if you try to wrap your head around it in an appreciative context.  </p>\n<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever touched that many floppies, even after getting my hands into huge (to me at the time) boxes of software shipped between friends and strangers across the country and overseas in a filesharing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet\">sneakernet</a> that made every month feel like Christmas. (<a href=\"http://www.bpfh.net/sysadmin/never-underestimate-bandwidth.html\">Never underestimate the bandwidth</a> of the postal service.)</p>\n<p>Today, all that stuff and more can be found <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=c64+gigatorrent\">in torrents topping 20GB</a> that offer brain-numbingly huge archives of both commercial abandonware and <a href=\"http://noname.c64.org/csdb/\">freely-shared demoscene releases</a>.  I&#39;m sure there are things left out, but you&#39;d be hard pressed not to find everything you ever remembered seeing on a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64\">Commodore 64</a>.  These archives are so large and uncurated that it&#39;s easier to do research online first  to come up with things to look.  Kind of like those huge boxes, but we had no web to search back in the day.</p>\n<p>And nearly all of it works on <a href=\"http://www.jbrain.net/products/uIEC%7B47%7DSD.html\">this thing</a> after a quick drag-and-drop into the FAT-formatted filesystem of an SD card.  You just need to rediscover and dust off some old expertise with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_Wedge\">arcane DOS wedge commands of the Commodore era</a>, <a href=\"http://sd2iec.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=sd2iec.git;a=blob;f=README;hb=HEAD\">sprinkle in some new additions</a> to navigate modern directory structures and disk images, and you&#39;re off.  Sure, you could just <a href=\"http://www.viceteam.org/\">use an emulator</a> for this stuff—but if you don&#39;t get at least a little thrill from the original hardware, you probably never grew up with it.</p>\n<p>For the floppies I <em>do</em> still possess, the <a href=\"http://www.jbrain.net/products/uIEC%7B47%7DSD.html\">uIEC/SD</a> can write to as well as read from SD cards. So, the real magic is that I&#39;ve been able to recover all kinds of data from 15-25 years ago: old BASIC and assembly programs; awkward poetry and short stories; embarrassing high school newspaper articles and columns; college application essays; archived message threads of religious debates and miscellaney from BBSes I used to call; even the memory-jogging lists of names and numbers to those BBSes that started so much for me.</p>\n<p>In short, further fodder for introspection that I thought was long lost to bitrot and drive failure.

    "body": "I've lived a very focused life. [From very early on][newlydigital], I've been learning to make computers do things.\r\n\r\n[newlydigital]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital\r\n\r\nAnd being as introspective as I am, I like spending time considering how I got here.  I suppose this is nostalgia, but I like to think of it as recentering and recapitulation. Contemplating the story so far, as a means to consider the story yet to come.\r\n\r\nOne huge benefit of this habit is that I've become ever more appreciative of today.  It's easy to forget, but we're living in the future these days—at least, with respect to [who I was in 1983][newlydigital].\r\n\r\nNo flying cars yet, but for US$55 I was able to [buy a tiny gadget called a uIED/SD][uiec] that gives a [Commodore 64][c64] access to modern SD cards for storage.  And, of course, I have [Jason Scott's review of the more general-use FC5025 5.25? Floppy to USB Adapter][review] to blame in getting me started on this current mini-obsession.\r\n\r\nYou want to talk about a magical device? Screw the iPad—this is magic.  \r\n\r\nThis is what it looks like:\r\n\r\n[<img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/4486021528_ce7ff4fc35.jpg\" />][flickruiec]\r\n\r\n\r\n[flickruiec]: http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/4486021528/\r\n[review]: http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2503\r\n[c64]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64\r\n[uiec]: http://www.jbrain.net/products/uIEC%7B47%7DSD.html\r\n<!--more-->To put that in context, take a look at this thing alongside the [Commodore 1541][1541] drives it emulates:\r\n\r\n[<img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4033/4486021636_1b132686b4.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" alt=\"C64 + uIEC/SD\" />][flickruiec2]\r\n\r\nIf my math is right—and it often isn't—plonking a 1GB card into this thing is the equivalent of over 5700 old-school floppies.  That's nearly incomprehensible if you try to wrap your head around it in an appreciative context.  \r\n\r\nI don't think I've ever touched that many floppies, even after getting my hands into huge (to me at the time) boxes of software shipped between friends and strangers across the country and overseas in a filesharing [sneakernet][] that made every month feel like Christmas. ([Never underestimate the bandwidth][bandwidth] of the postal service.)\r\n\r\n[sneakernet]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet\r\n[bandwidth]: http://www.bpfh.net/sysadmin/never-underestimate-bandwidth.html\r\n\r\nToday, all that stuff and more can be found [in torrents topping 20GB][giga] that offer brain-numbingly huge archives of both commercial abandonware and [freely-shared demoscene releases][demos].  I'm sure there are things left out, but you'd be hard pressed not to find everything you ever remembered seeing on a [Commodore 64][c64].  These archives are so large and uncurated that it's easier to do research online first  to come up with things to look.  Kind of like those huge boxes, but we had no web to search back in the day.\r\n\r\n[giga]: http://www.google.com/search?q=c64+gigatorrent\r\n[demos]: http://noname.c64.org/csdb/\r\n[c64]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64\r\n\r\nAnd nearly all of it works on [this thing][uiec] after a quick drag-and-drop into the FAT-formatted filesystem of an SD card.  You just need to rediscover and dust off some old expertise with the [arcane DOS wedge commands of the Commodore era][doswedge], [sprinkle in some new additions][sdreadme] to navigate modern directory structures and disk images, and you're off.  Sure, you could just [use an emulator][vice] for this stuff—but if you don't get at least a little thrill from the original hardware, you probably never grew up with it.\r\n\r\n[vice]: http://www.viceteam.org/\r\n[doswedge]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_Wedge\r\n[sdreadme]: http://sd2iec.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=sd2iec.git;a=blob;f=README;hb=HEAD\r\n\r\nFor the floppies I *do* still possess, the [uIEC/SD][uiec] can write to as well as read from SD cards. So, the real magic is that I've been able to recover all kinds of data from 15-25 years ago: old BASIC and assembly programs; awkward poetry and short stories; embarrassing high school newspaper articles and columns; college application essays; archived message threads of religious debates and miscellaney from BBSes I used to call; even the memory-jogging lists of names and numbers to those BBSes that started so much for me.\r\n\r\nIn short, further fodder for introspection that I thought was long lost to bitrot and drive failure.  Luckily, all my old-school hardware and media seems to be in just enough working order to make one more transfer.  I can only hope to be in as decent shape myself someday, should the [Rapture of the Nerds][nerdrapture] ever come.\r\n\r\n[nerdrapture]: http://www.metafilter.com/89307/The-Rapture-of-the-Nerds\r\n\r\nAnyway, I wanted to get this breathless post off my chest first, but I'm thinking about writing a more in-depth account of using this thing, with links pointing at what to download first and how to use it.  You know, written to that recent-past self of mine who'd just opened the package and stared dumbfounded at the \"<code>Ready.</code>\" prompt again with serious intent for the first time in a decade or so.  \r\n\r\nLet me know if that'd be of interest.\r\n\r\n[uiec]: http://www.jbrain.net/products/uIEC%7B47%7DSD.html\r\n[flickruiec2]: http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/4486021636/in/photostream/\r\n[1541]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_1541\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090738\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0a9ab4b71ce193e98b7284ca257e327&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\">Jason Clark</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090738\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-04-08T02:37:43\">2010-04-08T02:37:43</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>There is, at this very moment, a box full of floppies (including plenty of manually hacked 'flippies' made with a hole punch) a 1541 Disk Drive, and at least one but possibly two functioning C-64s, plus various and sundry joysticks, modems, Fast Load Cartridges &amp;tc.,  sitting in my garage, just waiting to be called forth again into the light, as soon as I have an excuse and some time.

    "html": "<p>I just finished Bioware&#39;s Mass Effect 2 for Xbox 360, and I&#39;ve got some thoughts about it.  Haven&#39;t really written reviews here for games before, but I said I wanted to start posting things here that I&#39;d want to read.  So, here goes...</p>\n<p>In a nutshell: I loved it, will play it again—but it could have been so much better.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3 id=\"mass-effect-1-the-obsession\">Mass Effect 1: The Obsession</h3>\n<p>After having had a blast playing through <a href=\"http://sc2.sourceforge.net/\">Star Control 2 / The Ur-Quan Masters</a> and loving the classic (albeit pulpy) sci-fi storyline, someone suggested <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect 1</a> would feel like a modern remake.  I forget who it was, but they were right.  Galactic exploration, negotiation between alien races, even taking a moon patrol buggy (a.k.a. the Mako) down to planets for resource gathering—it all matched up pretty well and compared very favorably.</p>\n<p>So, I was set up to be impressed.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect 1</a> was <em>cinematic</em>—even down to the film grain simulation in graphics options.  It was also the first major next-gen console game I spent any time with on a nice, big HDTV.  </p>\n<p>The storyline gave me a nice <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder\">sensawunda</a>, like a season of a well-made sci-fi series like <a href=\"http://www.henson.com/fantasy_scifi.php?content=farscape\">Farscape</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1\">Stargate SG-1</a>.  I actually cared about what happened in the dialog sequences, and I wanted to explore those bits equally alongside combat and planetary exploration.  I actually said &quot;Whoa,&quot; when I first saw the inside of the Citadel, with its massive cylindrical interior dotted with neighborhoods and landscaping.  I read all the Codex entries and planet descriptions to soak in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding\">worldbuilding</a>.</p>\n<p>And then there were the art and music direction of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect 1</a>, both of which were note-perfect for me.  </p>\n<p>The art was like the future <a href=\"http://www.atarimuseum.com/otherprojects/bionics/proto/index.html\">Atari computer designers had envisioned</a>, all clean surfaces and angles.  </p>\n<p>The music was like a modern Vangelis soundtrack for an alternate reality Blade Runner.  The transition from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhN4CUG4ek\">Eden Prime</a> to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdfc4GVPsRk\">Battle at Eden Prime</a> was a great build-up of suspense in the opening mission.  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9SiMTmCqvI&amp;feature=related\">The Citadel</a> was a big <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder\">sensawunda</a> moment—in fact, the whole soundtrack had a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder\">sensawunda</a> thread throughout. You might be on a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph6XcHu9ZB8&amp;feature=related\">dangerous safari</a>, but damn if it ain&#39;t an awesome universe to do it in.</p>\n<p>At the end—spoiler alert—they surprised me by carrying through the total feel of an 80&#39;s movie with a <em>real band</em> playing out the closing credits. It was a total &quot;the end&quot; kind of song that you&#39;d walk out of a theater listening to, all jazzed about the show you&#39;d just seen.  The first things I did after the game ended was to look up that song (<a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M4_Part_II\">M4 Part II</a> by <a href=\"http://www.faunts.com/\">Faunts</a>), buy that band&#39;s albums, and then buy the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XXWKAW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000XXWKAW\" title=\"Mass Effect Original Game Soundtrack\">game soundtrack</a>.  </p>\n<p>During a plane ride to California, I watched <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lPsGxJhyq4\">the making-of videos</a> on my iPod Touch.  I bought an <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/3501486581/\">SR1 hat</a> when I got back home.  </p>\n<p>I have done these things before for favorite movies, but only rarely for games.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-i-liked-in-me2\">What I liked in ME2</h3>\n<p>So... that brings me to <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">Mass Effect 2</a>, and the large shoes it had to fill.</p>\n<p>As a game, <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> is much improved over <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> in many ways.  They&#39;ve streamlined a lot of fiddly tedium in the gameplay; amped up the combat to compete with other cover-based shooters; backed away from the cookie-cutter procedural environments to hand-craft all missions.</p>\n<p>That last part, hand-crafting every mission, is easily the biggest improvement.  In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>, nearly every mission was a <a href=\"http://www.madlibs.com/\">Mad Libs</a> mashup of some pre-fab warehouse / mine / space station; an assortment of cloned enemies; some loot lockers; and maybe a unique objective or two.  I still liked it: dungeon-crawlers like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_%28video_game%29\">Diablo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.torchlightgame.com/\">Torchlight</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nethack.org/\">Nethack</a> are fun, and I have an even softer spot for space opera than fantasy.  </p>\n<p>But, <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> clearly shows more effort in mission design.  It&#39;s obvious that a human being spent many, many hours building every environment rather than just filling out a few data structures with object IDs and sketching out simple maps.  I&#39;m sure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> was more involved than I make it out to be, but the fact that <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> spans two discs alone is a testament to the extra effort.</p>\n<p>Oh, and the new &quot;circuit bypass&quot; and &quot;code hacking&quot; mini-games? They&#39;re a <em>huge</em> improvement over the all-purpose &quot;Simon&quot; game from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>.  I miss having the cheating option to just throw some omnigel at a locked door, but I don&#39;t have the overstuffed inventory to constantly recycle into wonderstuff any more either.</p>\n<p>In terms of the story, well, it has a very brief main arc accompanied by a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales\">Canterbury Tales</a> parade of side-stories for everyone you need to recruit to go up against the <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Collectors\">Collectors</a>.  The <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Collectors\">Collectors</a> are very definitely bad—but, all told, you rarely see them in the act of doing bad things.  They&#39;re less of a constant nemesis, and more of a looming threat that will nonetheless wait until you&#39;re done puttering around with your sniper&#39;s family problems.</p>\n<p>Really, the <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Collectors\">Collectors</a> felt like a blatant <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macguffin\">MacGuffin</a> for getting Shepard involved in the lives of some interesting characters.  I <em>did</em> find most of those characters interesting, so I was able to go with it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"its-a-small-world\">It&#39;s a small world</h3>\n<p>What I missed in the story, though, was a real sense of exploration and worldbuilding.  I guess maybe they figured they got it all out of the way in the previous season and just wanted to plow through with action in the second.</p>\n<p>I <em>was</em> expecting Omega to be the &quot;anti-Citadel&quot;, though, so I was a bit disappointed to find that the area was so sparse and small. Instead of a load of nooks and crannies to wander through, I got a few bare floors of grunge leading straight to objectives.  I really wanted to spend some time digging into the place in the talk-to-every-villager style of most RPGs.  Instead, I got a seedy nightclub, some shops, and an apartment—that&#39;s it.</p>\n<p>In fact, although the Citadel returned and the Asari world Ilium was introduced in <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a>, I felt like they were mere shadows of what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> offered.  I guess the flip side of having the hand-crafted environments throughout the rest of the game&#39;s missions means that the hub worlds suffer.  </p>\n<p>Another weird thing were the news reports on various terminals, mentioning things happening throughout the galaxy.  In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>, hearing about trouble and raids on colonies were the starting points for side missions.  In <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a>, they were just random fluff and color.  I&#39;m not sure why they bothered with the content, to be honest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mediocre-art-and-music\">Mediocre art and music</h3>\n<p>Style-wise, <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> stripped out a lot of what I adored about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>, coming very close to making it <em>just another game</em> rather than <em>a work of art</em>.  You can call me nuts—and probably already have, though strangely you&#39;re still reading—but yes: I thought <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> was special.</p>\n<p>The music in <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> is largely forgettable. There&#39;s an orchestra with horns and strings, and occasionally a chorus chants.  Sometimes, there are bells and triangles.  There were no themes that stuck with me, other than maybe the end-of-mission report jingle.  It&#39;s just like every other modern video game with a big budget.</p>\n<p>At least they kept something like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMyu9kehCVY&amp;feature=related\">Uncharted Worlds</a> from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> for the Galaxy Map.</p>\n<p>The art direction in <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> also strays toward mediocrity.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a> was <em>stylized</em>, all clean surfaces and sleek angles.  It was nostalgic and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2010/apr/01/science-fiction\">optimistic</a>, something refreshing.  (See also: <a href=\"http://io9.com/5064844/new-star-trek-movie-is-intentionally-cheesy\">The New Star Trek</a>.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a> introduces more grime &amp; dirt—it&#39;s &quot;grittier&quot; and more &quot;realistic&quot;. Just like every other modern video game with a big budget.</p>\n<p>But, you know what? &quot;Realism&quot; and &quot;grit&quot; are so last-decade—I&#39;m sick of it. If I&#39;d wanted to play <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_of_War\">Gears of War</a>, I&#39;d play it.  I didn&#39;t. I watched <a href=\"http://www.syfy.com/battlestar/\">Battlestar Galactica</a>—it was good; it&#39;s over now. </p>\n<h3 id=\"rip-m35-mako\">R.I.P. M35 Mako</h3>\n<p>They also killed the <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M35_Mako\">M35 Mako</a>, replacing it with a tedious planet-scanning mini-game.  No more endless alien skies over suited-up away teams, unless you&#39;re on a mission and don&#39;t have time to look up anyway.</p>\n<p>Sure, there were pain-in-the-ass 89.999º inclines to navigate with the I-think-I-can moon patrol buggy and its annoying jump-jets that would throw you right off a mile-high mountain peak with a slipped button press.  But, I&#39;d take all of those flaws versus painstakingly dragging a pokey reticule across a textured sphere hoping for a spiky waveform and bit of vibration in my lap.  </p>\n<p>If there&#39;s an away team to be assembled for scouring a planetary surface in-person, I&#39;m your man.  But, screw this scanning grind.  Half my recruited shipmates spent all their time meditating or staring at the walls. Couldn&#39;t I have delegated some reticule-dragging duty to them, rather than wasting my precious galaxy-saving time?</p>\n<p>Oh, but I <em>do</em> get to fly the little model Normandy around on the galaxy map now.  Whoosh, vroom, whoop-de-doo!  Remember to keep the gas tank full.  Wait, isn&#39;t that Joker&#39;s job? Christ, do I have to do <em>everything</em> around here?  While I was really hoping they&#39;d include some sort of space vehicles alongside the Mako, tooling around with a toy was not what I had in mind.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">BioWare</a> missed an opportunity:  Of the several dozen missions in the game, there were only around four main arc missions involving the big-baddies—the digressions out-massed the central story.</p>\n<p>I would have loved some random / procedurally-generated levels on planets—ala every mission in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>, only more unapologetically dungeon-crawley—fighting constant waves of Collectors, saving forgettable-yet-grateful human colonies as I scooped up the resources I needed to get the next sniper rifle upgrade.  No hand-crafting needed here, just give me some bug hunts and make the Collectors seem like a serious and constant threat.  Hell, give me a scoreboard of Collector versus Colonist body count for extra fun.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dragon-age-got-my-hopes-up\">Dragon Age got my hopes up</h3>\n<p>In another <a href=\"http://www.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">BioWare</a> game, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonAge\">Dragon Age</a>, <a href=\"http://random.lmorchard.com/dragon-age-origins-is-an-interactive-fantasy\">I got sucked in despite my so-so attraction to fantasy stories</a>.  The main thing came down to dialog and character interactions, and a departure from the general <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Morality\">Paragon / Renegade system</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">ME1</a>.  </p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonAge\">Dragon Age</a>, you get <a href=\"http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Approval\"><em>per-character</em> approval meters</a>.  This means that what endears one character may repulse another.  So, if you want to try to please or at least gain respect from everyone you recruit, you need to be careful about who you bring on which quests and what you do in the course of accomplishing goals.  The occasional deep conversation or gift helps, too.  It makes the game surprisingly rich.</p>\n<p>Assuming that <a href=\"http://www.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">BioWare</a> has a set of technologies and notions they carry from game to game, I expected to see this sort of thing pop up in <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">ME2</a>.</p>\n<p>No such luck.</p>\n<p>Instead, you get the same <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Morality\">Paragon / Renegade system</a> that opens up special options in dialog as before, and <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Loyalty\">a simple binary not-loyal / loyal state</a> for each of your squaddies depending on whether you completed their respective special-attention missions.  Makes for fun additional missions, but is relatively boring overall.</p>\n<h3 id=\"id-play-it-again-and-ill-play-mass-effect-3\">I&#39;d play it again, and I&#39;ll play Mass Effect 3</h3>\n<p>I grouse, but it&#39;s out of love.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect 1</a> hit all the right spots for me as a sci-fi adventure and a storytelling experience in general. There&#39;s no way I wouldn&#39;t play <a href=\"http://masseffect.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">Mass Effect 2</a>, and I&#39;ll be right in line for Mass Effect 3.  I&#39;ll probably even start over again from the beginning and replay #1 &amp; #2 before #3 comes out.</p>\n<p>But, <a href=\"http://www.%5BBioWare%5D%5B%5D.com/\">BioWare</a>? I&#39;d really love it if you pulled back from fully making Mass Effect 3 <em>just another video game</em> and recaptured a bit of what made the first one so great.</p>\n",

Galactic exploration, negotiation between alien races, even taking a moon patrol buggy (a.k.a. the Mako) down to planets for resource gathering—it all matched up pretty well and compared very favorably.\r\n\r\nSo, I was set up to be impressed.  [Mass Effect 1][me1] was *cinematic*—even down to the film grain simulation in graphics options.  It was also the first major next-gen console game I spent any time with on a nice, big HDTV.  \r\n\r\nThe storyline gave me a nice [sensawunda][sensawunda], like a season of a well-made sci-fi series like [Farscape][farscape] or [Stargate SG-1][sg1].  I actually cared about what happened in the dialog sequences, and I wanted to explore those bits equally alongside combat and planetary exploration.  I actually said \"Whoa,\" when I first saw the inside of the Citadel, with its massive cylindrical interior dotted with neighborhoods and landscaping.  I read all the Codex entries and planet descriptions to soak in the [worldbuilding][].\r\n\r\n[worldbuilding]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding\r\n\r\nAnd then there were the art and music direction of [Mass Effect 1][me1], both of which were note-perfect for me.  \r\n\r\nThe art was like the future [Atari computer designers had envisioned][ataridesign], all clean surfaces and angles.  \r\n\r\nThe music was like a modern Vangelis soundtrack for an alternate reality Blade Runner.  The transition from [Eden Prime][eden-prime] to [Battle at Eden Prime][edenbattle] was a great build-up of suspense in the opening mission.  [The Citadel][citadel] was a big [sensawunda][] moment—in fact, the whole soundtrack had a [sensawunda][] thread throughout. You might be on a [dangerous safari][virmire], but damn if it ain't an awesome universe to do it in.\r\n\r\n[eden-prime]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhN4CUG4ek\r\n[edenbattle]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdfc4GVPsRk\r\n[virmire]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph6XcHu9ZB8&feature=related\r\n[citadel]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9SiMTmCqvI&feature=related\r\n[presidium]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7V6P8MUwKw&feature=related\r\n\r\nAt the end—spoiler alert—they surprised me by carrying through the total feel of an 80's movie with a *real band* playing out the closing credits. It was a total \"the end\" kind of song that you'd walk out of a theater listening to, all jazzed about the show you'd just seen.  The first things I did after the game ended was to look up that song ([M4 Part II][m4] by [Faunts][faunts]), buy that band's albums, and then buy the [game soundtrack][me1soundtrack].  \r\n\r\nDuring a plane ride to California, I watched [the making-of videos][makingof] on my iPod Touch.  I bought an [SR1 hat][sr1hat] when I got back home.  \r\n\r\nI have done these things before for favorite movies, but only rarely for games.\r\n\r\n### What I liked in ME2\r\n\r\nSo... that brings me to [Mass Effect 2][me2], and the large shoes it had to fill.\r\n\r\nAs a game, [ME2][me2] is much improved over [ME1][me1] in many ways.  They've streamlined a lot of fiddly tedium in the gameplay; amped up the combat to compete with other cover-based shooters; backed away from the cookie-cutter procedural environments to hand-craft all missions.\r\n\r\nThat last part, hand-crafting every mission, is easily the biggest improvement.  In [ME1][me1], nearly every mission was a [Mad Libs][madlibs] mashup of some pre-fab warehouse / mine / space station; an assortment of cloned enemies; some loot lockers; and maybe a unique objective or two.  I still liked it: dungeon-crawlers like [Diablo][diablo] and [Torchlight][torchlight] and [Nethack][nethack] are fun, and I have an even softer spot for space opera than fantasy.  \r\n\r\nBut, [ME2][] clearly shows more effort in mission design.  It's obvious that a human being spent many, many hours building every environment rather than just filling out a few data structures with object IDs and sketching out simple maps.  I'm sure [ME1][] was more involved than I make it out to be, but the fact that [ME2][] spans two discs alone is a testament to the extra effort.\r\n\r\nOh, and the new \"circuit bypass\" and \"code hacking\" mini-games? They're a *huge* improvement over the all-purpose \"Simon\" game from [ME1][].  I miss having the cheating option to just throw some omnigel at a locked door, but I don't have the overstuffed inventory to constantly recycle into wonderstuff any more either.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the story, well, it has a very brief main arc accompanied by a [Canterbury Tales][chaucer] parade of side-stories for everyone you need to recruit to go up against the [Collectors][].  The [Collectors][] are very definitely bad—but, all told, you rarely see them in the act of doing bad things.  They're less of a constant nemesis, and more of a looming threat that will nonetheless wait until you're done puttering around with your sniper's family problems.\r\n\r\nReally, the [Collectors][] felt like a blatant [MacGuffin][] for getting Shepard involved in the lives of some interesting characters.  I *did* find most of those characters interesting, so I was able to go with it.\r\n\r\n[chaucer]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales\r\n[macguffin]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macguffin\r\n[collectors]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Collectors\r\n\r\n### It's a small world\r\n\r\nWhat I missed in the story, though, was a real sense of exploration and worldbuilding.  I guess maybe they figured they got it all out of the way in the previous season and just wanted to plow through with action in the second.\r\n\r\nI *was* expecting Omega to be the \"anti-Citadel\", though, so I was a bit disappointed to find that the area was so sparse and small. Instead of a load of nooks and crannies to wander through, I got a few bare floors of grunge leading straight to objectives.  I really wanted to spend some time digging into the place in the talk-to-every-villager style of most RPGs.  Instead, I got a seedy nightclub, some shops, and an apartment—that's it.\r\n\r\nIn fact, although the Citadel returned and the Asari world Ilium was introduced in [ME2][], I felt like they were mere shadows of what [ME1][] offered.  I guess the flip side of having the hand-crafted environments throughout the rest of the game's missions means that the hub worlds suffer.  \r\n\r\nAnother weird thing were the news reports on various terminals, mentioning things happening throughout the galaxy.  In [ME1][], hearing about trouble and raids on colonies were the starting points for side missions.  In [ME2][], they were just random fluff and color.  I'm not sure why they bothered with the content, to be honest.\r\n\r\n### Mediocre art and music\r\n\r\nStyle-wise, [ME2][] stripped out a lot of what I adored about [ME1][], coming very close to making it *just another game* rather than *a work of art*.  You can call me nuts—and probably already have, though strangely you're still reading—but yes: I thought [ME1][] was special.\r\n\r\nThe music in [ME2][] is largely forgettable. There's an orchestra with horns and strings, and occasionally a chorus chants.  Sometimes, there are bells and triangles.  There were no themes that stuck with me, other than maybe the end-of-mission report jingle.  It's just like every other modern video game with a big budget.\r\n\r\nAt least they kept something like [Uncharted Worlds][uncharted] from [ME1][] for the Galaxy Map.\r\n\r\n[uncharted]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMyu9kehCVY&feature=related\r\n\r\nThe art direction in [ME2][] also strays toward mediocrity.  [ME1][] was *stylized*, all clean surfaces and sleek angles.  It was nostalgic and [optimistic][optimisticscifi], something refreshing.  (See also: [The New Star Trek][newstartrek].)\r\n\r\n[ME2][] introduces more grime & dirt—it's \"grittier\" and more \"realistic\". Just like every other modern video game with a big budget.\r\n\r\nBut, you know what? \"Realism\" and \"grit\" are so last-decade—I'm sick of it. If I'd wanted to play [Gears of War][gow], I'd play it.  I didn't. I watched [Battlestar Galactica][bsg]—it was good; it's over now. \r\n\r\n### R.I.P. M35 Mako\r\n\r\nThey also killed the [M35 Mako][mako], replacing it with a tedious planet-scanning mini-game.  No more endless alien skies over suited-up away teams, unless you're on a mission and don't have time to look up anyway.\r\n\r\n[mako]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M35_Mako\r\n\r\nSure, there were pain-in-the-ass 89.999º inclines to navigate with the I-think-I-can moon patrol buggy and its annoying jump-jets that would throw you right off a mile-high mountain peak with a slipped button press.  But, I'd take all of those flaws versus painstakingly dragging a pokey reticule across a textured sphere hoping for a spiky waveform and bit of vibration in my lap.  \r\n\r\nIf there's an away team to be assembled for scouring a planetary surface in-person, I'm your man.  But, screw this scanning grind.  Half my recruited shipmates spent all their time meditating or staring at the walls. Couldn't I have delegated some reticule-dragging duty to them, rather than wasting my precious galaxy-saving time?\r\n\r\nOh, but I *do* get to fly the little model Normandy around on the galaxy map now.  Whoosh, vroom, whoop-de-doo!  Remember to keep the gas tank full.  Wait, isn't that Joker's job? Christ, do I have to do *everything* around here?  While I was really hoping they'd include some sort of space vehicles alongside the Mako, tooling around with a toy was not what I had in mind.\r\n\r\n[BioWare][] missed an opportunity:  Of the several dozen missions in the game, there were only around four main arc missions involving the big-baddies—the digressions out-massed the central story.\r\n\r\nI would have loved some random / procedurally-generated levels on planets—ala every mission in [ME1][], only more unapologetically dungeon-crawley—fighting constant waves of Collectors, saving forgettable-yet-grateful human colonies as I scooped up the resources I needed to get the next sniper rifle upgrade.  No hand-crafting needed here, just give me some bug hunts and make the Collectors seem like a serious and constant threat.  Hell, give me a scoreboard of Collector versus Colonist body count for extra fun.\r\n\r\n### Dragon Age got my hopes up\r\n\r\nIn another [BioWare][] game, [Dragon Age][], [I got sucked in despite my so-so attraction to fantasy stories][dragonage].  The main thing came down to dialog and character interactions, and a departure from the general [Paragon / Renegade system][me-morality] of [ME1][].  \r\n\r\nIn [Dragon Age][], you get [*per-character* approval meters][approval].  This means that what endears one character may repulse another.  So, if you want to try to please or at least gain respect from everyone you recruit, you need to be careful about who you bring on which quests and what you do in the course of accomplishing goals.  The occasional deep conversation or gift helps, too.  It makes the game surprisingly rich.\r\n\r\n[approval]: http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Approval\r\n\r\nAssuming that [BioWare][] has a set of technologies and notions they carry from game to game, I expected to see this sort of thing pop up in [ME2][].\r\n\r\nNo such luck.\r\n\r\nInstead, you get the same [Paragon / Renegade system][me-morality] that opens up special options in dialog as before, and [a simple binary not-loyal / loyal state][me2-loyalty] for each of your squaddies depending on whether you completed their respective special-attention missions.  Makes for fun additional missions, but is relatively boring overall.\r\n\r\n### I'd play it again, and I'll play Mass Effect 3\r\n\r\nI grouse, but it's out of love.\r\n\r\n[Mass Effect 1][me1] hit all the right spots for me as a sci-fi adventure and a storytelling experience in general. There's no way I wouldn't play [Mass Effect 2][me2], and I'll be right in line for Mass Effect 3.  I'll probably even start over again from the beginning and replay #1 & #2 before #3 comes out.\r\n\r\nBut, [BioWare][]? I'd really love it if you pulled back from fully making Mass Effect 3 *just another video game* and recaptured a bit of what made the first one so great.\r\n\r\n[makingof]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lPsGxJhyq4\r\n[optimisticscifi]: http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2010/apr/01/science-fiction\r\n[newstartrek]: http://io9.com/5064844/new-star-trek-movie-is-intentionally-cheesy\r\n[urquan]: http://sc2.sourceforge.net/\r\n[me1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\r\n[me-morality]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Morality\r\n[me2-loyalty]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Loyalty\r\n[me1soundtrack]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XXWKAW?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000XXWKAW \"Mass Effect Original Game Soundtrack\"\r\n[m4]: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M4_Part_II\r\n[faunts]: http://www.faunts.com/\r\n[sr1hat]: http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/3501486581/\r\n[me2]: http://masseffect.[BioWare][].com/\r\n[sensawunda]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_wonder\r\n[farscape]: http://www.henson.com/fantasy_scifi.php?content=farscape\r\n[sg1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1\r\n[ataridesign]: http://www.atarimuseum.com/otherprojects/bionics/proto/index.html\r\n[madlibs]: http://www.madlibs.com/\r\n[diablo]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_%28video_game%29\r\n[nethack]: http://www.nethack.org/\r\n[torchlight]: http://www.torchlightgame.com/\r\n[gow]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_of_War\r\n[bsg]: http://www.syfy.com/battlestar/\r\n[dragonage]: http://random.lmorchard.com/dragon-age-origins-is-an-interactive-fantasy\r\n[bioware]: http://www.[BioWare][].com/\r\n[Dragon Age]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonAge\r\n",

What I&#39;ve yet to figure out is if the cause is a matter of motivation, publishing tools, audience, or writing topics.</p>\n<p>Behold as I ramble on for many tens of words pondering the cobwebs here at 0xDECAFBAD.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"motivation\">Motivation</h2>\n<p>Other outlets have absorbed nearly all of my motivations that once prompted casual blogging. And those other outlets, in most cases, provide better rewards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For quick top-of-the-head thoughts and quips, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard\">Twitter</a> works best for the brain-spew and gets me feedback from interesting people faster than my spam-embattled comments here ever did.</li>\n<li>For sharing things I find on the web, <a href=\"http://delicious.com/deusx\">Delicious</a> took that job over years ago and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/shared/l.m.orchard\">Google Reader</a> has been angling for the job as well.</li>\n<li>For sharing code and projects, I&#39;ve started doing more and more over at <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/\">my GitHub account</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Quite awhile ago, I even went so far as to redirect the front page of my decafbad.com domain straight to a page that&#39;s nothing more than  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/lifestream\">a shell for a FriendFeed widget that aggregates my output from elsewhere</a>. It&#39;s kind of a cop-out, but if you want to see what I&#39;m really up to, that&#39;s a much better page than my stagnant blog index anyway.  I&#39;ve got a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/ffa/lmorchard\">local archive of my activity</a>, and have been meaning to make a self-hosted lifestream more front-and-center, but I&#39;ve been too busy to bother.</p>\n<h2 id=\"publishing-tools\">Publishing tools</h2>\n<p>In fact, I&#39;ve been thinking about killing my WordPress installation here altogether, and switching the blog over to a static fossil snapshot.  Since I rarely post, there&#39;s rarely a comment inbound here these days that&#39;s not trying to slip through an ad for pills or fake handbags. Thus, most of the CPU cycles on my web host are spent on busy work processing requests that will never amount to anything real. So, why bother having an actual PHP application running here?</p>\n<p>The one thing that I haven&#39;t done a lot of lately—and would like to carve out time to get back to—is some real long-form writing. You would think that that&#39;s where this WordPress thing would come in handy, but oddly it seems not to. I hate writing in textareas in browsers, haven&#39;t found a desktop blog client that I liked in years.</p>\n<p>So, because of the little things that annoy me, I stop writing before I start because the anticipated process to publish seems like a chore. I&#39;d much rather be writing in MacVim and checking text files into a git repository. Then, I could throw <a href=\"http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a> or something yak-shavingly homebrewed on top of post-receive hooks to do indexing magic and such in static HTML. You know, the stuff that took forever in MovableType back in the day, but decoupled from my actual writing process. </p>\n<p>Huh, now that I describe it, the above sounds like a chore too—but it would be a shiny new toy!  At that point, I wouldn&#39;t be blogging so much as publishing an archive of essays on the web.  But, at least I&#39;d know the format would be future-proof, the platform exploit-resistant, and the overall maintenance less worrisome.  If I had comments, I could even outsource them to another service and run periodic backups to be safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"audience\">Audience</h2>\n<p>But, beyond the mechanisms, there&#39;s who I imagine might be reading this stuff. I hold off on writing a lot of things that could be posted here because they&#39;re maybe not tech-nerdy enough. If it doesn&#39;t have at least one code example, I hesitate to share it here—and if I don&#39;t share it here, I probably don&#39;t share it anywhere.</p>\n<p>And then there&#39;s the thought that whatever I write here, no one will read it if it&#39;s too long.  This entry is mostly written to myself, and I expect a single-digit comment count—most likely zero.  I get the most feedback on the shortest things, which has ultimately lead to Twitter and its 140 character limit yielding some of my most rewarding interactions on the web in years. I post an essay here, and it&#39;s all crickets.</p>\n<p>The exceptions are where I post something really useful, like that article about <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2009/07/15/html5-drag-and-drop\">HTML 5 Drag &amp; Drop</a> or a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/09/01/writing-a-delicious-command-for-ubiquity\">Delicious command for Ubiquity</a>.  That is, of course, a clue if comments and feedback are what I&#39;m after.</p>\n<h2 id=\"writing-topics\">Writing topics</h2>\n<p>So, what could I be writing about these days? Let&#39;s see, I could write about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what I&#39;ve been up to at Mozilla since I started;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/homebrewing/\">brewing beer</a> and roasting coffee at home;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/4389264445/\">retro computing on my C64 and Amiga</a>;</li>\n<li>developing for Palm webOS;</li>\n<li>random thoughts on life;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Huh. That all sounds like a blog, and one I would read myself—though that last one sounds like <a href=\"http://deus-x.livejournal.com/\">my LiveJournal</a>, long neglected since I started dating my wife and got much less emo in general. We probably don&#39;t need to go there so much, but I could probably bore with more even-tempered philosophical expositions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-the-problem\">What&#39;s the problem?</h2>\n<p>I wonder what my real problem is, then? Is it really just a matter of <a href=\"http://www.dawsbrothers.com/2010/03/09/butt-in-the-seat-a-writers-technique/\">butt in the seat</a> that I&#39;m missing?  I write every day—in a paper journal, in wiki pages, in emails, to myself—I just don&#39;t write much here. Maybe all the above is just a collection of excuses.</p>\n<p>Lately, I&#39;ve had this notion that I should try writing and publishing for an earlier version of myself. That is: all these things I end up searching for and researching on the web, I should write them up in a way that I wish had been the first search result in Google. Whatever the topic, if a younger version of me wanted to find it, I should put it out there to be found. Never mind who else I think might read it or (not) comment on it.</p>\n<p>Write for myself, write what I&#39;d want to read—sounds pretty obvious when I put it out there like that. So, is that the deal? Who knows; we&#39;ll see if a change in perspective results in more happenings here.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090129\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ciarang.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=18910207650685d4592d9a6a71528180&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ciarang.com/\">CiaranG</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090129\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:04:04\">2010-03-10T19:04:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I write about stuff (including beer brewing, Amigas and less archaic techy stuff) mostly for the pleasure of my current self, and the amusement of my future self.</p>\n<p>I never considered writing for an earlier version of myself, but then I know for a fact he didn't have a time machine.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090132\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5441ca4708065da7e0467e1470c49653&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\">Carter Rabasa</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090132\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:19:19\">2010-03-10T19:19:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I long ago gave up on the idea of regular blogging.

And this month I'm joining the Mozilla Corporation, partly because I want to work with you and other hackers whose work has influenced me over the years.  Your audience may be small, but we're devoted!  :)</p>\n<p>I moved my own technical blogging to Jekyll recently.  There's a bit less guilt about slow update schedules when I think of it more like a static collection of articles than an online journal.  (And yeah, using a real editor and version control makes it much easier to get longer pieces done.)  I use Planet Venus for my personally-hosted lifestream, though these days most of my friends get my aggregated data via Facebook or Buzz.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090136\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/danmactough.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">danmactough</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090136\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:27:53\">2010-03-10T19:27:53</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I've never used my blog as much as you've used yours -- I've never really been a blogger at all, honestly.</p>\n<p>I like posting code snippets.

I knew before I ever installed blosxom that I didn't want to be a \"blogger.\" I had no interest in sharing my deep thoughts about life, politics, or anything else. I enjoy talking with people; it's not an antisocial thing. It's just that I don't know what long-term ramifications there may be to such free expression. Likewise, you won't see pictures of me and my family generally available on Flickr or Picasa (there may be a handful). Facebook is nothing to me except somewhere to echo my Twitter stream, such as it is (and I've stopped doing that). Brightkite -- forget it! My last.fm profile is about as intimate as I get online.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking about shutting down my WP installation. I really don't use it. The only thing I really use my VPS for is my web-based feed reader.</p>\n<p>All of these blogging, microblogging, and social networking services -- especially the social networking services -- are really interesting to me, though.

So, it's pretty natural for me to live online.</p><p>Still, I have gotten more and more private. My LiveJournal has some entries that I'd never write now, and I'll probably never post religious / political stuff here because it's not worth the debate or potential life / career damage.</p>\n<p>So... yeah, I'll probably never again be a blogger, per se.

    "body": "It's plain to see that I've not been a blogger for a long time.\r\n\r\nThis place is a long-neglected ghost town that sees a begrudged entry every few months, when I happen to remember it still exists and I feel guilty for not feeding it with content. What I've yet to figure out is if the cause is a matter of motivation, publishing tools, audience, or writing topics.\r\n\r\nBehold as I ramble on for many tens of words pondering the cobwebs here at 0xDECAFBAD.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nOther outlets have absorbed nearly all of my motivations that once prompted casual blogging. And those other outlets, in most cases, provide better rewards:\r\n\r\n* For quick top-of-the-head thoughts and quips, [Twitter](http://twitter.com/lmorchard) works best for the brain-spew and gets me feedback from interesting people faster than my spam-embattled comments here ever did.\r\n* For sharing things I find on the web, [Delicious](http://delicious.com/deusx) took that job over years ago and [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/l.m.orchard) has been angling for the job as well.\r\n* For sharing code and projects, I've started doing more and more over at [my GitHub account](http://github.com/lmorchard/).\r\n\r\nQuite awhile ago, I even went so far as to redirect the front page of my decafbad.com domain straight to a page that's nothing more than  [a shell for a FriendFeed widget that aggregates my output from elsewhere](http://decafbad.com/blog/lifestream). It's kind of a cop-out, but if you want to see what I'm really up to, that's a much better page than my stagnant blog index anyway.  I've got a [local archive of my activity](http://decafbad.com/ffa/lmorchard), and have been meaning to make a self-hosted lifestream more front-and-center, but I've been too busy to bother.\r\n\r\n## Publishing tools\r\n\r\nIn fact, I've been thinking about killing my WordPress installation here altogether, and switching the blog over to a static fossil snapshot.  Since I rarely post, there's rarely a comment inbound here these days that's not trying to slip through an ad for pills or fake handbags. Thus, most of the CPU cycles on my web host are spent on busy work processing requests that will never amount to anything real. So, why bother having an actual PHP application running here?\r\n\r\nThe one thing that I haven't done a lot of lately—and would like to carve out time to get back to—is some real long-form writing. You would think that that's where this WordPress thing would come in handy, but oddly it seems not to. I hate writing in textareas in browsers, haven't found a desktop blog client that I liked in years.\r\n\r\nSo, because of the little things that annoy me, I stop writing before I start because the anticipated process to publish seems like a chore. I'd much rather be writing in MacVim and checking text files into a git repository. Then, I could throw [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) or something yak-shavingly homebrewed on top of post-receive hooks to do indexing magic and such in static HTML. You know, the stuff that took forever in MovableType back in the day, but decoupled from my actual writing process. \r\n\r\nHuh, now that I describe it, the above sounds like a chore too—but it would be a shiny new toy!  At that point, I wouldn't be blogging so much as publishing an archive of essays on the web.  But, at least I'd know the format would be future-proof, the platform exploit-resistant, and the overall maintenance less worrisome.  If I had comments, I could even outsource them to another service and run periodic backups to be safe.\r\n\r\n## Audience\r\n\r\nBut, beyond the mechanisms, there's who I imagine might be reading this stuff. I hold off on writing a lot of things that could be posted here because they're maybe not tech-nerdy enough. If it doesn't have at least one code example, I hesitate to share it here—and if I don't share it here, I probably don't share it anywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the thought that whatever I write here, no one will read it if it's too long.  This entry is mostly written to myself, and I expect a single-digit comment count—most likely zero.  I get the most feedback on the shortest things, which has ultimately lead to Twitter and its 140 character limit yielding some of my most rewarding interactions on the web in years. I post an essay here, and it's all crickets.\r\n\r\nThe exceptions are where I post something really useful, like that article about [HTML 5 Drag & Drop](http://decafbad.com/blog/2009/07/15/html5-drag-and-drop) or a [Delicious command for Ubiquity](http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/09/01/writing-a-delicious-command-for-ubiquity).  That is, of course, a clue if comments and feedback are what I'm after.\r\n\r\n## Writing topics\r\n\r\nSo, what could I be writing about these days? Let's see, I could write about:\r\n\r\n* what I've been up to at Mozilla since I started;\r\n* [brewing beer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/homebrewing/) and roasting coffee at home;\r\n* [retro computing on my C64 and Amiga](http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/4389264445/);\r\n* developing for Palm webOS;\r\n* random thoughts on life;\r\n\r\nHuh. That all sounds like a blog, and one I would read myself—though that last one sounds like [my LiveJournal](http://deus-x.livejournal.com/), long neglected since I started dating my wife and got much less emo in general. We probably don't need to go there so much, but I could probably bore with more even-tempered philosophical expositions.\r\n\r\n## What's the problem?\r\n\r\nI wonder what my real problem is, then? Is it really just a matter of [butt in the seat](http://www.dawsbrothers.com/2010/03/09/butt-in-the-seat-a-writers-technique/) that I'm missing?  I write every day—in a paper journal, in wiki pages, in emails, to myself—I just don't write much here. Maybe all the above is just a collection of excuses.\r\n\r\nLately, I've had this notion that I should try writing and publishing for an earlier version of myself. That is: all these things I end up searching for and researching on the web, I should write them up in a way that I wish had been the first search result in Google. Whatever the topic, if a younger version of me wanted to find it, I should put it out there to be found. Never mind who else I think might read it or (not) comment on it.\r\n\r\nWrite for myself, write what I'd want to read—sounds pretty obvious when I put it out there like that. So, is that the deal? Who knows; we'll see if a change in perspective results in more happenings here.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090129\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ciarang.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=18910207650685d4592d9a6a71528180&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ciarang.com/\">CiaranG</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090129\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:04:04\">2010-03-10T19:04:04</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I write about stuff (including beer brewing, Amigas and less archaic techy stuff) mostly for the pleasure of my current self, and the amusement of my future self.</p>\n\n<p>I never considered writing for an earlier version of myself, but then I know for a fact he didn't have a time machine.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090132\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5441ca4708065da7e0467e1470c49653&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://cubanlinks.org/blog\">Carter Rabasa</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090132\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:19:19\">2010-03-10T19:19:19</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I long ago gave up on the idea of regular blogging.

I don't know how I ended up here, but it looks like last month was the seventh anniversary of my first comment:</p>\n\n<p>http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/02/20/ooodae</p>\n\n<p>\"Newly Digital in 1983\" is still one of my favorite stories ever.  You also got me interested in ifiction and flash fiction. (I ended up publishing a few stories on 365tomorrows and Ficlets.)  And this month I'm joining the Mozilla Corporation, partly because I want to work with you and other hackers whose work has influenced me over the years.  Your audience may be small, but we're devoted!  :)</p>\n\n<p>I moved my own technical blogging to Jekyll recently.  There's a bit less guilt about slow update schedules when I think of it more like a static collection of articles than an online journal.  (And yeah, using a real editor and version control makes it much easier to get longer pieces done.)  I use Planet Venus for my personally-hosted lifestream, though these days most of my friends get my aggregated data via Facebook or Buzz.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090136\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/danmactough.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">danmactough</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090136\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:27:53\">2010-03-10T19:27:53</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I've never used my blog as much as you've used yours -- I've never really been a blogger at all, honestly.</p>\n\n<p>I like posting code snippets. Maybe I'll check out github at some point, but I've got a 2-year-old now. He's way more fun and interesting than Python or whatever. (I guess that could be interpreted as implying that my wife is NOT more fun and interesting than those things. Rather than explain why that is not the case, I'll just say that we've been together forever, and I love her very much.)</p>\n\n<p>At any rate, I thought your post merited at least one comment pondering why the commenter does not blog (anymore).</p>\n\n<p>For my part, it has a lot to do with privacy, I think. I knew before I ever installed blosxom that I didn't want to be a \"blogger.\" I had no interest in sharing my deep thoughts about life, politics, or anything else. I enjoy talking with people; it's not an antisocial thing. It's just that I don't know what long-term ramifications there may be to such free expression. Likewise, you won't see pictures of me and my family generally available on Flickr or Picasa (there may be a handful). Facebook is nothing to me except somewhere to echo my Twitter stream, such as it is (and I've stopped doing that). Brightkite -- forget it! My last.fm profile is about as intimate as I get online.</p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking about shutting down my WP installation. I really don't use it. The only thing I really use my VPS for is my web-based feed reader.</p>\n\n<p>All of these blogging, microblogging, and social networking services -- especially the social networking services -- are really interesting to me, though. I will keep hanging around the periphery of them, dipping in a toe here and there.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090137\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://wambatech.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3ba9f5af09024586154461580b546479&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://wambatech.com\">bud</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T19:44:56\">2010-03-10T19:44:56</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Les I've followed this for a while.

The past self thing is really thinking that someone like me might come along and appreciate what I tossed onto the web.  Beyond that, I like writing and can't think of better any better topics than writing about the other stuff I like doing.</p>\n\n<p>@Carter: I think my main source of lament here is that I'm a writer who never seems to write on his own site. I feel like I should be publishing more about the stuff I do. But, yeah, this place isn't really the center of my online universe anymore.</p>\n\n<p>@Matt: Huh, you know, that <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital\" rel=\"nofollow\">Newly Digital in 1983</a> post was one of my quieter ones in terms of feedback. I always wondered if it got many reads, but it was one of my own favorites to write since it was the sort of thing I liked to see on others' blogs.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and welcome to Mozilla! I'm back out to Mountain View pretty regularly, so we'll have to hang out sometime.  Might have to pick your brain about Jekyll and how you like mobile hacking.</p>\n\n<p>@Dan: I'm a bit weird, since most of my friends since the age of 8 have been behind computers, modems, or the internet. And now, my job is almost entirely on the net since I'm telecommuting from my basement 3000 miles away from HQ. So, it's pretty natural for me to live online.</p><p>Still, I have gotten more and more private. My LiveJournal has some entries that I'd never write now, and I'll probably never post religious / political stuff here because it's not worth the debate or potential life / career damage.</p>\n\n<p>So... yeah, I'll probably never again be a blogger, per se. I don't feel like having a diary online so much as a place where I publish interesting things.</p>\n\n<p>I think really my thing here is I call myself a writer, so I should probably be doing more of it. :)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090139\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/danmactough.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">danmactough</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090139\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-10T20:17:10\">2010-03-10T20:17:10</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Regarding publishing interesting things -- I'm totally with you there.

I had started to write my own, but then I started wondering why I had to have my own.  It turned out Jekyll gets most of what I want done with a minimum of yak shaving.  I think the only weakness is the lack of categories/tags and the requisite feeds.  It's nice to write something up with markdown, build the site, and push it out.  Jekyll feels natural for people like us.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090147\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://friendfeed.com/lenlynch\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d3bbd90851fa3a038bd8ca7560428412&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://friendfeed.com/lenlynch\">Len Lynch</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090147\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2010-03-11T04:51:08\">2010-03-11T04:51:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Community is funny.

So, buy one of those other ones, and grab this one as your backup for most other occasions. :)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083058\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mahal.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bc60227676cca234405bb8336d162040&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mahal.org\">Davinder</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083058\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-09-18T15:15:14\">2009-09-18T15:15:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hey Les,</p>\n\n<p>Congrats on getting the book out!

It's another blog post—and this one\n<a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/html5-drag-and-drop/\">is cross-posted on hacks.mozilla.com</a>.\nI won't say this is the start of a renewed blogging habit, but let's see what happens.\n</i></p>\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\ndl { margin-left: 2em; }\ndd { margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.25em; }\n</style>\n<div id=\"introduction\">\n    <p>\n        Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions\n        afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it\n        allows users to pair the selection of an object with the\n        execution of an action, often including a second object in the\n        operation.  It's a simple yet powerful UI concept used to\n        support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),\n        and even the creation of link relationships.\n    </p><p>\n        Since it's so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web\n        applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first\n        offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although\n        <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, and\n        <code>mouseup</code> made it possible, the implementation has been\n        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,\n        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,\n        there's a challenge to find the subject of the drop when\n        the interaction is completed.\n    </p><p>\n\n<pre><code>    Of course, that doesn&#39;t prevent most modern JavaScript\n    frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and\n    throwing in some flourishes while they&#39;re at it.  But, wouldn&#39;t\n    it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and\n    drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd&quot;&gt;section on new drag-and-drop events&lt;/a&gt;, and \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop&quot;&gt;Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation&lt;/a&gt; of those events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    If you want to jump straight to the code, I&#39;ve put together \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html&quot;&gt;some simple demos&lt;/a&gt; \n    of the new events.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n    I&#39;ve even scratched an itch of my own and\n    built &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html&quot;&gt;the beginnings of an outline editor&lt;/a&gt;,\n    where every draggable element is also a drop target—of which\n    there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something\n    that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past\n    while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from \n    &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop&quot;&gt;a GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;\n    I&#39;ve created especially for this article—which continues after the jump.\n&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<div id=\"events\">\n\n<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;The New Drag and Drop Events&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    So, with no further ado, here are the new drag and drop events,\n    in roughly the order you might expect to see them fired:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;dl&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        A drag has been initiated, with the dragged element as the\n        event target.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;drag&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        The mouse has moved, with the dragged element as the event target.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;dragenter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        The dragged element has been moved into a drop listener,\n        with the drop listener element as the event target.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;dragover&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        The dragged element has been moved over a drop listener,\n        with the drop listener element as the event target.  Since\n        the default behavior is to cancel drops, returning\n        &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; or calling &lt;code&gt;preventDefault()&lt;/code&gt; in\n        the event handler indicates that a drop is allowed here.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;dragleave&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        The dragged element has been moved out of a drop listener,\n        with the drop listener element as the event target.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        The dragged element has been successfully dropped on a drop\n        listener, with the drop listener element as the event\n        target.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;dragend&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        A drag has been ended, successfully or not, with the\n        dragged element as the event target.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;/dl&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n    Like the mouse events of yore, listeners can be attached to\n    elements using &lt;code&gt;addEventListener()&lt;/code&gt; \n    directly or by way of your favorite JS library.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    Consider the following example using jQuery, \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#newschool&quot;&gt;also available as a live demo&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot; line=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<div id=\"newschool\">\n    <div class=\"dragme\">Drag me!</div>\n    <div class=\"drophere\">Drop here!</div>\n</div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    $(document).ready(function() {\n        $('#newschool .dragme')\n            .attr('draggable', 'true')\n            .bind('dragstart', function(ev) {\n                var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;\n                dt.setData(\"Text\", \"Dropped in zone!\");\n                return true;\n            })\n            .bind('dragend', function(ev) {\n                return false;\n            });\n        $('#newschool .drophere')\n            .bind('dragenter', function(ev) {\n                $(ev.target).addClass('dragover');\n                return false;\n            })\n            .bind('dragleave', function(ev) {\n                $(ev.target).removeClass('dragover');\n                return false;\n            })\n            .bind('dragover', function(ev) {\n                return false;\n            })\n            .bind('drop', function(ev) {\n                var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;\n                alert(dt.getData('Text'));\n                return false;\n            });\n    });\n</script>\n<pre><code>&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    Thanks to the new events and jQuery, this example is both short\n    and simple—but it packs in a lot of functionality, as the rest\n    of this article will explain.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    Before moving on, there are at least three things about the above\n    code that are worth mentioning:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;\n            Drop targets are enabled by virtue of having\n            listeners for drop events.  But, \n            &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#drag-and-drop-processing-model&quot;&gt;per the HTML 5 spec&lt;/a&gt;,\n            draggable elements need an\n            attribute of &lt;code&gt;draggable=&quot;true&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, set either in\n            markup or in JavaScript.  \n        &lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n            Thus, &lt;code&gt;$(&#39;#newschool&amp;nbsp;.dragme&#39;).attr(&#39;draggable&#39;, &#39;true&#39;)&lt;/code&gt;.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n            The original DOM event (as opposed to jQuery&#39;s event\n            wrapper) offers a property called &lt;code&gt;dataTransfer&lt;/code&gt;.\n            Beyond just manipulating elements, the new drag and drop\n            events accomodate the transmission of user-definable data\n            during the course of the interaction.  \n        &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n\n            Since these are first-class events, you can apply \n            &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://icant.co.uk/sandbox/eventdelegation/&quot;&gt;the technique of Event Delegation&lt;/a&gt;.\n        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n            What&#39;s that?  Well, imagine you have a list of 1000\n            list items—as part of a deeply-nested outline document,\n            for instance.  Rather than needing to attach listeners\n            or otherwise fiddle with all 1000 items, simply attach\n            a listener to the parent node (eg. the\n            &lt;code&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element) and all events from\n            the children will propagate up to the single parent listener.\n            As a bonus, all new child elements added after page\n            load will enjoy the same benefits.\n        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n            &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#delegated&quot;&gt;Check out this demo&lt;/a&gt;, \n            and \n            &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-delegated.js&quot;&gt;the associated JS code&lt;/a&gt; \n            to see more about these events and Event Delegation.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"datatransfer\">\n    <h2>Using dataTransfer</h2>\n    <p>\n        As mentioned in the last section, the new drag and drop events\n        let you send data along with a dragged element.  But, it's even\n        better than that:  Your drop targets can receive data\n        transferred by content objects dragged into the window from \n        other browser windows, and even <i>other applications</i>.\n    </p><p>\n\n<pre><code>    Since the example is a bit longer,  \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#data_transfer&quot;&gt;check out the live demo&lt;/a&gt;\n    and \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-datatransfer.js&quot;&gt;associated code&lt;/a&gt;\n    to get an idea of what&#39;s possible with &lt;code&gt;dataTransfer&lt;/code&gt;.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    In a nutshell, the stars of this show are the\n    &lt;code&gt;setData()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getData()&lt;/code&gt; methods of\n    the &lt;code&gt;dataTransfer&lt;/code&gt; property exposed by the Event object.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n    The &lt;code&gt;setData()&lt;/code&gt; method is typically called in the \n    &lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt; listener, loading &lt;code&gt;dataTransfer&lt;/code&gt;\n    up with one or more strings of content with associated\n    &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Recommended_Drag_Types#link&quot;&gt;recommended content types&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n    For illustration, here&#39;s a quick snippet from the example code:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot; line=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;<br>dt.setData(&#39;text/plain&#39;, $(&#39;#logo&#39;).parent().text());\ndt.setData(&#39;text/html&#39;, $(&#39;#logo&#39;).parent().html());\ndt.setData(&#39;text/uri-list&#39;, $(&#39;#logo&#39;)[0].src);\n    </pre>\n    </p><p>\n        On the other end, <code>getData()</code> allows you to query\n        for content by type (eg. <code>text/html</code> followed by\n        <code>text/plain</code>).  This, in turn, allows you to decide\n        on acceptable content types at the time of the\n        <code>drop</code> event or even during <code>dragover</code></p>\n<pre><code>    to offer feedback for unacceptable types during the drag.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    Here&#39;s another example from the receiving end of the example code:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot; line=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;<br>$(&#39;.content_url .content&#39;).text(dt.getData(&#39;text/uri-list&#39;));\n$(&#39;.content_text .content&#39;).text(dt.getData(&#39;text/plain&#39;));\n$(&#39;.content_html .content&#39;).html(dt.getData(&#39;text/html&#39;));\n    </pre>\n    <p>\n        Where <code>dataTransfer</code> really shines, though, is that\n        it allows your drop targets to receive content from \n        sources outside your defined draggable elements and even from\n        outside the browser altogether.  Firefox accepts such drags, \n        and attempts to populate <code>dataTransfer</code> with\n        appropriate content types extracted from the external object.\n    </p><p></p>\n<pre><code>    Thus, you could select some text in a word processor window and\n    drop it into one of your elements, and at least expect to find\n    it available as &lt;code&gt;text/plain&lt;/code&gt; content.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    You can also select content in \n    another browser window, and expect to see &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt;\n    appear in your events.

By default in\n       Firefox, this is a \"ghost\" image of the dragged element itself.  But,\n       the <code>dataTransfer</code> property of the original Event\n       object exposes the method <code>setDragImage()</code> for use\n       in customizing this representation.\n    </p><p>\n\n<pre><code>    There&#39;s\n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#feedback_image&quot;&gt;a live demo&lt;/a&gt; of this feature, as well as\n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-feedback-images.js&quot;&gt;associated JS code&lt;/a&gt; \n    available.

The\n        second two parameters indicate at what left and top offset\n        the mouse should appear in the image while dragging.\n    </p><p></p>\n<pre><code>    For example, since the &lt;code&gt;#logo&lt;/code&gt; image is 64x64,\n    the parameters in the second &lt;code&gt;setDragImage()&lt;/code&gt;\n    method places the mouse right in the center of the image.\n    On the other hand, the first call positions the feedback\n    image such that the mouse rests in the upper left corner.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"dragfeedback\">\n\n<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;Using Drop Effects&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    As mentioned at the start of this article, the drag and drop\n    interaction has been used to support actions such as copying,\n    moving, and linking.  Accordingly, the HTML 5 specification \n    accomodates these operations in the form of the \n    &lt;code&gt;effectAllowed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dropEffect&lt;/code&gt;\n    properties exposed by the Event object.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n\n    For a quick fix, check out the\n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#drag_effects&quot;&gt;a live demo&lt;/a&gt; \n    of this feature, as well as the\n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-effects.js&quot;&gt;associated JS code&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    The basic idea is that the &lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt; event\n    listener can set a value for &lt;code&gt;effectAllowed&lt;/code&gt; like so:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot; line=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;\nswitch (ev.target.id) {\n    case &#39;effectdrag0&#39;: dt.effectAllowed = &#39;copy&#39;; break;\n    case &#39;effectdrag1&#39;: dt.effectAllowed = &#39;move&#39;; break;\n    case &#39;effectdrag2&#39;: dt.effectAllowed = &#39;link&#39;; break;\n    case &#39;effectdrag3&#39;: dt.effectAllowed = &#39;all&#39;; break;\n    case &#39;effectdrag4&#39;: dt.effectAllowed = &#39;none&#39;; break;\n}\n    </pre>\n    <p>The choices available for this property include the following:</p>\n    <dl> \n        <dt><code>none</code></dt><dd>no operation is permitted </dd>\n        <dt><code>copy</code></dt><dd>copy only </dd></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;move&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;move only &lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;link only &lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;copyMove&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;copy or move only &lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;copyLink&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;copy or link only &lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;linkMove&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;link or move only &lt;/dd&gt;\n\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;all&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;copy, move, or link &lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;/dl&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    On the other end, the &lt;code&gt;dragover&lt;/code&gt; event listener \n    can set the value of the\n    &lt;code&gt;dropEffect&lt;/code&gt; property to indicate the expected effect\n    invoked on a successful drop.  If the value does\n    not match up with &lt;code&gt;effectAllowed&lt;/code&gt;, the drop will\n    be considered cancelled on completion.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n    In the \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#drag_effects&quot;&gt;a live demo&lt;/a&gt;,\n    you should be able to see that only elements with matching\n    effects can be dropped into the appropriate drop zones.  This\n    is accomplished with code like the following:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot; line=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;\nswitch (ev.target.id) {\n    case &#39;effectdrop0&#39;: dt.dropEffect = &#39;copy&#39;; break;\n    case &#39;effectdrop1&#39;: dt.dropEffect = &#39;move&#39;; break;\n    case &#39;effectdrop2&#39;: dt.dropEffect = &#39;link&#39;; break;\n    case &#39;effectdrop3&#39;: dt.dropEffect = &#39;all&#39;; break;\n    case &#39;effectdrop4&#39;: dt.dropEffect = &#39;none&#39;; break;\n}\n    </pre>\n    <p>\n        Although the OS itself can provide some feedback, you \n        can also use these properties to update your own visible \n        feedback, both on the dragged element and on the drop zone\n        itself.\n    </p></p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"conclusion\">\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>\n        The new first-class drag and drop events in HTML5 and Firefox\n        make supporting this form of UI interaction simple, concise,\n        and powerful in the browser.

For dragging from external applications (such as the Desktop) is a normal webpage able to get the data from the drop?

However, the documentation seems to state that on drop that data should be made available to the page.  Likewise, in the same way an image can be dragged off the page onto the desktop, can an arbitrary element be dragged onto the desktop with whatever file content to be saved?

I don't work on the browser itself, but I noticed that unexpected behavior on drag &amp; drop.  The window really should scroll when you get toward the top or bottom while dragging - and, in fact, most pre-HTML5 JS frameworks do that in their own drag &amp; drop abstractions.  </p>\n<p>Until / unless Firefox gets this fixed, the same sort of auto-scrolling could be hacked in to HTML5 drag and drop.  Not perfect, but it's doable.  That is, in the drag event, you can check if the mouse is near the upper or lower edge of the viewport - and if so, start scrolling appropriately.

It's another blog post—and this one\r\n<a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/html5-drag-and-drop/\">is cross-posted on hacks.mozilla.com</a>.\r\nI won't say this is the start of a renewed blogging habit, but let's see what happens.\r\n</i></p>\r\n\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\ndl { margin-left: 2em; }\r\ndd { margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.25em; }\r\n</style>\r\n<div id=\"introduction\">\r\n    <p>\r\n        Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions\r\n        afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it\r\n        allows users to pair the selection of an object with the\r\n        execution of an action, often including a second object in the\r\n        operation.  It's a simple yet powerful UI concept used to\r\n        support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),\r\n        and even the creation of link relationships.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        Since it's so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web\r\n        applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first\r\n        offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although\r\n        <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, and\r\n        <code>mouseup</code> made it possible, the implementation has been\r\n        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,\r\n        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,\r\n        there's a challenge to find the subject of the drop when\r\n        the interaction is completed.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        Of course, that doesn't prevent most modern JavaScript\r\n        frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and\r\n        throwing in some flourishes while they're at it.  But, wouldn't\r\n        it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and\r\n        drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd\">section on new drag-and-drop events</a>, and \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop\">Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation</a> of those events.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        If you want to jump straight to the code, I've put together \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html\">some simple demos</a> \r\n        of the new events.  \r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        I've even scratched an itch of my own and\r\n        built <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html\">the beginnings of an outline editor</a>,\r\n        where every draggable element is also a drop target—of which\r\n        there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something\r\n        that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past\r\n        while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from \r\n        <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop\">a GitHub repository</a>\r\n        I've created especially for this article—which continues after the jump.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"events\">\r\n\r\n    <h2>The New Drag and Drop Events</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        So, with no further ado, here are the new drag and drop events,\r\n        in roughly the order you might expect to see them fired:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <dl>\r\n        <dt><code>dragstart</code></dt>\r\n        <dd>\r\n            A drag has been initiated, with the dragged element as the\r\n            event target.\r\n        </dd>\r\n\r\n        <dt><code>drag</code></dt>\r\n        <dd>\r\n            The mouse has moved, with the dragged element as the event target.\r\n        </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>dragenter</code></dt>\r\n        <dd>\r\n            The dragged element has been moved into a drop listener,\r\n            with the drop listener element as the event target.\r\n        </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>dragover</code></dt>\r\n\r\n        <dd>\r\n            The dragged element has been moved over a drop listener,\r\n            with the drop listener element as the event target.

But, \r\n                <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#drag-and-drop-processing-model\">per the HTML 5 spec</a>,\r\n                draggable elements need an\r\n                attribute of <code>draggable=\"true\"</code>, set either in\r\n                markup or in JavaScript.  \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Thus, <code>$('#newschool&nbsp;.dragme').attr('draggable', 'true')</code>.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The original DOM event (as opposed to jQuery's event\r\n                wrapper) offers a property called <code>dataTransfer</code>.\r\n                Beyond just manipulating elements, the new drag and drop\r\n                events accomodate the transmission of user-definable data\r\n                during the course of the interaction.  \r\n            </p>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <p>\r\n\r\n                Since these are first-class events, you can apply \r\n                <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://icant.co.uk/sandbox/eventdelegation/\">the technique of Event Delegation</a>.\r\n            </p><p>\r\n                What's that?

Rather than needing to attach listeners\r\n                or otherwise fiddle with all 1000 items, simply attach\r\n                a listener to the parent node (eg. the\r\n                <code><ul></code> element) and all events from\r\n                the children will propagate up to the single parent listener.\r\n                As a bonus, all new child elements added after page\r\n                load will enjoy the same benefits.\r\n            </p><p>\r\n                <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#delegated\">Check out this demo</a>, \r\n                and \r\n                <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-delegated.js\">the associated JS code</a> \r\n                to see more about these events and Event Delegation.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"datatransfer\">\r\n    <h2>Using dataTransfer</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        As mentioned in the last section, the new drag and drop events\r\n        let you send data along with a dragged element.  But, it's even\r\n        better than that:  Your drop targets can receive data\r\n        transferred by content objects dragged into the window from \r\n        other browser windows, and even <i>other applications</i>.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        Since the example is a bit longer,  \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#data_transfer\">check out the live demo</a>\r\n        and \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-datatransfer.js\">associated code</a>\r\n        to get an idea of what's possible with <code>dataTransfer</code>.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        In a nutshell, the stars of this show are the\r\n        <code>setData()</code> and <code>getData()</code> methods of\r\n        the <code>dataTransfer</code> property exposed by the Event object.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        The <code>setData()</code> method is typically called in the \r\n        <code>dragstart</code> listener, loading <code>dataTransfer</code>\r\n        up with one or more strings of content with associated\r\n        <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Recommended_Drag_Types#link\">recommended content types</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        For illustration, here's a quick snippet from the example code:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    \r\ndt.setData('text/plain', $('#logo').parent().text());\r\ndt.setData('text/html', $('#logo').parent().html());\r\ndt.setData('text/uri-list', $('#logo')[0].src);\r\n    </pre>\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        On the other end, <code>getData()</code> allows you to query\r\n        for content by type (eg. <code>text/html</code> followed by\r\n        <code>text/plain</code>).  This, in turn, allows you to decide\r\n        on acceptable content types at the time of the\r\n        <code>drop</code> event or even during <code>dragover</code>\r\n\r\n        to offer feedback for unacceptable types during the drag.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        Here's another example from the receiving end of the example code:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    \r\n$('.content_url .content').text(dt.getData('text/uri-list'));\r\n$('.content_text .content').text(dt.getData('text/plain'));\r\n$('.content_html .content').html(dt.getData('text/html'));\r\n    </pre>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Where <code>dataTransfer</code> really shines, though, is that\r\n        it allows your drop targets to receive content from \r\n        sources outside your defined draggable elements and even from\r\n        outside the browser altogether.  Firefox accepts such drags, \r\n        and attempts to populate <code>dataTransfer</code> with\r\n        appropriate content types extracted from the external object.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        Thus, you could select some text in a word processor window and\r\n        drop it into one of your elements, and at least expect to find\r\n        it available as <code>text/plain</code> content.  \r\n    </p><p>\r\n        You can also select content in \r\n        another browser window, and expect to see <code>text/html</code>\r\n        appear in your events.

By default in\r\n       Firefox, this is a \"ghost\" image of the dragged element itself.  But,\r\n       the <code>dataTransfer</code> property of the original Event\r\n       object exposes the method <code>setDragImage()</code> for use\r\n       in customizing this representation.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        There's\r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#feedback_image\">a live demo</a> of this feature, as well as\r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-feedback-images.js\">associated JS code</a> \r\n        available.  The gist, however, is sketched out in these code snippets:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    \r\n\r\ndt.setDragImage( $('#feedback_image h2')[0], 0, 0);\r\n\r\ndt.setDragImage( $('#logo')[0], 32, 32); \r\n\r\nvar canvas = document.createElement(\"canvas\");\r\ncanvas.width = canvas.height = 50;\r\n\r\nvar ctx = canvas.getContext(\"2d\");\r\nctx.lineWidth = 8;\r\nctx.moveTo(25,0);\r\nctx.lineTo(50, 50);\r\nctx.lineTo(0, 50);\r\nctx.lineTo(25, 0);\r\nctx.stroke();\r\n\r\ndt.setDragImage(canvas, 25, 25);\r\n    </pre>\r\n    <p>\r\n        You can supply a DOM node as the first parameter to \r\n        <code>setDragImage()</code>, which includes everything from\r\n        text to images to <code>canvas</code> elements.  The\r\n        second two parameters indicate at what left and top offset\r\n        the mouse should appear in the image while dragging.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        For example, since the <code>#logo</code> image is 64x64,\r\n        the parameters in the second <code>setDragImage()</code>\r\n        method places the mouse right in the center of the image.\r\n        On the other hand, the first call positions the feedback\r\n        image such that the mouse rests in the upper left corner.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"dragfeedback\">\r\n\r\n    <h2>Using Drop Effects</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        As mentioned at the start of this article, the drag and drop\r\n        interaction has been used to support actions such as copying,\r\n        moving, and linking.  Accordingly, the HTML 5 specification \r\n        accomodates these operations in the form of the \r\n        <code>effectAllowed</code> and <code>dropEffect</code>\r\n        properties exposed by the Event object.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n        For a quick fix, check out the\r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#drag_effects\">a live demo</a> \r\n        of this feature, as well as the\r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-effects.js\">associated JS code</a>.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        The basic idea is that the <code>dragstart</code> event\r\n        listener can set a value for <code>effectAllowed</code> like so:\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;\r\nswitch (ev.target.id) {\r\n    case 'effectdrag0': dt.effectAllowed = 'copy'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrag1': dt.effectAllowed = 'move'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrag2': dt.effectAllowed = 'link'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrag3': dt.effectAllowed = 'all'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrag4': dt.effectAllowed = 'none'; break;\r\n}\r\n    </pre>\r\n    <p>The choices available for this property include the following:</p>\r\n    <dl> \r\n        <dt><code>none</code></dt><dd>no operation is permitted </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>copy</code></dt><dd>copy only </dd>\r\n\r\n        <dt><code>move</code></dt><dd>move only </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>link</code></dt><dd>link only </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>copyMove</code></dt><dd>copy or move only </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>copyLink</code></dt><dd>copy or link only </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>linkMove</code></dt><dd>link or move only </dd>\r\n\r\n        <dt><code>all</code></dt><dd>copy, move, or link </dd>\r\n    </dl>\r\n    <p>\r\n        On the other end, the <code>dragover</code> event listener \r\n        can set the value of the\r\n        <code>dropEffect</code> property to indicate the expected effect\r\n        invoked on a successful drop.  If the value does\r\n        not match up with <code>effectAllowed</code>, the drop will\r\n        be considered cancelled on completion.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        In the \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#drag_effects\">a live demo</a>,\r\n        you should be able to see that only elements with matching\r\n        effects can be dropped into the appropriate drop zones.  This\r\n        is accomplished with code like the following:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;\r\nswitch (ev.target.id) {\r\n    case 'effectdrop0': dt.dropEffect = 'copy'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop1': dt.dropEffect = 'move'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop2': dt.dropEffect = 'link'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop3': dt.dropEffect = 'all'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop4': dt.dropEffect = 'none'; break;\r\n}\r\n    </pre>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Although the OS itself can provide some feedback, you \r\n        can also use these properties to update your own visible \r\n        feedback, both on the dragged element and on the drop zone\r\n        itself.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"conclusion\">\r\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        The new first-class drag and drop events in HTML5 and Firefox\r\n        make supporting this form of UI interaction simple, concise,\r\n        and powerful in the browser.

For dragging from external applications (such as the Desktop) is a normal webpage able to get the data from the drop?

However, the documentation seems to state that on drop that data should be made available to the page.  Likewise, in the same way an image can be dragged off the page onto the desktop, can an arbitrary element be dragged onto the desktop with whatever file content to be saved?

I don't work on the browser itself, but I noticed that unexpected behavior on drag &amp; drop.  The window really should scroll when you get toward the top or bottom while dragging - and, in fact, most pre-HTML5 JS frameworks do that in their own drag &amp; drop abstractions.  </p>\n\n<p>Until / unless Firefox gets this fixed, the same sort of auto-scrolling could be hacked in to HTML5 drag and drop.  Not perfect, but it's doable.  That is, in the drag event, you can check if the mouse is near the upper or lower edge of the viewport - and if so, start scrolling appropriately. That's pretty much how the JS frameworks do it with old-school D&D</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090975\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.copperbot.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=df48b2c2a3a2be51b1e15f10c5fb05da&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.copperbot.net\">CopperBot</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090975\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-07-23T21:41:07\">2009-07-23T21:41:07</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Very cool article!

It&apos;s another blog post&#x2014;and this one\n<a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/html5-drag-and-drop/\">is cross-posted on hacks.mozilla.com</a>.\nI won&apos;t say this is the start of a renewed blogging habit, but let&apos;s see what happens.\n</i></p>\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\ndl { margin-left: 2em; }\ndd { margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.25em; }\n</style>\n<div id=\"introduction\">\n    <p>\n        Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions\n        afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it\n        allows users to pair the selection of an object with the\n        execution of an action, often including a second object in the\n        operation.  It&apos;s a simple yet powerful UI concept used to\n        support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),\n        and even the creation of link relationships.\n    </p><p>\n        Since it&apos;s so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web\n        applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first\n        offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although\n        <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, and\n        <code>mouseup</code> made it possible, the implementation has been\n        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,\n        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,\n        there&apos;s a challenge to find the subject of the drop when\n        the interaction is completed.\n    </p><p>\n\n</p><pre><code>    Of course, that doesn&apos;t prevent most modern JavaScript\n    frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and\n    throwing in some flourishes while they&apos;re at it.  But, wouldn&apos;t\n    it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and\n    drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd&quot;&gt;section on new drag-and-drop events&lt;/a&gt;, and \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop&quot;&gt;Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation&lt;/a&gt; of those events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    If you want to jump straight to the code, I&apos;ve put together \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html&quot;&gt;some simple demos&lt;/a&gt; \n    of the new events.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n    I&apos;ve even scratched an itch of my own and\n    built &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html&quot;&gt;the beginnings of an outline editor&lt;/a&gt;,\n    where every draggable element is also a drop target&#x2014;of which\n    there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something\n    that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past\n    while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from \n    &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop&quot;&gt;a GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;\n    I&apos;ve created especially for this article&#x2014;which continues after the jump.\n&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n"

However it&#39;s expressed—is it <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/shortlink\"><code>rel=&quot;shortlink&quot;</code></a> now?—the final remaining things I&#39;d like to see are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>An more generalized scope for alternate URL choices asserted by publishers, not just URL shortening.  Other criteria beyond character length include ease of entry on mobile devices (eg. short, but also simple, maybe mostly numeric), ease of verbal mention (eg. billboards, postcards, etc).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>HTTP headers are great where available—hooray for HEAD—but it still needs to be in the page for publishers who can&#39;t set custom headers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Microformats are great, but I&#39;d rather not parse a whole page to the footer to lift out the desired URLs.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Don&#39;t panic. Have fun.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And with that, I&#39;m going to try coming up with other things to write about so this blog doesn&#39;t stay dormant.  The rest of this entry remains unedited below...</p>\n<!--more-->\n<hr />\n\n<p><strike>So, like it says up there: I like <a href=\"http://revcanonical.appspot.com/\">rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</a>.</strike></p>\n<p>Basically, it&#39;s a way of saying—instead of using that 3rd-party service <em>you</em> like for munging <em>my</em> URLs, use one of these pre-munged URLs I&#39;ve provided.  Ideally, the URLs I provide will be shorter for your needs, but my URLs won&#39;t be subject to <a href=\"http://joshua.schachter.org/2009/04/on-url-shorteners.html\">potentially distasteful things I object to with respect to a service you might pick</a>.</p>\n<p>I like keeping control of URL spaces in the hands of their publishers.  This also opens the field for more individual choice in URL shortening services, allowing more people to try their hand at building a better mouse trap—or allowing publishers to opt out of the mess altogether.  </p>\n<p>And, apropos of that, I tend to like <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> as the means of expressing this choice.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s a lot more background on this whole shebang, but I&#39;ll just stick to my $0.02 on the discussion so far.</p>\n<h3 id=\"its-too-alpha-geeky-to-get-adoptedalso-nerds\"><a href=\"http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2009/04/11/revcanonicalDiggBarOutrageCausesBadIdeasToComeOutOfTheWoodWork.aspx\">It&#39;s too alpha geeky to get adopted—also: NERDS!</a></h3>\n<p>Alpha geeks write plugins for web publishing systems used by less-alpha geeks, who eventually install web publishing systems for those even further down the geek scale.  It&#39;s not unheard of for something incredibly nerdy to become relatively common, if it proves useful.</p>\n<p>Feed auto-discovery is in blogging software and browsers now—it was once considered a somewhat arcane usage of the <code>rel</code> attribute on <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags in HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"everyone-needs-to-implement-their-own-url-shortener\"><a href=\"http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2009/04/11/revcanonicalDiggBarOutrageCausesBadIdeasToComeOutOfTheWoodWork.aspx\">Everyone needs to implement their own URL shortener.</a></h3>\n<p>No, but everyone gets to pick a shortener for their own URLs—which could coincidentally be self-hosted or third-party.  Isn&#39;t the web great?</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-rev-attribute-is-too-hard-to-understand-people-will-get-it-wrong\"><a href=\"http://benramsey.com/archives/a-revcanonical-rebuttal/\">The <code>rev</code> attribute is too hard to understand, people will get it wrong</a>.</h3>\n<p>I hadn&#39;t paid much attention to the <code>rev</code> attribute until a week or so ago.  I <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#adef-rev\">read the HTML spec on links</a> again.  Within 10 minutes of reading the spec, my understanding became this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>rel=&quot;{X}&quot;</code> — &quot;this link means {X} in relation to the current page&quot;.</li>\n<li><code>rev=&quot;{X}&quot;</code> — &quot;this current page means {X} in relation to this link&quot;.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I may have misunderstood it—if so, explain to me how and I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s harder to understand than I think.  There are harder concepts in the HTML 4 spec.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-rev-attribute-is-removed-in-html5\">The <code>rev</code> attribute is removed in HTML5</h3>\n<p>That&#39;s too bad for HTML5.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-July/006888.html\">The rationale given for the removal</a> seems sensible enough.  But, I&#39;d say the rationale for removal is weakened if someone finds a use for the attribute and uses it correctly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"relshorter--relshort-is-better-and-more-explicit\"><code>rel=&quot;shorter&quot;</code> / <code>rel=&quot;short&quot;</code> is better and more explicit.</h3>\n<p>I like this idea in general, and I don&#39;t <em>really</em> care strongly enough about <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> vs <code>rel=&quot;short&quot;</code> to make much noise beyond this blog post.  </p>\n<p>But, I prefer the semantics of <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code>, I don&#39;t think <code>rel=&quot;short(er)&quot;</code> is better, and actually I think the less explicit assertion is a feature.  I&#39;ve not yet been convinced otherwise—but realistically, if either catches on, I&#39;ll probably use the most popular.</p>\n<h3 id=\"revcanonical-doesnt-mean-shorter-url\"><code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> doesn&#39;t mean &quot;shorter URL&quot;</h3>\n<p>That&#39;s okay—what if I don&#39;t <em>want</em> you to have shortened versions of my URLs?  Doesn&#39;t fit in your tweet?  Screw you.  I didn&#39;t want you to link to me that badly anyway.  Bah.  </p>\n<p>That, of course, is self-defeating.  Conventional use of the attribute will probably yield shorter URLs out of self-interest.  Furthermore, I could even offer a half-dozen URL variations, and you could use the string length function in the language of your choice to pick one on the basis of shortness.  There&#39;s a lot of choice to go around here.</p>\n<p>Also, feed auto-discovery links don&#39;t always lead to truly alternate versions of the current page—but instead to a useful set of items, many of which may currently appear somewhere on the page.  So, even the &quot;clear&quot; semantics have some play in them as used in the wild.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-revcanonical-http-header-is-better\"><a href=\"http://shiflett.org/blog/2009/apr/a-rev-canonical-http-header\">A <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> HTTP header is better.</a></h3>\n<p>Hmm, maybe.  It would certainly allow for possibly lighter-weight HEAD requests in determining the alternative URL for a given URL.  But, I would expect it to fall apart in collections of static HTML pages baked by an offline script where web server configuration might not make setting custom headers easy.</p>\n<p>Not everyone has the luxury / inclination to have a dynamic language capable of setting headers running in their web server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"revcanonical-should-appear-on-hyperlinks-in-the-body-of-the-page\"><a href=\"http://adactio.com/journal/1568/\"><code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> should appear on hyperlinks in the body of the page</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/08/whats-old-scraping-is-new-again-microformats\">I like microformats</a>, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/17/magic-microformat-forms\">in general</a>.  But, I don&#39;t really want to potentially parse a whole page to find the shorter URL that might be in the footer.  With <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, I only have to parse so far before I find it or give up.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s a lot of prior art on this with relation to feed autodiscovery—we used to mainly look for RSS feed URLs inside the page, too.  It sucked.</p>\n<h3 id=\"claiming-to-be-canonical-for-another-url-is-trouble\"><a href=\"http://benramsey.com/archives/a-revcanonical-rebuttal/#comment-288465\">Claiming to be canonical for another URL is trouble.</a></h3>\n<p>Okay, how about requiring a reciprocal <code>rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> on the same page with <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p>Trust but verify—and only accept <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> where <code>rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> matches the current URL <em>and</em> <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> yields a 301 redirect to the <code>rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p>I can&#39;t see this verification process being necessarily more burdensome than using a 3rd-party shortener API—and that&#39;s <em>if</em> you&#39;re paranoid and building an index that needs some measure of resistance to gaming.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-single-character-slip-from-revcanonical-to-relcanonical-could-wreck-your-googlejuice\"><a href=\"http://samj.net/2009/04/revcanonical-considered-harmful.html?showComment=1239617160000#c7231589643969293690\">A single character slip from <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> to <code>rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> could wreck your Googlejuice!</a></h3>\n<p>So, don&#39;t do that.  </p>\n<p>Maybe Googlejuice should be more resilient.

I like the idea behind <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> and I prefer its expression as <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> best—but the idea is the important thing.

The problem I have is this:</p>\n<p>rel=canonical was introduced so when people went to various urls that a search engine would know that the url specified in rel=canonical was the real one.  Let's do this to make life easier:</p>\n<p>http://foo.com/A\nand \nhttp://foo.com/B</p>\n<p>both go to the exact same page, and the publisher can't for some reason redirect to the canonicalized page (maybe it's amazon and they have stupid large urls with affiliate codes).</p>\n<p>so if the former is canonical then this is present:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>whether you go to /A or /B.</p>\n<p>if they use rev=\"canonical\":</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Should only be shown if they are visitng /A not /B otherwise that rev statement implies that /A or /B are the canonical forms of \"http://f.us/A\".</p>\n<p>I think that's why the rev attribute isn't a very good one.

That was an amazingly dumb move, luckily it is a draft still is all I can say. Here is why I believe this:\n1) 1 char diff argument: shut up you nub programmers\n2) misuse: it's night vs day, black vs white, there is no gray area except that which your confused minds have created. The confusion -I think- usually comes in to play when considering a value, which is easy if you truly understand the diff between @rel and @rev.\n3) @rev values can be represented as @rel values: sure I agree but this can not be true without adding more rel values then are necessary with a @rev which is already in the html 4 spec for a reason. If you remove something with use you cause confusion on multiple fronts: first people have to become aware of the change, then they need to understand why the change was made, then they need to make the changes to their code base, and finally when they want to express rev=canonical with a @rel value, debates over what best @rel value represents the equivalent of another @rel value if it were used in @rev occur..</p>\n<p>I submit the debate which the opposition to rev=canonical are having over rel=short* as evidence that @rev is required. A link with rev=canonical that is short is a short url of the canonical url by definition, thus rel=short* is redundant for the use case of discovering a short url for the canonical url of some document. Albeit, I think rel=shorturl (or whatever is finally decided on) could be used by the publisher to indicate a preferred short url(s), if say there were &gt;1 rev=canonical.</p>\n<p>In an algorithm to discover a short url for a document one method could be to scan all links and find the shortest rev=canonical, or if a rel=shorturl is provided then use that and stop scanning immediately. My point is that rev=canonical should be used. Also rel=shorturl adds a marginal benefit to rev=canonical.</p>\n<p>Another point, a rel=shorturl is rev=canonical by definition, thus if you were to use rel=shorturl and @rev were alive and well as it should be, you should automatically add rev=canonical (even though it is implied).</p>\n<p>Another argument the opposition make to using rev=canonical is that the number of rev=canonical's are possibly infinite, so I say only list the rev=canonical's which a user may find of interest for the use cases you can imagine.</p>\n<p>Another case for using rev=canonical is using rev=canonical with rel=mobile perhaps? so that a user can scan rev=canonical's for a rel=mobile url which is short enough to fit in the newest microblog gadget. Where a rel=mobile without rev=canonical could be the mobile site's homepage, even better for this link would be rel=\"mobile home\" without rev=canonical.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091029\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://erikvold.com/index.cfm\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8fa21a16e24905fba4413501e3afb36e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://erikvold.com/index.cfm\">Erik Vold</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221091029\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-21T05:17:14\">2009-04-21T05:17:14</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>The reasons why I like rev=canonical: http://erikvold.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/4/21/rev_canonical_good</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091030\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221091030\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-28T05:31:35\">2009-04-28T05:31:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>@Erik: Well, I \"gave in\" mainly because I wasn't really looking for a fight and had a vacation to attend to.</p>\n<p>After that, the amount of hyperbolic stop energy being slung around rel=short{foo} has exhausted my care for the subject.</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "*Update 4/14*: So, I liked `rev=\"canonical\"`, but I like the notion of pages offering sets of alternative URLs better.  [There are enough cracks in the case](http://www.mnot.net/blog/2009/04/14/rev_canonical_bad) for `rev=\"canonical\"` to stop caring about it and instead focus on the notion behind it.  However it's expressed—is it [`rel=\"shortlink\"`](http://groups.google.com/group/shortlink) now?—the final remaining things I'd like to see are:\r\n\r\n* An more generalized scope for alternate URL choices asserted by publishers, not just URL shortening.  Other criteria beyond character length include ease of entry on mobile devices (eg. short, but also simple, maybe mostly numeric), ease of verbal mention (eg. billboards, postcards, etc).\r\n\r\n* HTTP headers are great where available—hooray for HEAD—but it still needs to be in the page for publishers who can't set custom headers.\r\n\r\n* Microformats are great, but I'd rather not parse a whole page to the footer to lift out the desired URLs.\r\n\r\n* Don't panic. Have fun.\r\n\r\nAnd with that, I'm going to try coming up with other things to write about so this blog doesn't stay dormant.  The rest of this entry remains unedited below...\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strike>So, like it says up there: I like [rev=\"canonical\"](http://revcanonical.appspot.com/).</strike>\r\n\r\nBasically, it's a way of saying—instead of using that 3rd-party service *you* like for munging *my* URLs, use one of these pre-munged URLs I've provided.  Ideally, the URLs I provide will be shorter for your needs, but my URLs won't be subject to [potentially distasteful things I object to with respect to a service you might pick](http://joshua.schachter.org/2009/04/on-url-shorteners.html).\r\n\r\nI like keeping control of URL spaces in the hands of their publishers.  This also opens the field for more individual choice in URL shortening services, allowing more people to try their hand at building a better mouse trap—or allowing publishers to opt out of the mess altogether.  \r\n\r\nAnd, apropos of that, I tend to like `rev=\"canonical\"` as the means of expressing this choice.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot more background on this whole shebang, but I'll just stick to my $0.02 on the discussion so far.\r\n\r\n### [It's too alpha geeky to get adopted—also: NERDS!](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2009/04/11/revcanonicalDiggBarOutrageCausesBadIdeasToComeOutOfTheWoodWork.aspx)\r\n\r\nAlpha geeks write plugins for web publishing systems used by less-alpha geeks, who eventually install web publishing systems for those even further down the geek scale.  It's not unheard of for something incredibly nerdy to become relatively common, if it proves useful.\r\n\r\nFeed auto-discovery is in blogging software and browsers now—it was once considered a somewhat arcane usage of the `rel` attribute on `<link>` tags in HTML `<head>`.\r\n\r\n### [Everyone needs to implement their own URL shortener.](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2009/04/11/revcanonicalDiggBarOutrageCausesBadIdeasToComeOutOfTheWoodWork.aspx)\r\n\r\nNo, but everyone gets to pick a shortener for their own URLs—which could coincidentally be self-hosted or third-party.  Isn't the web great?\r\n\r\n### [The `rev` attribute is too hard to understand, people will get it wrong](http://benramsey.com/archives/a-revcanonical-rebuttal/).\r\n\r\nI hadn't paid much attention to the `rev` attribute until a week or so ago.  I [read the HTML spec on links](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#adef-rev) again.  Within 10 minutes of reading the spec, my understanding became this:\r\n\r\n* `rel=\"{X}\"` — \"this link means {X} in relation to the current page\".\r\n* `rev=\"{X}\"` — \"this current page means {X} in relation to this link\".\r\n\r\nI may have misunderstood it—if so, explain to me how and I'll admit it's harder to understand than I think.  There are harder concepts in the HTML 4 spec.\r\n\r\n### The `rev` attribute is removed in HTML5\r\n\r\nThat's too bad for HTML5.  \r\n\r\n[The rationale given for the removal](http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-July/006888.html) seems sensible enough.  But, I'd say the rationale for removal is weakened if someone finds a use for the attribute and uses it correctly.\r\n\r\n### `rel=\"shorter\"` / `rel=\"short\"` is better and more explicit.\r\n\r\nI like this idea in general, and I don't *really* care strongly enough about `rev=\"canonical\"` vs `rel=\"short\"` to make much noise beyond this blog post.  \r\n\r\nBut, I prefer the semantics of `rev=\"canonical\"`, I don't think `rel=\"short(er)\"` is better, and actually I think the less explicit assertion is a feature.  I've not yet been convinced otherwise—but realistically, if either catches on, I'll probably use the most popular.\r\n\r\n### `rev=\"canonical\"` doesn't mean \"shorter URL\"\r\n\r\nThat's okay—what if I don't *want* you to have shortened versions of my URLs?  Doesn't fit in your tweet?  Screw you.  I didn't want you to link to me that badly anyway.  Bah.  \r\n\r\nThat, of course, is self-defeating.  Conventional use of the attribute will probably yield shorter URLs out of self-interest.  Furthermore, I could even offer a half-dozen URL variations, and you could use the string length function in the language of your choice to pick one on the basis of shortness.  There's a lot of choice to go around here.\r\n\r\nAlso, feed auto-discovery links don't always lead to truly alternate versions of the current page—but instead to a useful set of items, many of which may currently appear somewhere on the page.  So, even the \"clear\" semantics have some play in them as used in the wild.\r\n\r\n### [A `rev=\"canonical\"` HTTP header is better.](http://shiflett.org/blog/2009/apr/a-rev-canonical-http-header)\r\n\r\nHmm, maybe.  It would certainly allow for possibly lighter-weight HEAD requests in determining the alternative URL for a given URL.  But, I would expect it to fall apart in collections of static HTML pages baked by an offline script where web server configuration might not make setting custom headers easy.\r\n\r\nNot everyone has the luxury / inclination to have a dynamic language capable of setting headers running in their web server.\r\n\r\n### [`rev=\"canonical\"` should appear on hyperlinks in the body of the page](http://adactio.com/journal/1568/)\r\n\r\n[I like microformats](http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/08/whats-old-scraping-is-new-again-microformats), [in general](http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/17/magic-microformat-forms).  But, I don't really want to potentially parse a whole page to find the shorter URL that might be in the footer.  With `rev=\"canonical\"` in the `<head>`, I only have to parse so far before I find it or give up.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of prior art on this with relation to feed autodiscovery—we used to mainly look for RSS feed URLs inside the page, too.  It sucked.\r\n\r\n### [Claiming to be canonical for another URL is trouble.](http://benramsey.com/archives/a-revcanonical-rebuttal/#comment-288465)\r\n\r\nOkay, how about requiring a reciprocal `rel=\"canonical\"` on the same page with `rev=\"canonical\"`.\r\n\r\nTrust but verify—and only accept `rev=\"canonical\"` where `rel=\"canonical\"` matches the current URL *and* `rev=\"canonical\"` yields a 301 redirect to the `rel=\"canonical\"`.\r\n\r\nI can't see this verification process being necessarily more burdensome than using a 3rd-party shortener API—and that's *if* you're paranoid and building an index that needs some measure of resistance to gaming.\r\n\r\n### [A single character slip from `rev=\"canonical\"` to `rel=\"canonical\"` could wreck your Googlejuice!](http://samj.net/2009/04/revcanonical-considered-harmful.html?showComment=1239617160000#c7231589643969293690)\r\n\r\nSo, don't do that.  \r\n\r\nMaybe Googlejuice should be more resilient.  Maybe it actually is—has anyone actually soured their juice yet with a mistake like this and lived to tell the tale?  \r\n\r\nEither way, characters mean things in computer languages, so make sure you use the right ones in the right order.\r\n\r\n### You guys are moving on this stuff too fast!\r\n\r\nWelcome to 2002, when lots of us had more spare time than employment and we deployed new crap like this on our blogs and sites daily.  \r\n\r\nBack in those olden days, we manipulated raw HTML with our bare hands and deployed radioactive code using our teeth—all without benefit of protective change control.  We probably all have cancer of the access logs now, but it was all in the name of Web Science!\r\n\r\n### Too long; didn't read\r\n\r\nSo, yeah.  I like the idea behind `rev=\"canonical\"` and I prefer its expression as `rev=\"canonical\"` best—but the idea is the important thing.  Let's get over the expression part fast and spend more time exploring the nuts and bolts and implications of the concept itself.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091011\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4e160e713acf1ab8547d1c36233389c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/\">http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221091011\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-13T14:00:04\">2009-04-13T14:00:04</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Forget rel=\"short\" or rel=\"shorter\".

That was an amazingly dumb move, luckily it is a draft still is all I can say. Here is why I believe this:\n1) 1 char diff argument: shut up you nub programmers\n2) misuse: it's night vs day, black vs white, there is no gray area except that which your confused minds have created. The confusion -I think- usually comes in to play when considering a value, which is easy if you truly understand the diff between @rel and @rev.\n3) @rev values can be represented as @rel values: sure I agree but this can not be true without adding more rel values then are necessary with a @rev which is already in the html 4 spec for a reason. If you remove something with use you cause confusion on multiple fronts: first people have to become aware of the change, then they need to understand why the change was made, then they need to make the changes to their code base, and finally when they want to express rev=canonical with a @rel value, debates over what best @rel value represents the equivalent of another @rel value if it were used in @rev occur..</p>\n\n<p>I submit the debate which the opposition to rev=canonical are having over rel=short* as evidence that @rev is required. A link with rev=canonical that is short is a short url of the canonical url by definition, thus rel=short* is redundant for the use case of discovering a short url for the canonical url of some document. Albeit, I think rel=shorturl (or whatever is finally decided on) could be used by the publisher to indicate a preferred short url(s), if say there were &gt;1 rev=canonical.</p>\n\n<p>In an algorithm to discover a short url for a document one method could be to scan all links and find the shortest rev=canonical, or if a rel=shorturl is provided then use that and stop scanning immediately. My point is that rev=canonical should be used. Also rel=shorturl adds a marginal benefit to rev=canonical.</p>\n\n<p>Another point, a rel=shorturl is rev=canonical by definition, thus if you were to use rel=shorturl and @rev were alive and well as it should be, you should automatically add rev=canonical (even though it is implied).</p>\n\n<p>Another argument the opposition make to using rev=canonical is that the number of rev=canonical's are possibly infinite, so I say only list the rev=canonical's which a user may find of interest for the use cases you can imagine.</p>\n\n<p>Another case for using rev=canonical is using rev=canonical with rel=mobile perhaps? so that a user can scan rev=canonical's for a rel=mobile url which is short enough to fit in the newest microblog gadget. Where a rel=mobile without rev=canonical could be the mobile site's homepage, even better for this link would be rel=\"mobile home\" without rev=canonical.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091029\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://erikvold.com/index.cfm\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8fa21a16e24905fba4413501e3afb36e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://erikvold.com/index.cfm\">Erik Vold</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221091029\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-21T05:17:14\">2009-04-21T05:17:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>The reasons why I like rev=canonical: http://erikvold.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/4/21/rev_canonical_good</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091030\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221091030\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-28T05:31:35\">2009-04-28T05:31:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@Erik: Well, I \"gave in\" mainly because I wasn't really looking for a fight and had a vacation to attend to.</p>\n\n<p>After that, the amount of hyperbolic stop energy being slung around rel=short{foo} has exhausted my care for the subject.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

My wife is a nerd, who tracked me down via a user name shown in the webcam picture I used for my Yahoo! Personals ad, in order to avoid paying to reply.  [Dial-up BBSes and DOOR games played a part in our courtship][doorgames].\r\n2. We have [two ocicats][ocicats], littermates named [Puck][puck] and [Inanna][inanna].  They're both [very cute][cute] and are [more awesome][awesome] than anyone else's cats. \r\n3. I have [sleep apnea][apnea], and use [a CPAP machine][cpap] every night.  [If you snore, go get tested][snore].  Heart disease, [of which my snoring father died][dad], is one of many possible consequences of untreated sleep apnea.\r\n4. [Although I have been a computer nerd since the age of 7][newly], I had the wild notion in starting college that I wanted to be [a journalist][ratreview] or a psychologist.  Luckily, the web took off during my freshman year, which let me be a little of all the above.  [I'm not sure why I ever thought I'd be anything other than a computer nerd][growup].\r\n6. I'm [a complete introvert][introvert] and though I work hard at being sociable, I need a day or two alone for every half-day or so spent being social.  My main coping mechanism since even before my teenage years was to make friends from behind a keyboard and screen, and the internet has made that even more scalable as I've grown up.  And now, I get to work that way too—HUGE SUCCESS!\r\n1. In my senior year of High School, I won 2nd place in [the Ayn Rand Institute's *The Fountainhead* essay contest][essay].  This was the culmination of having read every scrap of Ayn Rand's writing I could get my hands on throughout High School.  I used the money to take a summer trip to visit a friend who'd moved to Texas and to buy my [well used, now dead palmtop PC][palmtop].\r\n7. I like extremely hot spicy food, insanely hop-saturated beer, Irish whiskey, and fresh locally roasted coffee.\r\n\r\n[Per Ben Hearsum][ben], I think I'll make this a leaf node in the meme spanning the [Mozillasphere][].

So, I suspect this means I&#39;m not <em>entirely</em> opposed to the sentiment in <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a>, because I don&#39;t think tags work everywhere their use is attempted.</p>\n<p>The rest of this entry elaborates on the above.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>From Cathy Marshall&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Have I convinced you that tags aren't all they've cracked up to be? I hope I have, but nonetheless there's a lingering fascination. Surely there's something to be done about tags: we don't want to just turn up our noses at Mr. Weinberger's argument.</blockquote>\n\n<p>From Mark Bernstein&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.markbernstein.org/Jan09/InTEKKATags.html\">In TEKKA: Tags</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\nThe study could be repeated on more images, and in additional contexts. It might be bad luck. But if it’s a repeatable result — and I think we all know it is — then we’re going to have to rethink a lot of our Web 2.0 rhetoric. Folksonomy is an illusion.</blockquote>\n\n<p>From my <a href=\"http://delicious.com/url/125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd#item-125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd972759\">bookmark on Delicious</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>If you can get past the rambling paragraphs of awkward fun-poking at tags interspersed with library science / web 2.0 / cultural references—as well as a discovery of what, you know, Flickr is all about—there's a well-embellished and obsessively-assembled statistical analysis of tags vs title vs notes in finding photos featuring tourist heel-spinning on the testicles of a bull mosaic in Milan. My impression is that she's missed the point of tags, but I'm having trouble reducing the impression to a critique.</blockquote>\n\n<p>It might be that I&#39;m intimidated by the writing in <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> or by the fact that a lot of work was done to produce numbers I can&#39;t dispute.  Either way, I have neither the time to produce a counter-study nor the wherewithal to extract and refute points in that article with precision.  So, I&#39;m just going to throw my impressions out there and hope they coalesce.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tags are extremely useful to me.<ul>\n<li>I&#39;ve been using tags on Delicious since shortly after the site was created.  </li>\n<li>To date, <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/deusx\">I&#39;ve saved 11825 bookmarks and spawned 6069 tags</a>.  (More on that ratio later.)  </li>\n<li>Tags have worked very well for me, both in later finding my own saved resources and in finding aggregates of others&#39;.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Flickr is not the poster child of tagging—Delicious is.  <ul>\n<li>On Flickr, I&#39;ve found tags occasionally interesting, but not incredibly so.  More a curiosity than a killer feature, really.  (More on that in a bit, too.)</li>\n<li>To be honest, I&#39;ve not found a great deal of use for tags around Web 2.0 properties beyond Delicious, folksonomy hype notwithstanding.  </li>\n<li>Fun fact: When I worked on Delicious, we disliked the term &quot;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy\">folksonomy</a>&quot; and tried never to use it in serious discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The places where I&#39;ve found tags useful are text-heavy, where the full text is either not indexed or not displayed in results when using search.<ul>\n<li>Consider magazine articles or blog posts bookmarked on Delicious.</li>\n<li>Those bookmarks are subject to the character limits of title or description fields.  </li>\n<li>Far more often than on Flickr, there is information in tags not present in a bookmark&#39;s title or description.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>On Delicious, the use of bookmarklets and extensions is the primary source of new bookmarks.  <ul>\n<li>These tools tend to produce a title based on the original bookmarked page and, when present, a description summarized from the page contents by way of highlighted text.</li>\n<li>With this in mind, consider that tags often make up the <strong>sole intentional contribution</strong> made to the bookmark by the person saving it.  <ul>\n<li>Beyond the choice to save the bookmark in the first place, that is.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Whereas on Flickr, the effort is spent on title and, sometimes, the description.  Beyond that point, tags are an afterthought, at best.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The user interface of tagging is near effortless versus, say, formal taxonomies or nested folders.  <ul>\n<li>Even the much-debated choice of the big, fat space bar as a delimiter supports minimal effort.</li>\n<li>Minimal effort lowers mental cost, which promotes more noise, but also encourages more input (or  any input) and thus more signal overall.</li>\n<li>People have limited attention span budgets from which useful metadata can be solicited.  Tagging lowers the budget requirement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The reason why I have generated a ratio of 1 new tag for every 2 bookmarks is that I use tags in a way akin to free association, made possible by the low cost of tagging.  <ul>\n<li><strong>This is a feature, not a bug.</strong></li>\n<li>I have many, many tags used only once and never again—some of them are, in fact, jokes.  </li>\n<li>But, I have generated some tags that I&#39;ve come to adopt more heavily, most of which proved surprisingly useful over months or years of recurrence.</li>\n<li>As for those tags I&#39;ve never used again: They cost nothing, can be hidden below visibility thresholds, and can be merged later into more appropriate tags if I care to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And, there&#39;s where I run out of steam.  For the conclusion, go back to the beginning of this entry.  Biased though I might be, I think Delicious is the place to study tagging, and there they&#39;re of great use.  This is where I think <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> misses the value, despite the volume of writing and data.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086340\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086340\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-18T07:40:08\">2009-01-18T07:40:08</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>In addition Flickr's tagging implementation has always been non-optimal because there is a 1-to-1-to-1 relationship of object (photo) - tag - tagger.

So at least you are in agreement on this.</p>\n<p>But let's dig a bit further what is she saying and what you are saying. I have too tagged a lot of stuff with another service similar to del.icio.us. The result is that no, it is not useful to find something quickly, and I would even go further that I don't even find my own stuff. What I do though on a regular basis is to reduce my own stuff by changing the tags for a set a of pages for example if there are économie, economie, economy, business, I might finally reduce it to one tag \"économie\". What I would really wish is that I could do a hierarchy of these. For example sometimes I tag Japan and Tokyo, what I wish is that in my own hierarchy when I tag Tokyo, the system assumed Japan.</p>\n<p>On Flickr it really depends on what we are looking for, but I'm using flickr for finding images for specific location and for specific creative commons licenses. In both cases, these metadata depends on an ontology (taxonomy, structured schemas, $ORGANIZATIONSYSTEM)</p>\n<p>geolocation… the ontology is the map, a well defined system where you can pinpoint an image somewhere and get the real lat/long values. </p>\n<p>licenses… a controlled vocabulary of different type of licenses.</p>\n<p>The debate is not about \"do tags suck\" but do they work? And indeed they are not really efficient compared to other methods. It's cool they exist, but they should not be here to justify that ontology sucks either.

On Delicious, something akin to lightweight communities emerge based around bottom-up tags. </p>\n<p>I am no library scientist—but, if you've got a community with a collection to organize, I don't think you really need tags.

Meaning tags work as intended, at least for me on Delicious.  I suspect they work for others too, since they keep tagging things in ways that I keep finding them.</p>\n<p>You wrote about another service, but I didn't—I'm writing about tags on Delicious.  I don't know what the thing they call tags looks like on that other unnamed service.  </p>\n<p>This is part of the reason behind my mild disdain for the term \"folksonomy\":  Delicious didn't introduce tagging to start a best practice for Web 2.0 at large—tagging was introduced as a site feature for Delicious.  Attempts to clone that feature elsewhere have been uneven in results, despite having had a term coined and a body of hype spun around it.</p>\n<p>Tagging is like a salt water fish that lots of people thought was pretty and they started trying to stick in fresh water tanks.  I don't think it thrives everywhere people have tried to stick it and not everyone who's tried to clone tagging has gotten all the important parts right.</p>\n<p>On Flickr, I've asserted that tags aren't that useful.  Machine tags like geo tags are a big exception though.  Otherwise, they have a wealth of other tools for finding things beyond tags, whereas on Delicious they're the only game in town.</p>\n<p>I guess my main point is this:  In my experience, tags work.  On Delicious.  Where they're largely agreed to have been cloned from.  Elsewhere, I think there have been transcription errors and misinterpretations that give the concept a dubious reputation. </p>\n<p>I'm not sure what you mean about tags being not really efficient compared to other methods.  Tags are a way to get people to provide metadata useful in emergent classification that would otherwise have not been supplied at all.  I think they're efficient at that.</p>\n<p>Many people just punt when faced with sorting a new resource into a formal category or folder structure.

Note also the tags about themes, such as \"mean spirited\", which refers to an \"argument\" some people make. And, click a tag like \"bill richardson\" to see how I make some sense of large numbers of posts: many of the lists with a large number of posts are preceded by a summary linking to individual posts.</p>\n<p>(Note: that doesn't represent all the content at my site because I switched from MT to Drupal a couple months ago and only a fraction of thousands of posts is tagged. There are also a few hundred tags that aren't shown; I need to figure out how to show lots of tags.)</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "For the \"<a href=\"delicious.com/tag/tl;dr\">too long</a>; <a href=\"http://delicious.com/tag/tldr\">didn't read</a>\" crowd:\r\n\r\n* I've <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/deusx\">been using a lot of tags on Delicious</a> over a relatively long time, so they seem very useful to me.\r\n* Delicious encourages the use of tags through UI convention and tool usage patterns, whereas Flickr presents no particular bias toward collecting tags from users.\r\n* Since title and description attract more contribution effort from users on Flickr than on Delicious, it's natural that search over those fields will be more productive than for tags.\r\n* Search on Delicious doesn't have access to the complete text of the bookmarked resource, and often tags will contain information missing from the supplied title or description.\r\n* All told, tags on Delicious are more essential than tags on Flickr.\r\n* In conclusion, I think <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> misses the value of tags, as I know them, by focusing on Flickr.\r\n\r\nOf course, I don't really care what this means for folksonomy and the rest of Web 2.0—tags work for me on Delicious.  So, I suspect this means I'm not *entirely* opposed to the sentiment in <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a>, because I don't think tags work everywhere their use is attempted.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this entry elaborates on the above.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nFrom Cathy Marshall's <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a>:\r\n<blockquote>Have I convinced you that tags aren't all they've cracked up to be? I hope I have, but nonetheless there's a lingering fascination. Surely there's something to be done about tags: we don't want to just turn up our noses at Mr. Weinberger's argument.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFrom Mark Bernstein's <a href=\"http://www.markbernstein.org/Jan09/InTEKKATags.html\">In TEKKA: Tags</a>:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThe study could be repeated on more images, and in additional contexts. It might be bad luck. But if it’s a repeatable result — and I think we all know it is — then we’re going to have to rethink a lot of our Web 2.0 rhetoric. Folksonomy is an illusion.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFrom my <a href=\"http://delicious.com/url/125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd#item-125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd972759\">bookmark on Delicious</a>:\r\n<blockquote>If you can get past the rambling paragraphs of awkward fun-poking at tags interspersed with library science / web 2.0 / cultural references—as well as a discovery of what, you know, Flickr is all about—there's a well-embellished and obsessively-assembled statistical analysis of tags vs title vs notes in finding photos featuring tourist heel-spinning on the testicles of a bull mosaic in Milan. My impression is that she's missed the point of tags, but I'm having trouble reducing the impression to a critique.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt might be that I'm intimidated by the writing in <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> or by the fact that a lot of work was done to produce numbers I can't dispute.  Either way, I have neither the time to produce a counter-study nor the wherewithal to extract and refute points in that article with precision.  So, I'm just going to throw my impressions out there and hope they coalesce.\r\n\r\n* Tags are extremely useful to me.\r\n    * I've been using tags on Delicious since shortly after the site was created.  \r\n    * To date, <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/deusx\">I've saved 11825 bookmarks and spawned 6069 tags</a>.  (More on that ratio later.)  \r\n    * Tags have worked very well for me, both in later finding my own saved resources and in finding aggregates of others'.\r\n* Flickr is not the poster child of tagging—Delicious is.  \r\n    * On Flickr, I've found tags occasionally interesting, but not incredibly so.  More a curiosity than a killer feature, really.  (More on that in a bit, too.)\r\n    * To be honest, I've not found a great deal of use for tags around Web 2.0 properties beyond Delicious, folksonomy hype notwithstanding.  \r\n    * Fun fact: When I worked on Delicious, we disliked the term \"[folksonomy][]\" and tried never to use it in serious discussion.\r\n* The places where I've found tags useful are text-heavy, where the full text is either not indexed or not displayed in results when using search.\r\n    * Consider magazine articles or blog posts bookmarked on Delicious.\r\n    * Those bookmarks are subject to the character limits of title or description fields.  \r\n    * Far more often than on Flickr, there is information in tags not present in a bookmark's title or description.\r\n* On Delicious, the use of bookmarklets and extensions is the primary source of new bookmarks.  \r\n    * These tools tend to produce a title based on the original bookmarked page and, when present, a description summarized from the page contents by way of highlighted text.\r\n    * With this in mind, consider that tags often make up the **sole intentional contribution** made to the bookmark by the person saving it.  \r\n        * Beyond the choice to save the bookmark in the first place, that is.\r\n    * Whereas on Flickr, the effort is spent on title and, sometimes, the description.  Beyond that point, tags are an afterthought, at best.\r\n* The user interface of tagging is near effortless versus, say, formal taxonomies or nested folders.  \r\n    * Even the much-debated choice of the big, fat space bar as a delimiter supports minimal effort.\r\n    * Minimal effort lowers mental cost, which promotes more noise, but also encourages more input (or  any input) and thus more signal overall.\r\n    * People have limited attention span budgets from which useful metadata can be solicited.  Tagging lowers the budget requirement.\r\n* The reason why I have generated a ratio of 1 new tag for every 2 bookmarks is that I use tags in a way akin to free association, made possible by the low cost of tagging.  \r\n    * **This is a feature, not a bug.**\r\n    * I have many, many tags used only once and never again—some of them are, in fact, jokes.  \r\n    * But, I have generated some tags that I've come to adopt more heavily, most of which proved surprisingly useful over months or years of recurrence.\r\n    * As for those tags I've never used again: They cost nothing, can be hidden below visibility thresholds, and can be merged later into more appropriate tags if I care to do so.\r\n\r\nAnd, there's where I run out of steam.  For the conclusion, go back to the beginning of this entry.  Biased though I might be, I think Delicious is the place to study tagging, and there they're of great use.  This is where I think <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> misses the value, despite the volume of writing and data.\r\n\r\n[folksonomy]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086340\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086340\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-18T07:40:08\">2009-01-18T07:40:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>In addition Flickr's tagging implementation has always been non-optimal because there is a 1-to-1-to-1 relationship of object (photo) - tag - tagger.

So at least you are in agreement on this.</p>\n\n<p>But let's dig a bit further what is she saying and what you are saying. I have too tagged a lot of stuff with another service similar to del.icio.us. The result is that no, it is not useful to find something quickly, and I would even go further that I don't even find my own stuff. What I do though on a regular basis is to reduce my own stuff by changing the tags for a set a of pages for example if there are économie, economie, economy, business, I might finally reduce it to one tag \"économie\". What I would really wish is that I could do a hierarchy of these. For example sometimes I tag Japan and Tokyo, what I wish is that in my own hierarchy when I tag Tokyo, the system assumed Japan.</p>\n\n<p>On Flickr it really depends on what we are looking for, but I'm using flickr for finding images for specific location and for specific creative commons licenses. In both cases, these metadata depends on an ontology (taxonomy, structured schemas, $ORGANIZATIONSYSTEM)</p>\n\n<p>geolocation… the ontology is the map, a well defined system where you can pinpoint an image somewhere and get the real lat/long values. </p>\n\n<p>licenses… a controlled vocabulary of different type of licenses.</p>\n\n<p>The debate is not about \"do tags suck\" but do they work? And indeed they are not really efficient compared to other methods. It's cool they exist, but they should not be here to justify that ontology sucks either. Every community which is in a need of achieving a specific repetitive task comes one day or the other to structured data organization.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086344\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.ethanhein.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4c0a6f9419c7bce70e889b6115e9bb77&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.ethanhein.com\">Ethan</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086344\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-19T02:33:33\">2009-01-19T02:33:33</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Very often, the suggested tags on a new Delicious post inspire my personal informational ontology.

And if they would work for Delicious, someone somewhere is probably emulating them with specially-formed tags to varying degrees of success. Eventually we might have discovered those uses and wrapped a feature around them. (see also: for:* and system:media:*)</p>\n\n<p>Actually, one area where I think Flickr has done better with tagging is in machine tags.

I find tags on Delicious just as useful for finding <em>others'</em> bookmarks, too.</p>\n\n<p>I assume that many others use tags much like I do—especially the people bookmarking things I find interesting.  On Delicious, something akin to lightweight communities emerge based around bottom-up tags. </p>\n\n<p>I am no library scientist—but, if you've got a community with a collection to organize, I don't think you really need tags.  That community probably already has a notion of categories worth extracting in a more formal top-down process.  </p>\n\n<p>As for repeating the study, I probably won't be the person to do it.  But, for a quick example that I'd suggest is par for the course, take a look at <a href=\"http://delicious.com/url/125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd\" rel=\"nofollow\">the bookmarks for the article in question</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Of the 18 bookmarks, 10 have notes. That page only shows the most common title, but I'd be surprised if any of the 18 have a title other than \"Do Tags Work?\"  That leaves the tags.  Of the top 10 tags, only one appears in the title (\"tags\").  The word \"folksonomy\" appears in none of the descriptions.  There's also \"socialsoftware\" used 3 times, which appears neither in title or description, nor in the original article itself.  I think this shows better use of tags than the example used from Flickr.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086348\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086348\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-19T03:12:10\">2009-01-19T03:12:10</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@karl: I wrote that tags are useful for finding both mine <em>and</em> others' bookmarks.  Meaning tags work as intended, at least for me on Delicious.  I suspect they work for others too, since they keep tagging things in ways that I keep finding them.</p>\n\n<p>You wrote about another service, but I didn't—I'm writing about tags on Delicious.  I don't know what the thing they call tags looks like on that other unnamed service.  </p>\n\n<p>This is part of the reason behind my mild disdain for the term \"folksonomy\":  Delicious didn't introduce tagging to start a best practice for Web 2.0 at large—tagging was introduced as a site feature for Delicious.  Attempts to clone that feature elsewhere have been uneven in results, despite having had a term coined and a body of hype spun around it.</p>\n\n<p>Tagging is like a salt water fish that lots of people thought was pretty and they started trying to stick in fresh water tanks.  I don't think it thrives everywhere people have tried to stick it and not everyone who's tried to clone tagging has gotten all the important parts right.</p>\n\n<p>On Flickr, I've asserted that tags aren't that useful.  Machine tags like geo tags are a big exception though.  Otherwise, they have a wealth of other tools for finding things beyond tags, whereas on Delicious they're the only game in town.</p>\n\n<p>I guess my main point is this:  In my experience, tags work.  On Delicious.  Where they're largely agreed to have been cloned from.  Elsewhere, I think there have been transcription errors and misinterpretations that give the concept a dubious reputation. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what you mean about tags being not really efficient compared to other methods.  Tags are a way to get people to provide metadata useful in emergent classification that would otherwise have not been supplied at all.  I think they're efficient at that.</p>\n\n<p>Many people just punt when faced with sorting a new resource into a formal category or folder structure.  I suppose that filters out all but the conscientious, leaving better quality results.

Like we always tell people, there's no wrong way to tag, and that makes it really really hard to generalize accurately about What Tags Mean.</p>\n\n<p>I tend to use Delicious tags to associate a bookmark with a thread of my thinking (which is very useful), and I use a combination of search and tags to find things. But on Flickr, I like looking through tagged photos, and I like looking through groups even more. I search to find old photos, often finding a picture because of the tags on the photo. Both Flickr and Delicious work very well for me.</p>\n\n<p>Tags are interface; the \"meaning\" of each tag is de-emphasized. Compared to hierarchical structures, they're easier, messier, more-used, more fun. They're flexible - they're personal.</p>\n\n<p>Tags on Delicious are collective; tags on Flickr are collective (except when you tag another person's photos); folksonomy implies collaborative.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086352\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://delicious.com/britta\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=57aab4d4b63173e994095032a52d78e6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://delicious.com/britta\">Britta</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086352\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-19T06:39:57\">2009-01-19T06:39:57</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>P.S.

I don't think this really invalidates his point, though: tags are the place for (most) people to put their mark on a link. Us description-editors are odd.</p>\n\n<p>(Annoyingly, I can't find a link that shows that well. There's <a href=\"http://delicious.com/blech/tagging\" rel=\"nofollow\">my bookmarks tagged 'tagging'</a>, I suppose. I've only just noticed this has related tags- that's a nice touch I'd never really spotted.)</p>\n\n<p>On a side note, I love machine tags in Flickr, mainly because they're hidden from the user by default. (They've got a lot more useful now that there are specialised methods in the API, too.) I mused on Twitter last week that neither Delicious nor a third party has done anything with the loose convention of via: or cite: tags that some people use.

You can emulate categories using tags, but you'll be going against the grain.</p>\n\n<p>Tags are about throwing things at the wall and letting analysis and algorithms help surface implicit structures or relations.</p>\n\n<p>And, yes, the semantic issue of \"chinese\" the language vs \"chinese\" the food vs \"chinese\" the people is a long standing one.  Single tags don't solve this and tagging in general kind of shrugs on the issue—though tag intersections involving many tags help disambiguate intended meaning.

For instance, I wouldn't tag this with \"tags\" but instead with \"tagging debate\", \"tagging meta\", or similar. That would allow a visitor to this site to find every similar discussion. The \"tags\" tag might include a lot of things that someone wasn't looking for, such as a comparison of tagging services.</p>\n\n<p>This could also be tagged with the name of the person who wrote the link so the visitors could find discussions involving that person.</p>\n\n<p>For how I do things, my tag cloud is at my name's link.</p>\n\n<p>Note the tags with [name topic], such as \"obama cabinet\". Anyone who sees that should realize right away what it involves. And, someone looking for specific Obama information can scan the tags starting with his name for subtopics. Note also the tags about themes, such as \"mean spirited\", which refers to an \"argument\" some people make. And, click a tag like \"bill richardson\" to see how I make some sense of large numbers of posts: many of the lists with a large number of posts are preceded by a summary linking to individual posts.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: that doesn't represent all the content at my site because I switched from MT to Drupal a couple months ago and only a fraction of thousands of posts is tagged. There are also a few hundred tags that aren't shown; I need to figure out how to show lots of tags.)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

And the Mozilla community acts a lot like an ecosystem, which can be visualized <a href=\"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2008/07/29/the-mozilla-tree/\">as a kind of living tree</a>—not to confused with the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/mozilla-central\">mozilla-central tree</a>.  Oh yeah, and Mozilla is the name of <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/reorganization/\">both a Foundation and a Corporation</a>.</p>\n<p>Confused yet?  If not, then we should talk so you can explain it to me, because it all looks pretty tangly and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity\">intertwingled</a> to me.  Nonetheless, it seems to work, and produces a good chunk of my favorite software and technologies.</p>\n<p>There are many efforts to track what&#39;s going on—including <a href=\"http://planet.mozilla.org/\">planets</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/about_mozilla/\">newsletters</a> and <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/\">bugzillas</a> and <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/WeeklyUpdates/2009-01-05\">wikis</a> and <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/\">repositories</a> and <a href=\"http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=Firefox\">tinderboxen</a>.  Some of these resources report on, or are driven by, the activity occurring in the others.  Some are automated, and others are carefully stitched together by hand.  None offer a full picture of what&#39;s going on in the <a href=\"http://ascher.ca/blog/2008/06/19/whats-mozillas-scope-what-should-it-be/\">Mozilla galaxy</a> in a way that&#39;s casually comprehensible by a sane human being.</p>\n<p>Of course, that&#39;s not a slight against any of these sites or the people maintaining them—extracting an overview from such an organic phenomenon is neither easy nor straightforward.

    "body": "[caption id=\"attachment_1582\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"247\" caption=\"The Mozilla Tree\"]<a href=\"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2008/07/29/the-mozilla-tree/\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/moz-tree.jpg\" alt=\"The Mozilla Tree\" title=\"moz-tree\" width=\"247\" height=\"191\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1582\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nBehind Firefox is Mozilla, and behind Mozilla is a community.  And the Mozilla community acts a lot like an ecosystem, which can be visualized [as a kind of living tree][tree]—not to confused with the [mozilla-central tree][mctree].  Oh yeah, and Mozilla is the name of [both a Foundation and a Corporation][mocofo].\r\n\r\nConfused yet?  If not, then we should talk so you can explain it to me, because it all looks pretty tangly and [intertwingled][inter] to me.  Nonetheless, it seems to work, and produces a good chunk of my favorite software and technologies.\r\n\r\nThere are many efforts to track what's going on—including [planets][planet] and [newsletters][about] and [bugzillas][bugzilla] and [wikis][wikis] and [repositories][repos] and [tinderboxen][tinderbox].  Some of these resources report on, or are driven by, the activity occurring in the others.  Some are automated, and others are carefully stitched together by hand.  None offer a full picture of what's going on in the [Mozilla galaxy][galaxy] in a way that's casually comprehensible by a sane human being.\r\n\r\nOf course, that's not a slight against any of these sites or the people maintaining them—extracting an overview from such an organic phenomenon is neither easy nor straightforward.  But, it might be fun to try.\r\n\r\nAs an infovore and avid practitioner of [continuous partial attention][firehose], my first impulse is to reach for a firehose and stick my head into the stream.  Relax, defocus, and try to let my pattern recognizers do their thing—sometimes those pattern recognizers are in my head, and [sometimes they're written in Python][popularlinks].\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1585\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"225\" caption=\"Firefox Victory!\"]<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/intothefuzz/2571283860/in/set-72157605179678562/\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/robo-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Firefox Victory Robot\" title=\"firefox-victory\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1585\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nBut, for Mozilla, I couldn't find a stream of sufficient volume or completeness to satisfy me or [my robots][myrobots].  Happily, though, my feeding urge found itself aligned with a project to discover the patterns of contribution in the Mozilla community and to find a way to thank the contributors responsible.\r\n\r\nSo, while we're still working on the thank-you angle, allow me to introduce you to [the Lizardfeeder][lizardfeeder].  The [LizardFeeder][lizardfeeder] is a feed aggregator, [whose source code][lizardcode] is built atop [Sam Ruby's Planet Venus][venus]. The [LizardFeeder][lizardfeeder] pulls together and archives activity streams from a wide variety of Mozilla community sources.  Beyond the usual human-readable pages produced by a [blog-gathering Planet][planet], the [LizardFeeder][lizardfeeder] accumulates [statistical and historical data][jsondata] meant for consumption and analysis by robots.\r\n\r\nAt present, the only robot navigating the [LizardFeeder][lizardfeeder] archives is an AJAX-ified user interface that animates the firehose as a near real-time or time-lapsed stream of events scrolling by.  \r\n\r\nThis is just meant as a conversation starter, though.  I'm hoping to [gather feedback and find more sources][requests], as well as to entice creative community members to come up with more sophisticated visualizations of this data.  \r\n\r\nSo, take a look, [check it out][lizardfeeder], and let me know what you think!\r\n\r\n[myrobots]: http://www.digitpress.com/dpsoundz/destroyhimrobots.wav\r\n[inter]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity\r\n[mocofo]: http://www.mozilla.org/reorganization/\r\n[mctree]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/mozilla-central\r\n[galaxy]: http://ascher.ca/blog/2008/06/19/whats-mozillas-scope-what-should-it-be/\r\n[popularlinks]: http://decafbad.com/hgwebdir.cgi/hacking_rss_and_atom/file/f7a85b9fd48a/ch15_popular_links.py\r\n[jsondata]: http://feeds.mozilla.com/archives/index.json\r\n[lizardcode]: https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/lizardfeeder/trunk/\r\n[venus]: http://www.intertwingly.net/code/venus/\r\n[lizardfeeder]: http://feeds.mozilla.com/\r\n[firehose]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/23/the-zen-of-firehose-drinking\r\n[tinderbox]: http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=Firefox\r\n[repos]: http://hg.mozilla.org/\r\n[wikis]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/WeeklyUpdates/2009-01-05\r\n[bugzilla]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/\r\n[planet]: http://planet.mozilla.org/\r\n[about]: http://blog.mozilla.com/about_mozilla/\r\n[tree]: http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2008/07/29/the-mozilla-tree/\r\n[requests]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=469838\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083355\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb4ef8f72f933b04a27b118070ac538e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">dria</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083355\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-06T01:26:18\">2009-01-06T01:26:18</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Is there a list of what sources are already being read by the LizardFeeder anywhere?

    "html": "<p>A funny thing happened on the way to building <a href=\"http://svn.mozilla.org/projects/lizardfeeder/trunk/\">a delayed real-time feed display</a>:  I got temporarily obsessed with implementing <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/jquery-tal-template/tree/master\">a template language in JavaScript</a> that, as it turned out later, I didn&#39;t need.  About <a href=\"http://svn.mozilla.org/projects/lizardfeeder/trunk/\">the feed project itself</a>, I hope to write more soon—but for now I want to get this extra template language thing out of my system and see if anyone else might have a use for it.</p>\n<p>See, I had a notion it would be keen if I had access to the same template language on the client as on the server.  I needed to render a number of list items statically on the server with feed entries, then update that list with new entries on the client as they became available through JSON feed polling.  It&#39;d be a pain in the butt to maintain two separate list item templates for client and server, so I reached for a shared template language.</p>\n<p>Never mind that I&#39;d just gotten done writing <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470452021?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;c%0D%0Areative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470452021\">a small book on Dojo</a>, and was already aware of the existence of the <a href=\"http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/src/dojox/trunk/dtl/README\">DojoX Django Template Language</a>.  This might&#39;ve worked, since the server end of things was written in Python (though not with Django).  That the JavaScript side already used <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a> wasn&#39;t <em>too</em> tall a hurdle.  Also, I&#39;m sure there are a handful of other JavaScript/Python template language match-ups to be found.</p>\n<p>But, let&#39;s be honest here:  I&#39;ve always been a fan of Zope&#39;s <a href=\"http://wiki.zope.org/ZPT/TALSpecification14\">Template Attribute Language</a> for their <a href=\"http://wiki.zope.org/ZPT/FrontPage\">Page Templates</a>, and have long wondered how hard it would be to implement.  The concept seems so much cleaner to me than most string-formatting template languages, and the workflow from mockup-to-template and back again has always been appealing to me when it works.  So, when my first few experimental steps in trying my hand at it actually started working, I couldn&#39;t stop coding.  </p>\n<p>And now, <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/jquery-tal-template/tree/master/jquery.taltemplate.js\">the thing</a> is mostly done.  It has no tests, has features left undone, and probably yields plenty of bugs—but I finished it enough to use it practically, and that was long enough to convince me it wasn&#39;t the right tool for the job.  </p>\n<p>Still, though, I can&#39;t help thinking it might be the right tool for <em>some</em> job.

    "body": "A funny thing happened on the way to building [a delayed real-time feed display][lizardfeeder]:  I got temporarily obsessed with implementing [a template language in JavaScript][jqtal] that, as it turned out later, I didn't need.  About [the feed project itself][lizardfeeder], I hope to write more soon—but for now I want to get this extra template language thing out of my system and see if anyone else might have a use for it.\r\n\r\nSee, I had a notion it would be keen if I had access to the same template language on the client as on the server.  I needed to render a number of list items statically on the server with feed entries, then update that list with new entries on the client as they became available through JSON feed polling.  It'd be a pain in the butt to maintain two separate list item templates for client and server, so I reached for a shared template language.\r\n\r\nNever mind that I'd just gotten done writing [a small book on Dojo][book], and was already aware of the existence of the [DojoX Django Template Language][djt].  This might've worked, since the server end of things was written in Python (though not with Django).  That the JavaScript side already used [jQuery][] wasn't *too* tall a hurdle.  Also, I'm sure there are a handful of other JavaScript/Python template language match-ups to be found.\r\n\r\nBut, let's be honest here:  I've always been a fan of Zope's [Template Attribute Language][tal] for their [Page Templates][pt], and have long wondered how hard it would be to implement.  The concept seems so much cleaner to me than most string-formatting template languages, and the workflow from mockup-to-template and back again has always been appealing to me when it works.  So, when my first few experimental steps in trying my hand at it actually started working, I couldn't stop coding.  \r\n\r\nAnd now, [the thing][thing] is mostly done.  It has no tests, has features left undone, and probably yields plenty of bugs—but I finished it enough to use it practically, and that was long enough to convince me it wasn't the right tool for the job.  \r\n\r\nStill, though, I can't help thinking it might be the right tool for *some* job.  That could be because I spent a lot of time on it, or that I'm unreasonably fond of [TAL][tal], but it still feels like a decent little plugin to have on hand.  Maybe someone reading this will have a similar conclusion.\r\n\r\nOh and by the way, plain [jQuery][] turned out to be a better tool for [the job in question][lizardfeeder].  This seems to nicely balance the duplicate effort between server and client, demanding only that I stick with semantically significant CSS class names in the server template—something I should be doing anyway:\r\n\r\n            // Clone and populate a new entry.\r\n            var new_item = $('#feed-items .entry:last')\r\n                .clone()\r\n                .attr('class', entry_classes.join(' ')) \r\n                .find('.group span')\r\n                    .text(tags['group'])\r\n                .end()\r\n                .find('.title')\r\n                    .find('.favicon')\r\n                        .attr('src', favicon)\r\n                    .end()\r\n                    .find('.link')\r\n                        .attr('href', entry.link)\r\n                        .text(entry.title)\r\n                    .end()\r\n                .end()\r\n                .find('.updated')\r\n                    .find('.timeago')\r\n                        .attr('title', entry.updated)\r\n                        .text(entry_updated.strftime('%+'))\r\n                        .timeago()\r\n                    .end()\r\n                    .find('.time')\r\n                        .text(entry_updated.strftime('%I:%M %p'))\r\n                    .end()\r\n                .end()\r\n                .find('.author')\r\n                    .text(entry.author || 'n/a')\r\n                .end()\r\n                .prependTo('#feed-items')\r\n                .hide();\r\n\r\nOf course, *plain* is a relative term here.\r\n\r\n[jquery]: http://jquery.com/\r\n[tal]: http://wiki.zope.org/ZPT/TALSpecification14\r\n[pt]: http://wiki.zope.org/ZPT/FrontPage\r\n[book]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470452021?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&c%0D%0Areative=9325&creativeASIN=0470452021\r\n[djt]: http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/src/dojox/trunk/dtl/README\r\n[jqtal]: http://github.com/lmorchard/jquery-tal-template/tree/master\r\n[lizardfeeder]: http://svn.mozilla.org/projects/lizardfeeder/trunk/\r\n[thing]: http://github.com/lmorchard/jquery-tal-template/tree/master/jquery.taltemplate.js\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083366\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3f398029eea744ce9ba9147aab627557&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">brad clements</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083366\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-11-03T21:26:42\">2008-11-03T21:26:42</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Groan,</p>\n\n<p>Too bad I haven't had a chance to finish documenting (and tweaking) the ATALi project.</p>\n\n<p>It's a collection of Alternative TAL Implementations.</p>\n\n<p>It currently has TAL for xslt (server side using libxslt directly or via lxml with metal support)</p>\n\n<p>and TAL for javascript (no libraries needed, though it does recognize mochikit iterators, no metal)</p>\n\n<p>https://launchpad.net/atali</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083367\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.jm3.net/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/jm3.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.jm3.net/\">John Manoogian III (jm3)</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083367\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-11-24T18:51:17\">2008-11-24T18:51:17</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Have you seen \"trimpath\"?</p>\n\n<p>http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/JavaScriptTemplates</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

    "html": "<p>From Mark Bernstein&#39;s entry on <a href=\"http://www.markbernstein.org/Oct0801/PracticalPrototypeandscrip.html\">Practical Prototype and script.aculo.us</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When chemists consult a volume about professional chemical technique, or when surgeons reach for the latest update on neuroanatomy, they can usually find a book that isn&#39;t couched in terms of silly examples and jokes. So can poets, mathematicians, and geologists. For some reason, though, it has become the accepted practice that language manuals should spend lots of time with silly, self-deprecating jokes, and that their example applications should be breakfast loggers and fantasy football leagues (or, conversely, payroll programs).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As an tech author with just a few books under my belt, Mark&#39;s take on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590599195?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1590599195\">Practical Prototype and script.aculo.us</a> struck a bit of a sour note for me, because I&#39;d like to work on making my tech writing more entertaining than not.  I think that&#39;s a good thing, but I&#39;m willing to be convinced otherwise.</p>\n<p>I think the issue is that there are different meanings for &quot;professional&quot; when it comes to the web.  There are web scientists and there are web masons.  Web scientists pursue fundamentals and disambiguations, while web masons are busy building the next micro-site for the new product release from the almighty client.  Many web scientists are also computer scientists and many web masons are also web scientists—but most web masons I&#39;ve known come from creative liberal or fine arts backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Though, for what it&#39;s worth, even amongst computer scientists there&#39;s still a tradition of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1225292376&amp;sr=8-1\">leaving room for jelly stains</a> and other oddities.  This seems to be the sort of thing Mark acknowledges with dismay.  (&quot;It’s not fair to blame Mr. DuPont for the general vice.&quot;)</p>\n<p>Is playfulness in literature just a computer science thing?  I&#39;m not a chemist; maybe chemists just  don&#39;t like being funny in writing, or maybe their jokes are more subtle.</p>\n<p>In any case, I think the &quot;practical&quot; genre of tech books is aimed at people who want to get something done, aren&#39;t interested in or have little time for context or background, yet wouldn&#39;t mind being entertained during the course of weekend tinkering and self-education.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, a good book. But take out the jokes, trim back the sample code (or dispatch it to the Web site where it makes more sense), and give us to professional perspective, and everyone is going to be much happier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The guidelines with which I&#39;m familiar for tech books in the &quot;practical&quot; or similar genres include advice such as &quot;show, don&#39;t tell&quot;.  They also suggest that, although sample code should be made available online, the author should compose the book assuming that it&#39;s a standalone product.  Web sites and CDROMs with code often vanish, but a bound book remains stable—which is especially useful on a cross-country flight without net access.  Professional perspective is of course a desirable thing to work into the prose, but job #1 is to illustrate the right way to do things through running code.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How does Prototype+Javascript relate to other languages — C++/STL, say, or SELF? What, precisely, are the semantics of the key methods? I don&#39;t need the inevitable chapter 1 pitch for the wonderfulness of Javascript and the badness of MSIE, but it might be a good place for a quick summary for the pros. Call by reference • no pointers • primitives are objects • everything has a prototype slot • parens() do this, braces {} do that, brackets [] do something else • single and double quotes are different. Kernighan &amp; Ritchie did this so well in C, and it’s not like we’re not familiar with their example.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;d posit that most in the audience for &quot;practical&quot; tech books are entirely unfamiliar with Kernigan &amp; Ritchie and haven&#39;t touched a line of C source code.  Most of these readers have probably tumbled down the slope from HTML to CSS and finally to JavaScript in order to get something interesting to happen in a browser—and usually while under an unreasonable deadline.</p>\n<p>I&#39;d really be surprised if many readers have heard of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_programming_language\">Self</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library\">C++/STL</a> or have much of a grounding at all in computer science or programming language fundamentals.  Having these fundamentals would of course help web masons get a deeper understanding of the technologies that make the job possible, but the pragmatic rewards tend not to make up for the effort involved.</p>\n<p>So, to sum up, the purpose for this entry isn&#39;t to beat up on Mark Bernstein.  He&#39;s written a great deal of prose and code that I respect, so his opinion is interesting to me.  Rather, I&#39;ve tried to express my own understanding of this writing market, and hoping I&#39;ve aimed at the right goals.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086683\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.markbernstein.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cdb20bf8e09680028612532944833686&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.markbernstein.org/\">Mark Bernstein</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086683\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-10-29T16:51:59\">2008-10-29T16:51:59</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I'd settle for a better class of joke!</p>\n<p>On tech content, doesn't it annoy <em>you</em> that it's hard (or impossible) to find a book about a Web framework or language or facility that takes advantage of what you already know?

    "body": "From Mark Bernstein's entry on [Practical Prototype and script.aculo.us](http://www.markbernstein.org/Oct0801/PracticalPrototypeandscrip.html):\r\n> When chemists consult a volume about professional chemical technique, or when surgeons reach for the latest update on neuroanatomy, they can usually find a book that isn't couched in terms of silly examples and jokes. So can poets, mathematicians, and geologists. For some reason, though, it has become the accepted practice that language manuals should spend lots of time with silly, self-deprecating jokes, and that their example applications should be breakfast loggers and fantasy football leagues (or, conversely, payroll programs).\r\n\r\nAs an tech author with just a few books under my belt, Mark's take on [Practical Prototype and script.aculo.us](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590599195?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1590599195) struck a bit of a sour note for me, because I'd like to work on making my tech writing more entertaining than not.  I think that's a good thing, but I'm willing to be convinced otherwise.\r\n\r\nI think the issue is that there are different meanings for \"professional\" when it comes to the web.  There are web scientists and there are web masons.  Web scientists pursue fundamentals and disambiguations, while web masons are busy building the next micro-site for the new product release from the almighty client.  Many web scientists are also computer scientists and many web masons are also web scientists—but most web masons I've known come from creative liberal or fine arts backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThough, for what it's worth, even amongst computer scientists there's still a tradition of [leaving room for jelly stains](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1225292376&sr=8-1) and other oddities.  This seems to be the sort of thing Mark acknowledges with dismay.  (\"It’s not fair to blame Mr. DuPont for the general vice.\")\r\n\r\nIs playfulness in literature just a computer science thing?  I'm not a chemist; maybe chemists just  don't like being funny in writing, or maybe their jokes are more subtle.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think the \"practical\" genre of tech books is aimed at people who want to get something done, aren't interested in or have little time for context or background, yet wouldn't mind being entertained during the course of weekend tinkering and self-education.\r\n\r\n> So, a good book. But take out the jokes, trim back the sample code (or dispatch it to the Web site where it makes more sense), and give us to professional perspective, and everyone is going to be much happier.\r\n\r\nThe guidelines with which I'm familiar for tech books in the \"practical\" or similar genres include advice such as \"show, don't tell\".  They also suggest that, although sample code should be made available online, the author should compose the book assuming that it's a standalone product.  Web sites and CDROMs with code often vanish, but a bound book remains stable—which is especially useful on a cross-country flight without net access.  Professional perspective is of course a desirable thing to work into the prose, but job #1 is to illustrate the right way to do things through running code.\r\n\r\n> How does Prototype+Javascript relate to other languages — C++/STL, say, or SELF? What, precisely, are the semantics of the key methods? I don't need the inevitable chapter 1 pitch for the wonderfulness of Javascript and the badness of MSIE, but it might be a good place for a quick summary for the pros. Call by reference • no pointers • primitives are objects • everything has a prototype slot • parens() do this, braces {} do that, brackets [] do something else • single and double quotes are different. Kernighan & Ritchie did this so well in C, and it’s not like we’re not familiar with their example.\r\n\r\nI'd posit that most in the audience for \"practical\" tech books are entirely unfamiliar with Kernigan & Ritchie and haven't touched a line of C source code.  Most of these readers have probably tumbled down the slope from HTML to CSS and finally to JavaScript in order to get something interesting to happen in a browser—and usually while under an unreasonable deadline.\r\n\r\nI'd really be surprised if many readers have heard of [Self](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_programming_language) or [C++/STL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library) or have much of a grounding at all in computer science or programming language fundamentals.  Having these fundamentals would of course help web masons get a deeper understanding of the technologies that make the job possible, but the pragmatic rewards tend not to make up for the effort involved.\r\n\r\nSo, to sum up, the purpose for this entry isn't to beat up on Mark Bernstein.  He's written a great deal of prose and code that I respect, so his opinion is interesting to me.  Rather, I've tried to express my own understanding of this writing market, and hoping I've aimed at the right goals.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086683\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.markbernstein.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cdb20bf8e09680028612532944833686&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.markbernstein.org/\">Mark Bernstein</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086683\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-10-29T16:51:59\">2008-10-29T16:51:59</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I'd settle for a better class of joke!</p>\n\n<p>On tech content, doesn't it annoy <em>you</em> that it's hard (or impossible) to find a book about a Web framework or language or facility that takes advantage of what you already know?

    "html": "<p>In my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/08/31/ubiquity-cracks-open-personal-mashup-tinkering\" title=\"Ubiquity cracks open personal mashup tinkering\">last post</a>, I got all fluffy about how cool <a href=\"http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/\">Ubiquity</a> is but didn&#39;t share any code to prove the point.  As it happens, I have come up with at least one useful command that I&#39;m starting to use habitually in posting bookmarks to Delicious.  You can <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/UbiquityCommands/\">subscribe to my command</a> or <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/hg/UbiquityCommands/file/tip/delicious.ubiq.js\">check out the full source</a>—this post will serve as a dissection of the thing.  Since this will be fairly lengthy, follow along after the jump.</p>\n<p>Oh, and it&#39;s been awhile since I posted something this in-depth around here, so feel free to let me know how this first draft works.  And, bug reports and patches are of course welcome.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>To begin, consider the following code starting off the command source code:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\n/**\n * share-on-delicious - an Ubiquity command for sharing bookmarks on\n * delicious.com\n *\n * l.m.orchard@pobox.com\n * http://decafbad.com/\n * Share and Enjoy!\n */\nvar uext = Application.extensions.get('ubiquity@labs.mozilla.com');\n\nvar cookie_mgr = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/cookiemanager;1\"]\n    .getService(Components.interfaces.nsICookieManager);\n</pre>\n\n<p>The first thing to note here is that a short header comment introduces the command.  This isn&#39;t required, but it&#39;s a good idea.  It&#39;s also something you can&#39;t really do with bookmarklets.  On the other hand, Greasemonkey user scripts expect metadata about the script to be provided here, but Ubiquity doesn&#39;t use this convention.</p>\n<p>Second, notice that the code accesses some chrome-level resources.  Again, this is something unavailable to bookmarklets and Greasemonkey user scripts.  Just take a look at the <a href=\"http://developer.mozilla.org/en/FUEL\">FUEL library documentation</a> to get a quick sense of what&#39;s available using that simplified API, not to mention what&#39;s available using the lower-level browser APIs.</p>\n<p>Now, check out this next chunk of code, which begins the construction of an Ubiquity command:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"13\">\nCmdUtils.CreateCommand({\n\n    name:        \n        'share-on-delicious',\n    icon:\n        'http://delicious.com/favicon.ico',\n    description: \n        'Share the current page as a bookmark on delicious.com',\n    help:        \n        'Select text on the page to use as notes, or enter your own ' + \n        'text after the command word.  You can also assign tags to the '+ \n        'bookmark with the \"tagged\" modifier, and alter the bookmark ' + \n        'default page title with the \"entitled\" modifier.  Note that ' + \n        'you must also already be logged in at delicious.com to use ' +\n        'this command.',\n\n    homepage:   \n        'http://decafbad.com',\n    author: { \n        name: 'Leslie Michael Orchard', \n        email: 'l.m.orchard@pobox.com' \n    },\n    license:\n        'MPL/GPL/LGPL',\n</pre>\n\n<p>Whereas Greasemonkey scripts support metadata in the header comment, the Ubiquity command script API works a little differently.  </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hg.toolness.com/ubiquity-firefox/file/tip/ubiquity/chrome/content/cmdutils.js\"><code>CmdUtils</code> module</a> provided by Ubiquity offers a <code>CreateCommand</code> function, which expects an object as a parameter.  The object literal whose construction is begun in the code above serves as a self-contained package for the command, bearing metadata describing the command as well as containing all the code necessary to implement it.</p>\n<p>So, in the above code block, you can see the machine-readable description of the command—including a command name, display icon, home page URL, author information, and license.  The command name (<code>share-on-delicious</code>) will be used by the Ubiquity command parser, but the rest of the description will also be used in the list of commands available to the user, invoked by the <code>command-list</code> command, like so:</p>\n<img src=\"/2008/ubiq-share-on-delicious-list.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333; margin: 0.25em; padding: 0.25em\" />\n\n<p>Moving along, this next chunk of code introduces the first functional bits of the command:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"37\">\n    takes: { notes: noun_arb_text },\n    modifiers: { \n        tagged:  noun_arb_text,\n        entitled: noun_arb_text\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>Like smart keyword shortcut bookmarks, Ubiquity commands accept user-supplied input.  But, what&#39;s unique to Ubiquity is that it employs a parser whose goal is to support something approximating natural language.  At present, this results in commands that support a single primary argument—declared above with the <code>takes</code> property—and any number of additional keyword modifiers—declared above by the <code>modifiers</code> property.</p>\n<p>For the command under construction here, this establishes a pattern something like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>share-on-delicious {notes} [tagged {tags} entitled {title}]</code></pre>\n<p>Content for the <code>{notes}</code> argument can either be typed directly by hand, or it can be supplied by text highlighted on the page.  To use highlighted text, you can either issue the command alone, or use the word <code>this</code> for the <code>{notes}</code> argument before including further modifiers.</p>\n<p>The modifiers <code>tagged</code> and <code>entitled</code> are optional, and can be used in any order.  Each of these keywords signifies the start of a different argument—which unfortunately can collide with the literal data supplied for notes, which will hopefully be a rare occurrence.</p>\n<p>All of this adds up command invocations including the following:</p>\n<pre><code>share-on-delicious\nshare-on-delicious I really like this page tagged nifty amusing\nshare-on-delicious this entitled This bookmark has no tags\nsh this tagged osx software apple entitled This is good OS X software</code></pre>\n<p>That last example is important—since I have no other commands starting with &quot;<code>sh</code>&quot;, I can abbreviate the full command.  Ubiquity only requires enough of a command name to disambiguate it within your collection of commands.</p>\n<p>Another thing to note is the use of the constant value <code>noun_arb_text</code>, which declares that these arguments should expect any arbitrary text as input.  </p>\n<p>This facility is not exploited for the present command, but Ubiquity defines <a href=\"http://hg.toolness.com/ubiquity-firefox/file/tip/ubiquity/chrome/content/nlparser/en/nountypes.js\">noun types</a>.  These include concepts such as plain text, dates, address book contacts, browser tabs, bookmark tags, and more.  You can define your own noun types, as well as implement suggestion schemes that help guide the user toward constructing useful input values in the command interface.  You can <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1_Author_Tutorial#Introduction_to_Noun_Types\">read more about this</a> in the official author tutorial.</p>\n<p>Next up is a quick bit of command-specific configuration:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"42\">\n    /**\n     * Command configuration settings.\n     */\n    _config: {\n        // Base URL for the delicious v1 API\n        api_base:      'https://api.del.icio.us',\n\n        // Domain and name of the delicious login session cookie.\n        cookie_domain: '.delicious.com',\n        cookie_name:   '_user'\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>Since this command will be posting to Delicious via the V1 API, it&#39;s handy to declare the base URL for the API in an easily changed spot.  That way, you could change this value later on to point the command at another implementation of the API.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this command will employ a little-known authentication trick supported by the Delicious API that accepts the user&#39;s login cookie set by the Delicious website—this &quot;cookie god&quot; auth is used by the official Delicious addon for Firefox.  It&#39;s handy for piggybacking on the website login and removing the need to ask the user for their username and password again and possibly storing it in an insecure manner.</p>\n<p>In fact, this next chunk of code defines a utility method to rummage through the cookie jar:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"53\">\n    /**\n     * Dig up the Delicious login session cookie.\n     */\n    _getUserCookie: function() {\n        var iter = cookie_mgr.enumerator;\n        while (iter.hasMoreElements()) {\n            var cookie = iter.getNext();\n            if( cookie instanceof Components.interfaces.nsICookie && \n                cookie.host.indexOf(this._config.cookie_domain) != -1 && \n                cookie.name == this._config.cookie_name) {\n                return decodeURIComponent(cookie.value);\n            }\n        }\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>The method defined above, <code>._getUserCookie()</code>, uses the browser&#39;s cookie manager and the values defined in the previous configuration section to find the login session cookie set for Delicious.  Take note that this is far beyond the allowed capabilities of bookmarklets and Greasemoney user scripts—this is digging straight into the browser itself, skipping past the usual content-space security restrictions.  </p>\n<p>In other words: In Ubiquity, <em>the gun is loaded</em> and you should be careful.  </p>\n<p>Moving along, consider this next utility method:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"67\">\n    /**\n     * Given input data and modifiers, attempt to assemble data necessary to\n     * post a bookmark.\n     */\n    _extractBookmarkData: function(input_obj, mods) {\n        return {\n            _user:\n                this._getUserCookie(),\n            url:\n                context.focusedWindow.location,\n            description:\n                mods.entitled.text || context.focusedWindow.document.title,\n            extended: \n                input_obj.text,\n            tags:\n                mods.tagged.text\n        };\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>Named <code>._extractBookmarkData()</code>, this utility method accepts the results of Ubiquity&#39;s parser interpreting the primary argument and modifier arguments supplied by the user.  Using these data structures, it attempts to build a structure representing the fields of a Delicious bookmark.</p>\n<p>The <code>_user</code> field is used for authentication via the site login cookie.  The <code>url</code> is set from the location bar of the current page.  The <code>description</code>, or title, field of the bookmark is taken from either the <code>entitled</code> modifier or the title of the current page.  The <code>tags</code>, if any, come from the <code>tagged</code> modifier.  And, finally, the <code>extended</code> notes for the bookmark are taken from the primary input argument of the command.</p>\n<p>As you&#39;ll see shortly, this utility method will be used in both the preview and the execution of the command.</p>\n<p>Next, there&#39;s one more utility method to cover:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"85\">\n    /**\n     * Given an object, build a URL query string\n     */\n    _buildQueryString: function(data) {\n        var qs = [];\n        for (k in data) if (data[k]) \n            qs.push( encodeURIComponent(k) + '=' + \n                encodeURIComponent(data[k]) );\n        return qs.join('&');\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>In anticipation of using the Delicious V1 API, the <code>._buildQueryString()</code> method accepts an object and constructs a URL query string from the encoded properties of the object.  This will be paired with the <code>._extractBookmarkData()</code> method to supply data for API calls.</p>\n<p>Moving along, it&#39;s time to start digging into the meat of this Ubiquity command:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"95\">\n    /**\n     * Present a preview of the bookmark under construction during the course\n     * of composing the command.\n     */\n    preview: function(pblock, input_obj, mods) {\n\n        var bm          = this._extractBookmarkData(input_obj, mods);\n        var user_cookie = this._getUserCookie();\n        var user_name   = (user_cookie) ? user_cookie.split(' ')[0] : '';\n\n        var ns = { user_name: user_name, bm: bm };\n        var tmpl;\n</pre>\n\n<p>With this code, the implementation of command method <code>.preview()</code> has begun.  This method is used by Ubiquity to generate a live preview of the command.  Called with a DOM node (<code>pblock</code>) and partially completed command input (<code>input_obj</code> and <code>mods</code>), this method is expected to build a representation of the command&#39;s results in the DOM node.  As the user types, this method will be called over and over again, ideally offering feedback as the user composes a command.</p>\n<p>Continuing on, consider this next chunk of code checking the validity of command input:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"107\">\n        if (!user_name) {\n\n            // If there's no user name, there's no login, so this command won't work. \n            tmpl = [ \n                '<p style=\"color: #d44\">No active user found - log in at ', \n                '<img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\n                '<b><a style=\"color: #3774D0\" href=\"http://delicious.com\">delicious.com</a></b> ', \n                'to use this command.</p>'\n            ].join('');\n\n        } else if (!bm.description) {\n\n            // If there's no title, then this is an error too.\n            tmpl = [ \n                '<p style=\"color: #d44\">A title is required for bookmarks on ', \n                '<img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\n                '<b><a style=\"color: #3774D0\" href=\"http://delicious.com\">delicious.com</a></b> ', \n                '</p>'\n            ].join('');\n</pre>\n\n<p>This chunk of code first checks for a user name, which can be extracted from a valid Delicious login cookie, if one was found.  If not found, the command will fail—so the preview built here will instruct the user to login at Delicious before going further.</p>\n<p>The second precondition for using the command is that the bookmark has been given a title.  By default, this is the title of the current page—but, some pages don&#39;t offer titles.  So, an error needs to be flagged if the user hasn&#39;t manually supplied a title in this case.</p>\n<p>Finally, notice in both of these error cases, a string of HTML is composed in the variable <code>tmpl</code>.  This will be used at the end of the method to populate the DOM node passed in as <code>pblock</code>.</p>\n<p>Now, assuming that all the command&#39;s prerequisites have been met, it&#39;s time to try constructing a proper preview for the results of this command: </p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"126\">\n        } else {\n\n            // Attempt to construct a vaguely delicious-esque preview of a bookmark.\n            tmpl = [ \n                '<style type=\"text/css\">',\n                    '.preview a { color: #3774D0 }',\n                    '.del-bookmark { font: 12px arial; color: #ddd; background: #eee; line-height: 1.25em }',\n                    '.del-bookmark a.title { color: #1259C7 }',\n                    '.del-bookmark .full-url { color: #396C9B; font-size: 12px; display: block; padding: 0.25em 0 }',\n                    '.del-bookmark .notes { color: #4D4D4D }',\n                    '.del-bookmark .tags { color: #787878; padding-top: 0.25em; text-align: right }',\n                '</style>',\n                '<div class=\"preview\">',\n                    '<p>Share a bookmark at <img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\n                        '<b><a href=\"http://delicious.com/${user_name}\">delicious.com/${user_name}</a></b>:</p>',\n                    '<div class=\"del-bookmark\">',\n                        '<div style=\"padding: 1em;\">',\n                        '<a class=\"title\" href=\"${bm.url}\">${bm.description}</a>',\n                        '<a class=\"full-url\" href=\"${bm.url}\">${bm.url}</a>',\n                        bm.extended ? \n                            '<div class=\"notes\">${bm.extended}</div>' : '',\n                        bm.tags ?\n                            '<div class=\"tags\"><span>tags:</span> ${bm.tags}</div>' : '',\n                    '</div>',\n                '</div>'\n            ].join(\"\\n\");\n\n        }\n\n        pblock.innerHTML = CmdUtils.renderTemplate(tmpl, ns);\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>Building on the notion that previews are built in a DOM node, the code above uses both CSS and HTML to assemble a quick-and-dirty facsimile of a Delicious bookmark—which will be rendered like this:</p>\n<img src=\"/2008/ubiq-share-on-delicious-preview.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333; margin: 0.25em; padding: 0.25em\" />\n\n<p>Also note that Ubiquity provides a template engine for use in generating content—namely the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/JavaScriptTemplates\">JavaScript Templates</a> engine from the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/TrimPath\">TrimPath</a> project.  This engine may eventually be replaced with another, but the notion is that Ubiquity will provide tools to more easily generate previews and more.</p>\n<p>The conclusion of the <code>.preview()</code> method uses the template engine with a call to <code>CmdUtils.renderTemplate()</code> to inject content into the preview element by way of the <code>.innerHTML</code> property.</p>\n<p>Now that the preview is out of the way, it&#39;s time to get down to implementing the execution of the command:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"157\">    \n    /**\n     * Attempt to use the delicious v1 API to post a bookmark using the \n     * command input\n     */\n    execute: function(input_obj, mods) {\n        var bm          = this._extractBookmarkData(input_obj, mods);\n        var user_cookie = this._getUserCookie();\n        var user_name   = (user_cookie) ? user_cookie.split(' ')[0] : '';\n\n        if (!user_name) {\n            // If there's no user name, there's no login, so this command won't work. \n            displayMessage('No active user found - log in at delicious.com ' +\n                'to use this command.');\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        if (!bm.description) {\n            // If there's no title, somehow, then this is an error too.\n            displayMessage(\"A title is required for bookmarks at delicious.com\");\n            return false;\n        }\n</pre>\n\n<p>Mirroring the <code>.preview()</code> method, the <code>.execute()</code> method first checks for validity of the arguments given by the user.  A missing user name or title result in a notification that the command has failed.</p>\n<p>But, if the arguments are all valid, it&#39;s time to actually issue a request to the Delicious V1 API:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"178\">\n        var path = '/v1/posts/add';\n        var url  = this._config.api_base + path;\n\n        var req = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/xmlextras/xmlhttprequest;1\"].\n            createInstance();\n\n        req.open('POST', url, true);\n\n        req.onload = function(ev) { \n            displayMessage('Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n                'shared at delicious.com/' + user_name);\n        }\n\n        req.onerror = function(ev) { \n            displayMessage('ERROR: Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n                ' NOT shared on delicious.com/' + user_name);\n        }\n</pre>\n\n<p>Using the base URL for the Delicious API declared earlier in the configuration section, the <code>.execute()</code> method constructs an API URL for the <code>/v1/posts/add</code> method.  Then, it creates an instance of <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> from the browser to be used in sending the API request.  Event handlers are registered with the object to present notifications to the user indicating whether or not the API request was successful.</p>\n<p>At long last, it&#39;s time to wrap up this method and make the API request:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"195\">\n        req.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Basic Y29va2llOmNvb2tpZQ=='); // btoa('cookie:cookie')\n\n        var mediator = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/appshell/window-mediator;1\"].\n            getService(Components.interfaces.nsIWindowMediator);\n        var win = mediator.getMostRecentWindow(null);\n        var user_agent = win.navigator.userAgent + \";Ubiquity-share-on-delicious\";\n\n        req.setRequestHeader(\"User-Agent\", user_agent);      \n\n        req.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');\n        req.send(this._buildQueryString(bm));\n    },\n\n    EOF:null // I hate trailing commas\n});\n</pre>\n\n<p>The login cookie authentication supported by the Delicious V1 API is triggered by supplying a user name / password pair of <code>cookie</code>, which is done by setting the <code>Authorization</code> request header.  The login cookie is then expected to be passed in as the POST variable <code>_user</code>, which is done in the <code>._extractBookmarkData()</code> utility method.</p>\n<p>Another bit here that shows more access of browser resources is the construction of a unique User-Agent header for this API call based on the browser&#39;s own User-Agent string, something that&#39;s suggested in the guidelines for using the Delicious API.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <code>.execute()</code> method—and the command itself—is wrapped up with by sending off the bookmark data encoded as POST form variables with the <code>._buildQueryString()</code> utility method.</p>\n<p>And, that&#39;s it—a command-driven Delicious browser extension in a little over 200 lines of code.  There&#39;s still more to be done to really make this thing full-featured, but I think this shows off the basic features of Ubiquity.  I&#39;m hoping to dig in deeper and explore further, taking a look at running Greasemonkey-style code at <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1_Author_Tutorial#Running_on_page_load_and_startup\">browser startup and page load</a>, as well as playing with some more browser chrome features.  </p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085986\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0a9ab4b71ce193e98b7284ca257e327&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\">Jason Clark</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085986\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-01T14:47:35\">2008-09-01T14:47:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>First off-  fantastic post.  Great to see a lengthy post here again, although I'm one to talk.  This is an excellent introduction to Ubiquity command development, and tres useful to boot.</p>\n<p>I'm wondering why you chose to construct and post the XMLHttpRequest manually instead of using jQuery, which is included with Ubiquity.  I don't know that there's any benefit other than some simplicity, but I took a crack at converting your code to use jQuery, which works nicely.  In the 'execute' function, replace everything after \"var url  = this._config.api_base + path;\" with this (hope code blocks work in comments):</p>\n<p><code>\nvar win = context.focusedWindow;\nvar user_agent = win.navigator.userAgent + \";Ubiquity-share-on-delicious\";</code></p>\n<pre><code>    jQuery.ajax({\ntype: \"POST\",\nurl: url,\ndata: this._buildQueryString(bm),\nusername: \"cookie\",\npassword: \"cookie\",\nbeforeSend: function( req ) {\nreq.setRequestHeader(\"User-Agent\", user_agent); \n},\nerror: function() {\ndisplayMessage('ERROR: Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n' NOT shared on delicious.com/' + user_name);\n},\nsuccess: function() {\ndisplayMessage('Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n'shared at delicious.com/' + user_name);\n},\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, with both versions of the code, I'm seeing some unexpected behavior around authentication.  Assume I'm logged in to delicious, with \"stay logged in\" checked, and I restart my browser.  Trying to post with the command fails with a 401 unauthorized, even though I can see the cookie was sent (via Live HTTP Headers extension).  Going to delicious.com shows me logged in, and once I've viewed the site, the command works.  Except that now I can't reproduce; but I know it happened because I've got the headers.  At any rate, it is working nicely, but the previous failure is bugging me... feel like I'm overlooking something.  </p>\n<p>Thanks again for an awesome post.  Hope to see more of the same.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085988\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e799a79441c7543be48562403411cd13&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Ryan Scott Scheel</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085988\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-01T15:07:01\">2008-09-01T15:07:01</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>You should be helping with the documentation, if you aren't already.

    "body": "In my [last post][last], I got all fluffy about how cool [Ubiquity][] is but didn't share any code to prove the point.  As it happens, I have come up with at least one useful command that I'm starting to use habitually in posting bookmarks to Delicious.  You can [subscribe to my command][subs] or [check out the full source][source]—this post will serve as a dissection of the thing.  Since this will be fairly lengthy, follow along after the jump.\r\n\r\nOh, and it's been awhile since I posted something this in-depth around here, so feel free to let me know how this first draft works.  And, bug reports and patches are of course welcome.\r\n\r\n[ubiquity]: http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/\r\n[last]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/08/31/ubiquity-cracks-open-personal-mashup-tinkering \"Ubiquity cracks open personal mashup tinkering\"\r\n[subs]: http://decafbad.com/UbiquityCommands/\r\n[source]: http://decafbad.com/hg/UbiquityCommands/file/tip/delicious.ubiq.js\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nTo begin, consider the following code starting off the command source code:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\n/**\r\n * share-on-delicious - an Ubiquity command for sharing bookmarks on\r\n * delicious.com\r\n *\r\n * l.m.orchard@pobox.com\r\n * http://decafbad.com/\r\n * Share and Enjoy!\r\n */\r\nvar uext = Application.extensions.get('ubiquity@labs.mozilla.com');\r\n\r\nvar cookie_mgr = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/cookiemanager;1\"]\r\n    .getService(Components.interfaces.nsICookieManager);\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe first thing to note here is that a short header comment introduces the command.  This isn't required, but it's a good idea.  It's also something you can't really do with bookmarklets.  On the other hand, Greasemonkey user scripts expect metadata about the script to be provided here, but Ubiquity doesn't use this convention.\r\n\r\nSecond, notice that the code accesses some chrome-level resources.  Again, this is something unavailable to bookmarklets and Greasemonkey user scripts.  Just take a look at the [FUEL library documentation][fuel] to get a quick sense of what's available using that simplified API, not to mention what's available using the lower-level browser APIs.\r\n\r\n[fuel]: http://developer.mozilla.org/en/FUEL\r\n\r\nNow, check out this next chunk of code, which begins the construction of an Ubiquity command:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"13\">\r\nCmdUtils.CreateCommand({\r\n    \r\n    name:        \r\n        'share-on-delicious',\r\n    icon:\r\n        'http://delicious.com/favicon.ico',\r\n    description: \r\n        'Share the current page as a bookmark on delicious.com',\r\n    help:        \r\n        'Select text on the page to use as notes, or enter your own ' + \r\n        'text after the command word.  You can also assign tags to the '+ \r\n        'bookmark with the \"tagged\" modifier, and alter the bookmark ' + \r\n        'default page title with the \"entitled\" modifier.  Note that ' + \r\n        'you must also already be logged in at delicious.com to use ' +\r\n        'this command.',\r\n\r\n    homepage:   \r\n        'http://decafbad.com',\r\n    author: { \r\n        name: 'Leslie Michael Orchard', \r\n        email: 'l.m.orchard@pobox.com' \r\n    },\r\n    license:\r\n        'MPL/GPL/LGPL',\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nWhereas Greasemonkey scripts support metadata in the header comment, the Ubiquity command script API works a little differently.  \r\n\r\nThe [`CmdUtils` module][cmdutils] provided by Ubiquity offers a `CreateCommand` function, which expects an object as a parameter.  The object literal whose construction is begun in the code above serves as a self-contained package for the command, bearing metadata describing the command as well as containing all the code necessary to implement it.\r\n\r\nSo, in the above code block, you can see the machine-readable description of the command—including a command name, display icon, home page URL, author information, and license.  The command name (`share-on-delicious`) will be used by the Ubiquity command parser, but the rest of the description will also be used in the list of commands available to the user, invoked by the `command-list` command, like so:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/2008/ubiq-share-on-delicious-list.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333; margin: 0.25em; padding: 0.25em\" />\r\n\r\n[cmdutils]: http://hg.toolness.com/ubiquity-firefox/file/tip/ubiquity/chrome/content/cmdutils.js\r\n\r\nMoving along, this next chunk of code introduces the first functional bits of the command:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"37\">\r\n    takes: { notes: noun_arb_text },\r\n    modifiers: { \r\n        tagged:  noun_arb_text,\r\n        entitled: noun_arb_text\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nLike smart keyword shortcut bookmarks, Ubiquity commands accept user-supplied input.  But, what's unique to Ubiquity is that it employs a parser whose goal is to support something approximating natural language.  At present, this results in commands that support a single primary argument—declared above with the `takes` property—and any number of additional keyword modifiers—declared above by the `modifiers` property.\r\n\r\nFor the command under construction here, this establishes a pattern something like the following:\r\n\r\n    share-on-delicious {notes} [tagged {tags} entitled {title}]\r\n\r\nContent for the `{notes}` argument can either be typed directly by hand, or it can be supplied by text highlighted on the page.  To use highlighted text, you can either issue the command alone, or use the word `this` for the `{notes}` argument before including further modifiers.\r\n\r\nThe modifiers `tagged` and `entitled` are optional, and can be used in any order.  Each of these keywords signifies the start of a different argument—which unfortunately can collide with the literal data supplied for notes, which will hopefully be a rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nAll of this adds up command invocations including the following:\r\n\r\n    share-on-delicious\r\n    share-on-delicious I really like this page tagged nifty amusing\r\n    share-on-delicious this entitled This bookmark has no tags\r\n    sh this tagged osx software apple entitled This is good OS X software\r\n\r\nThat last example is important—since I have no other commands starting with \"`sh`\", I can abbreviate the full command.  Ubiquity only requires enough of a command name to disambiguate it within your collection of commands.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is the use of the constant value `noun_arb_text`, which declares that these arguments should expect any arbitrary text as input.  \r\n\r\nThis facility is not exploited for the present command, but Ubiquity defines [noun types][noun].  These include concepts such as plain text, dates, address book contacts, browser tabs, bookmark tags, and more.  You can define your own noun types, as well as implement suggestion schemes that help guide the user toward constructing useful input values in the command interface.  You can [read more about this][noun_tut] in the official author tutorial.\r\n\r\n[noun]: http://hg.toolness.com/ubiquity-firefox/file/tip/ubiquity/chrome/content/nlparser/en/nountypes.js\r\n[noun_tut]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1_Author_Tutorial#Introduction_to_Noun_Types\r\n\r\nNext up is a quick bit of command-specific configuration:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"42\">\r\n    /**\r\n     * Command configuration settings.\r\n     */\r\n    _config: {\r\n        // Base URL for the delicious v1 API\r\n        api_base:      'https://api.del.icio.us',\r\n\r\n        // Domain and name of the delicious login session cookie.\r\n        cookie_domain: '.delicious.com',\r\n        cookie_name:   '_user'\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nSince this command will be posting to Delicious via the V1 API, it's handy to declare the base URL for the API in an easily changed spot.  That way, you could change this value later on to point the command at another implementation of the API.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this command will employ a little-known authentication trick supported by the Delicious API that accepts the user's login cookie set by the Delicious website—this \"cookie god\" auth is used by the official Delicious addon for Firefox.  It's handy for piggybacking on the website login and removing the need to ask the user for their username and password again and possibly storing it in an insecure manner.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this next chunk of code defines a utility method to rummage through the cookie jar:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"53\">\r\n    /**\r\n     * Dig up the Delicious login session cookie.\r\n     */\r\n    _getUserCookie: function() {\r\n        var iter = cookie_mgr.enumerator;\r\n        while (iter.hasMoreElements()) {\r\n            var cookie = iter.getNext();\r\n            if( cookie instanceof Components.interfaces.nsICookie && \r\n                cookie.host.indexOf(this._config.cookie_domain) != -1 && \r\n                cookie.name == this._config.cookie_name) {\r\n                return decodeURIComponent(cookie.value);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe method defined above, `._getUserCookie()`, uses the browser's cookie manager and the values defined in the previous configuration section to find the login session cookie set for Delicious.  Take note that this is far beyond the allowed capabilities of bookmarklets and Greasemoney user scripts—this is digging straight into the browser itself, skipping past the usual content-space security restrictions.  \r\n\r\nIn other words: In Ubiquity, *the gun is loaded* and you should be careful.  \r\n\r\nMoving along, consider this next utility method:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"67\">\r\n    /**\r\n     * Given input data and modifiers, attempt to assemble data necessary to\r\n     * post a bookmark.\r\n     */\r\n    _extractBookmarkData: function(input_obj, mods) {\r\n        return {\r\n            _user:\r\n                this._getUserCookie(),\r\n            url:\r\n                context.focusedWindow.location,\r\n            description:\r\n                mods.entitled.text || context.focusedWindow.document.title,\r\n            extended: \r\n                input_obj.text,\r\n            tags:\r\n                mods.tagged.text\r\n        };\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nNamed `._extractBookmarkData()`, this utility method accepts the results of Ubiquity's parser interpreting the primary argument and modifier arguments supplied by the user.  Using these data structures, it attempts to build a structure representing the fields of a Delicious bookmark.\r\n\r\nThe `_user` field is used for authentication via the site login cookie.  The `url` is set from the location bar of the current page.  The `description`, or title, field of the bookmark is taken from either the `entitled` modifier or the title of the current page.  The `tags`, if any, come from the `tagged` modifier.  And, finally, the `extended` notes for the bookmark are taken from the primary input argument of the command.\r\n\r\nAs you'll see shortly, this utility method will be used in both the preview and the execution of the command.\r\n\r\nNext, there's one more utility method to cover:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"85\">\r\n    /**\r\n     * Given an object, build a URL query string\r\n     */\r\n    _buildQueryString: function(data) {\r\n        var qs = [];\r\n        for (k in data) if (data[k]) \r\n            qs.push( encodeURIComponent(k) + '=' + \r\n                encodeURIComponent(data[k]) );\r\n        return qs.join('&');\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of using the Delicious V1 API, the `._buildQueryString()` method accepts an object and constructs a URL query string from the encoded properties of the object.  This will be paired with the `._extractBookmarkData()` method to supply data for API calls.\r\n\r\nMoving along, it's time to start digging into the meat of this Ubiquity command:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"95\">\r\n    /**\r\n     * Present a preview of the bookmark under construction during the course\r\n     * of composing the command.\r\n     */\r\n    preview: function(pblock, input_obj, mods) {\r\n\r\n        var bm          = this._extractBookmarkData(input_obj, mods);\r\n        var user_cookie = this._getUserCookie();\r\n        var user_name   = (user_cookie) ? user_cookie.split(' ')[0] : '';\r\n\r\n        var ns = { user_name: user_name, bm: bm };\r\n        var tmpl;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nWith this code, the implementation of command method `.preview()` has begun.  This method is used by Ubiquity to generate a live preview of the command.  Called with a DOM node (`pblock`) and partially completed command input (`input_obj` and `mods`), this method is expected to build a representation of the command's results in the DOM node.  As the user types, this method will be called over and over again, ideally offering feedback as the user composes a command.\r\n\r\nContinuing on, consider this next chunk of code checking the validity of command input:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"107\">\r\n        if (!user_name) {\r\n\r\n            // If there's no user name, there's no login, so this command won't work. \r\n            tmpl = [ \r\n                '<p style=\"color: #d44\">No active user found - log in at ', \r\n                '<img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\r\n                '<b><a style=\"color: #3774D0\" href=\"http://delicious.com\">delicious.com</a></b> ', \r\n                'to use this command.</p>'\r\n            ].join('');\r\n\r\n        } else if (!bm.description) {\r\n\r\n            // If there's no title, then this is an error too.\r\n            tmpl = [ \r\n                '<p style=\"color: #d44\">A title is required for bookmarks on ', \r\n                '<img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\r\n                '<b><a style=\"color: #3774D0\" href=\"http://delicious.com\">delicious.com</a></b> ', \r\n                '</p>'\r\n            ].join('');\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThis chunk of code first checks for a user name, which can be extracted from a valid Delicious login cookie, if one was found.  If not found, the command will fail—so the preview built here will instruct the user to login at Delicious before going further.\r\n\r\nThe second precondition for using the command is that the bookmark has been given a title.  By default, this is the title of the current page—but, some pages don't offer titles.  So, an error needs to be flagged if the user hasn't manually supplied a title in this case.\r\n\r\nFinally, notice in both of these error cases, a string of HTML is composed in the variable `tmpl`.  This will be used at the end of the method to populate the DOM node passed in as `pblock`.\r\n\r\nNow, assuming that all the command's prerequisites have been met, it's time to try constructing a proper preview for the results of this command: \r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"126\">\r\n        } else {\r\n\r\n            // Attempt to construct a vaguely delicious-esque preview of a bookmark.\r\n            tmpl = [ \r\n                '<style type=\"text/css\">',\r\n                    '.preview a { color: #3774D0 }',\r\n                    '.del-bookmark { font: 12px arial; color: #ddd; background: #eee; line-height: 1.25em }',\r\n                    '.del-bookmark a.title { color: #1259C7 }',\r\n                    '.del-bookmark .full-url { color: #396C9B; font-size: 12px; display: block; padding: 0.25em 0 }',\r\n                    '.del-bookmark .notes { color: #4D4D4D }',\r\n                    '.del-bookmark .tags { color: #787878; padding-top: 0.25em; text-align: right }',\r\n                '</style>',\r\n                '<div class=\"preview\">',\r\n                    '<p>Share a bookmark at <img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\r\n                        '<b><a href=\"http://delicious.com/${user_name}\">delicious.com/${user_name}</a></b>:</p>',\r\n                    '<div class=\"del-bookmark\">',\r\n                        '<div style=\"padding: 1em;\">',\r\n                        '<a class=\"title\" href=\"${bm.url}\">${bm.description}</a>',\r\n                        '<a class=\"full-url\" href=\"${bm.url}\">${bm.url}</a>',\r\n                        bm.extended ? \r\n                            '<div class=\"notes\">${bm.extended}</div>' : '',\r\n                        bm.tags ?\r\n                            '<div class=\"tags\"><span>tags:</span> ${bm.tags}</div>' : '',\r\n                    '</div>',\r\n                '</div>'\r\n            ].join(\"\\n\");\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        pblock.innerHTML = CmdUtils.renderTemplate(tmpl, ns);\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nBuilding on the notion that previews are built in a DOM node, the code above uses both CSS and HTML to assemble a quick-and-dirty facsimile of a Delicious bookmark—which will be rendered like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/2008/ubiq-share-on-delicious-preview.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333; margin: 0.25em; padding: 0.25em\" />\r\n\r\nAlso note that Ubiquity provides a template engine for use in generating content—namely the [JavaScript Templates][jst] engine from the [TrimPath][] project.  This engine may eventually be replaced with another, but the notion is that Ubiquity will provide tools to more easily generate previews and more.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the `.preview()` method uses the template engine with a call to `CmdUtils.renderTemplate()` to inject content into the preview element by way of the `.innerHTML` property.\r\n\r\n[jst]: http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/JavaScriptTemplates\r\n[trimpath]: http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/TrimPath\r\n\r\nNow that the preview is out of the way, it's time to get down to implementing the execution of the command:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"157\">    \r\n    /**\r\n     * Attempt to use the delicious v1 API to post a bookmark using the \r\n     * command input\r\n     */\r\n    execute: function(input_obj, mods) {\r\n        var bm          = this._extractBookmarkData(input_obj, mods);\r\n        var user_cookie = this._getUserCookie();\r\n        var user_name   = (user_cookie) ? user_cookie.split(' ')[0] : '';\r\n\r\n        if (!user_name) {\r\n            // If there's no user name, there's no login, so this command won't work. \r\n            displayMessage('No active user found - log in at delicious.com ' +\r\n                'to use this command.');\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (!bm.description) {\r\n            // If there's no title, somehow, then this is an error too.\r\n            displayMessage(\"A title is required for bookmarks at delicious.com\");\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nMirroring the `.preview()` method, the `.execute()` method first checks for validity of the arguments given by the user.  A missing user name or title result in a notification that the command has failed.\r\n\r\nBut, if the arguments are all valid, it's time to actually issue a request to the Delicious V1 API:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"178\">\r\n        var path = '/v1/posts/add';\r\n        var url  = this._config.api_base + path;\r\n\r\n        var req = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/xmlextras/xmlhttprequest;1\"].\r\n            createInstance();\r\n\r\n        req.open('POST', url, true);\r\n\r\n        req.onload = function(ev) { \r\n            displayMessage('Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \r\n                'shared at delicious.com/' + user_name);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        req.onerror = function(ev) { \r\n            displayMessage('ERROR: Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \r\n                ' NOT shared on delicious.com/' + user_name);\r\n        }\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nUsing the base URL for the Delicious API declared earlier in the configuration section, the `.execute()` method constructs an API URL for the `/v1/posts/add` method.  Then, it creates an instance of `XMLHttpRequest` from the browser to be used in sending the API request.  Event handlers are registered with the object to present notifications to the user indicating whether or not the API request was successful.\r\n\r\nAt long last, it's time to wrap up this method and make the API request:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"195\">\r\n        req.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Basic Y29va2llOmNvb2tpZQ=='); // btoa('cookie:cookie')\r\n\r\n        var mediator = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/appshell/window-mediator;1\"].\r\n            getService(Components.interfaces.nsIWindowMediator);\r\n        var win = mediator.getMostRecentWindow(null);\r\n        var user_agent = win.navigator.userAgent + \";Ubiquity-share-on-delicious\";\r\n\r\n        req.setRequestHeader(\"User-Agent\", user_agent);      \r\n\r\n        req.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');\r\n        req.send(this._buildQueryString(bm));\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    EOF:null // I hate trailing commas\r\n});\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe login cookie authentication supported by the Delicious V1 API is triggered by supplying a user name / password pair of `cookie`, which is done by setting the `Authorization` request header.  The login cookie is then expected to be passed in as the POST variable `_user`, which is done in the `._extractBookmarkData()` utility method.\r\n\r\nAnother bit here that shows more access of browser resources is the construction of a unique User-Agent header for this API call based on the browser's own User-Agent string, something that's suggested in the guidelines for using the Delicious API.\r\n\r\nFinally, the `.execute()` method—and the command itself—is wrapped up with by sending off the bookmark data encoded as POST form variables with the `._buildQueryString()` utility method.\r\n\r\nAnd, that's it—a command-driven Delicious browser extension in a little over 200 lines of code.  There's still more to be done to really make this thing full-featured, but I think this shows off the basic features of Ubiquity.  I'm hoping to dig in deeper and explore further, taking a look at running Greasemonkey-style code at [browser startup and page load][load], as well as playing with some more browser chrome features.  \r\n\r\n[load]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1_Author_Tutorial#Running_on_page_load_and_startup\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085986\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0a9ab4b71ce193e98b7284ca257e327&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\">Jason Clark</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085986\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-01T14:47:35\">2008-09-01T14:47:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>First off-  fantastic post.  Great to see a lengthy post here again, although I'm one to talk.  This is an excellent introduction to Ubiquity command development, and tres useful to boot.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering why you chose to construct and post the XMLHttpRequest manually instead of using jQuery, which is included with Ubiquity.  I don't know that there's any benefit other than some simplicity, but I took a crack at converting your code to use jQuery, which works nicely.  In the 'execute' function, replace everything after \"var url  = this._config.api_base + path;\" with this (hope code blocks work in comments):</p>\n\n<p><code>\n        var win = context.focusedWindow;\n        var user_agent = win.navigator.userAgent + \";Ubiquity-share-on-delicious\";</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>    jQuery.ajax({\n      type: \"POST\",\n      url: url,\n      data: this._buildQueryString(bm),\n      username: \"cookie\",\n      password: \"cookie\",\n      beforeSend: function( req ) {\n        req.setRequestHeader(\"User-Agent\", user_agent); \n      },\n      error: function() {\n        displayMessage('ERROR: Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n            ' NOT shared on delicious.com/' + user_name);\n      },\n      success: function() {\n        displayMessage('Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n            'shared at delicious.com/' + user_name);\n      },\n    });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Also, with both versions of the code, I'm seeing some unexpected behavior around authentication.  Assume I'm logged in to delicious, with \"stay logged in\" checked, and I restart my browser.  Trying to post with the command fails with a 401 unauthorized, even though I can see the cookie was sent (via Live HTTP Headers extension).  Going to delicious.com shows me logged in, and once I've viewed the site, the command works.  Except that now I can't reproduce; but I know it happened because I've got the headers.  At any rate, it is working nicely, but the previous failure is bugging me... feel like I'm overlooking something.  </p>\n\n<p>Thanks again for an awesome post.  Hope to see more of the same.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085988\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e799a79441c7543be48562403411cd13&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Ryan Scott Scheel</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085988\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-01T15:07:01\">2008-09-01T15:07:01</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>You should be helping with the documentation, if you aren't already.

    "html": "<p>When I was a wee hacker, I lived my digital life though a <a href=\"http://www.virtualsky.net/iadoremyc64/\">Commodore 64</a>.  I played games on it, did homework, talked to people far away—you know, all the stuff they showed in the pictures on the box.  I also took things apart—both the machine itself and software running on it.  I grew up learning that my digital environment was ultimately understandable, <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/\">susceptible to tinkering</a>, and open to being bent to my own purposes.</p>\n<p>From the Commodore 64, I graduated eventually to terminals and text editors, opening portals mostly onto computers elsewhere via powerful UNIX command shells.  And, of course, over the past decade, this has largely given way to life in a browser.  </p>\n<p>Yet, for a little while, particularly in the first few years of browsers, freedom to tinker seemed cramped.  JavaScript had yet to arrive, and was a little messy when it did.  There was no relatively easy addon development.  And, though the portals opened by a browser were richer than those provided by terminals, the paths of navigation defined by links controlled by site owners offered less freedom of movement than UNIX commands.  I could create my own pages, but I couldn&#39;t do much to others&#39; pages.</p>\n<p>But then, javascript: URLs came around, dots were connected, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet\">bookmarklets</a> were born.  Suddenly, it was possible to customize <em>my</em> browsing environment with arbitrary JavaScript code having access to the current page—no matter <em>whose</em> page it was.  And, through the various tricks of the AJAX trade, bookmarklets have only gotten more capable throughout the years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/docs/end-user/keywords.html\">Smart keyword shortcuts</a> came around a little later, allowing quick access to bookmarks via simple keywords typed into the location bar.  The smart part, though, came in the form of bookmarked URLs with placeholders and keywords given arguments to fill the placeholders—allowing not only quick access to bookmarked pages but also search engine forms bookmarked with late-bound fields.</p>\n<p>Bookmarklets inherited the benefits of smart keyword shortcuts.  The same placeholder in http: URLs can be inserted into the code of a javascript: URL, thus parameterizing the JavaScript code and incidentally turning the location bar into a kind of primitive command line.  For example, one of my most heavily used &quot;<a href=\"http://naeblis.cx/weblog/2004/08/09/DeliciousAddresslets\">addresslets</a>&quot; is based on <a href=\"http://ejohn.org/blog/super-fast-delicious-bookmarklet/\">John Resig&#39;s original &quot;Super-Fast Delicious Bookmarklet&quot;</a>.</p>\n<p>Another leap in prying open the browser tinkering space came in the form of <a href=\"http://www.greasespot.net/\">Greasemonkey</a>—an addon-powered environment created explicitly for the purpose of end-user scripting applied to others&#39; pages.  <a href=\"http://www.greasespot.net/\">Greasemonkey</a> user scripts can do more than bookmarklets, and with a much better development environment to boot.

    "body": "When I was a wee hacker, I lived my digital life though a [Commodore 64][c64].  I played games on it, did homework, talked to people far away—you know, all the stuff they showed in the pictures on the box.  I also took things apart—both the machine itself and software running on it.  I grew up learning that my digital environment was ultimately understandable, [susceptible to tinkering][transactor], and open to being bent to my own purposes.\r\n\r\nFrom the Commodore 64, I graduated eventually to terminals and text editors, opening portals mostly onto computers elsewhere via powerful UNIX command shells.  And, of course, over the past decade, this has largely given way to life in a browser.  \r\n\r\nYet, for a little while, particularly in the first few years of browsers, freedom to tinker seemed cramped.  JavaScript had yet to arrive, and was a little messy when it did.  There was no relatively easy addon development.  And, though the portals opened by a browser were richer than those provided by terminals, the paths of navigation defined by links controlled by site owners offered less freedom of movement than UNIX commands.  I could create my own pages, but I couldn't do much to others' pages.\r\n\r\nBut then, javascript: URLs came around, dots were connected, and [bookmarklets][] were born.  Suddenly, it was possible to customize *my* browsing environment with arbitrary JavaScript code having access to the current page—no matter *whose* page it was.  And, through the various tricks of the AJAX trade, bookmarklets have only gotten more capable throughout the years.\r\n\r\n[Smart keyword shortcuts][shortcuts] came around a little later, allowing quick access to bookmarks via simple keywords typed into the location bar.  The smart part, though, came in the form of bookmarked URLs with placeholders and keywords given arguments to fill the placeholders—allowing not only quick access to bookmarked pages but also search engine forms bookmarked with late-bound fields.\r\n\r\nBookmarklets inherited the benefits of smart keyword shortcuts.  The same placeholder in http: URLs can be inserted into the code of a javascript: URL, thus parameterizing the JavaScript code and incidentally turning the location bar into a kind of primitive command line.  For example, one of my most heavily used \"[addresslets](http://naeblis.cx/weblog/2004/08/09/DeliciousAddresslets)\" is based on [John Resig's original \"Super-Fast Delicious Bookmarklet\"](http://ejohn.org/blog/super-fast-delicious-bookmarklet/).\r\n\r\nAnother leap in prying open the browser tinkering space came in the form of [Greasemonkey][]—an addon-powered environment created explicitly for the purpose of end-user scripting applied to others' pages.  [Greasemonkey][] user scripts can do more than bookmarklets, and with a much better development environment to boot.  And, though a user script can't do quite as much as a proper browser addon, they're much easier to hack on and distribute.\r\n\r\nNow, consider one of [Mozilla Labs][labs]' [newest projects][ubiquity], named [Ubiquity][].  This rough and experimental addon for Firefox combines and improves upon everything I've described so far:\r\n\r\n* [Ubiquity][] is a hackable command line environment, better than [bookmarklets][] and smart [keyword shortcuts][shortcuts];\r\n* [Ubiquity][] enables persistent customization of others' pages, not unlike [Greasemonkey][]; \r\n* [Ubiquity][] facilitates live in-browser creation and web-based subscription to user commands and scripts;\r\n* [Ubiquity][] gives access to browser chrome resources without a need for frequent restarts;\r\n\r\nSo far, most of the [commands][] I see popping up since the 0.1 release have not accomplished much more than [smart keyword shortcuts][shortcuts] in the location bar could.  But, it's early yet, and [Ubiquity][] is far from limited to these commands.\r\n\r\nOnce the basics have been well-explored, I expect to see more people taking a crack at the broader capabilities offered by [Ubiquity][].  [Bookmarklets][] and [Greasemonkey][] can't access browser chrome—but [Ubiquity][] can.  [Ubiquity][] also offers a user interface that's so much more promising than keyword shortcuts, including command previews and typed parameters with suggestions.\r\n\r\nUbiquity promises web-wide mashups directed by a conversational command interface.  All in all, the potential of this makes me feel like my digital environment—browser and web as a whole—is getting even more intimately, personally hackable.  \r\n\r\nIt'll be very interesting to see where this project goes.\r\n\r\n[labs]: http://labs.mozilla.com/\r\n[transactor]: http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/\r\n[c64]: http://www.virtualsky.net/iadoremyc64/\r\n[shortcuts]: http://www.mozilla.org/docs/end-user/keywords.html\r\n[greasemonkey]: http://www.greasespot.net/\r\n[bookmarklets]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet\r\n[ubiquity]: http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/\r\n[commands]: https://labs.toolness.com/ubiquity-herd/\r\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089574\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=22b4e824255828f5aedd0e6e2558dc52&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Raul</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089574\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-31T10:20:58\">2008-08-31T10:20:58</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hi, was using the original delicious command linked from the Ubiquity wiki, just tried yours and its definitely more polished and functional.

And, since I&#39;m pretty sure everyone over there is either burnt out or still insanely busy at the moment, it might be awhile before anyone tells the full story of what this relaunch offers.  As it is, even I only know a bit of what all went into this effort.</p>\n<p>So, off the top of my head, I thought I might point out <strong>just a few</strong> of the easily-missed improvements the new site offers beyond the great new love-it-or-hate-it visual redesign that seems to have occupied most of the discussion I&#39;ve seen so far:</p>\n<p><strong>Search works and is incredibly fast.</strong>  In fact, search may really be the real star of the redesign show here—especially since del.icio.us often took 30 seconds or more for a simple search, rendering it all but useless.

Though I think it comes along with <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/tools\">the browser extensions</a>, I&#39;ve yet to find this for <a href=\"http://mycroft.mozdev.org/developer/hosting.html\">autodiscovery</a> from the site itself.</p>\n<p><strong>The notes field in bookmarks has been expanded from 255 to 1000 characters.</strong>  Yes, this means that you can now include long running quotes from pages, or complete paragraphs of rambling discourse. </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/feeds\">The feeds have all been overhauled and reorganized</a>.</strong>  An attempt at backward compatibility was made, but the old feed URLs are all deprecated.  Replacing these, there&#39;s now <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/feeds\">a common and consistent URL namespace for feeds across formats</a>.  </p>\n<p>Almost all RSS feeds have <a href=\"http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/\">JSONP</a> counterparts, and further feed formats could be considered.  Additionally, the old mix of RSS 1.0 and 2.0 has been dropped in favor of RSS 2.0 format across the board to support podcast and media enclosure elements consistently.  The <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/tools\">linkrolls, tagrolls, network badges, and tagometers</a> now all use the new JSONP feeds—and the widgets can be examined as example code in using the feeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Tag bundles can now be viewed as combined bookmark views, complete with feeds.</strong>  This augments bundles from a simple visual organization tool to a more powerful content aggregation function.  Personally, I never had much use for tag bundles until now, but since they can actually be used to partition tags and bookmarks I might actually take the time to use them.

From there, you can subscribe to those partitioned bookmarks in different folders in readers, or use the bundled bookmark views in mashups through JSON feeds.  Check out these example URLs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://delicious.com/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard\">http://delicious.com/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard\">http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/network/bkerr/bundle:Brickyard</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Network member and fan feeds now include the date when the contact was added.</strong>  Pro tip: Subscribe to fan feeds to see when new people have started following your bookmarks.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/api\">Several previously undocumented parts of the V1 API have now been documented</a>.</strong>  In particular, the following new parameter combinations have been used with the browser extensions for primitive bookmark sync:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?hashes\">https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?hashes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?meta=yes\">https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?meta=yes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?fromdt=%7BDT%7D&amp;todt=%7BDT%7D\">https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?fromdt={DT}&amp;todt={DT}</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?start=%7B##%7D&amp;results=%7B##%7D\">https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all?start={##}&amp;results={##}</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The posts/all API URL works again for users with large collections.</strong>  With my 11k+ bookmarks, del.icio.us was keeling over with the attempt to assemble and deliver my entire collection with a posts/all call.  Now, however, Delicious 2.0 appears able to handle this call for my account.</p>\n<p><strong>Easter eggs have been rotated and recalibrated.</strong> No, I&#39;m not going to tell you what or where or how many they are.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085469\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085469\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-05T02:31:52\">2008-08-05T02:31:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n<p>Since I’m pretty sure everyone over there is either burnt out or still insanely busy at the moment, it might be awhile before anyone tells the full story of what this relaunch offers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Admit it, Les, you just got impatient after building a bunch of shiny toys that no one at Yahoo! seemed to be coming forth to tell the world about them. :) (I would be miffed too.)</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085470\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.yining.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cd8af1a8b7c1cfdca49fb19d4a98a7bc&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.yining.org\">Yining</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085470\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-05T06:51:44\">2008-08-05T06:51:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>one thing in the new version that disappoints me is the tab-to-complete feature is gone.

I&#39;m suddenly inspired to break blog-radio-silence and get it out of my head.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/let-the-microblogs-bloom\">Let the microblogs bloom - RussellBeattie.com</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Once this is widely accepted (and I'm sure there are many that would argue with me), the thing that will separate these types of services won't be whether they stay up (ala Twitter), but how fast your subscription messages are updated. Some services might be smaller or offer more features but not update as quickly whereas others will pride themselves on being as close to real-time as possible. The key is that it's all about messaging, not publishing. (Oh, and this also facilitates federation as well, but that's another topic).</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also: <a href=\"http://randomfoo.net/blog/id/4182\">Rearchitecting Twitter: Brought to You By the 17th Letter of the Alphabet - random($foo)</a></p>\n<p>One of the problems it seems most modern web apps face is the tendency to want to do everything all at once, and all in the same code that responds directly to a user.  Because, while you&#39;re in there building a user interface, it&#39;s <em>easy</em> to implement everything else that needs to happen in that same UI module or library.</p>\n<p>Someone wants to post a bookmark?  Someone wants to post a message?  Well, of course you want the system to cross-reference and deliver that new piece of User Generated Content through every permutation of tag, recipient, keyword, and notification channel supported by your system.  </p>\n<p><strong>But</strong>, do you <em>really</em> have to do everything all at once—while the person who generated that content is tapping his or her foot, waiting for the web interface to respond with feedback?  Are all of these things immediately vital to the person watching the browser spin, <em>right now</em>?  </p>\n<p>No.  Your user wants to get on with things.  He or she wants to see the submitted content get accepted and, as feedback and confirmation, see it reflected in a personal view immediately.  Does it matter—to <em>this person</em>, at <em>this moment</em>—whether it shows up <em>simultaneously</em> in a friend&#39;s inbox, the public timeline, a global tag page, or even an RSS or Atom feed?</p>\n<p>Again, no, simultaneity doesn&#39;t really matter—because no human beings actually appreciate it.  Instead, imagine a ripple effect of concentric social and attention contexts with associated people spreading out from the original submission.  (This probably rates the creation of a diagram someday.)  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>To make the person who&#39;s submitting something happy, offer feedback visible in their own personal context in under 50-200 milliseconds.  (That is, less than half-a-second at worst, in people terms.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The next person to delight is someone following the first person&#39;s published content—and humanly speaking, delays of <em>tens of thousands of milliseconds</em> can be acceptable here.  (That is, 1-10 seconds at worst, in people terms.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Finally, you can start worrying about strangers, allowing the content to propagate to tag pages, keyword tracking pages, and other public views—and I&#39;d assert that delays of <em>hundreds of thousands of milliseconds</em> are acceptable here.  (That is, 1-2 minutes at worst, in people terms.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea here is that the social structure can help you scale, while still delighting people.  Even with these delays, the system is still better at getting the word out than the original content creator would be at notifying all the others involved with an out-of-band system like IM or email.  And that&#39;s at worst—on most good days, all the delays should tend to be on the order of seconds or less.</p>\n<p>And how do you do all of this?  Use queues.  Sure, the original submission of content can and should be done all at once—just enough to get the content into the user&#39;s collection.  Then, queue a job for further processing and get out of the way.  In fact, just queue one job from the user interface—the processor of <em>that</em> queue can then queue further jobs for all the other individual processing tasks that are likely susceptible to plenty of parallel processing and horizontal scaling.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the original user creating content has been thanked for their submission and life goes on.  In fact, their life may include going on to submit many more pieces of content in rapid succession, thanks to your delightfully responsive web user interface.  </p>\n<p>And, in the end, that&#39;s really the purpose of a web-based content creation interface—accepting something as quickly as possible to make the user happy enough to continue submitting more.

I think it's often a matter of developers not wanting to (and/or being politically unable to) venture into what they consider the sysadmin's domain. Take the way-too-common case of apps that make the client wait while it does housekeeping. Why isn't this in a cron job? One reason is maybe this is KewlOSSBlogWikiPackage and it's simpler to say \"just untar the package under htdocs and you're done\" instead of saying \"also, unpack these scripts in a non-servable area and set them up to run hourly, but not all at the same time; stagger them a little. And run them with the same UID your web server is running as\". But we end up with a lot of apps that (badly) reimplement basic tools their OS ships with in the first place.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083327\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1d7a7610cb0f02de44be3c4186f82ac3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083327\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-28T21:23:06\">2008-07-28T21:23:06</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I wonder if you're still setting the bar too high for low-priority connections.

    "body": "This is a blog post I've had simmering in my brainmeats for well over a year or two.  I'm suddenly inspired to break blog-radio-silence and get it out of my head.\r\n\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/let-the-microblogs-bloom\">Let the microblogs bloom - RussellBeattie.com</a>:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Once this is widely accepted (and I'm sure there are many that would argue with me), the thing that will separate these types of services won't be whether they stay up (ala Twitter), but how fast your subscription messages are updated. Some services might be smaller or offer more features but not update as quickly whereas others will pride themselves on being as close to real-time as possible. The key is that it's all about messaging, not publishing. (Oh, and this also facilitates federation as well, but that's another topic).</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSee also: <a href=\"http://randomfoo.net/blog/id/4182\">Rearchitecting Twitter: Brought to You By the 17th Letter of the Alphabet - random($foo)</a>\r\n\r\nOne of the problems it seems most modern web apps face is the tendency to want to do everything all at once, and all in the same code that responds directly to a user.  Because, while you're in there building a user interface, it's *easy* to implement everything else that needs to happen in that same UI module or library.\r\n\r\nSomeone wants to post a bookmark?  Someone wants to post a message?  Well, of course you want the system to cross-reference and deliver that new piece of User Generated Content through every permutation of tag, recipient, keyword, and notification channel supported by your system.  \r\n\r\n**But**, do you *really* have to do everything all at once—while the person who generated that content is tapping his or her foot, waiting for the web interface to respond with feedback?  Are all of these things immediately vital to the person watching the browser spin, *right now*?  \r\n\r\nNo.  Your user wants to get on with things.  He or she wants to see the submitted content get accepted and, as feedback and confirmation, see it reflected in a personal view immediately.  Does it matter—to *this person*, at *this moment*—whether it shows up *simultaneously* in a friend's inbox, the public timeline, a global tag page, or even an RSS or Atom feed?\r\n\r\nAgain, no, simultaneity doesn't really matter—because no human beings actually appreciate it.  Instead, imagine a ripple effect of concentric social and attention contexts with associated people spreading out from the original submission.  (This probably rates the creation of a diagram someday.)  \r\n\r\n* To make the person who's submitting something happy, offer feedback visible in their own personal context in under 50-200 milliseconds.  (That is, less than half-a-second at worst, in people terms.)\r\n\r\n* The next person to delight is someone following the first person's published content—and humanly speaking, delays of *tens of thousands of milliseconds* can be acceptable here.  (That is, 1-10 seconds at worst, in people terms.)\r\n\r\n* Finally, you can start worrying about strangers, allowing the content to propagate to tag pages, keyword tracking pages, and other public views—and I'd assert that delays of *hundreds of thousands of milliseconds* are acceptable here.  (That is, 1-2 minutes at worst, in people terms.)\r\n\r\nThe idea here is that the social structure can help you scale, while still delighting people.  Even with these delays, the system is still better at getting the word out than the original content creator would be at notifying all the others involved with an out-of-band system like IM or email.  And that's at worst—on most good days, all the delays should tend to be on the order of seconds or less.\r\n\r\nAnd how do you do all of this?  Use queues.  Sure, the original submission of content can and should be done all at once—just enough to get the content into the user's collection.  Then, queue a job for further processing and get out of the way.  In fact, just queue one job from the user interface—the processor of *that* queue can then queue further jobs for all the other individual processing tasks that are likely susceptible to plenty of parallel processing and horizontal scaling.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the original user creating content has been thanked for their submission and life goes on.  In fact, their life may include going on to submit many more pieces of content in rapid succession, thanks to your delightfully responsive web user interface.  \r\n\r\nAnd, in the end, that's really the purpose of a web-based content creation interface—accepting something as quickly as possible to make the user happy enough to continue submitting more.  The other part of the user interface, retrieval, serves simply to get the original content distributed as fast as can be reasonably expected.\r\n\r\nNow, preparing for fast retrieval is another story.  The flip side to processing queues are message inboxes—expect content duplicated everywhere and fetched simply, rather than using cleverly expressed SQL joins that bring a system to its knees.  But, that's another post altogether. :)\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083313\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://fatalerror.in\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=15516fd23722eeca86b8ea91738eea4b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://fatalerror.in\">shyam</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083313\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-04T21:12:46\">2008-07-04T21:12:46</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Interesting bits of conversation happening all over the place regarding queues and the irony of it all - the much maligned Java has had workqueues since the early days.</p>\n\n<p>What everyone will learn, rather painfully in in cases like Twitter, is that all data is not created, consumed or processed equally.

I think it's often a matter of developers not wanting to (and/or being politically unable to) venture into what they consider the sysadmin's domain. Take the way-too-common case of apps that make the client wait while it does housekeeping. Why isn't this in a cron job? One reason is maybe this is KewlOSSBlogWikiPackage and it's simpler to say \"just untar the package under htdocs and you're done\" instead of saying \"also, unpack these scripts in a non-servable area and set them up to run hourly, but not all at the same time; stagger them a little. And run them with the same UID your web server is running as\". But we end up with a lot of apps that (badly) reimplement basic tools their OS ships with in the first place.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083327\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1d7a7610cb0f02de44be3c4186f82ac3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083327\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-28T21:23:06\">2008-07-28T21:23:06</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I wonder if you're still setting the bar too high for low-priority connections.

    "html": "<p><em>Update, 30 Sep 2008</em>: </p>\n<p><strong>You don&#39;t want to follow the directions on this page—instead, leave this page and read this:</strong>  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://laconi.ca/darcs/README\">http://laconi.ca/darcs/README</a></p>\n<p>At one point, very early on in Laconica-time, this blog post offered useful information on getting Laconica up and running.  But since then, my time has taken me away from playing with Laconica and thus this guide has fallen far behind.  Hopefully soon I&#39;ll get back around to Laconica hacking, but not today.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m leaving the original text of this post here for posterity, but this is <em>no longer current</em> and following this guide will <em>do more harm than good</em> in confusing you about Laconica installation!</p>\n<p><strong>Again, to learn about getting Laconica up and running, leave this page and read this</strong>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://laconi.ca/darcs/README\">http://laconi.ca/darcs/README</a></p>\n<p>The latest mini-sensations to arrive through my firehoses are <a href=\"http://identi.ca\">identi.ca</a>, a Twitter-clone / microblogging site, and the Open Source software <a href=\"http://laconi.ca\">Laconica</a>, which powers the aforementioned site.</p>\n<p>Having started and neglected two Twitter cloning attempts of my own, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/Cuckoo\">Cuckoo</a> and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/OpenInterocitor\">OpenInterocitor</a>, seeing someone else carry the torch with any modicum of momentum is attractive to me.  So, I spent a little bit last night getting the code running on my own servers, and managed to do it twice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/laconica\">decafbad.com/laconica</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lmorchard.com/laconica\">lmorchard.com/laconica</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>See, the interesting thing promised by <a href=\"http://laconi.ca\">Laconica</a>—and something I wanted in my own clones—is the ability to federate instances of the software.  That is, users on one <a href=\"http://laconi.ca\">Laconica</a>-based site should be able to subscribe to the updates from users on another site, by way of the <a href=\"http://openmicroblogging.org/\">OpenMicroblogging specification</a>.  Although federation isn&#39;t a silver bullet to a web-scale Twitter clone, I do think it&#39;s one of the most important bootstrap steps—but that&#39;s another blog post entirely.</p>\n<p>Thus, since I&#39;d like to see <em>you</em> run a Laconica site (or something like it) for mine to talk to, I figured I&#39;d document how I got the thing running.  My server is running Ubuntu Gutsy, so your mileage may vary.  This is a long one, so check out the how-to after the jump...</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"get-the-laconica-code\">Get the Laconica code</h2>\n<p>I got my copy of the code by using <a href=\"http://darcs.net/\"><code>darcs</code></a>, as described on <a href=\"http://laconi.ca/Main/Source\">the Laconica source page</a>, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install darcs\ndarcs get --partial http://laconi.ca/darcs/</code></pre>\n<p>But, if you can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to use <code>darcs</code> right now, you can <a href=\"http://laconi.ca/laconica-0.4.1.tar.gz\">grab a Laconica tarball</a> to get started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-modules-and-third-party-prerequisites\">Get modules and third-party prerequisites</h2>\n<p>I had already installed PHP and Apache, along with lighttpd, on my server.  But, I found I needed a few more things.  So, here&#39;s a slew of packages you may or may not already have:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 php5-cgi php5-cli php-pear php5-gd php5-mysql</code></pre>\n<p>Next, now that you&#39;ve got PHP and PEAR, you can install some of the PEAR-based prerequisites:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo pear channel-update pear.php.net\nsudo pear install channel://pear.php.net/Validate-0.8.1\nsudo pear install DB_DataObject\nsudo pear install Mail\nsudo pear install Net_SMTP</code></pre>\n<p>After this, there are a few libraries that need to be downloaded by hand.  For this, I created an <code>extlib/</code> directory to keep them in, separate from Laconica&#39;s own <code>lib/</code> which will be subject to updates to the software itself:</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir extlib xfers\ncd xfers\ncurl -O http://openidenabled.com/files/php-openid/packages/php-openid-2.1.1.zip    \ncurl -O http://michelf.com/docs/projets/php-markdown-1.0.1m.zip\ncurl -O http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/php/OAuth.php\ncurl -O http://xmpphp.googlecode.com/files/xmpphp-0.1beta-r21.tar.gz\nunzip php-markdown-1.0.1m.zip\ncp &#39;PHP Markdown 1.0.1m/markdown.php&#39; ../extlib/\nunzip php-openid-2.1.1.zip\ncp -r php-openid-2.1.1/Auth ../extlib/\ncp OAuth.php ../extlib/\ntar -zxf xmpphp-0.1beta-r21.tar.gz\ncp xmpphp/*.php ../extlib/\ncd ..\nrm -rf xfers</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"set-up-mysql-tables\">Set up MySQL tables</h2>\n<p>I&#39;ll assume you already have MySQL installed.  To set up a database for Laconica, I did the following:</p>\n<pre><code>mysql -uroot -p -e &#39;create database laconica&#39;;\nmysql -uroot -p -e &quot;grant all privileges on laconica.* to laconica@localhost identified by &#39;PASSWORD&#39;&quot;;\nmysql -uroot -p laconica &lt; db/laconica.sql</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"configure-laconica\">Configure Laconica</h2>\n<p>So far, I&#39;ve found at least two config files that need tweaking—namely <code>config.php</code> and <code>dataobject.ini</code>.</p>\n<p>The first thing I did to <code>config.php</code> was to add the following at around line 6 to account for my <code>extlib/</code> directory:</p>\n<pre><code>#If you have downloaded libraries in random little places, you\n#can add the paths here\ndefine(&#39;INSTALLDIR&#39;, dirname(__FILE__));\nset_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . INSTALLDIR . &#39;/extlib&#39;);</code></pre>\n<p>The rest of the settings in <code>config.php</code> are somewhat self-explanatory.  These are the ones I changed for my installation:</p>\n<pre><code>$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;name&#39;] = &#39;cafeonica&#39;;\n$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;server&#39;] = &#39;decafbad.com&#39;;\n$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;path&#39;] = &#39;laconica&#39;;\n$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;fancy&#39;] = true;\n$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;theme&#39;] = &#39;stoica&#39;;\n$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;email&#39;] = &#39;l.m.orchard@pobox.com&#39;;\n$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;broughtby&#39;] = &#39;0xDECAFBAD&#39;;\n$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;broughtbyurl&#39;] = &#39;http://decafbad.com/&#39;;\n$config[&#39;db&#39;][&#39;database&#39;] = &#39;mysql://laconica:PASSWORD@localhost/laconica&#39;;\n$config[&#39;db&#39;][&#39;ini_laconica&#39;] = $config[&#39;db&#39;][&#39;schema_location&#39;].&#39;/stoica.ini&#39;;</code></pre>\n<p>After this, I tweaked the first few settings of <code>dataobject.ini</code> to the following: </p>\n<pre><code>database = mysql://laconica:PASSWORD@localhost/laconica \nschema_location = /www/decafbad.com/docs/laconica/classes \nclass_location = /www/decafbad.com/docs/laconica/classes \nrequire_prefix = /www/decafbad.com/docs/laconica/classes/ </code></pre>\n<p>Be sure to substitute your own web server paths and passwords in all the above.  And finally, in order to allow the upload of avatar images, you&#39;ll need to tweak the permissions on the <code>avatar/</code> directory, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo chown -R www-data avatar\nsudo chmod -R ug+rw avatar/</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"configure-web-server\">Configure Web Server</h2>\n<p>There isn&#39;t really much to configure if you&#39;re using Apache.  There&#39;s a file <code>htaccess.sample</code> that needs to be copied to <code>.htaccess</code>—this will put in place all the <code>mod_rewrite</code> rules necessary to support &quot;fancy&quot; URLs.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you&#39;re okay with uglier URLs with query parameters and whatnot, leave <code>.htaccess</code> alone and use <code>$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;fancy&#39;] = false</code> in your <code>config.php</code>.  </p>\n<p>For comparison, here are examples of non-fancy and fancy profile URLs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/laconica/index.php?action=showstream&amp;nickname=lmorchard\">http://decafbad.com/laconica/index.php?action=showstream&amp;nickname=lmorchard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/laconica/lmorchard\">http://decafbad.com/laconica/lmorchard</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One catch to the non-fancy and fancy thing, though—if you start off with non-fancy URLs and later switch to fancy, all of the profiles registered before that switch will appear with non-fancy URLs in the timeline.  This is because the <code>profile</code> table stores the original URLs at registration in the <code>profileurl</code> column.  You could change these if you like, but there be dragons.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configure-lighttpd-for-fancy-urls-optional\">Configure Lighttpd for &quot;fancy&quot; URLs (optional)</h3>\n<p>If you&#39;re like me, though, you&#39;re using something other than Apache for your main web server.  Personally, I just got up and running with <a href=\"http://www.lighttpd.net/\">lighttpd</a> not too long ago.  Alas, that means the <code>.htaccess</code> rewrite rules won&#39;t work directly.  </p>\n<p>Admittedly, I am a novice to configuring <a href=\"http://www.lighttpd.net/\">lighttpd</a>, so the following rules I added to my config could probably use some help:</p>\n<pre><code>url.rewrite-final += (\n    &quot;^/laconica/index.php(.*)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;$0&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=public&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/rss$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=publicrss&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/xrds$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=publicxrds&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/about$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=about&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/contact$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=contact&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/faq$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=faq&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/help$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=help&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/im$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=im&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/openid$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=openid&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/openmublog$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=openmublog&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/privacy$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=privacy&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/source$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=source&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/login$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=login&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/logout$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=logout&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/register$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=register&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/openid(?:\\?(.*)|$)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=openidlogin&amp;$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/remote(?:\\?(.*)|$)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=remotesubscribe&amp;$1&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/subscribe$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=subscribe&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/unsubscribe$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=unsubscribe&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/confirmaddress$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=confirmaddress&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/confirmaddress/(.*)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=confirmaddress&amp;code=$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/recoverpassword$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=recoverpassword&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/recoverpassword/(.*)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=recoverpassword&amp;code=$1&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/settings/avatar$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=avatar&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/settings/password$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=password&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/settings/profile$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=profilesettings&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/settings/openid$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=openidsettings&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/settings/im$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=imsettings&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/notice/new$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=newnotice&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/notice/(\\d+)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=shownotice&amp;notice=$1&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/user/(\\d+)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=userbyid&amp;id=$1&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)/subscriptions$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=subscriptions&amp;nickname=$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)/subscribers$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=subscribers&amp;nickname=$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)/xrds$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=xrds&amp;nickname=$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)/rss$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=userrss&amp;nickname=$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)/all$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=all&amp;nickname=$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)/all/rss$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=allrss&amp;nickname=$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)/foaf$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=foaf&amp;nickname=$1&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=showstream&amp;nickname=$1&quot;\n)</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"thats-it-for-now\">That&#39;s it (for now)</h2>\n<p>And that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for you for now.

However, I have been able to log in via OpenID, so that&#39;s something.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085627\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://pseudopost.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=761b6be3778aefa25a27dbbe3e65b641&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://pseudopost.org/\">Fabian Neumann</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085627\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-03T22:36:12\">2008-07-03T22:36:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Tried to remotely subscribe to you, but no success so far.

After re-compiling PHP on this server etc the error went away.</p>\n<p>Now the error is the inability to connect to the MySQL server?  This with the relevant connection string entries being made in config.php &amp; dataobject.ini?  These settings are definately correct as I am able to connect to the database from the command line copying and pasting the entries from these files.</p>\n<p>However it seems like access is trying to be gained on a \"strange\" port?  Is there some specific place where this has to be configured?  The error I am getting boils down to this: \"nativecode=Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket\"</p>\n<p>Any input regarding this problem would be greatly appreciated!</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085685\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1ff3d26e10560a02cade856bac212ec5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Herman</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085685\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-18T15:14:36\">2008-07-18T15:14:36</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p></p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085686\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.nedrichards.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7998e3215aae5f66f3f9503848e10a53&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.nedrichards.com/\">Nick</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085686\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-23T08:41:39\">2008-07-23T08:41:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Just to note for more recent install 0.4.4 and onwards you need XMP-PHP at least 0.1-r50 or up.

    "body": "*Update, 30 Sep 2008*: \r\n\r\n**You don't want to follow the directions on this page—instead, leave this page and read this:**  \r\n\r\n[http://laconi.ca/darcs/README](http://laconi.ca/darcs/README)\r\n\r\nAt one point, very early on in Laconica-time, this blog post offered useful information on getting Laconica up and running.  But since then, my time has taken me away from playing with Laconica and thus this guide has fallen far behind.  Hopefully soon I'll get back around to Laconica hacking, but not today.\r\n\r\nI'm leaving the original text of this post here for posterity, but this is *no longer current* and following this guide will *do more harm than good* in confusing you about Laconica installation!\r\n\r\n**Again, to learn about getting Laconica up and running, leave this page and read this**:\r\n\r\n[http://laconi.ca/darcs/README](http://laconi.ca/darcs/README)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latest mini-sensations to arrive through my firehoses are [identi.ca](http://identi.ca), a Twitter-clone / microblogging site, and the Open Source software [Laconica][], which powers the aforementioned site.\r\n\r\nHaving started and neglected two Twitter cloning attempts of my own, [Cuckoo](http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/Cuckoo) and [OpenInterocitor](http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/OpenInterocitor), seeing someone else carry the torch with any modicum of momentum is attractive to me.  So, I spent a little bit last night getting the code running on my own servers, and managed to do it twice:\r\n\r\n* [decafbad.com/laconica](http://decafbad.com/laconica)\r\n* [lmorchard.com/laconica](http://lmorchard.com/laconica)\r\n\r\nSee, the interesting thing promised by [Laconica][]—and something I wanted in my own clones—is the ability to federate instances of the software.  That is, users on one [Laconica][]-based site should be able to subscribe to the updates from users on another site, by way of the [OpenMicroblogging specification][openmu].  Although federation isn't a silver bullet to a web-scale Twitter clone, I do think it's one of the most important bootstrap steps—but that's another blog post entirely.\r\n\r\nThus, since I'd like to see *you* run a Laconica site (or something like it) for mine to talk to, I figured I'd document how I got the thing running.  My server is running Ubuntu Gutsy, so your mileage may vary.  This is a long one, so check out the how-to after the jump...\r\n\r\n[lighttpd]: http://www.lighttpd.net/\r\n[openmu]: http://openmicroblogging.org/\r\n[Twitter]: http://twitter.com\r\n[laconica]: http://laconi.ca\r\n[source]: http://laconi.ca/Main/Source\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n## Get the Laconica code\r\n\r\nI got my copy of the code by using [`darcs`](http://darcs.net/), as described on [the Laconica source page][source], like so:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install darcs\r\n    darcs get --partial http://laconi.ca/darcs/\r\n\r\nBut, if you can't or don't want to use `darcs` right now, you can [grab a Laconica tarball](http://laconi.ca/laconica-0.4.1.tar.gz) to get started.\r\n\r\n## Get modules and third-party prerequisites\r\n\r\nI had already installed PHP and Apache, along with lighttpd, on my server.  But, I found I needed a few more things.  So, here's a slew of packages you may or may not already have:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 php5-cgi php5-cli php-pear php5-gd php5-mysql\r\n\r\nNext, now that you've got PHP and PEAR, you can install some of the PEAR-based prerequisites:\r\n\r\n    sudo pear channel-update pear.php.net\r\n    sudo pear install channel://pear.php.net/Validate-0.8.1\r\n    sudo pear install DB_DataObject\r\n    sudo pear install Mail\r\n    sudo pear install Net_SMTP\r\n\r\nAfter this, there are a few libraries that need to be downloaded by hand.  For this, I created an `extlib/` directory to keep them in, separate from Laconica's own `lib/` which will be subject to updates to the software itself:\r\n\r\n    mkdir extlib xfers\r\n    cd xfers\r\n    curl -O http://openidenabled.com/files/php-openid/packages/php-openid-2.1.1.zip    \r\n    curl -O http://michelf.com/docs/projets/php-markdown-1.0.1m.zip\r\n    curl -O http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/php/OAuth.php\r\n    curl -O http://xmpphp.googlecode.com/files/xmpphp-0.1beta-r21.tar.gz\r\n    unzip php-markdown-1.0.1m.zip\r\n    cp 'PHP Markdown 1.0.1m/markdown.php' ../extlib/\r\n    unzip php-openid-2.1.1.zip\r\n    cp -r php-openid-2.1.1/Auth ../extlib/\r\n    cp OAuth.php ../extlib/\r\n    tar -zxf xmpphp-0.1beta-r21.tar.gz\r\n    cp xmpphp/*.php ../extlib/\r\n    cd ..\r\n    rm -rf xfers\r\n\r\n## Set up MySQL tables\r\n\r\nI'll assume you already have MySQL installed.  To set up a database for Laconica, I did the following:\r\n\r\n    mysql -uroot -p -e 'create database laconica';\r\n    mysql -uroot -p -e \"grant all privileges on laconica.* to laconica@localhost identified by 'PASSWORD'\";\r\n    mysql -uroot -p laconica < db/laconica.sql\r\n\r\n## Configure Laconica\r\n\r\nSo far, I've found at least two config files that need tweaking—namely `config.php` and `dataobject.ini`.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I did to `config.php` was to add the following at around line 6 to account for my `extlib/` directory:\r\n\r\n\r\n    #If you have downloaded libraries in random little places, you\r\n    #can add the paths here\r\n    define('INSTALLDIR', dirname(__FILE__));\r\n    set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . INSTALLDIR . '/extlib');\r\n\r\nThe rest of the settings in `config.php` are somewhat self-explanatory.  These are the ones I changed for my installation:\r\n\r\n    $config['site']['name'] = 'cafeonica';\r\n    $config['site']['server'] = 'decafbad.com';\r\n    $config['site']['path'] = 'laconica';\r\n    $config['site']['fancy'] = true;\r\n    $config['site']['theme'] = 'stoica';\r\n    $config['site']['email'] = 'l.m.orchard@pobox.com';\r\n    $config['site']['broughtby'] = '0xDECAFBAD';\r\n    $config['site']['broughtbyurl'] = 'http://decafbad.com/';\r\n    $config['db']['database'] = 'mysql://laconica:PASSWORD@localhost/laconica';\r\n    $config['db']['ini_laconica'] = $config['db']['schema_location'].'/stoica.ini';\r\n\r\nAfter this, I tweaked the first few settings of `dataobject.ini` to the following: \r\n\r\n    database = mysql://laconica:PASSWORD@localhost/laconica \r\n    schema_location = /www/decafbad.com/docs/laconica/classes \r\n    class_location = /www/decafbad.com/docs/laconica/classes \r\n    require_prefix = /www/decafbad.com/docs/laconica/classes/ \r\n\r\nBe sure to substitute your own web server paths and passwords in all the above.  And finally, in order to allow the upload of avatar images, you'll need to tweak the permissions on the `avatar/` directory, like so:\r\n\r\n    sudo chown -R www-data avatar\r\n    sudo chmod -R ug+rw avatar/\r\n\r\n## Configure Web Server\r\n\r\nThere isn't really much to configure if you're using Apache.  There's a file `htaccess.sample` that needs to be copied to `.htaccess`—this will put in place all the `mod_rewrite` rules necessary to support \"fancy\" URLs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you're okay with uglier URLs with query parameters and whatnot, leave `.htaccess` alone and use `$config['site']['fancy'] = false` in your `config.php`.  \r\n\r\nFor comparison, here are examples of non-fancy and fancy profile URLs:\r\n\r\n* http://decafbad.com/laconica/index.php?action=showstream&nickname=lmorchard\r\n* http://decafbad.com/laconica/lmorchard\r\n\r\nOne catch to the non-fancy and fancy thing, though—if you start off with non-fancy URLs and later switch to fancy, all of the profiles registered before that switch will appear with non-fancy URLs in the timeline.  This is because the `profile` table stores the original URLs at registration in the `profileurl` column.  You could change these if you like, but there be dragons.\r\n\r\n### Configure Lighttpd for \"fancy\" URLs (optional)\r\n\r\nIf you're like me, though, you're using something other than Apache for your main web server.  Personally, I just got up and running with [lighttpd][] not too long ago.  Alas, that means the `.htaccess` rewrite rules won't work directly.  \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, I am a novice to configuring [lighttpd][], so the following rules I added to my config could probably use some help:\r\n\r\n    url.rewrite-final += (\r\n        \"^/laconica/index.php(.*)$\" => \"$0\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=public\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/rss$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=publicrss\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/xrds$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=publicxrds\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/about$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=about\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/contact$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=contact\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/faq$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=faq\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/help$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=help\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/im$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=im\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/openid$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=openid\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/openmublog$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=openmublog\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/privacy$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=privacy\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/source$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=source\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/login$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=login\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/logout$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=logout\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/register$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=register\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/openid(?:\\?(.*)|$)$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=openidlogin&$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/remote(?:\\?(.*)|$)$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=remotesubscribe&$1\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/subscribe$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=subscribe\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/unsubscribe$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=unsubscribe\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/confirmaddress$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=confirmaddress\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/confirmaddress/(.*)$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=confirmaddress&code=$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/recoverpassword$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=recoverpassword\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/recoverpassword/(.*)$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=recoverpassword&code=$1\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/settings/avatar$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=avatar\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/settings/password$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=password\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/settings/profile$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=profilesettings\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/settings/openid$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=openidsettings\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/settings/im$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=imsettings\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/notice/new$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=newnotice\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/notice/(\\d+)$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=shownotice&notice=$1\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/user/(\\d+)$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=userbyid&id=$1\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)/subscriptions$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=subscriptions&nickname=$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)/subscribers$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=subscribers&nickname=$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)/xrds$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=xrds&nickname=$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)/rss$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=userrss&nickname=$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)/all$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=all&nickname=$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)/all/rss$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=allrss&nickname=$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)/foaf$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=foaf&nickname=$1\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=showstream&nickname=$1\"\r\n    )\r\n\r\n## That's it (for now)\r\n\r\nAnd that's all I've got for you for now.  At this point, it looks like my two Laconica installs are mostly working.  I've not yet played with the XMPP bot, nor have I been able to see the [OpenMicroblogging][openmu] stuff working with remore subscriptions.  However, I have been able to log in via OpenID, so that's something.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085627\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://pseudopost.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=761b6be3778aefa25a27dbbe3e65b641&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://pseudopost.org/\">Fabian Neumann</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085627\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-03T22:36:12\">2008-07-03T22:36:12</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Tried to remotely subscribe to you, but no success so far.

After re-compiling PHP on this server etc the error went away.</p>\n\n<p>Now the error is the inability to connect to the MySQL server?  This with the relevant connection string entries being made in config.php &amp; dataobject.ini?  These settings are definately correct as I am able to connect to the database from the command line copying and pasting the entries from these files.</p>\n\n<p>However it seems like access is trying to be gained on a \"strange\" port?  Is there some specific place where this has to be configured?  The error I am getting boils down to this: \"nativecode=Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket\"</p>\n\n<p>Any input regarding this problem would be greatly appreciated!</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085685\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1ff3d26e10560a02cade856bac212ec5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Herman</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085685\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-18T15:14:36\">2008-07-18T15:14:36</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p></p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085686\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.nedrichards.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7998e3215aae5f66f3f9503848e10a53&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.nedrichards.com/\">Nick</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085686\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-23T08:41:39\">2008-07-23T08:41:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Just to note for more recent install 0.4.4 and onwards you need XMP-PHP at least 0.1-r50 or up.

    "summary": "<p><em>Update, 30 Sep 2008</em>: </p>\n<p><strong>You don&apos;t want to follow the directions on this page&#x2014;instead, leave this page and read this:</strong>  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://laconi.ca/darcs/README\">http://laconi.ca/darcs/README</a></p>\n<p>At one point, very early on in Laconica-time, this blog post offered useful information on getting Laconica up and running.  But since then, my time has taken me away from playing with Laconica and thus this guide has fallen far behind.  Hopefully soon I&apos;ll get back around to Laconica hacking, but not today.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m leaving the original text of this post here for posterity, but this is <em>no longer current</em> and following this guide will <em>do more harm than good</em> in confusing you about Laconica installation!</p>\n<p><strong>Again, to learn about getting Laconica up and running, leave this page and read this</strong>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://laconi.ca/darcs/README\">http://laconi.ca/darcs/README</a></p>\n<p>The latest mini-sensations to arrive through my firehoses are <a href=\"http://identi.ca\">identi.ca</a>, a Twitter-clone / microblogging site, and the Open Source software <a href=\"http://laconi.ca\">Laconica</a>, which powers the aforementioned site.</p>\n<p>Having started and neglected two Twitter cloning attempts of my own, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/Cuckoo\">Cuckoo</a> and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/OpenInterocitor\">OpenInterocitor</a>, seeing someone else carry the torch with any modicum of momentum is attractive to me.  So, I spent a little bit last night getting the code running on my own servers, and managed to do it twice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/laconica\">decafbad.com/laconica</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lmorchard.com/laconica\">lmorchard.com/laconica</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>See, the interesting thing promised by <a href=\"http://laconi.ca\">Laconica</a>&#x2014;and something I wanted in my own clones&#x2014;is the ability to federate instances of the software.  That is, users on one <a href=\"http://laconi.ca\">Laconica</a>-based site should be able to subscribe to the updates from users on another site, by way of the <a href=\"http://openmicroblogging.org/\">OpenMicroblogging specification</a>.  Although federation isn&apos;t a silver bullet to a web-scale Twitter clone, I do think it&apos;s one of the most important bootstrap steps&#x2014;but that&apos;s another blog post entirely.</p>\n<p>Thus, since I&apos;d like to see <em>you</em> run a Laconica site (or something like it) for mine to talk to, I figured I&apos;d document how I got the thing running.  My server is running Ubuntu Gutsy, so your mileage may vary.  This is a long one, so check out the how-to after the jump...</p>\n"

    "html": "<p>So, it&#39;s getting to the end of my third week at Mozilla, and <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/planet/2008/05/19/planet-addition-class-of-5192008/\">I&#39;m a part</a> of <a href=\"http://planet.mozilla.org/\">the Planet now</a>—hooray!  Having gotten a membership into that club, I feel like I should start making some noise about what I&#39;m doing at work.  Having stayed mostly quiet about day job affairs thus far in my career, it&#39;s going to take a bit to get used to a place as open as Mozilla.</p>\n<p>Being a noob, I haven&#39;t started anything earthshaking yet.  But, I have gotten a couple of starter bugs thrown my way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395271\">Bug 395271</a> - Use memcache to cache output pages for non logged in users </p>\n<p>  <a href=\"http://wiki.mozilla.org/Sumo\">SUMO</a> is <a href=\"http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Firefox+Support+Home+Page\">support.mozilla.org</a>, a humongous and mostly volunteer-driven support effort for Mozilla products.  I&#39;ve never really been to the site before myself, so this bug is an iceberg-tip intro to the effort for me.  I&#39;m wading chest deep into <a href=\"http://tikiwiki.org\">TikiWiki</a> and plonking memcached into the middle of it to try to make knowledge base wiki page views a lot less expensive.</p>\n<p>  Oh, and the source I&#39;m working on is <a href=\"https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/sumo/\">in subversion</a>.  Weird.  Like, you could go look at it right now, and tell me <a href=\"http://viewvc.svn.mozilla.org/vc?view=rev&amp;revision=13362\">how bad</a> <a href=\"http://viewvc.svn.mozilla.org/vc?view=rev&amp;revision=13504\">my code</a> is.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=419647\">Bug 419647</a> - Add a sexy theme browser</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"http://wiki.mozilla.org/Update:Remora\">AMO</a> is <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/\">addons.mozilla.org</a>, another humongous effort to support distribution and developers of extensions for Firefox and more.  This is a site I&#39;ve been to plenty of times, but never as an extension developer.  And so, here&#39;s another opportunity to start wading into the deep end.  For this particular bug, the goal is to work up a presentation of themes more easily scanned visually.</p>\n<p>  Nothing checked into SVN for this one yet, so you&#39;ll have to withhold ridicule for a little bit yet.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#39;m really working on squashing my nerd fanboy tendencies.  Because, I remember downloading the original Mozilla Open Source release, staying home from work to compile it on Windows with Visual Studio, and getting just one or two page views out of it before it fell over and caught on fire.  And of course, long before that, I remember using the original lizard in monochrome on a Sun workstation, freaking out over everything and looking up <a href=\"http://umsa7.ums.edu/~anniebw/earth2/\">Earth 2</a> episode guides.</p>\n<p>So, although I&#39;m kinda subdued in general right now—subdued as in beat about the head and shoulders—I&#39;ve got a serious amount of breathlessness going on while trying hard to just kinda be nonchalant.  :)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086914\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://megalar.890m.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=750dbcc9cc192bfad37a3daa4edf139e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://megalar.890m.com/blog/\">megalar</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086914\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-05-24T14:08:35\">2008-05-24T14:08:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I hope this place is a good fit for you dude.

    "body": "So, it's getting to the end of my third week at Mozilla, and [I'm a part][part] of [the Planet now][planet]—hooray!  Having gotten a membership into that club, I feel like I should start making some noise about what I'm doing at work.  Having stayed mostly quiet about day job affairs thus far in my career, it's going to take a bit to get used to a place as open as Mozilla.\r\n\r\nBeing a noob, I haven't started anything earthshaking yet.  But, I have gotten a couple of starter bugs thrown my way:\r\n\r\n* [Bug 395271][b2] - Use memcache to cache output pages for non logged in users \r\n\r\n    [SUMO][] is [support.mozilla.org][support], a humongous and mostly volunteer-driven support effort for Mozilla products.  I've never really been to the site before myself, so this bug is an iceberg-tip intro to the effort for me.  I'm wading chest deep into [TikiWiki][] and plonking memcached into the middle of it to try to make knowledge base wiki page views a lot less expensive.\r\n\r\n    Oh, and the source I'm working on is [in subversion][sumosvn].  Weird.  Like, you could go look at it right now, and tell me [how bad][bad1] [my code][bad2] is.\r\n\r\n[bad1]: http://viewvc.svn.mozilla.org/vc?view=rev&revision=13362\r\n[bad2]: http://viewvc.svn.mozilla.org/vc?view=rev&revision=13504\r\n[tikiwiki]: http://tikiwiki.org\r\n[sumosvn]: https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/sumo/\r\n[sumo]: http://wiki.mozilla.org/Sumo\r\n[support]: http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Firefox+Support+Home+Page\r\n\r\n* [Bug 419647][b1] - Add a sexy theme browser\r\n\r\n    [AMO][] is [addons.mozilla.org][addons], another humongous effort to support distribution and developers of extensions for Firefox and more.  This is a site I've been to plenty of times, but never as an extension developer.  And so, here's another opportunity to start wading into the deep end.  For this particular bug, the goal is to work up a presentation of themes more easily scanned visually.\r\n\r\n    Nothing checked into SVN for this one yet, so you'll have to withhold ridicule for a little bit yet.\r\n\r\nI'm really working on squashing my nerd fanboy tendencies.  Because, I remember downloading the original Mozilla Open Source release, staying home from work to compile it on Windows with Visual Studio, and getting just one or two page views out of it before it fell over and caught on fire.  And of course, long before that, I remember using the original lizard in monochrome on a Sun workstation, freaking out over everything and looking up [Earth 2][e2] episode guides.\r\n\r\nSo, although I'm kinda subdued in general right now—subdued as in beat about the head and shoulders—I've got a serious amount of breathlessness going on while trying hard to just kinda be nonchalant.  :)\r\n\r\n[e2]: http://umsa7.ums.edu/~anniebw/earth2/\r\n[amo]: http://wiki.mozilla.org/Update:Remora\r\n[addons]: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/\r\n[b1]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=419647\r\n[b2]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395271\r\n[part]: http://blog.mozilla.com/planet/2008/05/19/planet-addition-class-of-5192008/\r\n[planet]: http://planet.mozilla.org/\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086914\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://megalar.890m.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=750dbcc9cc192bfad37a3daa4edf139e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://megalar.890m.com/blog/\">megalar</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086914\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-05-24T14:08:35\">2008-05-24T14:08:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I hope this place is a good fit for you dude.

    "html": "<p>I use <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> to write for this blog, and I don&#39;t think I could write much online without it.  (Of course, that&#39;s not saying much lately—but nevermind that for now.)</p>\n<p>Although I do appreciate all the effort put toward enhancing <code>&lt;textareas&gt;</code> on the web, I&#39;m not a fan of WYSIWYG writing interfaces.  They hide too much in an effort to make things &quot;easy&quot;—yet, for all that ease, they make me miss <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordperfect#Reveal_codes\">Reveal Codes</a> in WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  Hell, I wish I could write books using <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> instead of Microsoft Word.  (And, yeah, I know that some O&#39;Reilly authors have written books in <a href=\"http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html\">perlpod</a>—but that&#39;s a bit too far even for me.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think the issue is that it really bothers me to compose HTML in the same mental context as writing prose—HTML is too much like code.  Coding and <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prosing\">prosing</a> are two different modes for me, and I don&#39;t like the constant context-switching thrash.  (And, yes, I&#39;ve just learned today that <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prosing\">prosing</a> is a word.)</p>\n<p>So, apropos of this, there&#39;s been a <a href=\"http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2520\">thread</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001116.html\">blogophere</a> lately <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2008/05/a-million-littl.html\">naysaying</a> non-HTML, wiki-text, and <a href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/SmartAscii\">smart-ASCII</a> formats.  They seem to be mostly attacking the idea from a technical perspective, where it&#39;s more like a usability problem to me.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t see where Jeff Atwood&#39;s &quot;<a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001116.html\">Is HTML a Humane Markup Language?</a>&quot; makes the case for HTML as humane.  As far as I can tell, the inhumanity is that markup schemes are harder to keep track of than HTML.  Yet, there&#39;s a kind of coder macho thing going on there that&#39;s decidedly not humane—i.e. real programmers should be fine with getting their eyes poked by angle brackets on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I do agree that some of these formats are horrendous.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page\">Wikipedia markup</a> and <a href=\"http://www.phpbb.com/community/faq.php?mode=bbcode\">BBCode</a> are nasty in particular.  Though, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page\">Wikipedia markup</a> at least has some semantic purpose beyond HTML.  But, I can&#39;t follow from that to seeing how the whole idea is wrong.  </p>\n<p>I used <a href=\"http://textile.thresholdstate.com/\">Textile</a> for awhile, and then switched to <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> when it came around.  At this point, I&#39;ve been using <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> since it came out in 2004.  I now plug <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> into everything I can where I&#39;ll be doing any writing.  There&#39;s a version of <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> in just about every language known to the web these days—you can even find <a href=\"http://attacklab.net/showdown/\">Markdown in Javascript</a>.  I write notes to myself in <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a>, even when there&#39;s no URL to view it.  I&#39;ve even used <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> semi-consciously when writing by hand in a paper journal.</p>\n<p>Perhaps I&#39;ve said too much.  </p>\n<p>Anyway, I&#39;ll expend as many brain cells as it takes to not need to compose raw HTML by hand in the course of writing.  As it happens, I can usually just use <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a>, so those brain cells were spent years ago.  And thus, I feel I&#39;ve saved more brain cells in avoiding coding/<a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prosing\">prosing</a> thrash. So, it could just be personal preference, but I agree with the reasons why <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhyDoesntWikiDoHtml\">the original wiki doesn&#39;t use HTML</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085294\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://megalar.890m.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=750dbcc9cc192bfad37a3daa4edf139e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://megalar.890m.com/blog/\">megalar</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085294\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-05-18T22:19:07\">2008-05-18T22:19:07</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I couldn't agree more on this dude.

    "body": "I use [Markdown][] to write for this blog, and I don't think I could write much online without it.  (Of course, that's not saying much lately—but nevermind that for now.)\r\n\r\nAlthough I do appreciate all the effort put toward enhancing `<textareas>` on the web, I'm not a fan of WYSIWYG writing interfaces.  They hide too much in an effort to make things \"easy\"—yet, for all that ease, they make me miss [Reveal Codes][rc] in WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  Hell, I wish I could write books using [Markdown][] instead of Microsoft Word.  (And, yeah, I know that some O'Reilly authors have written books in [perlpod][]—but that's a bit too far even for me.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think the issue is that it really bothers me to compose HTML in the same mental context as writing prose—HTML is too much like code.  Coding and [prosing][] are two different modes for me, and I don't like the constant context-switching thrash.  (And, yes, I've just learned today that [prosing][] is a word.)\r\n\r\nSo, apropos of this, there's been a [thread][amd1] in the [blogophere][amd2] lately [naysaying][amd3] non-HTML, wiki-text, and [smart-ASCII][smartascii] formats.  They seem to be mostly attacking the idea from a technical perspective, where it's more like a usability problem to me.\r\n\r\nI don't see where Jeff Atwood's \"[Is HTML a Humane Markup Language?][ja]\" makes the case for HTML as humane.  As far as I can tell, the inhumanity is that markup schemes are harder to keep track of than HTML.  Yet, there's a kind of coder macho thing going on there that's decidedly not humane—i.e. real programmers should be fine with getting their eyes poked by angle brackets on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I do agree that some of these formats are horrendous.  [Wikipedia markup][wpm] and [BBCode][] are nasty in particular.  Though, [Wikipedia markup][wpm] at least has some semantic purpose beyond HTML.  But, I can't follow from that to seeing how the whole idea is wrong.  \r\n\r\nI used [Textile][] for awhile, and then switched to [Markdown][] when it came around.  At this point, I've been using [Markdown][] since it came out in 2004.  I now plug [Markdown][] into everything I can where I'll be doing any writing.  There's a version of [Markdown][] in just about every language known to the web these days—you can even find [Markdown in Javascript][showdown].  I write notes to myself in [Markdown][], even when there's no URL to view it.  I've even used [Markdown][] semi-consciously when writing by hand in a paper journal.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I've said too much.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll expend as many brain cells as it takes to not need to compose raw HTML by hand in the course of writing.  As it happens, I can usually just use [Markdown][], so those brain cells were spent years ago.  And thus, I feel I've saved more brain cells in avoiding coding/[prosing][] thrash. So, it could just be personal preference, but I agree with the reasons why [the original wiki doesn't use HTML][wiki].\r\n\r\n[ja]: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001116.html\r\n[wiki]: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhyDoesntWikiDoHtml\r\n[perlpod]: http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html\r\n[smartascii]: http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/SmartAscii\r\n[textile]: http://textile.thresholdstate.com/ \r\n[markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\r\n[bbcode]: http://www.phpbb.com/community/faq.php?mode=bbcode\r\n[wpm]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page\r\n[amd3]: http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2008/05/a-million-littl.html\r\n[amd2]: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001116.html\r\n[amd1]: http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2520\r\n[shdh]: http://superhappydevhouse.org/SuperHappyDevHouse25\r\n[rc]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordperfect#Reveal_codes\r\n[prosing]: http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prosing\r\n[showdown]: http://attacklab.net/showdown/\r\n[yak shaving]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yak_shaving\r\n[bucket]: http://decafbad.com/bucket/\r\n\r\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085294\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://megalar.890m.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=750dbcc9cc192bfad37a3daa4edf139e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://megalar.890m.com/blog/\">megalar</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085294\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-05-18T22:19:07\">2008-05-18T22:19:07</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I couldn't agree more on this dude.

But, I'm hopeful that things are going to get a lot better very soon.\r\n\r\n[jasmine]: http://transplanted-californian.blogspot.com/2007/10/star-jasmine.html\r\n[shdh]: http://superhappydevhouse.org/\r\n[house]: http://www.flickr.com/photos/missadroit/2493000246/\r\n[twit]: http://twitter.com/lmorchard\r\n[leavey]: http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/787565793\r\n[moz]: http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/804009957\r\n[people]: http://people.mozilla.org/~lorchard/\r\n[book]: http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047038459X.html\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086631\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.entish.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8b70790f2d886a2568bf35f10a3af9b1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.entish.org/\">Will Fitzgerald</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086631\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-05-15T01:27:47\">2008-05-15T01:27:47</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Welcome back to the Midwest!

    "html": "<p>When I first <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/02/14/ooooah\">created this blog</a> back in February 2002, I was talking to myself and I knew it.  But, that didn&#39;t really matter: Since becoming <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital\">newly digital in 1983</a>, I&#39;d already spent years plugging away at personal projects big and small, frequently abandoned, talking to myself all the time anyway.</p>\n<p>So, blogging, I thought, would give me a real or imagined motivation to finish some projects.  The difference between writing a blog and working alone in the basement, is that there&#39;s a chance someone outside my physical neighborhood might catch a few mutterings and knock on my door to have a chat—rather than just walking a little faster and avoiding my house in the future, like the local neighbors usually do when I find myself really going off on a tear.  </p>\n<p>Thus if someone, somewhere showed interest in things I was doing and describing—then maybe I might just stick with one or two of them long enough to declare a version worthy of a <a href=\"http://freshmeat.net/\">freshmeat.net</a> release.  (It&#39;s been awhile, but that used to be my gold standard for Real Software.)</p>\n<p>However, I&#39;ve realized that occasional visitors won&#39;t magically help me finish software.  I&#39;ve come to accept that I&#39;m far too much a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiast</a> to release much at v1.0 without a paycheck or some other substantial incentive.  But that&#39;s okay, because tinkering with unfinished software still seems to attract occasional visitors.  And, where there are visitors, there are contacts and conversations.  And, where there are contacts and conversations, there&#39;s learning and fulfillment—two of my favorite things.</p>\n<p>Apropos of conversations, though, I&#39;ve gone <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/10/13/throttling-the-basement-hacker\">habitually quiet</a> in the past few years.  I&#39;ve gone from claiming that <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/03/hacking-is-my-world-of-warcraft\">hacking is my World of Warcraft</a> to just getting <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/06/world-of-warcraft-is-my-world-of-warcraft\">sucked into WoW proper</a>.  It&#39;s gotten to the point that I&#39;ve wondered what I ever talked about here.  Yeah, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/12/21/my-semi-annual-blogger-navel-gazing-post\">I&#39;ve written this kind of entry</a> <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/07/14/dork-funk\">many times before</a>—but I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s gotten better.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m really out of the flow here, but I don&#39;t think giving it up is the right thing to do.  I&#39;ve been doing some retrospection (in volumes <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/04/26/greatest-hits-vol-1-the-tinkery-bits\">one</a> and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/04/26/greatest-hits-vol-2-the-babble-bits\">two</a>), and have been reviewing what I&#39;ve done here.  I&#39;m getting some ideas, and hoping I can get myself back into acting on them.</p>\n<p>It might be a little while before I produce anything on a regular basis, because I&#39;m currently working on a third book, entitled <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047038459X.html\">Professional JavaScript Frameworks</a>.  And, on top of that, I&#39;ve got <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/787565793\">a bit of a transition going on in my life right now</a>.  </p>\n<p>But, waking things up here is something I&#39;d like to make part of that transition.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087645\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://mpwilson.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e79b5fc97a604e3b1b41c158e9d61267&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://mpwilson.com/\">Mike Wilson</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087645\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-04-27T03:45:47\">2008-04-27T03:45:47</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Interesting.

The difference between writing a blog and working alone in the basement, is that there's a chance someone outside my physical neighborhood might catch a few mutterings and knock on my door to have a chat—rather than just walking a little faster and avoiding my house in the future, like the local neighbors usually do when I find myself really going off on a tear.  \r\n\r\nThus if someone, somewhere showed interest in things I was doing and describing—then maybe I might just stick with one or two of them long enough to declare a version worthy of a [freshmeat.net][fm] release.  (It's been awhile, but that used to be my gold standard for Real Software.)\r\n\r\nHowever, I've realized that occasional visitors won't magically help me finish software.  I've come to accept that I'm far too much a [serial enthusiast][serial] to release much at v1.0 without a paycheck or some other substantial incentive.  But that's okay, because tinkering with unfinished software still seems to attract occasional visitors.  And, where there are visitors, there are contacts and conversations.  And, where there are contacts and conversations, there's learning and fulfillment—two of my favorite things.\r\n\r\nApropos of conversations, though, I've gone [habitually quiet][quiet] in the past few years.  I've gone from claiming that [hacking is my World of Warcraft][hackwow] to just getting [sucked into WoW proper][wowwow].  It's gotten to the point that I've wondered what I ever talked about here.  Yeah, [I've written this kind of entry][navel1] [many times before][navel2]—but I don't feel it's gotten better.\r\n\r\nI'm really out of the flow here, but I don't think giving it up is the right thing to do.  I've been doing some retrospection (in volumes [one](http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/04/26/greatest-hits-vol-1-the-tinkery-bits) and [two](http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/04/26/greatest-hits-vol-2-the-babble-bits)), and have been reviewing what I've done here.  I'm getting some ideas, and hoping I can get myself back into acting on them.\r\n\r\nIt might be a little while before I produce anything on a regular basis, because I'm currently working on a third book, entitled [Professional JavaScript Frameworks][profjs].  And, on top of that, I've got [a bit of a transition going on in my life right now](http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/787565793).  \r\n\r\nBut, waking things up here is something I'd like to make part of that transition.\r\n\r\n[navel2]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/07/14/dork-funk\r\n[navel1]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/12/21/my-semi-annual-blogger-navel-gazing-post\r\n\r\n[quiet]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/10/13/throttling-the-basement-hacker\r\n[wowwow]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/06/world-of-warcraft-is-my-world-of-warcraft\r\n[hackwow]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/03/hacking-is-my-world-of-warcraft\r\n[grok]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/06/13/oooaih\r\n[linkbacks]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/07/oooadb\r\n[bookmarks]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/01/24/ooocii\r\n[REST]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/17/oooaob\r\n[moblogging]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/09/07/ooobgo\r\n[social]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/03/04/oooodd\r\n[feedauto]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/31/oooago\r\n[newlydigital]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital\r\n[transactor]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/25/i-was-a-pre-teen-transactor-author-wannabe-and-still-am\r\n[fm]: http://freshmeat.net/\r\n[serial]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\r\n[start]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/02/14/ooooah\r\n[sort]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/23/oooaae\r\n[backlinks]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/18/oooaoe\r\n[backlinks2]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/19/oooaoi\r\n[hackingfeedsout]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/13/hacking-rss-and-atom-is-out\r\n[hackingfeeds]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20\r\n[hackingdelout]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/09/hacking-delicious-is-out-and-about\r\n[hackingdel]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470037857/0xdecafbad01-20/104-2713105-4524705\r\n[moblogging]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/09/07/ooobgo\r\n[profjs]: http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047038459X.html\r\n[yahoomojo]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/03/18/briefly-briefly\r\n\r\n[bookmarks]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/01/24/ooocii\r\n[REST]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/17/oooaob\r\n[moblogging]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/09/07/ooobgo\r\n[social]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/03/04/oooodd\r\n[newlydigital]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital\r\n[transactor]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/25/i-was-a-pre-teen-transactor-author-wannabe-and-still-am\r\n[fm]: http://freshmeat.net/\r\n[serial]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\r\n[start]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/02/14/ooooah\r\n[sort]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/23/oooaae\r\n[backlinks]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/18/oooaoe\r\n[backlinks2]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/19/oooaoi\r\n[hackingfeedsout]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/13/hacking-rss-and-atom-is-out\r\n[hackingfeeds]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20\r\n[hackingdelout]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/09/hacking-delicious-is-out-and-about\r\n[hackingdel]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470037857/0xdecafbad01-20/104-2713105-4524705\r\n[moblogging]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/09/07/ooobgo\r\n[profjs]: http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047038459X.html\r\n[yahoomojo]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/03/18/briefly-briefly\r\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087645\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mpwilson.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e79b5fc97a604e3b1b41c158e9d61267&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mpwilson.com/\">Mike Wilson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087645\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-04-27T03:45:47\">2008-04-27T03:45:47</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Interesting.

I've never really quite done anything like that before, though.  Might be too personal, probably a little bit angry, and not entirely rosey.  I don't think that's the sort of thing that fits into most of the writing outlets I've set up for myself so far - excepting maybe my LiveJournal account that's gone mostly unused for the past 5 years or so. Hmm.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:10:41:20AM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\n<p><a name=\"When:12:20:25PM\"></a>I can still see my Dad's ashes on <a href=\"http://johndee.com/ncn/irons_ncn.htm\">the webcam</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:12:20:25PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\n<p><a name=\"When:2:00:10PM\"></a>I suppose this is as good a place as any to dump a few thoughts.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:2:00:10PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\n<p><a name=\"When:1:07:46PM\"></a>Watching a <a href=\"http://www.videosift.com/video/Richard-Dawkins-responds-to-Jerry-Falwells-students\">video of Richard Dawkins responding to questions after a talk</a>, and I just had to note one of the things he said of religion and religious rituals: \"What is comforting and what is true are two different things.\"&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:07:46PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a name=\"When:1:18:56PM\"></a>I suppose, in a way, I've wired myself to find comfort in truth - even if it's superficially uncomfortable.  I'm not perfect in this, but I do experience quite a large degree of painful cognitive dissonance when I catch me trying to fool myself.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:18:56PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\n<p><a name=\"When:1:13:18PM\"></a>In the wake of my Dad's passing, I'm working through a lot of things without the benefit of comforting religion.  A priest spoke at the funeral whose words fell on me like bad pop-up and banner ads for the Catholic Jesus - propagandic, mildly annoying, and not at all relevant to me or my situation.  I didn't even bother to sing along or mouth a single \"amen\" like I might to be polite in other settings.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:13:18PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\n<p><a name=\"When:1:13:32PM\"></a>Instead, the things in which I find closure, if not solace, is to do quite a lot of mindful reflection on my life, my Dad's life, and how the patterns of my life have come about in reflection - or in recoil - of his.  I try to find the gifts for which I owe him thanks, and the things of which I should be wary and protect myself.  This, to me, is where to find the meaning in his passing.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:13:32PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\n<p><a name=\"When:1:20:57PM\"></a>Dad died of heart disease at the age of 55 - only 24 years ahead of me.  He didn't take his medicine or follow doctors' advice very well.  After the divorce, he retreated to a cottage in the woods hours north from most family and old friends.  He lived with a gorgeous dog and a girlfriend who was apparently alcoholic and a chronic smoker.  He left a lot of things he wanted to do undone - a bucket of fishing poles for retirement forgotten in a basement, for example.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:20:57PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\n<p><a name=\"When:1:55:32PM\"></a>I've been making a lot of calls for doctor appointments this week and inventorying the buckets of fishing poles in my basements.

Seeking greater habits of mindfulness today.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:9:54:38AM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"When:10:41:20AM\"></a>Thinking sometime I'd like to blog about my Dad's passing, pen some kind of brain dump beyond the scattered thoughts I've been recording in my journal.  I've never really quite done anything like that before, though.  Might be too personal, probably a little bit angry, and not entirely rosey.  I don't think that's the sort of thing that fits into most of the writing outlets I've set up for myself so far - excepting maybe my LiveJournal account that's gone mostly unused for the past 5 years or so. Hmm.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:10:41:20AM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"When:12:20:25PM\"></a>I can still see my Dad's ashes on <a href=\"http://johndee.com/ncn/irons_ncn.htm\">the webcam</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:12:20:25PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"When:2:00:10PM\"></a>I suppose this is as good a place as any to dump a few thoughts.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:2:00:10PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"When:1:07:46PM\"></a>Watching a <a href=\"http://www.videosift.com/video/Richard-Dawkins-responds-to-Jerry-Falwells-students\">video of Richard Dawkins responding to questions after a talk</a>, and I just had to note one of the things he said of religion and religious rituals: \"What is comforting and what is true are two different things.\"&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:07:46PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"When:1:18:56PM\"></a>I suppose, in a way, I've wired myself to find comfort in truth - even if it's superficially uncomfortable.  I'm not perfect in this, but I do experience quite a large degree of painful cognitive dissonance when I catch me trying to fool myself.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:18:56PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"When:1:13:18PM\"></a>In the wake of my Dad's passing, I'm working through a lot of things without the benefit of comforting religion.  A priest spoke at the funeral whose words fell on me like bad pop-up and banner ads for the Catholic Jesus - propagandic, mildly annoying, and not at all relevant to me or my situation.  I didn't even bother to sing along or mouth a single \"amen\" like I might to be polite in other settings.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:13:18PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"When:1:13:32PM\"></a>Instead, the things in which I find closure, if not solace, is to do quite a lot of mindful reflection on my life, my Dad's life, and how the patterns of my life have come about in reflection - or in recoil - of his.  I try to find the gifts for which I owe him thanks, and the things of which I should be wary and protect myself.  This, to me, is where to find the meaning in his passing.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:13:32PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"When:1:20:57PM\"></a>Dad died of heart disease at the age of 55 - only 24 years ahead of me.  He didn't take his medicine or follow doctors' advice very well.  After the divorce, he retreated to a cottage in the woods hours north from most family and old friends.  He lived with a gorgeous dog and a girlfriend who was apparently alcoholic and a chronic smoker.  He left a lot of things he wanted to do undone - a bucket of fishing poles for retirement forgotten in a basement, for example.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:20:57PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"When:1:55:32PM\"></a>I've been making a lot of calls for doctor appointments this week and inventorying the buckets of fishing poles in my basements.
