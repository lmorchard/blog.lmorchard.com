    "summary": "<p><i>\nOh hey, look! It's another blog post—and this one\n<a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/html5-drag-and-drop/\">is cross-posted on hacks.mozilla.com</a>.\nI won't say this is the start of a renewed blogging habit, but let's see what happens.\n</i></p>\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\ndl { margin-left: 2em; }\ndd { margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.25em; }\n</style>\n<div id=\"introduction\">\n    <p>\n        Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions\n        afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it\n        allows users to pair the selection of an object with the\n        execution of an action, often including a second object in the\n        operation.  It's a simple yet powerful UI concept used to\n        support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),\n        and even the creation of link relationships.\n    </p><p>\n        Since it's so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web\n        applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first\n        offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although\n        <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, and\n        <code>mouseup</code> made it possible, the implementation has been\n        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,\n        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,\n        there's a challenge to find the subject of the drop when\n        the interaction is completed.\n    </p><p>\n\n</p><pre><code>    Of course, that doesn't prevent most modern JavaScript\n    frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and\n    throwing in some flourishes while they're at it.  But, wouldn't\n    it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and\n    drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification \n    &lt;a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd\"&gt;section on new drag-and-drop events&lt;/a&gt;, and \n    &lt;a target=\"_new\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop\"&gt;Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation&lt;/a&gt; of those events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    If you want to jump straight to the code, I've put together \n    &lt;a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html\"&gt;some simple demos&lt;/a&gt; \n    of the new events.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n    I've even scratched an itch of my own and\n    built &lt;a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html\"&gt;the beginnings of an outline editor&lt;/a&gt;,\n    where every draggable element is also a drop target—of which\n    there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something\n    that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past\n    while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from \n    &lt;a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop\"&gt;a GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;\n    I've created especially for this article—which continues after the jump.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n",

    "summary": "<p>In my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/08/31/ubiquity-cracks-open-personal-mashup-tinkering\" title=\"Ubiquity cracks open personal mashup tinkering\">last post</a>, I got all fluffy about how cool <a href=\"http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/\">Ubiquity</a> is but didn't share any code to prove the point.  As it happens, I have come up with at least one useful command that I'm starting to use habitually in posting bookmarks to Delicious.  You can <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/UbiquityCommands/\">subscribe to my command</a> or <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/hg/UbiquityCommands/file/tip/delicious.ubiq.js\">check out the full source</a>—this post will serve as a dissection of the thing.  Since this will be fairly lengthy, follow along after the jump.</p>\n<p>Oh, and it's been awhile since I posted something this in-depth around here, so feel free to let me know how this first draft works.  And, bug reports and patches are of course welcome.</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p><em>Update, 30 Sep 2008</em>: </p>\n<p><strong>You don't want to follow the directions on this page—instead, leave this page and read this:</strong>  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://laconi.ca/darcs/README\">http://laconi.ca/darcs/README</a></p>\n<p>At one point, very early on in Laconica-time, this blog post offered useful information on getting Laconica up and running.  But since then, my time has taken me away from playing with Laconica and thus this guide has fallen far behind.  Hopefully soon I'll get back around to Laconica hacking, but not today.</p>\n<p>I'm leaving the original text of this post here for posterity, but this is <em>no longer current</em> and following this guide will <em>do more harm than good</em> in confusing you about Laconica installation!</p>\n<p><strong>Again, to learn about getting Laconica up and running, leave this page and read this</strong>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://laconi.ca/darcs/README\">http://laconi.ca/darcs/README</a></p>\n<p>The latest mini-sensations to arrive through my firehoses are <a href=\"http://identi.ca\">identi.ca</a>, a Twitter-clone / microblogging site, and the Open Source software <a href=\"http://laconi.ca\">Laconica</a>, which powers the aforementioned site.</p>\n<p>Having started and neglected two Twitter cloning attempts of my own, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/Cuckoo\">Cuckoo</a> and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/OpenInterocitor\">OpenInterocitor</a>, seeing someone else carry the torch with any modicum of momentum is attractive to me.  So, I spent a little bit last night getting the code running on my own servers, and managed to do it twice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/laconica\">decafbad.com/laconica</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lmorchard.com/laconica\">lmorchard.com/laconica</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>See, the interesting thing promised by <a href=\"http://laconi.ca\">Laconica</a>—and something I wanted in my own clones—is the ability to federate instances of the software.  That is, users on one <a href=\"http://laconi.ca\">Laconica</a>-based site should be able to subscribe to the updates from users on another site, by way of the <a href=\"http://openmicroblogging.org/\">OpenMicroblogging specification</a>.  Although federation isn't a silver bullet to a web-scale Twitter clone, I do think it's one of the most important bootstrap steps—but that's another blog post entirely.</p>\n<p>Thus, since I'd like to see <em>you</em> run a Laconica site (or something like it) for mine to talk to, I figured I'd document how I got the thing running.  My server is running Ubuntu Gutsy, so your mileage may vary.  This is a long one, so check out the how-to after the jump...</p>\n",
