In past visits to the Pico-8 scene, using just the web player, the significance of this hadn&#39;t quite dawned on me. </p>\n<h2 id=\"view-source\">View Source</h2>\n<img class=\"lazyload inset right\" data-src=\"/uploads/2016/poke-the-mongo/PICO-8_21.gif\" />\n\n<p>With the full package, you can hit <kbd>Esc</kbd> on any running cartridge and tinker with the source - <strong>not entirely unlike View Source and Developer Tools on the Web</strong>. And, <a href=\"/2015/08/07/web-awesome/\">you know I&#39;m a fan of that</a>.</p>\n<p>Or, to strum my nostalgia strings, it&#39;s like when I would pour over listings in 1980s computer magazines to see how those games worked. In fact, there have even been a few issues of a <a href=\"https://sectordub.itch.io/pico-8-fanzine-1\">Pico-8 Zine</a> with code and interviews. </p>\n<p>After I&#39;d poked at a dozen-odd carts and browsed through the zines, I thought I should give it a go myself. I didn&#39;t know much Lua, but it&#39;s an easy language to pick up. Simpler than JavaScript, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/766870582856081409\">but it beats revisiting BASIC</a> - even my old favorite <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simons%27_BASIC\">Simons&#39; BASIC</a>, which has a surprising amount in common with this modern day system. </p>\n<p>I also decided to be masochistic by coding directly on the PocketC.H.I.P. Later, when my fingers vetoed further typing on metal domes, I plugged in a USB keyboard. As things got more complex, I broke down and bought the main edition of Pico-8 to move to a bigger screen. It&#39;s not Free Software or even Free-as-in-Beer. But, <a href=\"http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php#getpico8\">it&#39;s only US$14.99</a>. That single purchase gave me access to versions for my PC, Mac, and Linux machines. </p>\n<p>(There&#39;s even a Raspberry PI version - which gives me ideas for building a Pico-8 multicade machine. But, that&#39;s a story for another post.)</p>\n<p>On my PC, I discovered <code>.p8</code> cartridges are just text files I can edit in Vim! With that revelation, <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/Pico-8-Carts\">I created a GitHub repo</a> and started saving my work there.

It&#39;s great to get a fresh dose of that old school awe from seeing a clever hack make the machine do something it wasn&#39;t meant to do.
