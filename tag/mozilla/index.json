React offers a solid foundation for composing the editor. Personally, I really like working with <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/web/lib/components/SavedThemeSelector/index.js\">stateless functional components</a> - they’re kind of what tipped me over into becoming a React convert a few years ago. I’m also a terrible visual designer with weak CSS-fu - but <a href=\"https://simonsmith.io/using-webpack-to-build-react-components-and-their-assets/\">using Webpack to bundle assets from per-component directories</a> makes it easier for teammates to step in where I fall short.</p>\n<img id=\"thumbnail\" title=\"An early snapshot of Themer in development\" alt=\"An early snapshot of Themer in development\" src=\"image_1.png\" />\n\n<p>Further under the hood, Redux offers a clean way to <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/lib/store.js\">manage theme data and UI state</a>. Adding <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/tree/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/web/lib/components/UndoRedoButtons\">undo &amp; redo buttons</a> is easy, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/omnidan/redux-undo/\">redux-undo</a>. And, by way of some <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/web/index.js#L52\">simple Redux middleware</a>, I was able to easily add a hook to push every theme changes into the browser via the add-on.</p>\n<p>The website is just a static page - there’s no real server-side application. When you save a theme, <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/web/lib/storage.js\">it ends up in your browser’s localStorage</a>.

Rather than come up with a bespoke scheme, I use <a href=\"https://github.com/masotime/json-url\">this json-url module</a> to compress JSON and encode it as Base64, which makes for a long URL but not unreasonably so. This approach enables folks to simply copy &amp; paste a URL to share a theme they’ve made.

(Can you tell <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/2018/03/01/sio2pi/\">I’ve had retro computers on the mind</a>, lately?)</p>\n<p>Add-ons in Firefox can install <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts\">content scripts</a> that access content and data on web pages. Content scripts can communicate with the parent add-on <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts#Communicating_with_background_scripts\">by way of a message port</a>. They can also communicate with a web page <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts#Communicating_with_the_web_page\">by way of synthetic events</a>. Put the two together, and you’ve got <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/extension/contentScript.js\">a messaging channel</a> between a web page and an add-on in Firefox.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s the heart of <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/extension/contentScript.js\">that messaging bridge</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { CHANNEL_NAME } from &quot;../lib/constants&quot;;\n\n// Relay backend port messages to content\nlet port;\n\nfunction connect() {\n  port = browser.runtime.connect({ name: CHANNEL_NAME });\n  port.onDisconnect.addListener(() =&gt; {\n    port = null;\n    reconnect();\n  });\n  port.onMessage.addListener(message =&gt; {\n    window.postMessage({ ...message, channel: `${CHANNEL_NAME}-web` }, &quot;*&quot;);\n  });\n}\n\n// Relay content messages to backend port if the channel name matches\n// (Not a security feature so much as a noise filter)\nwindow.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;, event =&gt; {\n  if (\n    port &amp;&amp;\n    event.source === window &amp;&amp;\n    event.data &amp;&amp;\n    event.data.channel === `${CHANNEL_NAME}-extension`\n  ) {\n    port.postMessage({ ...event.data, location: window.location.href });\n  }\n});\n\nconnect();</code></pre>\n<p>With this approach, the web page doesn’t actually gain access to any Firefox APIs. <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/extension/background.js#L23\">The add-on can decide what to do with with messages it receives</a>. If the page sends invalid data or asks to do something not supported - nothing happens. Here&#39;s a snippet of that logic from the extension:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const messageListener = port =&gt; message =&gt; {\n  let theme;\n  switch (message.type) {\n    case &quot;fetchTheme&quot;:\n      log(&quot;fetchTheme&quot;);\n      fetchTheme().then(({ theme: currentTheme }) =&gt;\n        port.postMessage({ type: &quot;fetchedTheme&quot;, theme: currentTheme })\n      );\n      break;\n    case &quot;setTheme&quot;:\n      theme = normalizeTheme(message.theme);\n      log(&quot;setTheme&quot;, theme);\n      storeTheme({ theme });\n      applyTheme({ theme });\n      break;\n    case &quot;ping&quot;:\n      port.postMessage({ type: &quot;pong&quot; });\n      break;\n    default:\n      log(&quot;unexpected message&quot;, message);\n  }\n};</code></pre>\n<p>And here&#39;s a peek at <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/web/index.js#L52\">that Redux middleware I mentioned earlier</a> which updates the add-on from the web:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const postMessage = (type, data = {}) =&gt;\n  window.postMessage(\n    { ...data, type, channel: `${CHANNEL_NAME}-extension` },\n    &quot;*&quot;\n  );\n\nconst updateExtensionThemeMiddleware = ({ getState }) =&gt; next =&gt; action =&gt; {\n  const returnValue = next(action);\n  const meta = action.meta || {};\n  if (!meta.skipAddon &amp;&amp; themeChangeActions.includes(action.type)) {\n    postMessage(&quot;setTheme&quot;, { theme: selectors.theme(getState()) });\n  }\n  return returnValue;\n};</code></pre>\n<p>The add-on can also restrict the set of pages from which it will accept messages: We <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/webpack.extension.js#L55\">hardcode the URL for the theme editor</a> into the add-on’s content script configuration at build time, which means no other web page should be able to ask the add-on to alter the theme in Firefox.</p>\n<h2 id=\"add-on-detection-is-hard\">Add-on detection is hard</h2>\n<img class=\"inset wide right\" src=\"loader.png\" title=\"The loading overlay that appears until the editor is visually stable\" />\n\n<p>There is a wrinkle to the relationship between website and add-on, though: A normal web page cannot detect whether or not a particular add-on has been installed. All the page can do is send a message. If the add-on responds, then we know the add-on is available.</p>\n<p>Proving a negative, however, is impossible: the web page can’t know for sure that the addon is *not *available. Responses to asynchronous messages take time - not necessarily a long time, but more than zero time. </p>\n<p>If the page sends a message and doesn’t get a response, that doesn’t mean the add-on is missing. It could just mean that the add-on is taking awhile to respond. So, we have to render the theme editor such that it starts off by assuming the add-on is not installed. If the add-on shows up, minutes or milliseconds later, the page can update itself to reflect the new state of things.</p>\n<p>Left as-is, you’d see several flashes of color and elements on the page move as things settle. That seems unpleasant and possibly confusing, so we came up with a loading spinner: When the page loads, it displays the spinner and a timer starts. If that timer expires, we consider things ready and reveal the editor. But, if there’s any change to the Redux store while that timer is running, we restart the clock.</p>\n<p>This is the gist of what that code does:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const unsubscribeLoader = store.subscribe(() =&gt; {\n  if (selectors.loaderDelayExpired(store.getState())) {\n    // State settled down long enough for timer to expire - stop listening.\n    unsubscribeLoader();\n  } else {\n    // Reset the timer again.\n    startLoaderDelay();\n  }\n});\n\n// Utility to (re)start up a timer to dismiss the loading indicator\nlet loaderTimer = null;\nfunction startLoaderDelay() {\n  if (loaderTimer) {\n    clearTimeout(loaderTimer);\n  }\n  loaderTimer = setTimeout(\n    () =&gt; store.dispatch(actions.ui.setLoaderDelayExpired(true)),\n    LOADER_DELAY_PERIOD\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Early changes to the store are driven by things like decoding a shared theme and responses from the add-on. Again, these are asynchronous and unpredictable. The timer duration is an arbitrary guess I made that seems to feel right. It’s a dirty hack, but it seems like a good enough effort for now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-npm-scripts-and-multiple-webpack-configs\">Using npm scripts and multiple Webpack configs</h2>\n<p>One of the things that has worked nicely on this project is building everything in parallel with a single npm command. You can <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/tree/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05#get-started\">clone the repo and kick things off for development</a> with a simple <code>npm install &amp;&amp; npm start</code> dance.</p>\n<p>The add-on and the site both use Webpack. There’s <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/webpack.common.js\">a shared config</a> as a base and then specific configurations with tweaks for <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/webpack.web.js\">the site</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/webpack.extension.js\">the add-on</a>. So, we want to run two separate instances of Webpack to build everything, watch files, and host the dev server.</p>\n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all\">npm-run-all</a> comes in: It’s a CLI tool that lets you run multiple npm scripts. I used to use gulp to orchestrate this sort of thing, but <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all\">npm-run-all</a> lets me arrange it all <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts\">in <code>package.json</code></a>. It would be fine if this just enabled running scripts in series. But, npm-run-all also lets you run scripts* in parallel<em>. The cherry on top is that [this parallelization works on Linux, OS X, *and Windows</em>](<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all#%EF%B8%8F-motivation\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all#%EF%B8%8F-motivation</a>).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">&quot;scripts&quot;: {\n  &quot;start&quot;: &quot;npm-run-all --parallel server watch:extension watch:lint&quot;,\n  &quot;server&quot;: &quot;cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack-dev-server --config webpack.web.js&quot;,\n  &quot;watch&quot;: &quot;npm-run-all --parallel watch:*&quot;,\n  &quot;watch:web&quot;: &quot;cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack --watch --progress --colors --config webpack.web.js&quot;,\n  &quot;watch:extension&quot;: &quot;cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack --watch --progress --colors --config webpack.extension.js&quot;,\n  &quot;watch:lint&quot;: &quot;onchange -p -v \\&quot;src/**/*.js\\&quot; -- npm run lint&quot;,\n  &quot;lint&quot;: &quot;eslint --color .&quot;,\n},</code></pre>\n<p>In past years, Windows support might have been an abstract novelty for me. But, in recent months, I’ve switched from Apple hardware to a PC laptop. I’ve found the new <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10\">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> to be essential to that switch. But, sometimes it’s nice to just fire up a Node.js dev environment directly in PowerShell - <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all\">npm-run-all</a> lets me (and you) do that!</p>\n<p>So, <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/package.json#L12\">the start script in our package.json</a> is able to fire up both Webpack processes for the site and add-on. It can also <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/package.json#L17\">start a file watcher to run linting</a> and tests (when we have them) alongside. That simplifies using everything in a single shell window across platforms. <a href=\"https://decafbad.com/2011/06/os-webdev-vm/slides.html#1\">I used to lean on Vagrant or Docker to offer something &quot;simple&quot; to folks interested in contributing to a project</a>. But, though virtual machines and containers can hide apparent complexity in development, it’s hard to beat just running things in node on the native OS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"help-us-make-themes-more-fun\">Help us make themes more fun!</h2>\n<p>We’re launching this experiment soon. And, though it only makes limited use of the new theme APIs for now, we’re hoping that the web-based editor and ease of sharing makes it fun &amp; worth playing with. We’ve got some ideas on what to add over the course of the experiment and hope to get more from the community. </p>\n<p>Whether you can offer code, give feedback, participate in discussions, or just let us watch how you use something - everyone has something valuable to offer. In fact, one of <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Test_Pilot/mission\">the overarching goals of Test Pilot</a> is to expand channels of contribution for folks interested in helping us build Firefox.</p>\n<p>As with all Test Pilot experiments, we’ll be watching how folks use this stuff as input for what happens next. We also encourage participation in our <a href=\"https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/test-pilot\">Discourse forums</a>. And finally, the project itself is <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Themer\">open source on Github</a> and open to pull requests. </p>\n<p>In the meantime, start collecting color swatches for your own theme. Personally, I might try my hand at <a href=\"https://draculatheme.com/\">a Dracula theme</a> or maybe raid my Vim config directory for some inspiration.</p>\n",

React offers a solid foundation for composing the editor. Personally, I really like working with [stateless functional components](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/web/lib/components/SavedThemeSelector/index.js) - they’re kind of what tipped me over into becoming a React convert a few years ago.

Though we plan to move to a Mozilla-owned production server on launch, I’ve been [deploying](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/package.json#L29) builds to [GitHub Pages](https://mozilla.github.io/Themer/) during development.\n\nAnother interesting feature of the website is that we encode themes as a parameter in the URL. Rather than come up with a bespoke scheme, I use [this json-url module](https://github.com/masotime/json-url) to compress JSON and encode it as Base64, which makes for a long URL but not unreasonably so. This approach enables folks to simply copy & paste a URL to share a theme they’ve made.

I’ve also been able to work this into the location bar with the HTML5 History API and [Redux middleware](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/web/index.js#L61). The browser location represents the current theme, while back & forward buttons double as undo & redo.\n\n## Add-ons can be expansion cartridges\n\n[<img title=\"The Turbo Chameleon 64 cartridge adds many new capabilities to a Commodore 64\" class=\"inset wide right\" src=\"chameleon_housing_small.jpg\" />](http://www.syntiac.com/chameleon.html)\n\n[The companion add-on](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/tree/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/extension) is also built [using Webpack](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/webpack.extension.js) and acts as an [expansion cartridge](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Simons%27_BASIC) for the theme editor on the website. (Can you tell [I’ve had retro computers on the mind](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2018/03/01/sio2pi/), lately?)\n\nAdd-ons in Firefox can install [content scripts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts) that access content and data on web pages. Content scripts can communicate with the parent add-on [by way of a message port](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts#Communicating_with_background_scripts). They can also communicate with a web page [by way of synthetic events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts#Communicating_with_the_web_page). Put the two together, and you’ve got [a messaging channel](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/extension/contentScript.js) between a web page and an add-on in Firefox.\n\nHere's the heart of [that messaging bridge](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/extension/contentScript.js):\n\n```javascript\nimport { CHANNEL_NAME } from \"../lib/constants\";\n\n// Relay backend port messages to content\nlet port;\n\nfunction connect() {\n  port = browser.runtime.connect({ name: CHANNEL_NAME });\n  port.onDisconnect.addListener(() => {\n    port = null;\n    reconnect();\n  });\n  port.onMessage.addListener(message => {\n    window.postMessage({ ...message, channel: `${CHANNEL_NAME}-web` }, \"*\");\n  });\n}\n\n// Relay content messages to backend port if the channel name matches\n// (Not a security feature so much as a noise filter)\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\", event => {\n  if (\n    port &&\n    event.source === window &&\n    event.data &&\n    event.data.channel === `${CHANNEL_NAME}-extension`\n  ) {\n    port.postMessage({ ...event.data, location: window.location.href });\n  }\n});\n\nconnect();\n```\n\nWith this approach, the web page doesn’t actually gain access to any Firefox APIs. [The add-on can decide what to do with with messages it receives](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/extension/background.js#L23). If the page sends invalid data or asks to do something not supported - nothing happens. Here's a snippet of that logic from the extension:\n\n```javascript\nconst messageListener = port => message => {\n  let theme;\n  switch (message.type) {\n    case \"fetchTheme\":\n      log(\"fetchTheme\");\n      fetchTheme().then(({ theme: currentTheme }) =>\n        port.postMessage({ type: \"fetchedTheme\", theme: currentTheme })\n      );\n      break;\n    case \"setTheme\":\n      theme = normalizeTheme(message.theme);\n      log(\"setTheme\", theme);\n      storeTheme({ theme });\n      applyTheme({ theme });\n      break;\n    case \"ping\":\n      port.postMessage({ type: \"pong\" });\n      break;\n    default:\n      log(\"unexpected message\", message);\n  }\n};\n```\n\nAnd here's a peek at [that Redux middleware I mentioned earlier](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/src/web/index.js#L52) which updates the add-on from the web:\n\n```javascript\nconst postMessage = (type, data = {}) =>\n  window.postMessage(\n    { ...data, type, channel: `${CHANNEL_NAME}-extension` },\n    \"*\"\n  );\n\nconst updateExtensionThemeMiddleware = ({ getState }) => next => action => {\n  const returnValue = next(action);\n  const meta = action.meta || {};\n  if (!meta.skipAddon && themeChangeActions.includes(action.type)) {\n    postMessage(\"setTheme\", { theme: selectors.theme(getState()) });\n  }\n  return returnValue;\n};\n```\n\nThe add-on can also restrict the set of pages from which it will accept messages: We [hardcode the URL for the theme editor](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/webpack.extension.js#L55) into the add-on’s content script configuration at build time, which means no other web page should be able to ask the add-on to alter the theme in Firefox.\n\n## Add-on detection is hard\n\n<img class=\"inset wide right\" src=\"loader.png\" title=\"The loading overlay that appears until the editor is visually stable\" />\n\nThere is a wrinkle to the relationship between website and add-on, though: A normal web page cannot detect whether or not a particular add-on has been installed. All the page can do is send a message. If the add-on responds, then we know the add-on is available.\n\nProving a negative, however, is impossible: the web page can’t know for sure that the addon is *not *available. Responses to asynchronous messages take time - not necessarily a long time, but more than zero time. \n\nIf the page sends a message and doesn’t get a response, that doesn’t mean the add-on is missing. It could just mean that the add-on is taking awhile to respond. So, we have to render the theme editor such that it starts off by assuming the add-on is not installed. If the add-on shows up, minutes or milliseconds later, the page can update itself to reflect the new state of things.\n\nLeft as-is, you’d see several flashes of color and elements on the page move as things settle. That seems unpleasant and possibly confusing, so we came up with a loading spinner: When the page loads, it displays the spinner and a timer starts. If that timer expires, we consider things ready and reveal the editor. But, if there’s any change to the Redux store while that timer is running, we restart the clock.\n\nThis is the gist of what that code does:\n\n```javascript\nconst unsubscribeLoader = store.subscribe(() => {\n  if (selectors.loaderDelayExpired(store.getState())) {\n    // State settled down long enough for timer to expire - stop listening.\n    unsubscribeLoader();\n  } else {\n    // Reset the timer again.\n    startLoaderDelay();\n  }\n});\n\n// Utility to (re)start up a timer to dismiss the loading indicator\nlet loaderTimer = null;\nfunction startLoaderDelay() {\n  if (loaderTimer) {\n    clearTimeout(loaderTimer);\n  }\n  loaderTimer = setTimeout(\n    () => store.dispatch(actions.ui.setLoaderDelayExpired(true)),\n    LOADER_DELAY_PERIOD\n  );\n}\n```\n\nEarly changes to the store are driven by things like decoding a shared theme and responses from the add-on. Again, these are asynchronous and unpredictable. The timer duration is an arbitrary guess I made that seems to feel right. It’s a dirty hack, but it seems like a good enough effort for now.\n\n## Using npm scripts and multiple Webpack configs\n\nOne of the things that has worked nicely on this project is building everything in parallel with a single npm command. You can [clone the repo and kick things off for development](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/tree/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05#get-started) with a simple `npm install && npm start` dance.\n\nThe add-on and the site both use Webpack. There’s [a shared config](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/webpack.common.js) as a base and then specific configurations with tweaks for [the site](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/webpack.web.js) and [the add-on](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/webpack.extension.js). So, we want to run two separate instances of Webpack to build everything, watch files, and host the dev server.\n\nThis is where [npm-run-all](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all) comes in: It’s a CLI tool that lets you run multiple npm scripts. I used to use gulp to orchestrate this sort of thing, but [npm-run-all](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all) lets me arrange it all [in `package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts). It would be fine if this just enabled running scripts in series. But, npm-run-all also lets you run scripts* in parallel*. The cherry on top is that [this parallelization works on Linux, OS X, *and Windows*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all#%EF%B8%8F-motivation).\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\": \"npm-run-all --parallel server watch:extension watch:lint\",\n  \"server\": \"cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack-dev-server --config webpack.web.js\",\n  \"watch\": \"npm-run-all --parallel watch:*\",\n  \"watch:web\": \"cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack --watch --progress --colors --config webpack.web.js\",\n  \"watch:extension\": \"cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack --watch --progress --colors --config webpack.extension.js\",\n  \"watch:lint\": \"onchange -p -v \\\"src/**/*.js\\\" -- npm run lint\",\n  \"lint\": \"eslint --color .\",\n},\n```\n\nIn past years, Windows support might have been an abstract novelty for me. But, in recent months, I’ve switched from Apple hardware to a PC laptop. I’ve found the new [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to be essential to that switch. But, sometimes it’s nice to just fire up a Node.js dev environment directly in PowerShell - [npm-run-all](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all) lets me (and you) do that!\n\nSo, [the start script in our package.json](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/package.json#L12) is able to fire up both Webpack processes for the site and add-on. It can also [start a file watcher to run linting](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer/blob/5cdcb7e15d64934f0e71521512c74337dc58fa05/package.json#L17) and tests (when we have them) alongside. That simplifies using everything in a single shell window across platforms. [I used to lean on Vagrant or Docker to offer something \"simple\" to folks interested in contributing to a project](https://decafbad.com/2011/06/os-webdev-vm/slides.html#1). But, though virtual machines and containers can hide apparent complexity in development, it’s hard to beat just running things in node on the native OS.\n\n## Help us make themes more fun!\n\nWe’re launching this experiment soon. And, though it only makes limited use of the new theme APIs for now, we’re hoping that the web-based editor and ease of sharing makes it fun & worth playing with. We’ve got some ideas on what to add over the course of the experiment and hope to get more from the community. \n\nWhether you can offer code, give feedback, participate in discussions, or just let us watch how you use something - everyone has something valuable to offer. In fact, one of [the overarching goals of Test Pilot](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Test_Pilot/mission) is to expand channels of contribution for folks interested in helping us build Firefox.\n\nAs with all Test Pilot experiments, we’ll be watching how folks use this stuff as input for what happens next. We also encourage participation in our [Discourse forums](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/test-pilot). And finally, the project itself is [open source on Github](https://github.com/mozilla/Themer) and open to pull requests. \n\nIn the meantime, start collecting color swatches for your own theme. Personally, I might try my hand at [a Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/) or maybe raid my Vim config directory for some inspiration.\n\n[modeline]: # ( vim: set wrap linebreak nolist wrapmargin=5 syntax=markdown textwidth=78 formatoptions-=t: )\n",

Mostly because I&#39;ve been busy and lazy and <a href=\"/2016/08/31/yak-shaving-habits/\">busily shaving yaks</a>.</p>\n<p>But, there have been big things afoot lately, and I figured they were worth writing about - if only because they&#39;re invisible, behind-the-scenes things that nonetheless took a lot of work to accomplish.</p>\n<h2 id=\"be-prepared---but-for-what\">Be prepared - but for what?</h2>\n<p>When we started building Test Pilot last summer, we based the server-side on Django &amp; PostgreSQL. We had assumptions about the future: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>We&#39;d need to collect measurements from experiments. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We thought experiments would need some active server-side resources provided by the mothership.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We&#39;d need to manage user profiles &amp; preferences, so we required sign-in with a Firefox Account. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A year later, these assumptions didn&#39;t quite pan out: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Rather than reinvent the wheel by collecting &amp; analyzing measurements ourselves, we took advantage of Google Analytics and the efforts of <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Telemetry\">the Firefox Telemetry team</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We found it&#39;s best to stay out of the way of teams building Test Pilot experiments - let them manage their own services as necessary, rather than be tied to the delivery cadence of the core project.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The sign-in requirement turned away many potential users. But, we didn&#39;t need accounts to facilitate experiment participation anyway. Our metrics are anonymous and a Firefox add-on manages opt-in.</p>\n<p>Accounts ended up being private data we had to keep secure, but only used for email notifications. We have better ways to manage email subscriptions across Mozilla - so one less wheel to reinvent!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"didnt-need-that-server-anyway\">Didn&#39;t need that server anyway</h2>\n<p>There was just one last reason to use Django &amp; PostgreSQL on Test Pilot: A web-based content management system to update the site without heavyweight server deployments &amp; database migrations. </p>\n<p>But, wait a minute: If the other reasons for a server dropped away - why do we need complex deployments?</p>\n<p>Furthermore, why maintain content <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/database-antipattern\">in a database</a> at all?</p>\n<p>The whole Test Pilot team knows their way around text editors and GitHub - so let&#39;s make that our CMS. We can <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/frontend/tasks/pages.js\">bake the whole site</a> from <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/tree/master/content-src/experiments\">flat files</a>. Deployment is <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/docs/development/deployment.md#producing-a-static-build\">running a build script</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/circle.yml#L71\">uploading the result</a> to a web server. We get revision control &amp; collaboration along with the rest of the project. And as a security bonus, we stop shipping the tools to change the site along with the deployed site itself.</p>\n<p>None of this is revolutionary. Aaron Swartz&#39;s &quot;<a href=\"http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000404\">Bake, Don&#39;t Fry</a>&quot; is over 14 years old: Why fry up a new web page for every visit when you can pre-bake the whole site ahead of time? I used <a href=\"http://blosxom.sourceforge.net/\">Bloxsom</a> back in the day and <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/20/static-blog-generation-with-gulp/\">Gulp bakes this blog now</a>. Static site generators <a href=\"https://www.staticgen.com/\">are numerous &amp; popular</a> - GitHub itself offers <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/\">GitHub Pages</a> powered by <a href=\"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll\">Jekyll</a>.</p>\n<p>It sounds obvious in retrospect, but it took awhile to realize our site could be stripped down to so little. We assumed we needed all those moving parts - or would need them someday. But, it appears that we can get away with being nearly serverless. And if someday a feature requires more, we can stand up some loosely-coupled microservices - or better yet, find that another team at Mozilla has already solved the problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-show-must-go-on\">The show must go on</h2>\n<p>But, having realized all of this, we couldn&#39;t just burn down the site and start over. Because we&#39;re working on a vehicle in motion, we&#39;ve been doing this in increments over the summer: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A couple of months ago, <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/issues/1035\">we removed the Firefox Accounts requirement</a> and then <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/issues/1034\">deleted the user data</a> once we were sure we weren&#39;t going back.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We switched data sources for displaying the number of folks participating in experiments from our own Django API to <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/issues/1039\">a Telemetry-based resource</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I wrote a task to <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/frontend/tasks/content.js#L22\">import content from the current Django API</a>. Then, I wrote <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/frontend/tasks/content.js#L16\">a task to generate JSON</a> from those imported files - a direct static replacement for the Django API.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Next, I implemented <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/testpilot/experiments/views.py#L50\">a feature flag in Django</a> to substitute static JSON for content from the database. Thus, we can start managing content in YAML now, maintaining our current infrastructure until we work out a new stripped-down deployment process.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Soon, we&#39;ll be able to update the site by pushing to the appropriate branch on GitHub. We&#39;ve got <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/frontend/tasks/pages.js\">tasks to generate stub pages</a> for all the front end app routes. We&#39;re also looking into enforcing a requirement to <a href=\"http://micropipes.com/blog//2016/08/31/signing-your-commits-on-github-with-a-gpg-key/\">sign our commits and tags</a> on the way to release.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>After that, <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/issues/1306\">we plan to go even further with static site generation</a>. Test Pilot is currently a single page app that pulls content from JSON. But, we can do better by pre-rendering those HTML pages in our build process ahead of time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What&#39;s next?</h2>\n<p>There&#39;s a funny thing about all of this: If we&#39;re successful, no one visiting the site should notice anything different. We&#39;re developing some new features &amp; experiments - but all this work to rid our infrastructure of Django &amp; PostgreSQL should ideally be a non-event for anyone visiting the site. This is the least glamorous sort of work one occasionally has to do on a software project - change everything, but don&#39;t break anything.</p>\n<p>The real benefit will be that we&#39;re able to do a lot of things faster and more easily. For instance, there are now fewer places that need changes to display a new piece of information on a page. We don&#39;t have to monitor as many third-party dependencies - <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/issues/1116\">which we weren&#39;t doing very well to begin with</a>.</p>\n<p>Our development stack shrinks from Docker containers with Django &amp; PostgreSQL &amp; Node.js - down to just Node.js v6.2.0. <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/docs/development/quickstart.md\">The whole system has gotten simpler and more direct</a>.</p>\n<p>But, wait, there&#39;s more: Along with totally changing our server-side infrastructure, <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/issues/1307\">we&#39;ve also rewritten the front end of the site to switch from Ampersand to React &amp; Redux</a>. It should make static site generation easier. It&#39;s also eased development on a handful of new features in the past week or so.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s a big deal - and another thing that, in retrospect, seems more obvious now than it did a year ago.

We're moving away from Django and PostgreSQL, and it's been a bit of a journey.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/tp-header.png\" />\n\n<nav role=\"navigation\" class=\"table-of-contents\"></nav>\n\nI've been working on [Firefox Test Pilot][testpilot] for over a year, but I haven't written about it here before now. Mostly because I've been busy and lazy and [busily shaving yaks](/2016/08/31/yak-shaving-habits/).\n\nBut, there have been big things afoot lately, and I figured they were worth writing about - if only because they're invisible, behind-the-scenes things that nonetheless took a lot of work to accomplish.\n\n## Be prepared - but for what?\n\nWhen we started building Test Pilot last summer, we based the server-side on Django & PostgreSQL. We had assumptions about the future: \n\n* We'd need to collect measurements from experiments. \n\n* We thought experiments would need some active server-side resources provided by the mothership.\n\n* We'd need to manage user profiles & preferences, so we required sign-in with a Firefox Account. \n\nA year later, these assumptions didn't quite pan out: \n\n* Rather than reinvent the wheel by collecting & analyzing measurements ourselves, we took advantage of Google Analytics and the efforts of [the Firefox Telemetry team][telemetry].\n\n* We found it's best to stay out of the way of teams building Test Pilot experiments - let them manage their own services as necessary, rather than be tied to the delivery cadence of the core project.\n\n* The sign-in requirement turned away many potential users. But, we didn't need accounts to facilitate experiment participation anyway. Our metrics are anonymous and a Firefox add-on manages opt-in.\n  \n  Accounts ended up being private data we had to keep secure, but only used for email notifications. We have better ways to manage email subscriptions across Mozilla - so one less wheel to reinvent!\n\n## Didn't need that server anyway\n\nThere was just one last reason to use Django & PostgreSQL on Test Pilot: A web-based content management system to update the site without heavyweight server deployments & database migrations. \n\nBut, wait a minute: If the other reasons for a server dropped away - why do we need complex deployments?\n\nFurthermore, why maintain content [in a database][database] at all?\n\nThe whole Test Pilot team knows their way around text editors and GitHub - so let's make that our CMS. We can [bake the whole site][sitebake] from [flat files][]. Deployment is [running a build script][buildscript] and [uploading the result][uploadweb] to a web server. We get revision control & collaboration along with the rest of the project. And as a security bonus, we stop shipping the tools to change the site along with the deployed site itself.\n\nNone of this is revolutionary. Aaron Swartz's \"[Bake, Don't Fry][baked]\" is over 14 years old: Why fry up a new web page for every visit when you can pre-bake the whole site ahead of time? I used [Bloxsom][] back in the day and [Gulp bakes this blog now][gulp]. Static site generators [are numerous & popular][staticgen] - GitHub itself offers [GitHub Pages][pages] powered by [Jekyll][].\n\nIt sounds obvious in retrospect, but it took awhile to realize our site could be stripped down to so little. We assumed we needed all those moving parts - or would need them someday. But, it appears that we can get away with being nearly serverless. And if someday a feature requires more, we can stand up some loosely-coupled microservices - or better yet, find that another team at Mozilla has already solved the problem.\n\n## The show must go on\n\nBut, having realized all of this, we couldn't just burn down the site and start over. Because we're working on a vehicle in motion, we've been doing this in increments over the summer: \n\n* A couple of months ago, [we removed the Firefox Accounts requirement][fxareq] and then [deleted the user data][deletedata] once we were sure we weren't going back.\n\n* We switched data sources for displaying the number of folks participating in experiments from our own Django API to [a Telemetry-based resource][counts].\n\n* I wrote a task to [import content from the current Django API][import]. Then, I wrote [a task to generate JSON][generatejson] from those imported files - a direct static replacement for the Django API.\n\n* Next, I implemented [a feature flag in Django][featureflag] to substitute static JSON for content from the database. Thus, we can start managing content in YAML now, maintaining our current infrastructure until we work out a new stripped-down deployment process.\n\n* Soon, we'll be able to update the site by pushing to the appropriate branch on GitHub. We've got [tasks to generate stub pages][stubs] for all the front end app routes. We're also looking into enforcing a requirement to [sign our commits and tags][signreq] on the way to release.\n\n* After that, [we plan to go even further with static site generation][staticsite]. Test Pilot is currently a single page app that pulls content from JSON. But, we can do better by pre-rendering those HTML pages in our build process ahead of time.\n\n## What's next?\n\nThere's a funny thing about all of this: If we're successful, no one visiting the site should notice anything different. We're developing some new features & experiments - but all this work to rid our infrastructure of Django & PostgreSQL should ideally be a non-event for anyone visiting the site. This is the least glamorous sort of work one occasionally has to do on a software project - change everything, but don't break anything.\n\nThe real benefit will be that we're able to do a lot of things faster and more easily. For instance, there are now fewer places that need changes to display a new piece of information on a page. We don't have to monitor as many third-party dependencies - [which we weren't doing very well to begin with][dependencies].\n\nOur development stack shrinks from Docker containers with Django & PostgreSQL & Node.js - down to just Node.js v6.2.0. [The whole system has gotten simpler and more direct][quickstart].\n\nBut, wait, there's more: Along with totally changing our server-side infrastructure, [we've also rewritten the front end of the site to switch from Ampersand to React & Redux][reactrewrite]. It should make static site generation easier. It's also eased development on a handful of new features in the past week or so.\n\nIt's a big deal - and another thing that, in retrospect, seems more obvious now than it did a year ago. But, I'm going to save writing about that for my next post.\n\n[dependencies]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/issues/1116\n[quickstart]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/docs/development/quickstart.md\n[testpilot]: https://testpilot.firefox.com/\n[buildscript]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/docs/development/deployment.md#producing-a-static-build\n[uploadweb]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/circle.yml#L71\n[sitebake]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/frontend/tasks/pages.js\n[stubs]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/frontend/tasks/pages.js\n[signreq]: http://micropipes.com/blog//2016/08/31/signing-your-commits-on-github-with-a-gpg-key/\n[reactrewrite]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/issues/1307\n[staticsite]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/issues/1306\n[featureflag]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/testpilot/experiments/views.py#L50\n[generatejson]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/frontend/tasks/content.js#L16\n[import]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/frontend/tasks/content.js#L22\n[counts]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/issues/1039\n[deletedata]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/issues/1034\n[fxareq]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/issues/1035\n[flat files]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/tree/master/content-src/experiments\n[telemetry]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Telemetry\n[gulp]: https://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/20/static-blog-generation-with-gulp/\n[bloxsom]: http://blosxom.sourceforge.net/\n[jekyll]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll\n[pages]: https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/\n[baked]: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000404\n[database]: https://indieweb.org/database-antipattern\n[staticgen]: https://www.staticgen.com/\n\n<!-- vim: set wrap linebreak nolist wrapmargin=0 textwidth=0 syntax=markdown formatoptions-=t: -->\n",

    "html": "<nav role=\"navigation\" class=\"table-of-contents\"></nav>\n\n<p>TL;DR: I built <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/react-multiplatform/\">a toy app using React for web and native</a> to get a feel for whether this hybrid approach is worth using. I think the answer is &quot;yes&quot; - but mainly for apps whose business logic &amp; data models are more complex than their views.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"write-slightly-more-than-once-run-manywhere\">Write slightly more than once, run manywhere</h2>\n<p>At Mozilla, one of the things we try to champion is the efficiency of writing one web app versus building many separate native apps. In practice, your mileage varies based on goals, priorities, platform capabilities, and a dozen other factors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a> and <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\">React Native</a> seem to offer a middle ground: Given the shared conventions and patterns and language, it should be possible to share a lot of code between platforms while still taking advantage of native capabilities.</p>\n<p>So, I figured I&#39;d give it a shot and try measuring the common lines of code as a rough success metric.</p>\n<h2 id=\"great-another-todo-app\">Great, another Todo app</h2>\n<p>I decided to build a Todo app, with lots of inspiration and a little code borrowed from <a href=\"http://todomvc.com/\">TodoMVC</a>.</p>\n<p>A basic Todo app demands just enough user interface and data management to get an initial feel for most app frameworks. Commit to something bigger and you may end up wasting your time. Build something smaller and you won&#39;t have explored deep enough into the framework&#39;s solution space.</p>\n<p>I think I&#39;ve erred on the shallow side, but that just gives me room to improve.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-about-flux-vs-mvc\">What about Flux vs MVC?</h2>\n<p>It&#39;s said that React provides just the V in MVC (Model-View-Controller). But, there&#39;s also <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html\">this Flux notion</a>. It&#39;s billed as an alternative to MVC, and React is intended to be a part of it. That said, I haven&#39;t quite yet wrapped my head around Flux. Luckily, React is focused and useful in isolation. So, I can defer buying into the rest of the conceptual package as I learn.</p>\n<p>In fact, I didn&#39;t even really end up building a proper MVC app. The Controller role got distributed between Views &amp; Models: UI event handlers in Views modify Models directly. Views subscribe to change events from Models to update their own state.</p>\n<p>I expect that when I grok Flux better, it&#39;s this reciprocal Model/View relationship that will get broken up &amp; mediated by a Dispatcher. But, in the spirit of iterative hacking, I forged ahead with my terrible code &amp; design.</p>\n<h2 id=\"building-shared-models\">Building shared Models</h2>\n<p>For the Model layer, I took a look at <a href=\"http://ampersandjs.com/\">Ampersand.js</a>. Based originally on <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\">Backbone.js</a> - a library of which I&#39;m a big fan - <a href=\"http://ampersandjs.com/\">Ampersand.js</a> breaks things up into a collection of small modules that work well together.

    "body": "<nav role=\"navigation\" class=\"table-of-contents\"></nav>\n\nTL;DR: I built [a toy app using React for web and native][react-multiplatform] to get a feel for whether this hybrid approach is worth using. I think the answer is \"yes\" - but mainly for apps whose business logic & data models are more complex than their views.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## Write slightly more than once, run manywhere\n\nAt Mozilla, one of the things we try to champion is the efficiency of writing one web app versus building many separate native apps. In practice, your mileage varies based on goals, priorities, platform capabilities, and a dozen other factors.\n\n[React][] and [React Native][] seem to offer a middle ground: Given the shared conventions and patterns and language, it should be possible to share a lot of code between platforms while still taking advantage of native capabilities.\n\nSo, I figured I'd give it a shot and try measuring the common lines of code as a rough success metric.\n\n## Great, another Todo app\n\nI decided to build a Todo app, with lots of inspiration and a little code borrowed from [TodoMVC][].\n\nA basic Todo app demands just enough user interface and data management to get an initial feel for most app frameworks. Commit to something bigger and you may end up wasting your time. Build something smaller and you won't have explored deep enough into the framework's solution space.\n\nI think I've erred on the shallow side, but that just gives me room to improve.\n\n## What about Flux vs MVC?\n\nIt's said that React provides just the V in MVC (Model-View-Controller). But, there's also [this Flux notion][flux]. It's billed as an alternative to MVC, and React is intended to be a part of it. That said, I haven't quite yet wrapped my head around Flux. Luckily, React is focused and useful in isolation. So, I can defer buying into the rest of the conceptual package as I learn.\n\nIn fact, I didn't even really end up building a proper MVC app. The Controller role got distributed between Views & Models: UI event handlers in Views modify Models directly. Views subscribe to change events from Models to update their own state.\n\nI expect that when I grok Flux better, it's this reciprocal Model/View relationship that will get broken up & mediated by a Dispatcher. But, in the spirit of iterative hacking, I forged ahead with my terrible code & design.\n\n## Building shared Models\n\nFor the Model layer, I took a look at [Ampersand.js][]. Based originally on [Backbone.js][] - a library of which I'm a big fan - [Ampersand.js][] breaks things up into a collection of small modules that work well together. But, like [React][], most of the modules are handy in isolation or alongside substitutions from outside of the [Ampersand.js][] family.\n\nFor managing a single todo item, I liked the looks of [ampersand-state][]. With it, you can build JavaScript objects with properties that can be watched for changes. This is what [my todo item model][todo-model] looks like, using [TodoMVC code][todo-model-ampersand] as a starting point:\n\n```javascript\nvar State = require('ampersand-state');\nmodule.exports = State.extend({\n  // Properties this model will store\n  props: {\n    title: { type: 'string', default: '' },\n    completed: { type: 'boolean', default: false }\n  },\n  // session properties are not included when serializing.\n  session: {\n    editing: { type: 'boolean', default: false }\n  },\n  destroy: function () {\n    if (this.collection) {\n      this.collection.remove(this);\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Forking the Views by platform\n\nThis Model code works on both the web and native sides of my app. So far, so good - and pretty straightforward.\n\nHowever, getting down to actually rendering this data across platforms reveals where things start to vary. For example, [the JSX in the `render()` method of my web view][item-web-render] looks like this:\n\n```javascript\nreturn (\n  <li style={itemStyles.container}>\n    <input type=\"checkbox\"\n      style={itemStyles.completed}\n      onChange={(event) => this.handleCompletedChange(event.target.checked)}\n      checked={this.state.item.completed} />\n    {title}\n  </li>\n);\n```\n\nMeanwhile, [the JSX in the `render()` method of my iOS view][item-ios-render] looks like this:\n\n```javascript\nreturn (\n  <View style={styles.todoItem}>\n    <SwitchIOS\n      style={styles.todoCompleted}\n      onValueChange={this.handleCompletedChange}\n      value={this.state.item.completed} />\n    {title}\n  </View>\n);\n```\n\n[item-web-render]: https://github.com/lmorchard/react-multiplatform/blob/3fd16fe31473f249d8a54020ef252f524dd17d70/lib/views/web/TodoItem.js#L34\n[item-ios-render]: https://github.com/lmorchard/react-multiplatform/blob/3fd16fe31473f249d8a54020ef252f524dd17d70/lib/views/ios/TodoItem.js#L42\n\nAnd, if you take a longer peek at those views, you'll see some slightly more complex JSX devoted to the `{title}` placeholders where rendering changes based on whether the item is being edited.\n\nIt's not radically different; it's just enough to make things interesting.\n\n## Code sharing with React mixins\n\nWhat you might notice about these two divergent views, though, is they both start like this:\n\n```javascript\nvar TodoItem = module.exports = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Views.TodoItemCommonMixin],\n  // ...\n```\n\nIt turns out that, thanks to [React mixins][], I can write [the bulk of the View logic][item-shared-view] in a shared module. Since both sides use Models based on [ampersand-state][], this includes subscribing to Model changes:\n\n[React mixins]: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#mixins\n\n```javascript\ngetInitialState() {\n  return { editing: false, item: this.props.item };\n},\ncomponentDidMount() {\n  this.state.item.on('change', () => this.forceUpdate(), this);\n},\ncomponentWillUnmount() {\n  this.state.item.off(null, null, this);\n},\ncomponentWillReceiveProps(props) {\n  this.setState({ item: props.item });\n},\ncomponentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n  if (prevState.item !== this.state.item) {\n    prevState.item.off(null, null, this);\n    this.state.item.on('change', () => this.forceUpdate(), this);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n[item-shared-view]: https://github.com/lmorchard/react-multiplatform/blob/3fd16fe31473f249d8a54020ef252f524dd17d70/lib/views/index.js#L35\n\nAnd, since both sides use Views based on [React][], many UI event handlers can also be shared despite the difference in platform specific JSX and view elements.\n\n(Of course, I recently learned that [React mixins are dead][dead-mixins], so I'm already behind the times. But, this code works for now. I'll get around to burning that bridge when I learn more about Flux.)\n\n[dead-mixins]: https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750\n\n## Forking & sharing Model code for persistence\n\nFor multiple todo items, [ampersand-collection][] is handy. It manages arrays of [ampersand-state][] objects and emits events when the set changes. This is useful for keeping [list][list-web-view] [views][list-ios-view] updated.\n\n[list-web-view]: https://github.com/lmorchard/react-multiplatform/blob/3fd16fe31473f249d8a54020ef252f524dd17d70/lib/views/web/TodoList.js\n[list-ios-view]: https://github.com/lmorchard/react-multiplatform/blob/3fd16fe31473f249d8a54020ef252f524dd17d70/lib/views/ios/TodoList.js\n\n[ampersand-collection][] also offers methods for serializing & deserializing the models it contains. That's just what I need, because I'd like to make my todo list items persistent between sessions with the app.\n\n[todo-model]: https://github.com/lmorchard/react-multiplatform/blob/master/lib/models/Todo.js\n[todo-model-ampersand]: https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/examples/ampersand/js/models/todo.js\n\nApropos of that, we have some storage capabilities on each platform: [localStorage][] for modern browsers, and [AsyncStorage][] for React Native. Both allow you to store small amounts of persistent data on a device. For the purposes of this toy app, these data stores are just about right.\n\nBut, these storage APIs differ. [Using localStorage][using-localstorage] looks like this:\n\n```javascript\nreadFromStorage: function () {\n  var existingData = localStorage[STORAGE_KEY];\n  if (existingData) {\n    this.set(JSON.parse(existingData));\n  }\n},\nwriteToStorage: function () {\n  localStorage[STORAGE_KEY] = JSON.stringify(this);\n}\n```\n\nMeanwhile, [using AsyncStorage][using-asyncstorage] looks like this:\n\n```javascript\nreadFromStorage() {\n  AsyncStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEY).then((existingData) => {\n    this.set(JSON.parse(existingData));\n  });\n},\nwriteToStorage() {\n  AsyncStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(this));\n}\n```\n\nIf you peek at those last two links, though, you might notice they both define classes that start like this:\n\n```javascript\nvar TodoCollection = module.exports = BaseCollection.extend({\n```\n\nSince [ampersand-collection][] supports class inheritance, the bulk of the logic for these collections can be housed in [a shared superclass][basecollection]. The subclasses just need to implement the platform-specific storage methods. A different mechanism than [React mixins][], but for basically the same purpose.\n\n[using-localstorage]: https://github.com/lmorchard/react-multiplatform/blob/3fd16fe31473f249d8a54020ef252f524dd17d70/lib/models/web/TodoCollection.js#L14\n[using-asyncstorage]: https://github.com/lmorchard/react-multiplatform/blob/3fd16fe31473f249d8a54020ef252f524dd17d70/lib/models/ios/TodoCollection.js#L9\n[basecollection]: https://github.com/lmorchard/react-multiplatform/blob/3fd16fe31473f249d8a54020ef252f524dd17d70/lib/models/TodoCollection.js#L8\n\n[AsyncStorage]: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/asyncstorage.html\n[localstorage]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API\n\n## Sharing by the numbers\n\nThe main goal of this experiment is to get a feel as to whether a hybrid React approach is worth considering versus building totally separate apps for native and web platforms. The metric I decided to use for this is counting lines of code (LoC), and this is what I found:\n\n* Overall, ~30% shared LoC (226 / 748).\n\n* For Models, ~74% shared LoC (159 / 215).\n\n* For Views, ~12% shared LoC (67 / 533).\n\nBecause I like showing my work, here's how I came up with those numbers:\n\n```bash\n# Total LoC for models = 215\n$ cat lib/models/**/*.js | wc -l\n     215\n\n# ~74% common model code\n$ cat lib/models/*js | wc -l\n     159\n\n# ~12% iOS specific model code\n$ cat lib/models/ios/*js | wc -l\n      25\n\n# ~14% web specific model code\n$ cat lib/models/web/*js | wc -l\n      31\n\n# Total LoC for views = 533\n$ cat lib/views/**/*.js | wc -l\n     533\n\n# ~12% common view code\n$ cat lib/views/*js | wc -l\n      67\n\n# ~44% iOS specific view code\n$ cat lib/views/ios/*js | wc -l\n     235\n\n# ~43% web specific view code\n$ cat lib/views/web/*js | wc -l\n     231\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUsing React for both web & native looks promising.

I&#8217;m pretty sure very few people outside of the core team at the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla Developer Network\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla Developer Network</a> even know what <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript\">KumaScript</a> is. So, I guess it&#8217;s about time I do something about that.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<h3 id=\"necessity-is-the-mother-of-invention\"><span id=\"Necessity_is_the_Mother_of_Invention\">Necessity is the Mother of Invention</span></h3>\n<p>The major focus of my workaday (and workanight) life last summer was the relaunch of the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla Developer Network\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla Developer Network</a> wiki.</p>\n<p>It had been close to 18 months in the making, which usually spells <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/17/on-the-other-end-of-a-self-imposed-death-march-project\">death march</a> and disaster. But, against many expectations, we did finally arrive at something for launch that neither fell over in flames immediately nor jettisoned a significant number of features with respect to what it was replacing. I think this is the first time in my career something like this went off with as few hitches as it did.</p>\n<p>Your first questions might go something along the lines of, &#8220;18 months? For a <em>wiki</em>? Are you insane or just incompetent?&#8221; Well, it might help to note a few additional details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We call it a wiki, but it&#8217;s really more of a content management system that anyone can edit. It supports translation from English to 34 other languages, tracks revisions &amp; content hierarchies, accepts file attachments, and sings &amp; dances in a variety of other annoying-to-implement ways.</li>\n<li>At the time of switchover, we had over 50,000 documents to migrate with care from the old system to the new one. That body of content represents years of work, a non-trivial hunk of cruft and spam, and tickles a maddening array of edge cases.<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\nThe wiki we replaced—i.e. <a href=\"http://www.mindtouch.com/\">MindTouch</a>—supports server-side scripting in content with a language based on Lua—i.e. <a href=\"http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/DekiScript\">DekiScript</a>.\n</li>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of the above points represents its own special mix of horror and challenge, and I took on the bulk of the last two. That caused me a lot of stress, and <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/17/on-the-other-end-of-a-self-imposed-death-march-project\">I blogged a bit about that</a>.</p>\n<p>This blog post, however, focuses on that last point: <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript\">KumaScript</a> was built by backing into a semi-compatible replacement for <a href=\"http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/DekiScript\">DekiScript</a>. That&#8217;s pretty much the worst way to go about building something, but it seems to have worked.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-does-it-look-like\"><span id=\"What_Does_It_Look_Like\">What Does It Look Like?</span></h3>\n<p>First, you might want to check out <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript\">&#8220;Introduction to KumaScript&#8221; on MDN</a>. It&#8217;s the best work in progress describing the ins-and-outs of the service. But for the sake of this blog post, consider <a href=\"https://developer-new.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/KumaTests/hello_test?raw=1\">this wiki document</a>:</p>\n<pre>Here are three hellos:\n{{ hello('3') }}</pre>\n\n<p>Now, consider <a href=\"https://developer-new.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Template:hello\">this KumaScript template</a>, named <code>Template:hello</code>:</p>\n<pre>&lt;% for (var i = 0; i &lt; $0; i++) { %&gt;\nHello #&lt;%= i %&gt;\n&lt;% } %&gt;</pre>\n\n<p>Put the two of these together, and you get <a href=\"https://developer-new.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/KumaTests/hello_test\">this output</a>:</p>\n<pre>Here are three hellos:\nHello #0\nHello #1\nHello #2</pre>\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> consists mainly of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript#Template_Syntax\">Templates implemented using Embedded JavaScript Templates</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript#Macro_Syntax\">Macros in wiki content that call templates with parameters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript#Creating_modules\">Common JS inspired modules for reusable code used by templates</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This quick introduction glosses over interesting things you can do with <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a>—e.g. accessing data from external sources via HTTP, fetching content from other documents (also via HTTP). But, again, you can dive deeper by reading <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript\">&#8220;Introduction to Kumascript&#8221; on MDN</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scripting-in-wikis\"><span id=\"Scripting_in_Wikis\">Scripting in Wikis</span></h3>\n<p>Why would one would even build such a thing as <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a>? As it turns out, programmatically generating content is quite handy for composing documentation. Here are a few use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Localized macros for often-repeated constructs such as <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Template:Warning\">warnings</a>, notes, tips, &amp; callouts.</li>\n<li>Conditional content based on variables such as product, locale, &amp; standards status.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion\">Transclusion</a> of content, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL/button\">building documents from documents</a>. (Try viewing <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL/button?raw\">the raw source</a> of that page.)</li>\n<li>Mashups of data from <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> itself and from other sites and services like Bugzilla and Github. For example, here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Changelog\">a self-updating Changelog of our code deployments on MDN</a>. And, here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Template:KumaGithubChanges\">the template behind that page</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth pointing out that is different from scripting mixed with <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML</a> like you get from ASP or PHP: There, you can process forms, personalize responses, and generally build web applications.</p>\n<p>In the world of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a>, content scripting is a heavily cached thing and not tied to the current HTTP request. It mostly runs only when the document itself is edited, but can also be executed when we think dependencies or external data sources have changed.</p>\n<p>In fact, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> code doesn&#8217;t even have access to the incoming visitor&#8217;s request data at all—i.e. username, cookies, referrer header, et al—and instead we operate mainly on the content and metadata of documents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-javascript\"><span id=\"Why_JavaScript\">Why JavaScript?</span></h3>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, <a href=\"http://www.mindtouch.com/\">MindTouch</a> provides for scripted content by way of the Lua-based <a href=\"http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/DekiScript\">DekiScript</a>. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that the Wikimedia Foundation is working on <a href=\"http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Lua_scripting\">a Lua-based scripting system for MediaWiki and Wikipedia</a>. So, scripted content in a wiki isn&#8217;t an entirely crazy idea, in and of itself.</p>\n<p>As for Lua, I think it&#8217;s a nice little language. It&#8217;s used in World of Warcraft and many other games. It&#8217;s known for being easily embedded into applications to grant scriptability. I can totally see why one would reach for it.</p>\n<p>But, at <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a>, we&#8217;re all about the web. The lingua franca of programming on the web is <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a>. And, it doesn&#8217;t hurt that <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> already has a huge body of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a> documentation.</p>\n<p>So, as far as harmonious language choices go, I can&#8217;t think of a better one for scripting content on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> than <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"boring-lets-me-sleep-at-night\"><span id=\"Boring_Lets_Me_Sleep_at_Night\">Boring Lets Me Sleep at Night</span></h3>\n<p>There are some exciting things about embedding a Lua interpreter into a wiki platform, as MindTouch and MediaWiki have done. Even having chosen <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a> over Lua, I could have tried embedding a <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> interpreter like <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/v8/\">V8</a> or <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SpiderMonkey\">SpiderMonkey</a> into Python.</p>\n<p>However, because I like to sleep at night and am not particularly clever about embedding languages within languages (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5099043/embedding-a-low-performance-scripting-language-in-python#comment5715808_5099043\">yo dawg</a>), I want nothing to do with this brand of excitement. Consider me <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle\">a Hobbit</a> among developers.</p>\n<p>So, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> is a standalone <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a> web service. That is, everything going into and coming out of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> happens over HTTP. I understand HTTP a whole lot more than embedding language interpreters.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: Node.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a> is an exciting piece of exotic matter in its own right. But, someone more clever than me maintains Node.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a>. And, I&#8217;m betting most of my co-workers and potential project contributors understand <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a>, Node.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a>, and HTTP much better than embedding languages in other languages.</p>\n<p>In fact, besides my overwrought glue code, <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript/blob/master/package.json#L22\">KumaScript consists mainly of modules written &amp; maintained by other people more clever than me</a>. That&#8217;s even less work for me. One of the few things I like as much as sleeping at night is when other people fix bugs and build things for me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"http-all-the-things\"><span id=\"HTTP_ALL_the_Things\">HTTP ALL the Things</span></h3>\n<p>I really like HTTP. I&#8217;ve spent a good chunk of my adult life learning to understand it—so by this point it might be Stockholm Syndrome, but I think it embeds a lot of cleverness and useful decisions.</p>\n<p>HTTP gives you interesting system boundaries. You can cache, scale, and abstract using intermediaries. There are nice identifiers (ie. URLs), status codes, and a rich arsenal of means to transport data and metadata (ie. methods, headers, and content types).</p>\n<p>Having made <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> an HTTP service also means that someone other than <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> could use it.

DekiScript seems to allow for this. But, we never really used it that way on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a>.</p>\n<p>Instead, what we have is a system of templates and macros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Templates contain the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a> code in the form of <a href=\"https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs\">Embedded JavaScript Templates</a>. At present, these can be authored only by a core of trusted <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> editors.</li>\n<li>Macros call templates with parameters and dump the results of execution into the document. These can be used by anyone, and have <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript/blob/master/lib/kumascript/parser.pegjs\">a very constrained syntax</a>.</li>\n<li>The content resulting from macro evaluation <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bleach\">is sanitized</a> such that it&#8217;s subject to the same constraints as hand-written markup.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> has no access to a user&#8217;s request data, we&#8217;re decently firewalled in terms of privacy and abusing the visitor. And, since <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bleach\">the markup is filtered</a>, it&#8217;s difficult to inject nasty XSS exploits and the like.</p>\n<p>So, when I say security and safety, I&#8217;m thinking mainly about our servers: We want to sandbox this server-side <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> such that it can&#8217;t abuse CPU, memory, or network resources. At present, my approach to this is anemic: Restrict code authoring to trusted people, and impose impatient timeouts on macro execution.</p>\n<p>I have thoughts about improving this situation in the future, and hopefully expanding the ability to author <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> templates.

You can stick it behind a load balancer. Scale it horizontally by throwing more CPUs and processes at the problem. Cache the hell out of the responses.

I&#8217;m pretty sure very few people outside of the core team at the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla Developer Network\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla Developer Network</a> even know what [KumaScript][1] is. So, I guess it&#8217;s about time I do something about that.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n### <span id=\"Necessity_is_the_Mother_of_Invention\">Necessity is the Mother of Invention</span>\n\nThe major focus of my workaday (and workanight) life last summer was the relaunch of the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla Developer Network\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla Developer Network</a> wiki.\n\nIt had been close to 18 months in the making, which usually spells [death march][3] and disaster. But, against many expectations, we did finally arrive at something for launch that neither fell over in flames immediately nor jettisoned a significant number of features with respect to what it was replacing. I think this is the first time in my career something like this went off with as few hitches as it did.\n\nYour first questions might go something along the lines of, &#8220;18 months? For a *wiki*? Are you insane or just incompetent?&#8221; Well, it might help to note a few additional details:\n\n*   We call it a wiki, but it&#8217;s really more of a content management system that anyone can edit. It supports translation from English to 34 other languages, tracks revisions & content hierarchies, accepts file attachments, and sings & dances in a variety of other annoying-to-implement ways.\n*   At the time of switchover, we had over 50,000 documents to migrate with care from the old system to the new one. That body of content represents years of work, a non-trivial hunk of cruft and spam, and tickles a maddening array of edge cases.\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  The wiki we replaced—i.e. <a href=\"http://www.mindtouch.com/\">MindTouch</a>—supports server-side scripting in content with a language based on Lua—i.e. <a href=\"http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/DekiScript\">DekiScript</a>.\n</li>\n\nEach of the above points represents its own special mix of horror and challenge, and I took on the bulk of the last two. That caused me a lot of stress, and [I blogged a bit about that][3].\n\nThis blog post, however, focuses on that last point: [KumaScript][1] was built by backing into a semi-compatible replacement for [DekiScript][4]. That&#8217;s pretty much the worst way to go about building something, but it seems to have worked.\n\n### <span id=\"What_Does_It_Look_Like\">What Does It Look Like?</span>\n\nFirst, you might want to check out [&#8220;Introduction to KumaScript&#8221; on MDN][5]. It&#8217;s the best work in progress describing the ins-and-outs of the service. But for the sake of this blog post, consider [this wiki document][6]:\n\n<pre>Here are three hellos:\r\n{{ hello('3') }}</pre>\n\nNow, consider [this KumaScript template][7], named `Template:hello`:\n\n<pre>&lt;% for (var i = 0; i &lt; $0; i++) { %&gt;\r\nHello #&lt;%= i %&gt;\r\n&lt;% } %&gt;</pre>\n\nPut the two of these together, and you get [this output][8]:\n\n<pre>Here are three hellos:\r\nHello #0\r\nHello #1\r\nHello #2</pre>\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> consists mainly of the following:\n\n*   [Templates implemented using Embedded JavaScript Templates][9]\n*   [Macros in wiki content that call templates with parameters][10]\n*   [Common JS inspired modules for reusable code used by templates][11]\n\nThis quick introduction glosses over interesting things you can do with <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a>—e.g. accessing data from external sources via HTTP, fetching content from other documents (also via HTTP). But, again, you can dive deeper by reading [&#8220;Introduction to Kumascript&#8221; on MDN][5].\n\n### <span id=\"Scripting_in_Wikis\">Scripting in Wikis</span>\n\nWhy would one would even build such a thing as <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a>? As it turns out, programmatically generating content is quite handy for composing documentation. Here are a few use cases:\n\n*   Localized macros for often-repeated constructs such as [warnings][12], notes, tips, & callouts.\n*   Conditional content based on variables such as product, locale, & standards status.\n*   [Transclusion][13] of content, [building documents from documents][14]. (Try viewing [the raw source][15] of that page.)\n*   Mashups of data from <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> itself and from other sites and services like Bugzilla and Github. For example, here&#8217;s [a self-updating Changelog of our code deployments on MDN][16]. And, here&#8217;s [the template behind that page][17].\n\nIt&#8217;s also worth pointing out that is different from scripting mixed with <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML</a> like you get from ASP or PHP: There, you can process forms, personalize responses, and generally build web applications.\n\nIn the world of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a>, content scripting is a heavily cached thing and not tied to the current HTTP request. It mostly runs only when the document itself is edited, but can also be executed when we think dependencies or external data sources have changed.\n\nIn fact, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> code doesn&#8217;t even have access to the incoming visitor&#8217;s request data at all—i.e. username, cookies, referrer header, et al—and instead we operate mainly on the content and metadata of documents.\n\n### <span id=\"Why_JavaScript\">Why JavaScript?</span>\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, [MindTouch][18] provides for scripted content by way of the Lua-based [DekiScript][4]. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that the Wikimedia Foundation is working on [a Lua-based scripting system for MediaWiki and Wikipedia][19]. So, scripted content in a wiki isn&#8217;t an entirely crazy idea, in and of itself.\n\nAs for Lua, I think it&#8217;s a nice little language. It&#8217;s used in World of Warcraft and many other games. It&#8217;s known for being easily embedded into applications to grant scriptability. I can totally see why one would reach for it.\n\nBut, at <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a>, we&#8217;re all about the web. The lingua franca of programming on the web is <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a>. And, it doesn&#8217;t hurt that <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> already has a huge body of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a> documentation.\n\nSo, as far as harmonious language choices go, I can&#8217;t think of a better one for scripting content on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> than <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a>.\n\n### <span id=\"Boring_Lets_Me_Sleep_at_Night\">Boring Lets Me Sleep at Night</span>\n\nThere are some exciting things about embedding a Lua interpreter into a wiki platform, as MindTouch and MediaWiki have done. Even having chosen <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a> over Lua, I could have tried embedding a <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> interpreter like [V8][20] or [SpiderMonkey][21] into Python.\n\nHowever, because I like to sleep at night and am not particularly clever about embedding languages within languages ([yo dawg][22]), I want nothing to do with this brand of excitement. Consider me [a Hobbit][23] among developers.\n\nSo, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> is a standalone [Node.js][24] web service. That is, everything going into and coming out of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> happens over HTTP. I understand HTTP a whole lot more than embedding language interpreters.\n\nDon&#8217;t get me wrong: Node.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a> is an exciting piece of exotic matter in its own right. But, someone more clever than me maintains Node.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a>. And, I&#8217;m betting most of my co-workers and potential project contributors understand <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a>, Node.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a>, and HTTP much better than embedding languages in other languages.\n\nIn fact, besides my overwrought glue code, [KumaScript consists mainly of modules written & maintained by other people more clever than me][25]. That&#8217;s even less work for me. One of the few things I like as much as sleeping at night is when other people fix bugs and build things for me.\n\n### <span id=\"HTTP_ALL_the_Things\">HTTP ALL the Things</span>\n\nI really like HTTP. I&#8217;ve spent a good chunk of my adult life learning to understand it—so by this point it might be Stockholm Syndrome, but I think it embeds a lot of cleverness and useful decisions.\n\nHTTP gives you interesting system boundaries. You can cache, scale, and abstract using intermediaries. There are nice identifiers (ie. URLs), status codes, and a rich arsenal of means to transport data and metadata (ie. methods, headers, and content types).\n\nHaving made <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> an HTTP service also means that someone other than <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> could use it. The interface was not built specifically for <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a>, it&#8217;s neither dependent on Python nor Django. Fire up the processes and try running your web content through it—could be a wiki, could be a pile of static <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML</a>. There is, of course, slightly more to it than that—but not much.\n\nIn fact, I really *do* hope someday someone beyond <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> tries using <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a>.\n\n### <span id=\"Turtles_All_the_Way_Down\">Turtles All the Way Down</span>\n\nSo, the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> wiki—[named Kuma][26], which means [&#8220;bear&#8221; in Japanese][27]—talks to <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> via HTTP. And, in turn, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> talks to the wiki with HTTP.\n\nIn fact, although the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> service itself is hidden behind a firewall, [the wiki API used by KumaScript is open to the public][28]. What&#8217;s good for the goose is good for the gander, after all.\n\nThe typical document rendering process goes something like this:\n\n1.  <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kuma\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Getting_started_with_Kuma?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Kuma</a> makes a GET request to <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> with the URL of a wiki document.\n2.  <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> makes a GET request to <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kuma\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Getting_started_with_Kuma?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Kuma</a> for the raw source of the wiki document.\n3.  <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> parses the source, looking for macros & inventorying templates.\n4.  <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> makes a GET request to <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kuma\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Getting_started_with_Kuma?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Kuma</a> for the source of each template needed.\n5.  <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> evaluates the macros by executing templates with the given parameters. This may kick off additional GET requests as needed by templates to load modules.\n6.  <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> responds to the initial request from <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kuma\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Getting_started_with_Kuma?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Kuma</a> with the results of macro evaluation in the document.\n\nIt&#8217;s <del>turtles</del> HTTP GET, [all the way down][29]. Well, except for when we want to do a preview before saving: In that case it&#8217;s an HTTP POST which kicks everything off at step #3, with raw source in the request body.\n\nAnd though this might look like a Rube Goldberg machine, there are some nice qualities to all this HTTP GET traffic:\n\n*   Each GET is susceptible to caching, via the usual headers and semantics.\n*   Each GET can be serviced by a different process on a different machine.\n\nI&#8217;m sure I could come up with more items after I have lunch, but this is just HTTP.\n\nContent flows through request and response bodies. And—though this part might be a bit of a hack—I encode document context, errors, and messages using custom HTTP headers as a side-channel [using the FireLogger protocol][30] as an inspiration.\n\n### <span id=\"Security_Safety\">Security & Safety</span>\n\nSomething I could have done with <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> was to simply allow wiki authors to drop hunks of executable code into the middle of documents. DekiScript seems to allow for this. But, we never really used it that way on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a>.\n\nInstead, what we have is a system of templates and macros:\n\n*   Templates contain the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a> code in the form of [Embedded JavaScript Templates][31]. At present, these can be authored only by a core of trusted <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> editors.\n*   Macros call templates with parameters and dump the results of execution into the document. These can be used by anyone, and have [a very constrained syntax][32].\n*   The content resulting from macro evaluation [is sanitized][33] such that it&#8217;s subject to the same constraints as hand-written markup.\n\nSince <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> has no access to a user&#8217;s request data, we&#8217;re decently firewalled in terms of privacy and abusing the visitor. And, since [the markup is filtered][33], it&#8217;s difficult to inject nasty XSS exploits and the like.\n\nSo, when I say security and safety, I&#8217;m thinking mainly about our servers: We want to sandbox this server-side <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> such that it can&#8217;t abuse CPU, memory, or network resources. At present, my approach to this is anemic: Restrict code authoring to trusted people, and impose impatient timeouts on macro execution.\n\nI have thoughts about improving this situation in the future, and hopefully expanding the ability to author <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> templates. Because, remember, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> is a wiki—anyone and everyone can edit it. I&#8217;d like that to include the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> code, if at all possible to do with relative safety.\n\nPatches and pull requests are welcome, especially if you&#8217;re smarter than me about these things. (It&#8217;s not hard to be smarter than me about these things.)\n\n### <span id=\"Scaling_Stability\">Scaling & Stability</span>\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> scales like just about any web service. You can stick it behind a load balancer. Scale it horizontally by throwing more CPUs and processes at the problem. Cache the hell out of the responses. Throw a proxy in front of it to cache the hell out of outgoing requests to external services. Again, this is meant to be as boring as I can make it.\n\nAnd, if a <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> process should happen to misbehave or starts having a seizure, just kill it and start another one. There should be no state to worry about, and the processes should start up really fast. Ideally, the logs will have recorded what went wrong and we end up with just a transient error.\n\n### <span id=\"Maturity_THE_FUTURE\">Maturity & THE FUTURE</span>\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> turned a year old last month, has been in production since last summer, and had its last commit around 5 months ago. It has lots of tests, and it uses a version of Node.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a> from early 2012.\n\nThat doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s abandoned, though: <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> is a mature project by most definitions. It&#8217;s been working well enough that I haven&#8217;t wanted to touch it. Most of the work goes on within the wiki itself, and <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> is meant to be the smallest piece it can be.\n\nAnd maturity doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t have notions about future work. Off the top of my head, I&#8217;d like to get around things like the following:\n\n*   Improve template execution & sandboxing. Currently, if any one thing misbehaves in the document, the whole process gets aborted. Maybe instead, I should [spin up a pool of processes][34]: Each them can take care of executing a single macro, while a master process watches for CPU / RAM / network abuse and kills anything that behaves badly.\n*   Reconsider my possibly brain-dead approach to parsing source documents for macros using a PEG.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a> grammar. Or, maybe it&#8217;s good enough.\n*   Need much better error trapping and reporting throughout everywhere.\n*   Need much better use of [statsd][35] for measuring timings and suchlike.\n*   Maybe offer an HTTP proxy that runs all content through the service, for easier deployment atop existing sites beyond <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a>.\n\nAnd of course: Suggestions, patches, and pull requests are more than welcome!\n\n [1]: https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript\n [2]: https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript/commit/0cb247eaac58cf00bb59e16d6b37a215484633b2\n [3]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/17/on-the-other-end-of-a-self-imposed-death-march-project\n [4]: http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/DekiScript\n [5]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript\n [6]: https://developer-new.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/KumaTests/hello_test?raw=1\n [7]: https://developer-new.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Template:hello\n [8]: https://developer-new.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/KumaTests/hello_test\n [9]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript#Template_Syntax\n [10]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript#Macro_Syntax\n [11]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript#Creating_modules\n [12]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Template:Warning\n [13]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion\n [14]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL/button\n [15]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL/button?raw\n [16]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Changelog\n [17]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Template:KumaGithubChanges\n [18]: http://www.mindtouch.com/\n [19]: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Lua_scripting\n [20]: http://code.google.com/p/v8/\n [21]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SpiderMonkey\n [22]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5099043/embedding-a-low-performance-scripting-language-in-python#comment5715808_5099043\n [23]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle\n [24]: http://nodejs.org/\n [25]: https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript/blob/master/package.json#L22\n [26]: https://github.com/mozilla/kuma\n [27]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuma#Animals\n [28]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:The_Kuma_API\n [29]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down\n [30]: https://github.com/lmorchard/node-firelogger\n [31]: https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs\n [32]: https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript/blob/master/lib/kumascript/parser.pegjs\n [33]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bleach\n [34]: https://github.com/lloyd/node-compute-cluster\n [35]: https://github.com/etsy/statsd/",

And, I&#8217;m not, really. But, it turns out that <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/firefoxos/\">FirefoxOS</a> needs some help to reach its first release milestones.

While it&#8217;s true that many apps <em>will</em> run in Firefox Nightly, and there is an emulator you can build from the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"b2g\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">b2g</a> repo, most apps are presently problematic in Firefox Nightly, and I&#8217;ve never gotten the emulator to build successfully.</p>\n<p>You can either <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client#Building_the_desktop_client\">build your own B2G Desktop</a>, or <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client#Download_a_nightly_build\">download a nightly build</a>. I&#8217;ve done both, and generally I recommend sticking with the nightly Aurora builds.</p>\n<p>On OS X, I was able to download a nightly build and launch it with a double-click. That got things running &#8211; hooray! But, it didn&#8217;t get me productive straight away: The nightly build comes equipped with its own embedded build of Gaia, which makes it handy for trying out your own 3rd party apps but not-so-handy for hacking on Gaia itself.</p>\n<p>To improve this situation, you need to do two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gaia/Hacking#Nightly_Builds\">Build your own Gaia profile</a> from your own clone of <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia\">mozilla-b2g/gaia</a>. This is pretty much just running <code>make</code> or <code>DEBUG=1 make</code> from your git clone. </li>\n<li>Run <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop from a terminal <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client#Running_the_desktop_client\">with command line options</a> that tell it to use your new Gaia profile, rather than the built-in. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, at this point, I have the Gaia source and a means by which to run it on my laptop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"breaking-things\"><span id=\"Breaking_things\">Breaking things</span></h2>\n<p>After getting the project running as intended, I break something. And by that, I mean that I change a button title somewhere to &#8220;LOL BUTTS&#8221; or intentionally introduce an exception or syntax error somewhere. Then, I fix it. This is practice that exposes me to the guts of the thing; gets me into the edit/build/run cycle; shows me what it does when something goes wrong; and pushes me toward finding the tests.</p>\n<p>But, I think I picked the wrong week to step into the arena, because everything came pre-broken. There were semi-known bugs preventing nightly builds of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop from running my fresh clone of Gaia. It took me most of my first week to track down those bugs in bugzilla, find workarounds, and finally get something going. And then, it all broke again. And I found workarounds again.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I was at a point where I built my own <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop from source with a particular patch from a particular bug applied, and <em>that</em> got me to the point where I could <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/commit/9f0129c7a5f04d58bbbe140de2b9562e3172d23c\">submit my first pull request</a> to fix a broken test.</p>\n<p>Happily, things seem to have stabilized since I started: <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop nightlies have been cooperating with bleeding-edge Gaia lately, so I&#8217;ve been able to stop building my own. So, now, when I find a combination of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop and phone and Gaia checkout that works, I cling to that for dear life until it&#8217;s absolutely necessary for me to update one of the parts.</p>\n<p>In short, FirefoxOS is very much in flux, right now. Bring a hard hat and expect delays.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fixing-things\"><span id=\"Fixing_things\">Fixing things</span></h2>\n<p>Once I&#8217;ve broken something and then fixed it, I usually have a sense for how to get real work done. Since then, I&#8217;ve been slowly wrapping my head around <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/tree/master/apps/calendar\">the core Calendar app</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/commits?author=lmorchard\">my bug fixes have finally started trickling in</a>.</p>\n<p>Cobbling together a reliable Gaia-hacking workflow is complicated, though:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some Gaia apps work in Firefox Nightly, at least partially. This is great, because Firefox has all the great tools like the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"DOM\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/DOM?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">DOM</a> inspector and web console. And, for the most part, you can just save-and-refresh to see changes. </li>\n<li>All Gaia apps work in <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop, usually, though sometimes there are&#8230; quirks. This is good for seeing how changes work in a closer-to-real environment. But, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop has none of the web developer tools offered by Firefox. And, to see changes, I generally have to save, relaunch <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop, then relaunch the app within the simulator. That&#8217;s pretty inconvenient.</li>\n<li>All Gaia apps work on the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a>-supplied dev phone &#8211; which almost no one has. Well, they work more often than they do on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop and Firefox, anyway. But, including a phone in the dev iteration loop is downright painful: As opposed to the usual webdev experience of save-and-refresh, the phone demands a save-build-flash-restart-relaunch cycle. </li>\n<li>There is one awesome thing, at least for <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/tree/master/apps/calendar\">the Calendar app</a>: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Gaia_Unit_Tests\">There are unit tests which run in B2G Desktop, but are driven by a node.js controller in my shell</a>. That lets me beat up on my code &amp; logic in a &#8220;headless&#8221; context before jumping into Firefox, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop, or the phone for a fuller integration test and a manual run-through. In fact, the unit testing framework even watches for file changes and will re-run tests right after a save, complete with a Growl notification of pass/fail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"room-for-improvement\"><span id=\"Room_for_improvement\">Room for improvement</span></h2>\n<p>Slowly but surely, I&#8217;ve gotten my minigun barrel spun up to start firing <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/25/lead-bullets/\">piles of lead bullets</a> at Gaia bugs. But, it has been and continues to be a challenge. I&#8217;m hard-pressed to recommend it as a fun-time leisure project to anyone without a <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a> paycheck, or even as an off-hours interest for those who live-and-breathe Firefox. This is to be expected, since it&#8217;s not even a v1.0 project yet &#8211; but, I really, really hope things improve in the not-so-distant future.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We need to make sure that new contributors can get quickly from cloning the source to running the code. And it should <em>always</em> work &#8211; as in big, noisy automated tests fail when it breaks. I don&#8217;t care if it works fine on the phone if I can&#8217;t hack on it, at least from a contributor perspective. </li>\n<li>We need a consistent and convenient development environment for Gaia. All day, I bounce between things that are partly broken in Firefox, partly broken in <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop, and mostly working on the phone. This kills productivity and enthusiasm, all day. And, many times, no one else in the <a href=\"irc://irc.mozilla.org/gaia\">#gaia channel on IRC</a> knows what I&#8217;m on about when I say something&#8217;s broken &#8211; because everyone&#8217;s dev environment is a unique little snowflake. </li>\n<li>My ideal workflow would never leave Firefox and my editor: Consider it a variant of the Responsive Design View, and ensure all the various APIs expected on a real phone are either working properly, polyfilled, or usefully stubbed out. Then, when it&#8217;s perfect in my most comfy environment, I can try it on a phone or standalone simulator as an afterthought. The <a href=\"http://www.blueskyonmars.com/2012/11/08/r2d2b2g-is-becoming-the-firefox-os-simulator/\">upcoming built-in Firefox OS Simulator</a> (née <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/10/r2d2b2g-an-experimental-prototype-firefox-os-test-environment/\">r2d2b2g</a>) looks promising, but it needs to be seamless. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"still-digging\"><span id=\"Still_digging\">Still digging</span></h2>\n<p>Even with the challenges, and even if my contributions are small, I&#8217;m happy to have the opportunity to work on FirefoxOS. It&#8217;s a big deal; it&#8217;s the next Firefox. So, I plan to keep ramming my head against this stuff to help make it better, and I hope we can start taking time to make making it better better, too!</p>\n",

This is good for seeing how changes work in a closer-to-real environment. But, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop has none of the web developer tools offered by Firefox. And, to see changes, I generally have to save, relaunch <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop, then relaunch the app within the simulator. That&#8217;s pretty inconvenient.\r\n*   All Gaia apps work on the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a>-supplied dev phone &#8211; which almost no one has. Well, they work more often than they do on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop and Firefox, anyway. But, including a phone in the dev iteration loop is downright painful: As opposed to the usual webdev experience of save-and-refresh, the phone demands a save-build-flash-restart-relaunch cycle. \r\n*   There is one awesome thing, at least for [the Calendar app][19]: [There are unit tests which run in B2G Desktop, but are driven by a node.js controller in my shell][21]. That lets me beat up on my code & logic in a &#8220;headless&#8221; context before jumping into Firefox, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop, or the phone for a fuller integration test and a manual run-through. In fact, the unit testing framework even watches for file changes and will re-run tests right after a save, complete with a Growl notification of pass/fail.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Room_for_improvement\">Room for improvement</span>\r\n\r\nSlowly but surely, I&#8217;ve gotten my minigun barrel spun up to start firing [piles of lead bullets][22] at Gaia bugs. But, it has been and continues to be a challenge. I&#8217;m hard-pressed to recommend it as a fun-time leisure project to anyone without a <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a> paycheck, or even as an off-hours interest for those who live-and-breathe Firefox. This is to be expected, since it&#8217;s not even a v1.0 project yet &#8211; but, I really, really hope things improve in the not-so-distant future.\r\n\r\n*   We need to make sure that new contributors can get quickly from cloning the source to running the code. And it should *always* work &#8211; as in big, noisy automated tests fail when it breaks. I don&#8217;t care if it works fine on the phone if I can&#8217;t hack on it, at least from a contributor perspective. \r\n*   We need a consistent and convenient development environment for Gaia. All day, I bounce between things that are partly broken in Firefox, partly broken in <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop, and mostly working on the phone. This kills productivity and enthusiasm, all day. And, many times, no one else in the [#gaia channel on IRC][23] knows what I&#8217;m on about when I say something&#8217;s broken &#8211; because everyone&#8217;s dev environment is a unique little snowflake. \r\n*   My ideal workflow would never leave Firefox and my editor: Consider it a variant of the Responsive Design View, and ensure all the various APIs expected on a real phone are either working properly, polyfilled, or usefully stubbed out. Then, when it&#8217;s perfect in my most comfy environment, I can try it on a phone or standalone simulator as an afterthought. The [upcoming built-in Firefox OS Simulator][24] (née [r2d2b2g][25]) looks promising, but it needs to be seamless. \r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Still_digging\">Still digging</span>\r\n\r\nEven with the challenges, and even if my contributions are small, I&#8217;m happy to have the opportunity to work on FirefoxOS. It&#8217;s a big deal; it&#8217;s the next Firefox. So, I plan to keep ramming my head against this stuff to help make it better, and I hope we can start taking time to make making it better better, too!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/17/on-the-other-end-of-a-self-imposed-death-march-project#p[BInCtb]\r\n [2]: http://www.mozilla.org/firefoxos/\r\n [3]: http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/\r\n [4]: https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia\r\n [5]: https://developer.mozilla.org/\r\n [6]: http://blog.margaretleibovic.com/post/32836884540/challenges-getting-started-with-gaia\r\n [7]: http://bluesock.org/~willg/blog/gaia/gaia_onboarding.html\r\n [8]: http://schalk-neethling.com/2012/10/debugging-b2g-desktop-blank-screen-on-launch-gaia/\r\n [9]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS\r\n [10]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gaia/Hacking\r\n [11]: https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/B2G\r\n [12]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Gonk\r\n [13]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Gecko\r\n [14]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client#Building_the_desktop_client\r\n [15]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client#Download_a_nightly_build\r\n [16]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gaia/Hacking#Nightly_Builds\r\n [17]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client#Running_the_desktop_client\r\n [18]: https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/commit/9f0129c7a5f04d58bbbe140de2b9562e3172d23c\r\n [19]: https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/tree/master/apps/calendar\r\n [20]: https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/commits?author=lmorchard\r\n [21]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Gaia_Unit_Tests\r\n [22]: http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/25/lead-bullets/\r\n [23]: irc://irc.mozilla.org/gaia\r\n [24]: http://www.blueskyonmars.com/2012/11/08/r2d2b2g-is-becoming-the-firefox-os-simulator/\r\n [25]: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/10/r2d2b2g-an-experimental-prototype-firefox-os-test-environment/",

And, in technology, it&#8217;s no coincidence that more choice tends to be messier and complex, less choice tends to be cleaner and simple. It&#8217;s a trade-off between what you choose and what you leave up to an expert.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"tasting-menus-and-wine-pairings\"><span id=\"Tasting_menus_and_wine_pairings\">Tasting menus and wine pairings</span></h2>\n<p>My wife and I like to go out a few times a year on date nights to nice restaurants. These restaurants have <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=tasting+menu\">tasting menus</a> with wine pairings. This is dinner on cruise control, and we let the chef drive. It&#8217;s great when it works, because the chef makes expert choices.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, it doesn&#8217;t work. There might be something we don&#8217;t like: Rabbit are pets, for instance. We&#8217;re not fans of seafood, though some menus have surprised us. We also have food allergies. Usually—though not always—we can ask for a substitution. Otherwise, we chalk it up to adventure.</p>\n<p>But, overall, ordering from the tasting menu and trying the wine pairings makes date night simple with a side of novelty. It&#8217;s on the high end of freedom from choice. We choose to go out, and we choose the restaurant, but we leave the rest to experts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"suds-and-swine\"><span id=\"Suds_and_swine\">Suds and swine</span></h2>\n<p>On the other end of things, I like to make homebrew—<a href=\"http://www.alphadictionary.com/goodword/word/zymurgy\">zymurgy</a>, not software. There&#8217;s a spectrum of choice to be had here, too. But, even with <a href=\"https://www.homebrewing.org/2-Hearted-Clone_p_518.html\">a kit</a>, the process is much more involved than just ordering a pint. I also have <a href=\"http://rogueestate.com/\">friends who are great cooks</a>. When we all get together, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/k1ds3ns4t10n/6114071558/\">it&#8217;s a party</a>.</p>\n<p>But, that party is <em>about</em> the food and drink, about sharing the process and the product. It&#8217;s not a simple date night: The choices are the focus as much as the participants. It&#8217;s a chance to show off and try new things, become experts ourselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"power-and-ease-of-use\"><span id=\"Power_and_ease_of_use\">Power and ease of use</span></h2>\n<p>Where am I going with this? Well, <a href=\"http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/todaysPodcast\">Dave Winer said this in a podcast</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In software, the tricky parts are where the power comes from, and the ease of use comes from where you limit the amount of options. The more limited the options, the easier it is, but the less powerful it is. It&#8217;s just an engineering tradeoff there. It&#8217;s like the tradeoff between heat and motion in physics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The folks at Apple are masters of tasting menus and wine pairings when it comes to consumer electronics. You pick Apple because you don&#8217;t want to think about most of the choices. They have experts in various forms of design, and their products are elegant, beautiful, and generally work great together. It&#8217;s blindingly obvious from their bank balance that this is something people are more than happy to pay for.</p>\n<p>Why? Because you have better things to do with your time than to futz with impedance mismatches and arcane interfaces. You know, like do the things for which you bought the gadgets in the first place (eg. work, play, communicate, etc).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, you have something like the Linux ecosystem. Therein, many others have made choices for you. But, all the choices are still open to you—and many <em>must</em> be made by you. The result is kind of a mess at times, with little or no top-down unifying vision. But, the grit and the loose coupling between the parts are the stuff of freedom. Freedom of choice is dirty and complex, especially when lots of players are involved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"choose-not-to-decide-or-diy\"><span id=\"Choose_not_to_decide_or_DIY\">Choose not to decide, or DIY</span></h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=OnxkfLe4G74#t=70s\">If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice</a>—you&#8217;ve just chosen to let an expert make most of the choices for you.</p>\n<p>What happens when disagree with some of those choices? If you&#8217;re lucky, you can ask for substitutions (or tweak some options). But, you might have to go to a different restaurant (ie. another manufacturer). If you&#8217;re really unlucky, you&#8217;ll find that you disagree with <em>almost all of the restaurants and manufacturers</em>. Sometimes, we just grin and bear it, because switching is too inconvenient.</p>\n<p>And beyond switching, do-it-yourself is just plain hard. You can crawl up the spectrum toward greater freedom-of-choice—but that demands greater knowledge, skill, and attention. You have to discover the choices, make them, and then track what you&#8217;ve done. In fact, it rises to the level of a <em>hobby</em> at a certain point, and you spend as much time (or more) on the infrastructure as the things it&#8217;s there to support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sharpen-the-saw\"><span id=\"Sharpen_the_saw\">Sharpen the saw</span></h2>\n<p>Here, I guess, it&#8217;s a personal decision: How much time are you willing to spend on the devices through which you do your thinking?

And, in technology, it&#8217;s no coincidence that more choice tends to be messier and complex, less choice tends to be cleaner and simple. It&#8217;s a trade-off between what you choose and what you leave up to an expert.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Tasting_menus_and_wine_pairings\">Tasting menus and wine pairings</span>\r\n\r\nMy wife and I like to go out a few times a year on date nights to nice restaurants. These restaurants have [tasting menus][1] with wine pairings. This is dinner on cruise control, and we let the chef drive. It&#8217;s great when it works, because the chef makes expert choices.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, it doesn&#8217;t work. There might be something we don&#8217;t like: Rabbit are pets, for instance. We&#8217;re not fans of seafood, though some menus have surprised us. We also have food allergies. Usually—though not always—we can ask for a substitution. Otherwise, we chalk it up to adventure.\r\n\r\nBut, overall, ordering from the tasting menu and trying the wine pairings makes date night simple with a side of novelty. It&#8217;s on the high end of freedom from choice. We choose to go out, and we choose the restaurant, but we leave the rest to experts.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Suds_and_swine\">Suds and swine</span>\r\n\r\nOn the other end of things, I like to make homebrew—[zymurgy][2], not software. There&#8217;s a spectrum of choice to be had here, too. But, even with [a kit][3], the process is much more involved than just ordering a pint. I also have [friends who are great cooks][4]. When we all get together, [it&#8217;s a party][5].\r\n\r\nBut, that party is *about* the food and drink, about sharing the process and the product. It&#8217;s not a simple date night: The choices are the focus as much as the participants. It&#8217;s a chance to show off and try new things, become experts ourselves.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Power_and_ease_of_use\">Power and ease of use</span>\r\n\r\nWhere am I going with this? Well, [Dave Winer said this in a podcast][6]:\r\n\r\n> In software, the tricky parts are where the power comes from, and the ease of use comes from where you limit the amount of options. The more limited the options, the easier it is, but the less powerful it is. It&#8217;s just an engineering tradeoff there.

But, it feels like the space is really on fire now, since the advent of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML5\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/html5?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML5</a> tech and the recent moves by <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a> and Google toward truly &#8220;appifying&#8221; these things to compete with offerings from iOS and Android. Lots of pieces have come into alignment, and <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Kilimanjaro\">great things are coming together</a>—<a href=\"http://groovecoder.com/2012/09/12/facebook-never-bet-on-html5/\">never mind what the folks at Facebook say</a>.</p>\n<p>So, I think I&#8217;m going to build a simple app and blog about it. And, these days, the first thing I think about when starting a web app is: How do I get it onto the web?</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"start-on-the-web\"><span id=\"Start_on_the_web\">Start on the web</span></h2>\n<p>Okay, so getting on the web is not the <em>first</em> thing. The <em>very</em> first thing is to create a new <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard\">github.com</a> repo (complete with <code>README.md</code> and <code>.gitignore</code>) and then:</p>\n<pre><code>cd ~/Dropbox/Public/\ngit clone git@github.com:lmorchard/my-project.git\ncd my-project</code></pre>\n<p>And <em>then</em>, I start thinking about getting it onto the web.</p>\n<p>That might sound backward: If all I have is a <code>README</code>, aren&#8217;t I jumping the gun? Well, no—I like to iterate, especially when experimenting with something new. Start simple, try one little thing, repeat. And, because this is a new pan-device world we&#8217;re living in, I&#8217;m often sitting on my couch hacking with a laptop in front, tablet to the left, and phone to the right.</p>\n<p>So, before I even write the first line of &#8220;Hello world&#8221; in <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML</a>, I want to have a way to get at it from all the gadgets. If it were just my laptop, I could open a <code>file://</code> URL and be done with it. Oh, but not really: Many of the new <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML5\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/html5?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML5</a>-and-friends technologies depend on things like domain origins and real HTTP connections.</p>\n<p>I could <a href=\"http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/tech-tip-really-simple-http-server-python\">start up a disposable HTTP server in the project directory</a> on my laptop and point the other gadgets at that. That works, to some extent. But, that&#8217;s limited to my LAN, I can&#8217;t share it with others for quick alpha testing, and I can&#8217;t check it out when I&#8217;m away from home and the laptop is closed.</p>\n<p>That leaves me with my own web server. But, you know, that&#8217;s a pain in the butt and I&#8217;m getting tired of being sysadmin to my own server. Let&#8217;s take it to the cloud!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-i-abuse-github-pages\"><span id=\"How_I_abuse_Github_Pages\">How I (ab)use Github Pages</span></h2>\n<p>Since I started with GitHub, <em>my project is already on the web</em>. Or, mostly it is, but just not exactly how I&#8217;d like it. To get the project published at a URL, this is what I do:</p>\n<pre><code>git co -b gh-pages\ngit push origin gh-pages\ngit co master</code></pre>\n<p>Give it a few, and you&#8217;ll receive an email from <a href=\"http://pages.github.com/\">Github Pages</a> (re: <code>[my-project] Page build successful</code>). Give it a few more, since this is the first time for the project. Shortly, the <code>README</code> shows up at an URL like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>http://lmorchard.github.com/my-project/README.md</code></pre>\n<p>After that, whenever I want to publish updates to the app, this is what I do:</p>\n<pre><code>git co gh-pages\ngit rebase master\ngit push origin gh-pages\ngit co master</code></pre>\n<p>And, within seconds (usually), my app is updated on the web. With free hosting, because the folks at GitHub are really nice.</p>\n<p>But, though this works nicely for an app demo or beta, try not to abuse their hospitality by using your <a href=\"http://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> URL as the official distribution point for your app.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-i-abuse-dropbox\"><span id=\"How_I_abuse_Dropbox\">How I (ab)use Dropbox</span></h2>\n<p>You know, all that committing and pushing and rebasing can really get tiresome. And, it craps up my commit history while I&#8217;m just kind of twiddling some bits back and forth to see what happens. We&#8217;re living in the future, damn it, I don&#8217;t have to put up with this!</p>\n<p>And, so, I don&#8217;t. Maybe you noticed that I ran <code>git clone</code> from inside my <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/help/16/en\">Dropbox Public folder</a>. Anything in that folder <em>is already on the web</em>: Each file has a public URL, and I can acquire it with a right-click in Finder (ie. Dropbox &gt; Copy Public Link). The result is something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>https://dl.dropbox.com/u/279855/my-project/README.md</code></pre>\n<p>It&#8217;s a crufty URL, but an URL nonetheless. Dropbox public links also mirror the folder structure, so that an <code>index.html</code> can load all the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"CSS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">CSS</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> it wants from relative URLs just like a normal web host.</p>\n<p>With Dropbox, then, my hacking cycle with Dropbox looks like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Save in MacVim</li>\n<li>Switch to Firefox</li>\n<li>Refresh</li>\n<li>Repeat</li>\n</ol>\n<p>More often than not, my app has gotten updated on the Dropbox servers somewhere between steps #1 and #3. That&#8217;s a much tighter iteration loop than doing the GitHub dance. In fact, it&#8217;s pretty much indistinguishable from just working on my laptop with <code>file://</code> URLs or a disposable HTTP server on my LAN.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s some bad news, though. I&#8217;ve just read that <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/help/16/en\">new accounts created after 7/31/2012 no longer get a Public folder</a>. So, it would seem that the days of carefree hosting-by-Public-folder are on the way out. But fret not: the folks at Dropbox have <a href=\"https://tech.dropbox.com/?p=345\">provided an alternative for hosting static web apps under development</a>.

But, it feels like the space is really on fire now, since the advent of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML5\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/html5?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML5</a> tech and the recent moves by <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a> and Google toward truly &#8220;appifying&#8221; these things to compete with offerings from iOS and Android. Lots of pieces have come into alignment, and [great things are coming together][3]—[never mind what the folks at Facebook say][4].\r\n\r\nSo, I think I&#8217;m going to build a simple app and blog about it. And, these days, the first thing I think about when starting a web app is: How do I get it onto the web?\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Start_on_the_web\">Start on the web</span>\r\n\r\nOkay, so getting on the web is not the *first* thing. The *very* first thing is to create a new [github.com][5] repo (complete with `README.md` and `.gitignore`) and then:\r\n\r\n    cd ~/Dropbox/Public/\r\n    git clone git@github.com:lmorchard/my-project.git\r\n    cd my-project\r\n    \r\n\r\nAnd *then*, I start thinking about getting it onto the web.\r\n\r\nThat might sound backward: If all I have is a `README`, aren&#8217;t I jumping the gun? Well, no—I like to iterate, especially when experimenting with something new. Start simple, try one little thing, repeat. And, because this is a new pan-device world we&#8217;re living in, I&#8217;m often sitting on my couch hacking with a laptop in front, tablet to the left, and phone to the right.\r\n\r\nSo, before I even write the first line of &#8220;Hello world&#8221; in <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML</a>, I want to have a way to get at it from all the gadgets. If it were just my laptop, I could open a `file://` URL and be done with it. Oh, but not really: Many of the new <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML5\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/html5?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML5</a>-and-friends technologies depend on things like domain origins and real HTTP connections.\r\n\r\nI could [start up a disposable HTTP server in the project directory][6] on my laptop and point the other gadgets at that. That works, to some extent. But, that&#8217;s limited to my LAN, I can&#8217;t share it with others for quick alpha testing, and I can&#8217;t check it out when I&#8217;m away from home and the laptop is closed.\r\n\r\nThat leaves me with my own web server. But, you know, that&#8217;s a pain in the butt and I&#8217;m getting tired of being sysadmin to my own server. Let&#8217;s take it to the cloud!\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"How_I_abuse_Github_Pages\">How I (ab)use Github Pages</span>\r\n\r\nSince I started with GitHub, *my project is already on the web*. Or, mostly it is, but just not exactly how I&#8217;d like it. To get the project published at a URL, this is what I do:\r\n\r\n    git co -b gh-pages\r\n    git push origin gh-pages\r\n    git co master\r\n    \r\n\r\nGive it a few, and you&#8217;ll receive an email from [Github Pages][7] (re: `[my-project] Page build successful`). Give it a few more, since this is the first time for the project. Shortly, the `README` shows up at an URL like the following:\r\n\r\n    http://lmorchard.github.com/my-project/README.md\r\n    \r\n\r\nAfter that, whenever I want to publish updates to the app, this is what I do:\r\n\r\n    git co gh-pages\r\n    git rebase master\r\n    git push origin gh-pages\r\n    git co master\r\n    \r\n\r\nAnd, within seconds (usually), my app is updated on the web. With free hosting, because the folks at GitHub are really nice.\r\n\r\nBut, though this works nicely for an app demo or beta, try not to abuse their hospitality by using your [GitHub Pages][7] URL as the official distribution point for your app.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"How_I_abuse_Dropbox\">How I (ab)use Dropbox</span>\r\n\r\nYou know, all that committing and pushing and rebasing can really get tiresome. And, it craps up my commit history while I&#8217;m just kind of twiddling some bits back and forth to see what happens. We&#8217;re living in the future, damn it, I don&#8217;t have to put up with this!\r\n\r\nAnd, so, I don&#8217;t. Maybe you noticed that I ran `git clone` from inside my [Dropbox Public folder][8]. Anything in that folder *is already on the web*: Each file has a public URL, and I can acquire it with a right-click in Finder (ie. Dropbox > Copy Public Link). The result is something like this:\r\n\r\n    https://dl.dropbox.com/u/279855/my-project/README.md\r\n    \r\n\r\nIt&#8217;s a crufty URL, but an URL nonetheless. Dropbox public links also mirror the folder structure, so that an `index.html` can load all the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"CSS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">CSS</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> it wants from relative URLs just like a normal web host.\r\n\r\nWith Dropbox, then, my hacking cycle with Dropbox looks like this:\r\n\r\n1.  Save in MacVim\r\n2.  Switch to Firefox\r\n3.  Refresh\r\n4.  Repeat\r\n\r\nMore often than not, my app has gotten updated on the Dropbox servers somewhere between steps #1 and #3. That&#8217;s a much tighter iteration loop than doing the GitHub dance. In fact, it&#8217;s pretty much indistinguishable from just working on my laptop with `file://` URLs or a disposable HTTP server on my LAN.\r\n\r\nThere&#8217;s some bad news, though. I&#8217;ve just read that [new accounts created after 7/31/2012 no longer get a Public folder][8]. So, it would seem that the days of carefree hosting-by-Public-folder are on the way out. But fret not: the folks at Dropbox have [provided an alternative for hosting static web apps under development][9]. They&#8217;ve also opened up their API for use by open <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"web apps\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Apps?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">web apps</a> with [dropbox-js][10]. In fact, this API will play a part in the app about which I plan to blog.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"How_I_use_Amazon_S3\">How I use Amazon S3</span>\r\n\r\nSo, (ab)using GitHub and Dropbox for hosting your app under development is fine and dandy. But, you definitely don&#8217;t want to rely on them for publishing your app for wider distribution. [There ain&#8217;t no such thing as a free lunch][11] (TANSTAAFL), and someone&#8217;s bound to shut you down or send you a bill—best to get that out of the way up front.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, [Amazon Web Services][12] will happily accept [the change from your penny jar][13] to serve up small collections of web content. Well, they will after you&#8217;ve turned the physical pennies into numbers in a bank account, but my point is that Amazon S3 is *[super cheap][13]*. And, since I&#8217;m talking about a single-page web app here, [plain old static web hosting][14] is all you need for now.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if you own a domain name, you can control the URL from which S3 serves up your content. Basically, you just:\r\n\r\n1.  create a DNS record with a CNAME to S3 (eg. `my-project.lmorchard.com` -> `s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`);\r\n2.  [create a bucket named for your domain][15] (eg. `my-project.lmorchard.com`);\r\n3.  [check a box in the properties panel to enable static hosting][16].\r\n\r\nThe above is vaguely more advanced than either GitHub or Dropbox, but this is playing with power. And, with great power comes great responsibility to read the fine manual. Still, it&#8217;s not that hard and it&#8217;s not that spendy.\r\n\r\n### <span id=\"How_I_make_Amazon_S3_work_like_Dropbox\">How I make Amazon S3 work like Dropbox</span>\r\n\r\nSo, great: You&#8217;ve got Amazon S3 serving content at a URL of your choice.

    "html": "<p>So, I&#8217;m a couple of weeks back from a well-deserved vacation taken after the launch of a project well over 18 months in the making. I kind of overworked myself, voluntarily, and that needs to change.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>What project? <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/kuma\">Kuma</a> on <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org\">developer.mozilla.org</a>. What&#8217;s that? Well, it&#8217;s generally described as a wiki, but though I think we&#8217;ve gone a long way away from &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki\">The simplest online database that could possibly work</a>&#8220;. At this point, it&#8217;s a content management system, complete with revision management, WYSIWYG, collaboration, community, and localization features. It&#8217;s a wiki insofar as anyone can edit it, but <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kuma\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Getting_started_with_Kuma?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Kuma</a>&#8217;s not exactly simple.</p>\n<p>The parts I had the heaviest hand in were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/blob/master/apps/dekicompat/management/commands/migrate_to_kuma_wiki.py\">Content migration from the previous incarnation</a>, which employed the <a href=\"http://www.mindtouch.com/\">MindTouch</a> platform to a very full extent;</li>\n<li>Development of <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript\">KumaScript</a>, a server-side <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> platform for dynamic content heavily inspired by (ie. cribbed entirely from) <a href=\"http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/DekiScript\">DekiScript</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As it turns out, those were two of the hardest parts of the project. No, I wasn&#8217;t alone: I&#8217;m a member of a team, and my teammates did plenty of work themselves. But, I&#8217;ve found that I have a lot in common with <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mordin_Solus\">Mordin Solus</a>, a fact that made me actually cry during this scene:</p>\n<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'></span></p>\n<p>(Spoiler alert: Mordin gets blown up.)</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why I say this was a self-imposed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_march_%28project_management%29\">death march</a>. No one nailed me to my desk, and no one on my team was a slacker.

I kind of overworked myself, voluntarily, and that needs to change.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhat project? [Kuma][1] on [developer.mozilla.org][2]. What&#8217;s that? Well, it&#8217;s generally described as a wiki, but though I think we&#8217;ve gone a long way away from &#8220;[The simplest online database that could possibly work][3]&#8220;. At this point, it&#8217;s a content management system, complete with revision management, WYSIWYG, collaboration, community, and localization features. It&#8217;s a wiki insofar as anyone can edit it, but <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kuma\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Getting_started_with_Kuma?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Kuma</a>&#8217;s not exactly simple.\r\n\r\nThe parts I had the heaviest hand in were:\r\n\r\n*   [Content migration from the previous incarnation][4], which employed the [MindTouch][5] platform to a very full extent;\r\n*   Development of [KumaScript][6], a server-side <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> platform for dynamic content heavily inspired by (ie. cribbed entirely from) [DekiScript][7].\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, those were two of the hardest parts of the project. No, I wasn&#8217;t alone: I&#8217;m a member of a team, and my teammates did plenty of work themselves. But, I&#8217;ve found that I have a lot in common with [Mordin Solus][8], a fact that made me actually cry during this scene:\r\n\r\n<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'></span>\r\n\r\n(Spoiler alert: Mordin gets blown up.)\r\n\r\nThat&#8217;s why I say this was a self-imposed [death march][9]. No one nailed me to my desk, and no one on my team was a slacker. In fact, although there was a lot of pressure to get this project out the door ASAP, managers and others quite often told me to take it easier. And furthermore, working on myself to ease up on this particularly neurotic sentiment was a major theme of recent performance reviews.\r\n\r\nSo, to be clear: This is about me, and not my team.

It makes no sense to demand that a JavaScript ninja or a CSS artisan also be a Python-wielding sysadmin, so we&#39;re trying to build <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webdev:DevBoxVMImages\">ready-baked VMs for our projects</a>.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/erix/3998080471/\" style=\"display: block; float: right; text-decoration: none; border: none; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\"><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/images/cloud-box.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px\" /><br /><small>Lieferung 3 by erix on Flickr</small></a></p>\n<p>Firefox is more than just a desktop browser, and Mozilla is more than just Firefox. An ever-growing mass of our code is going toward building web sites and services that <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering\">build</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/\">ship</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/AUS\">update</a>, <a href=\"http://support.mozilla.com/\">support</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Engagement\">promote</a>, <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/\">augment</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/\">document</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/sync/\">sync</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/F1\">share</a>, <a href=\"http://identity.mozilla.com/\">identify</a>, and <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Socorro\">report</a>. (And I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing a further cast of hundreds, here.) </p>\n<h3 id=\"sighting-storm-clouds-on-the-horizon\">Sighting storm clouds on the horizon</h3>\n<p>In other words, more and more of Mozilla is in the <em>cloud</em>. Unfortunately, many of these projects are really hard to get into as a contributor. It&#39;s often hard to find what needs doing in Bugzilla, and it&#39;s often hard to get the code up and running in a meaningful way without being both a bit of a sysadmin and a Mozilla insider.</p>\n<p>This is a huge problem. Although Mozilla has a core group of employees, we&#39;re not nearly enough to build all of these projects and pursue <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/about/mission.html\">the mission</a> on our own. We&#39;ve gotten to where we are thanks to the volunteer efforts of thousands of contributors—and the only way we&#39;ll get where we want to go is through the efforts of thousands (or *<a href=\"http://commonspace.wordpress.com/2011/02/22/nmm-redux/\">millions</a>*) more. The good news is that is feels like we&#39;re <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mozilla.org/Contribute\">waking up to this problem</a> and starting to get <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo\">really serious about it</a>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"sharing-recipes-for-fluffy-clouds\">Sharing recipes for fluffy clouds</h3>\n<p>For my part, I&#39;ve spent idle time over the past few years trying to work out how to make webdev projects more accessible to new contributors. We&#39;ve come a long way from the days of just uploading WordPress to an FTP server; these things come with a lot of moving parts nowadays, and the <code>INSTALL.txt</code> files run long and consume weekends. And so, they filter out all but the most dedicated (or masochistic) volunteers.</p>\n<p>For months, I spun my wheels playing with virtual machines and exporting appliances, doing a lot of things by hand. But then, earlier this year, I discovered both <a href=\"http://vagrantup.com/\">Vagrant</a> and <a href=\"http://www.puppetlabs.com/\">Puppet</a> and had my mind blown. With those tools, I could share recipes for VMs right alongside my code. </p>\n<p>I would never have to set up a webdev environment for myself by hand again—all the fiddly bits of installation and configuration could be codified, checked into github, and flushed from my brain.  But, the real magic is that I could <em>share</em> this stuff. So, future coworkers and collaborators could benefit from the same reproducible dev enviroments—<em>never having wasted brainpower and weekends on an INSTALL.txt to begin with</em>. </p>\n<p>This is a really big deal. I <a href=\"http://lanyrd.com/2011/osbridge/sdxby/\">presented on it this past June at Open Source Bridge</a> in Portland (<a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2011/06/os-webdev-vm/slides.html\">slides</a>). I&#39;ve been talking myself blue about this stuff for months, in opposition to my usual serially enthuastic habits. But, it looks like I&#39;ve infected my coworkers at Mozilla, because now we&#39;re talking about <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2011/10/04/developing-with-vagrant-puppet-and-playdoh/\">developing with Vagrant, Puppet, and Playdoh</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-assembly-required\">No assembly required</h3>\n<p>So, with <a href=\"http://vagrantup.com/\">Vagrant</a>, <a href=\"http://www.puppetlabs.com/\">Puppet</a>, and <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2011/10/04/developing-with-vagrant-puppet-and-playdoh/\">Playdoh</a>, we&#39;ll have projects that you can fire up with just a <code>git clone</code> and a <code>vagrant up</code> in a command line shell. Forget about <a href=\"http://macports.org/\">MacPorts</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/\">Homebrew</a> on Mac OS X, or whatever it is that people using Windows have to install. Take a bike ride or go to lunch, and you&#39;ll have a fully configured server running and source code ready for hacking.</p>\n<p>I think we can do better, though. For one, spinning up a fairly complex virtual machine from scratch with <a href=\"http://vagrantup.com/\">Vagrant</a> and <a href=\"http://www.puppetlabs.com/\">Puppet</a> takes a long time and a lot of bandwidth. This can be sped up by <a href=\"http://vagrantup.com/docs/boxes.html\">packaging pre-built boxes</a>. So, one improvement we can pursue is to spin up VMs with Vagrant as a part of our continual integration and deployment processes and package boxes for public download.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>At Mozilla, we're redoubling efforts to attract contributors. And, in the Webdev team, we're [using virtual machines][playdoh] to make it even easier to get started hacking. It makes no sense to demand that a JavaScript ninja or a CSS artisan also be a Python-wielding sysadmin, so we're trying to build [ready-baked VMs for our projects][devimages].</em>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/erix/3998080471/\" style=\"display: block; float: right; text-decoration: none; border: none; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\"><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/images/cloud-box.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px\" /><br /><small>Lieferung 3 by erix on Flickr</small></a>\r\n\r\nFirefox is more than just a desktop browser, and Mozilla is more than just Firefox. An ever-growing mass of our code is going toward building web sites and services that [build][releng], [ship][downloads], [update][aus], [support][sumo], [promote][promote], [augment][amo], [document][mdn], [sync][sync], [share][share], [identify][identity], and [report][socorro]. (And I'm sure I'm missing a further cast of hundreds, here.) \r\n\r\n### Sighting storm clouds on the horizon\r\n\r\nIn other words, more and more of Mozilla is in the *cloud*. Unfortunately, many of these projects are really hard to get into as a contributor. It's often hard to find what needs doing in Bugzilla, and it's often hard to get the code up and running in a meaningful way without being both a bit of a sysadmin and a Mozilla insider.\r\n\r\nThis is a huge problem. Although Mozilla has a core group of employees, we're not nearly enough to build all of these projects and pursue [the mission][mission] on our own. We've gotten to where we are thanks to the volunteer efforts of thousands of contributors—and the only way we'll get where we want to go is through the efforts of thousands (or *[millions][]*) more. The good news is that is feels like we're [waking up to this problem][contribute] and starting to get [really serious about it][remo]. \r\n\r\n### Sharing recipes for fluffy clouds\r\n\r\nFor my part, I've spent idle time over the past few years trying to work out how to make webdev projects more accessible to new contributors. We've come a long way from the days of just uploading WordPress to an FTP server; these things come with a lot of moving parts nowadays, and the `INSTALL.txt` files run long and consume weekends. And so, they filter out all but the most dedicated (or masochistic) volunteers.\r\n\r\nFor months, I spun my wheels playing with virtual machines and exporting appliances, doing a lot of things by hand. But then, earlier this year, I discovered both [Vagrant][] and [Puppet][] and had my mind blown. With those tools, I could share recipes for VMs right alongside my code. \r\n\r\nI would never have to set up a webdev environment for myself by hand again—all the fiddly bits of installation and configuration could be codified, checked into github, and flushed from my brain.  But, the real magic is that I could *share* this stuff. So, future coworkers and collaborators could benefit from the same reproducible dev enviroments—*never having wasted brainpower and weekends on an INSTALL.txt to begin with*. \r\n\r\nThis is a really big deal. I [presented on it this past June at Open Source Bridge][osbridge] in Portland ([slides][]). I've been talking myself blue about this stuff for months, in opposition to my usual serially enthuastic habits. But, it looks like I've infected my coworkers at Mozilla, because now we're talking about [developing with Vagrant, Puppet, and Playdoh][playdoh].\r\n\r\n### No assembly required\r\n\r\nSo, with [Vagrant][], [Puppet][], and [Playdoh][], we'll have projects that you can fire up with just a `git clone` and a `vagrant up` in a command line shell. Forget about [MacPorts][] or [Homebrew][] on Mac OS X, or whatever it is that people using Windows have to install. Take a bike ride or go to lunch, and you'll have a fully configured server running and source code ready for hacking.\r\n\r\nI think we can do better, though. For one, spinning up a fairly complex virtual machine from scratch with [Vagrant][] and [Puppet][] takes a long time and a lot of bandwidth. This can be sped up by [packaging pre-built boxes][boxes]. So, one improvement we can pursue is to spin up VMs with Vagrant as a part of our continual integration and deployment processes and package boxes for public download. These are also handy on a thumb drive for sharing at hack events and meetups.\r\n\r\nThis still requires [Vagrant][] and working with the command-line, though. Not everyone who has something valuable to contribute is a command-line jockey. And, a few of us webdevs have run into issues with [Vagrant][]—it's still early days for that project, after all. Additionally, not everyone who could be a Mozilla contributor owns the kind of hardware necessary to support running a substantial virtual machine.\r\n\r\nSo, I've also started playing with [Puppet][] by itself, to build plain-vanilla VM appliances and to spin up cloud servers on [Amazon EC2][ec2] and [Rackspace Cloud Servers][rackspace]. It's going pretty well, and it's conceivable we could do without [Vagrant][] to script the build of [downloadable VM appliances][ovf] and to spin up disposable cloud servers.\r\n\r\n### So, now what?\r\n\r\nThere are still some issues to be worked out, so [I've started a wiki page][devimages]. And, we need to spread the word that we're doing this to see what people think—and more importantly, see if this helps attract more help. From my years at Mozilla so far and bouncing between projects, VM appliances are things I wish I'd had when faced with a new project.

Well, I putzed around and didn&#39;t get far, so I&#39;m starting\nover with something more immediately useful.</em></p>\n<img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/images/badger-logo-working.png\" style=\"width:98%; display: block\" />\n\n<p><em>(This is an awesome illustration by <a href=\"http://seanmartell.com/\">Sean\nMartell</a>, used entirely without permission.\nI&#39;ll take it down if anyone gets mad.)</em></p>\n<p>Almost a year ago, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2010/07/badger-article/\">I wrote about building a badging service for\nall of Mozilla</a>. </p>\n<p>In a nutshell, I left the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/gen/4784616521/\">2010 Mozilla Summit</a>\nwanting to build a tool that empowered people to craft social objects\nrepresenting achievement and gratitude, and give them to each other.</p>\n<p>Since then, I&#39;ve <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/badger\">played around with a prototype in Django with\nPinax</a>.  But, I abandoned that thing due to getting super\nbusy with the Firefox 4 release. It also didn&#39;t help that I was a\nDjango newb and that I got caught up in screwing around with shiny\nthings like <a href=\"http://pinaxproject.com\">Pinax</a> and <a href=\"http://lettuce.it\">Lettuce</a> and neglected the actual feature\nset.</p>\n<p>So now, finally, <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/badger2\">I&#39;m picking the thread back up again</a>. This\ntime, with a little less ambition and a few more practical aims.</p>\n<h3 id=\"make-something-more-useful-right-away\">Make something more useful right away</h3>\n<p>While I <em>have</em> spent some dangerous time screwing around with shinies like\n<a href=\"http://vagrantup.com\">Vagrant</a>, <a href=\"http://pupetlabs.com\">Puppet</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/playdoh\">Playdoh</a>, I think I&#39;ve gotten that\nmostly out of my system and have gotten down to work <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/badger2/commits/master\">as of last\nnight</a>.</p>\n<p>Rather than build a Grand Central Station for badges, I&#39;ve reset my\ngoals to a progression of practical results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a reusable Django app that supports some basic use cases of\ncreating and awarding badges to users.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms\">Activity Stream</a>s narrating <a href=\"http://wiki.activitystrea.ms/w/page/27189812/Badge\">badge claims</a></li>\n<li>Add support for <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PubSubHubbub</a> with Badger activity streams</li>\n<li>Add a REST API, maybe with OAuth</li>\n<li>Accept badges for local users, via <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PuSH</a> from\nexternal sites</li>\n<li>See what the <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges\">Open Badges Project</a> is up to, and how Badger can\nfit in with their goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea here is to make Badger a practical, reusable, drop-in app for\nexisting sites—preferably (but not necessarily) the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/playdoh\">Playdoh</a>-flavored sites we&#39;re building at Mozilla. Then,\nincrementally and optionally empower a Badger-enabled site to become a\nbadge hub by accepting reports of badge claims from other\nBadger-enabled sites.</p>\n<h3 id=\"take-baby-steps-to-federation\">Take baby steps to federation</h3>\n<p>So, for example, let&#39;s say we dropped Badger into a few sites like\nthese:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://developer.mozilla.org\">http://developer.mozilla.org</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.mozilla.com\">http://support.mozilla.com</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://addons.mozilla.org\">http://addons.mozilla.org</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At first, Badger would just augment those sites with badging\nfacilities for their respective user bases. That could fill some needs\nright away.</p>\n<p>Then, say we built a site that offered personal profiles to members of\nthe Mozilla community.  With the <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms\">Activity Stream</a> and <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PuSH</a>\naugmentations, users could connect their profiles with each of the\nother Mozilla sites they use.  That way, whenever they claim a badge\nout there, it gets delivered to their community profile.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-bother-federating-at-all\">Why bother federating at all?</h3>\n<p>If the only cross-site goal to build an all-in-one display case for\nbadges on a community profile, I could just build JSON feeds and wrap\nthem in a JS-based widget. In fact, <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/1.0/\">a JSON-formatted Activity\nStream</a> will work nicely for that. Drop that into the profile\npage, and we&#39;re done.</p>\n<p>There are lots of reasons to federate. But, at least one thing not supported by\nthis solution are <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2010/07/badger-article/#section-105\">meta-badges</a>. That is, badges awarded for badges.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s say you close 100 bugs on Bugzilla, answer 100 questions on\nSUMO, edit 100 pages of documentation on MDN, and author 100 add-ons.\nAnd, let&#39;s say you get badges on the respective sites for all of those\nactivities.</p>\n<p>Well, now, I&#39;d like to give you a badge on your community profile for\nbeing a <strong>Mozilla Superhero</strong>. I could just do that by hand, having\nobserved all your greatness. But, I&#39;d rather the system just do that\nautomatically.</p>\n<p>If your community profile treated all your badges from your chosen affiliated\nsites as first-class citizens, then I could build the meta-badge\ntrigger right there.</p>\n<p>Of course, I could also write a program that monitors badge feeds from\nvarious sites. Then, use the community profile site&#39;s Badger API to\nissue a badge when the conditions are met. But, as maintainer of the\nmonitoring program, I&#39;d have to keep track of what feeds where count\nfor which people, which could be a mess.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s still some thinking to do here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-about-identity-and-co-opting-badges\">What about identity and co-opting badges?</h3>\n<p>I&#39;m still thinking through how someone connects a profile to other\nsites. As in, how can Badger ensure that the owner of the community\nprofile is also the owner of a badge claim feed on MDN?  Maybe some\nkind of OAuth dance that results in a <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PuSH</a> subscription between\nsites?</p>\n<p>Consider the least-capable federation case: a Badger-compatible feed\nhosted as a static file on Amazon S3. And, by Badger-compatible, I\nmean an <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms\">Activity Stream</a> that contains <a href=\"http://wiki.activitystrea.ms/w/page/27189812/Badge\">badge claims</a>. You\nshouldn&#39;t need my specific implementation of Badger-in-Django to\nproduce one of those.</p>\n<p>Although <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PuSH</a> is still the ideal case (I think), occasional\npolling of an <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms\">Activity Stream</a> feed should still be supported. If a\nuser connects that up to their community profile, we just have to take\ntheir word for it. We&#39;d rely on community members to\nflag stinkers trying to claim badge feeds that aren&#39;t theirs.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, there&#39;s probably some crypto-voodoo we can invoke here,\nfor cases where badge claim validity really matters—as opposed to the\nfun and games I have in mind for Mozilla.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-about-the-open-badges-project\">What about the Open Badges Project?</h3>\n<p>From various conversations over the past year, it sounds to me like\nthe <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges\">Open Badges Project</a> is getting the parts in place to do even\nmore interesting federation of badges that gives ownership of the\nbadge hub to the user.</p>\n<p>In that scenario, you have a backpack in your browser and can carry\nyour badge claims with you between sites with no prior coordination\nbetween the sites themselves. </p>\n<p>This sounds like something in which Badger should be able to\nparticipate, eventually. If not as a hub, Badger should at least offer\nthe tools to create and award badges that work with the user-owned hub\nscheme.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-what-next\">So, what next?</h3>\n<p>Now that I&#39;ve written all this out, I need to hack on it. If you&#39;re\ninterested in this stuff, let me know. That way, it&#39;ll look like\nsomeone might actually find this stuff handy when I get something\nworking!</p>\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=70: -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-256743407\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=afd2a7efeaad01509a571bae031dfc5c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">David Boswell</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-256743407\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-07-19T01:18:24\">2011-07-19T01:18:24</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Very cool to see an update on Badger.  I'm definitely interested in this and would love to see something like this show up in the Mozillians phonebook that will be ready soonish :)\nDavid</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-257292756\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://briks.si\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=29e2f1888cdcc9c451d32ab902d5a19c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://briks.si\">Brian King</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-257292756\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-07-19T15:12:01\">2011-07-19T15:12:01</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Over at the Mozilla Reps program, we are discussing the possible use of badges - https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-257331862\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://kanai.net/weblog/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gkanai.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://kanai.net/weblog/\">Gen Kanai</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-257331862\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-07-19T15:48:22\">2011-07-19T15:48:22</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Agreed with DBos.

It's using core template loaders and shortcuts, so switching over to standard stuff shouldn't be an issue for the views and models.\nI'm hoping at some point to put together some more Django-conventional template tags and templates toward that end, unless someone gets to it before me in a pull request (patches welcome!). Really, I think the template tags are the more important thing, since any templates out of the box will likely get overridden on a real site.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-301119028\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.integrating-technology.org/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/nelliemuller.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.integrating-technology.org/\">Dr. Nellie Deutsch</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-301119028\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-09-02T14:07:45\">2011-09-02T14:07:45</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I love the idea, Leslie.  I've been heading a self-funded organization that provides free online professional development workshops for educators around the world since 2006.

Well, I putzed around and didn't get far, so I'm starting\r\nover with something more immediately useful.</em>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/images/badger-logo-working.png\" style=\"width:98%; display: block\" />\r\n\r\n<em>(This is an awesome illustration by [Sean\r\nMartell](http://seanmartell.com/), used entirely without permission.\r\nI'll take it down if anyone gets mad.)</em>\r\n\r\nAlmost a year ago, [I wrote about building a badging service for\r\nall of Mozilla][badger-paper]. \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I left the [2010 Mozilla Summit](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gen/4784616521/)\r\nwanting to build a tool that empowered people to craft social objects\r\nrepresenting achievement and gratitude, and give them to each other.\r\n\r\nSince then, I've [played around with a prototype in Django with\r\nPinax][badger1].  But, I abandoned that thing due to getting super\r\nbusy with the Firefox 4 release. It also didn't help that I was a\r\nDjango newb and that I got caught up in screwing around with shiny\r\nthings like [Pinax][] and [Lettuce][] and neglected the actual feature\r\nset.\r\n\r\nSo now, finally, [I'm picking the thread back up again][badger2]. This\r\ntime, with a little less ambition and a few more practical aims.\r\n\r\n### Make something more useful right away\r\n\r\nWhile I *have* spent some dangerous time screwing around with shinies like\r\n[Vagrant][], [Puppet][], and [Playdoh][], I think I've gotten that\r\nmostly out of my system and have gotten down to work [as of last\r\nnight][work].\r\n\r\n[work]: https://github.com/lmorchard/badger2/commits/master\r\n\r\nRather than build a Grand Central Station for badges, I've reset my\r\ngoals to a progression of practical results:\r\n\r\n* Build a reusable Django app that supports some basic use cases of\r\n  creating and awarding badges to users.\r\n* Add [Activity Stream][]s narrating [badge claims][]\r\n* Add support for [PubSubHubbub][push] with Badger activity streams\r\n* Add a REST API, maybe with OAuth\r\n* Accept badges for local users, via [PuSH][] from\r\n  external sites\r\n* See what the [Open Badges Project][] is up to, and how Badger can\r\n  fit in with their goals.\r\n\r\n[badge claims]: http://wiki.activitystrea.ms/w/page/27189812/Badge\r\n[Open Badges Project]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to make Badger a practical, reusable, drop-in app for\r\nexisting sites—preferably (but not necessarily) the\r\n[Playdoh][]-flavored sites we're building at Mozilla. Then,\r\nincrementally and optionally empower a Badger-enabled site to become a\r\nbadge hub by accepting reports of badge claims from other\r\nBadger-enabled sites.\r\n\r\n### Take baby steps to federation\r\n\r\nSo, for example, let's say we dropped Badger into a few sites like\r\nthese:\r\n\r\n* <http://developer.mozilla.org>;\r\n* <http://support.mozilla.com>;\r\n* <http://addons.mozilla.org>.\r\n\r\nAt first, Badger would just augment those sites with badging\r\nfacilities for their respective user bases. That could fill some needs\r\nright away.\r\n\r\nThen, say we built a site that offered personal profiles to members of\r\nthe Mozilla community.  With the [Activity Stream][] and [PuSH][]\r\naugmentations, users could connect their profiles with each of the\r\nother Mozilla sites they use.  That way, whenever they claim a badge\r\nout there, it gets delivered to their community profile.\r\n\r\n### Why bother federating at all?\r\n\r\nIf the only cross-site goal to build an all-in-one display case for\r\nbadges on a community profile, I could just build JSON feeds and wrap\r\nthem in a JS-based widget. In fact, [a JSON-formatted Activity\r\nStream][as-json] will work nicely for that. Drop that into the profile\r\npage, and we're done.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of reasons to federate. But, at least one thing not supported by\r\nthis solution are [meta-badges][]. That is, badges awarded for badges.\r\n\r\nLet's say you close 100 bugs on Bugzilla, answer 100 questions on\r\nSUMO, edit 100 pages of documentation on MDN, and author 100 add-ons.\r\nAnd, let's say you get badges on the respective sites for all of those\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nWell, now, I'd like to give you a badge on your community profile for\r\nbeing a **Mozilla Superhero**. I could just do that by hand, having\r\nobserved all your greatness. But, I'd rather the system just do that\r\nautomatically.\r\n\r\nIf your community profile treated all your badges from your chosen affiliated\r\nsites as first-class citizens, then I could build the meta-badge\r\ntrigger right there.\r\n\r\nOf course, I could also write a program that monitors badge feeds from\r\nvarious sites. Then, use the community profile site's Badger API to\r\nissue a badge when the conditions are met. But, as maintainer of the\r\nmonitoring program, I'd have to keep track of what feeds where count\r\nfor which people, which could be a mess.\r\n\r\nThere's still some thinking to do here.\r\n\r\n### What about identity and co-opting badges?\r\n\r\nI'm still thinking through how someone connects a profile to other\r\nsites. As in, how can Badger ensure that the owner of the community\r\nprofile is also the owner of a badge claim feed on MDN?  Maybe some\r\nkind of OAuth dance that results in a [PuSH][] subscription between\r\nsites?\r\n\r\nConsider the least-capable federation case: a Badger-compatible feed\r\nhosted as a static file on Amazon S3. And, by Badger-compatible, I\r\nmean an [Activity Stream][] that contains [badge claims][]. You\r\nshouldn't need my specific implementation of Badger-in-Django to\r\nproduce one of those.\r\n\r\nAlthough [PuSH][] is still the ideal case (I think), occasional\r\npolling of an [Activity Stream][] feed should still be supported. If a\r\nuser connects that up to their community profile, we just have to take\r\ntheir word for it. We'd rely on community members to\r\nflag stinkers trying to claim badge feeds that aren't theirs.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, there's probably some crypto-voodoo we can invoke here,\r\nfor cases where badge claim validity really matters—as opposed to the\r\nfun and games I have in mind for Mozilla.\r\n\r\n### What about the Open Badges Project?\r\n\r\nFrom various conversations over the past year, it sounds to me like\r\nthe [Open Badges Project][] is getting the parts in place to do even\r\nmore interesting federation of badges that gives ownership of the\r\nbadge hub to the user.\r\n\r\nIn that scenario, you have a backpack in your browser and can carry\r\nyour badge claims with you between sites with no prior coordination\r\nbetween the sites themselves. \r\n\r\nThis sounds like something in which Badger should be able to\r\nparticipate, eventually. If not as a hub, Badger should at least offer\r\nthe tools to create and award badges that work with the user-owned hub\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n### So, what next?\r\n\r\nNow that I've written all this out, I need to hack on it. If you're\r\ninterested in this stuff, let me know. That way, it'll look like\r\nsomeone might actually find this stuff handy when I get something\r\nworking!\r\n\r\n[as-json]: http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/1.0/\r\n[meta-badges]: http://decafbad.com/2010/07/badger-article/#section-105\r\n[activity stream]: http://activitystrea.ms\r\n[push]: http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\r\n[vagrant]: http://vagrantup.com\r\n[puppet]: http://pupetlabs.com\r\n[playdoh]: https://github.com/mozilla/playdoh\r\n[pinax]: http://pinaxproject.com\r\n[lettuce]: http://lettuce.it\r\n[badger-paper]: http://decafbad.com/2010/07/badger-article/\r\n[badger1]: https://github.com/lmorchard/badger\r\n[badger2]: https://github.com/lmorchard/badger2\r\n\r\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=70: -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-256743407\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=afd2a7efeaad01509a571bae031dfc5c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">David Boswell</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-256743407\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-07-19T01:18:24\">2011-07-19T01:18:24</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Very cool to see an update on Badger.  I'm definitely interested in this and would love to see something like this show up in the Mozillians phonebook that will be ready soonish :)\r\n\r\nDavid</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-257292756\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://briks.si\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=29e2f1888cdcc9c451d32ab902d5a19c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://briks.si\">Brian King</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-257292756\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-07-19T15:12:01\">2011-07-19T15:12:01</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Over at the Mozilla Reps program, we are discussing the possible use of badges - https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-257331862\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://kanai.net/weblog/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gkanai.jpg\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://kanai.net/weblog/\">Gen Kanai</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-257331862\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-07-19T15:48:22\">2011-07-19T15:48:22</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Agreed with DBos.

It's using core template loaders and shortcuts, so switching over to standard stuff shouldn't be an issue for the views and models.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping at some point to put together some more Django-conventional template tags and templates toward that end, unless someone gets to it before me in a pull request (patches welcome!). Really, I think the template tags are the more important thing, since any templates out of the box will likely get overridden on a real site.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-301119028\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.integrating-technology.org/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/nelliemuller.jpg\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.integrating-technology.org/\">Dr. Nellie Deutsch</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-301119028\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-09-02T14:07:45\">2011-09-02T14:07:45</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I love the idea, Leslie.  I've been heading a self-funded organization that provides free online professional development workshops for educators around the world since 2006.

For me, it&#39;s been over a decade—which is about how long I&#39;ve had a cell phone.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/nyregion/19phones.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print\">pay phones have been disappearing</a> for awhile now. Why? Because pay phones are expensive to keep in working order. If more and more people have wireless phones, it&#39;s less likely that any particular pay phone will result in value for the phone company.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-what\">So what?</h3>\n<p>The reason I&#39;m thinking about this is that I&#39;m troubled by a few bugs I ran into in Bugzilla:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622051\">Remove support for microsummaries</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622045\">Remove smart bookmarks support</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622047\">Remove support for tagging bookmarks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049\">Get rid of livemark support</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Are these like pay phones? </p>\n<p>Each one requires engineering effort to keep working from release to release in Firefox. Some of them have issues in performance and functionality that could use some attention. And, the introduction of <a href=\"https://services.mozilla.com/\">Firefox Sync</a>, for example, introduces some new complexities in tracking changes.</p>\n<p>But, do any of these features provide enough value to justify continued attention?</p>\n<h3 id=\"microsummaries\">Microsummaries</h3>\n<p>Ever heard of <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries\">microsummaries</a>? I have, and I thought they&#39;d be neat. I installed a plugin on my blog to offer a microsummary, and I tried hacking them into Delicious at one point during a Hack Day. </p>\n<p>That was about 4 years ago, and I haven&#39;t thought about them much since. Sounds like a pay phone to me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"smart-bookmarks\">Smart Bookmarks</h3>\n<p>I always wondered how those out-of-box &quot;Recently Bookmarked&quot;, &quot;Recent Tags&quot;, and &quot;Most Visited&quot; folders worked in Firefox. Turns out that you can bookmark <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Places_query_uris\">queries against the internal Places database</a> as a persistent search folder. Seems pretty keen.</p>\n<p>But, I&#39;ve been using Firefox for years and only just learned about this in the past month. The feature&#39;s not very exposed, and it&#39;s not obvious how to use it. In fact, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622045#c0\">the bug to remove it might list the clearest hints on using it</a>.</p>\n<p>Seems like it might be a good feature to jettison into an add-on, like a pay phone to play with in your basement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tagging-bookmarks\">Tagging Bookmarks</h3>\n<p>This is a no-brainer for me: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470037857?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;%0D%0Acreative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470037857\">I like tagging my bookmarks</a>. The problem is that I&#39;ve exceeded 16,000 bookmarks. It&#39;s been years since any browser coped well with my corpus of bookmarks—that&#39;s one of the reasons I started really liking Delicious.</p>\n<p>However, tagging bookmarks in Firefox is kind of rough. The UI isn&#39;t awesome, and the database supporting it could use some work. Rather than improve things, though, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622047\">bug 622047</a> proposes removing the functionality altogether.</p>\n<p>Here, I&#39;m conflicted: I don&#39;t use tags in Firefox, because I don&#39;t use bookmarks in Firefox. If they worked better, I might use them. Instead, I use <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">pinboard.in</a> or a private Delicious clone of my own that copes with my scale—in fact, I got to this scale because those services handle it. So, usage data from me would support the feature&#39;s removal despite what I think I&#39;d like to see.</p>\n<p>But, does my <em>suspicion</em> that I would use a feature justify someone else&#39;s time in making it better?

They&#39;re feed subscriptions, built into the browser.</p>\n<p>So, when I saw <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049\" title=\"Get rid of livemark support\">bug 622049</a>, my first thought was &quot;<strong>Hey! I&#39;m using those!</strong>&quot; </p>\n<p>I just spent a week building an <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/27/introducing-fireriver-a-river-of-news-for-firefox-4\">add-on powered by Livemarks</a>. I&#39;ve been using <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireriver/\">Fireriver</a> on a daily basis, and I&#39;ve been thinking about trying more experiments. But, if livemarks are going away, then <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c11\">I&#39;m working toward a dead end</a>.</p>\n<p>Like tagging bookmarks, the UI and feed polling code behind livemarks could use some work. My add-on was an attempt to improve the interface, but I did <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=629742\">report a bug</a> on performance issues raised by my import of around 700 subscriptions from Google Reader. That&#39;s just one more strike against livemarks for <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049\" title=\"Get rid of livemark support\">bug 622049</a>.</p>\n<p>In the end, if livemarks go away <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/shared/l.m.orchard\">I&#39;d still have Google Reader</a>. I&#39;ll have blown a week or so on this add-on, though I did learn some interesting things. And, if Google Reader goes away, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764597582?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;c%0D%0Areative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0764597582\">it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve never written a feed reader before</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, this one bothers me the most, in terms of what I want to see for the web itself. <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/27/what-should-be-done-about-feeds-in-browsers\">This is better explored in another blog post</a>, but I want my browser to do more of the surfing for me. I think of bookmarks as long-term relationships to web resources—and livemarks turn those static links into live updates. I can think of a lot of uses for this functionality built into the browser, rather than delegated to <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848\">lobster traps</a> and content silos.</p>\n<p>But, livemarks do complicate things for Firefox engineers. They don&#39;t interact well with Sync, and the feed polling code has cases where it can really drag down the whole browser. And, of course, livemarks aren&#39;t good for much when a laptop&#39;s closed or if Firefox isn&#39;t running. Granted, the former happens more often than the latter for me, but we&#39;re not talking about an always-on server here in any case.</p>\n<p>Are livemarks a pay phone feature? Personally, I don&#39;t think so. I think Firefox is diminished if it loses this feature, rather than taking it further.</p>\n<p>Although I&#39;m reticent to do so, I might just rebuild livemarks in some form with an add-on if they go away. The good news is that add-ons are getting easier to write, which also deserves its own blog post. The bad news is, I might not have time or motivation to do the work myself. But, either, I&#39;m not all that comfortable clamoring for other people&#39;s time for this <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c11\">beyond registering my disagreement</a> and <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c14\">backing off</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Most of these things do indeed look like pay phones to me. Most of them seem not to offer enough value to pay for upkeep. </p>\n<p>Livemarks are the exception, in my mind, but I don&#39;t have answers as to how to fix their flaws. Maybe they&#39;re inherently doomed in the face of ubiquitous computing, maybe they&#39;re just in need of a better execution. But, I won&#39;t expect other busy engineers to drop what they&#39;re doing to come up with those answers in the meantime.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>Feel free to comment on this blog post.

I have bookmarks going back over a decade. Until about a year ago, they were a huge mess and nearly impossible to deal with. The big problem was that the folders were too restrictive and, so, the placement of many bookmarks was pretty arbitrary. So, I finally decided to go through every bookmark, delete all the useless stuff (the vast majority of bookmarks), and attach one or more tag to each bookmark. It took about a week. The result: the organization system now makes sense, and I have few enough bookmarks that I actually use them quite a lot. The problem is that the interface is designed for folders and not tags. I cannot drill down tags like I can with folders. Tags don’t appear in the bookmarks menu like folders. I had to create smart bookmarks to work around this limitation. Even with these artificial limitations in the interface, tags are <em>much</em> more humane than folders.</p>\n<p>My suggestion: deprecate folders altogether. In a future version of Firefox, migrate everyone to tags by converting them to tags. Moreover, fix the interface so as to make sense for tags instead of folders. Do that, and you’ll find that people start using tags. I agree that it’s kind of overkill to have both folders and tags. But the solution is to get rid of the archaic system of forced hierarchy (folders) and give tags the chance they deserve (by greatly improving the tagging interface).</p></div>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085116\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085116\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T07:40:18\">2011-02-07T07:40:18</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>FWIW, if I used bookmarks in Firefox, this is exactly what I'd do.

I don't know where it would show up in my web browser.  I had to Google to find The MozillaWiki describing them as \"Microsummaries are better for labeling bookmarks than static page titles, because they give users quicker access to the most interesting information behind a bookmark, and they give web sites a way to notify users of updates and entice them to revisit the site.\"  If you have your bookmarks open constantly, and are monitoring something, then sure that would be helpful.  But usually if we want real-time monitoring of something, there are other methods that we use.  We have moved to increasing screen real-estate, making tabs into just icons and hiding the bookmark toolbar.  </p>\n<p>I never got the hang of LiveMarks in the browser.  That definitely has a lot to do with UI.  But trying to turn a web browser into a full-fledged feed-reader, as part of the core technology, isn't the right direction.  There are addons, websites, and stand-alone readers that do a much better job.  The more RSS feeds you subscribe to, it quickly overwhelms the basics.  Personally, I do like having the little orange button in my URL bar to subscribe (I have it auto-routing to Google Reader), but that's mostly because it provides a fast way to subscribe instead of me hunting for a link.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Smart Bookmarks and Tags have a lot of potential, especially as the volume of bookmarks grows.  I don't use either of them, but I wouldn't want to see them gone.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085135\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ff6fac10b30d4f19bc083164c4c9b328&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Gruber</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085135\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T14:35:08\">2011-02-07T14:35:08</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>One more thing, I wonder if these arguments against these \"pay phones\" could/will also be made for Panorama and Tab Groups, I personally wouldn't shed a tear for it.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085138\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5406d41679a6d770aac64a86a1d1c815&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">augustm</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085138\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T19:16:39\">2011-02-07T19:16:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Firstly SQL has been broken in Firefox 3.6.x and 4.0b since the summer.\nIt makes searching on tags in bookmarks almost impossible. \nSo tags are mostly broken.

It's somewhat difficult to create microsummaries or smart bookmarks (as a user, without the web site supporting it).

It sat in my wallet for years until the day my cellphone battery died and all I had was my WIFI iPad. I looked up her phone number in my contacts and called her from the nearest payphone though it was a struggle to find the payphone in one of the most modern building complexes here in Tokyo.</p>\n<p>Another payphone story that came to mind was shortly after the recent Earthquake. Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people walked home. Some walking several hours. In my short walk to camp out a nearby friend's house, I saw people queuing up for payphones after their mobile phones had become unusable due to the mobile network congestion. The line to use the payphone was hundreds of people long. I'm sure that the maximum queue length at that phone in the previous 10 years was 2 people. This experience changed my mind. </p>\n<p>There are much fewer payphones than their heyday 15 years ago when we had payphones with ISDN jacks to plug in your laptop. It is difficult to find one now. Also, payphones are clunky and in Tokyo at least, very reliable. They are going to work, if nothing else works.</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

But, if you feel strongly about these features, you might get a better discussion with more people on [this thread from the `mozilla.dev.apps.firefox` newsgroup (in Google Groups)](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_thread/thread/fa6f83e781b962a4).</em>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"display: block; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; float:right;\">\r\n<a style=\"display: block;\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/4925985819/\" title=\"Phone Don't Work No More by Thomas Hawk, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4925985819_9ccbb166f7.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Phone Don't Work No More\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/4925985819/\">Phone Don't Work No More</a> by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/\">Thomas Hawk</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWhen's the last time you used a pay phone? For me, it's been over a decade—which is about how long I've had a cell phone.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, [pay phones have been disappearing][pay phones disappear] for awhile now. Why? Because pay phones are expensive to keep in working order. If more and more people have wireless phones, it's less likely that any particular pay phone will result in value for the phone company.\r\n\r\n[pay phones disappear]: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/nyregion/19phones.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print\r\n\r\n### So what?\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm thinking about this is that I'm troubled by a few bugs I ran into in Bugzilla:\r\n\r\n* [Remove support for microsummaries](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622051)\r\n* [Remove smart bookmarks support](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622045)\r\n* [Remove support for tagging bookmarks](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622047)\r\n* [Get rid of livemark support](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049)\r\n\r\nAre these like pay phones? \r\n\r\nEach one requires engineering effort to keep working from release to release in Firefox. Some of them have issues in performance and functionality that could use some attention. And, the introduction of [Firefox Sync][], for example, introduces some new complexities in tracking changes.\r\n\r\n[Firefox Sync]: https://services.mozilla.com/\r\n\r\nBut, do any of these features provide enough value to justify continued attention?\r\n\r\n### Microsummaries\r\n\r\nEver heard of [microsummaries][]? I have, and I thought they'd be neat. I installed a plugin on my blog to offer a microsummary, and I tried hacking them into Delicious at one point during a Hack Day. \r\n\r\nThat was about 4 years ago, and I haven't thought about them much since. Sounds like a pay phone to me.\r\n\r\n[microsummaries]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries\r\n\r\n### Smart Bookmarks\r\n\r\nI always wondered how those out-of-box \"Recently Bookmarked\", \"Recent Tags\", and \"Most Visited\" folders worked in Firefox. Turns out that you can bookmark [queries against the internal Places database][placesuri] as a persistent search folder. Seems pretty keen.\r\n\r\n[placesuri]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Places_query_uris\r\n\r\nBut, I've been using Firefox for years and only just learned about this in the past month. The feature's not very exposed, and it's not obvious how to use it. In fact, [the bug to remove it might list the clearest hints on using it](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622045#c0).\r\n\r\nSeems like it might be a good feature to jettison into an add-on, like a pay phone to play with in your basement.\r\n\r\n### Tagging Bookmarks\r\n\r\nThis is a no-brainer for me: [I like tagging my bookmarks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470037857?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&%0D%0Acreative=9325&creativeASIN=0470037857). The problem is that I've exceeded 16,000 bookmarks. It's been years since any browser coped well with my corpus of bookmarks—that's one of the reasons I started really liking Delicious.\r\n\r\nHowever, tagging bookmarks in Firefox is kind of rough. The UI isn't awesome, and the database supporting it could use some work. Rather than improve things, though, [bug 622047](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622047) proposes removing the functionality altogether.\r\n\r\nHere, I'm conflicted: I don't use tags in Firefox, because I don't use bookmarks in Firefox. If they worked better, I might use them. Instead, I use [pinboard.in](http://pinboard.in/u:deusx) or a private Delicious clone of my own that copes with my scale—in fact, I got to this scale because those services handle it. So, usage data from me would support the feature's removal despite what I think I'd like to see.\r\n\r\nBut, does my *suspicion* that I would use a feature justify someone else's time in making it better? I don't think I can ask for that with a straight face. \r\n\r\nPut another way, I could see how that pay phone they removed from the corner gas station could someday come in handy, but should I expect the phone company to keep it clear of graffiti until I come along with quarters?\r\n\r\n### Livemarks\r\n\r\nLive Bookmarks (or Livemarks) are bookmark folders whose contents are generated from RSS and Atom feeds periodically polled by Firefox. They're feed subscriptions, built into the browser.\r\n\r\nSo, when I saw [bug 622049][], my first thought was \"**Hey! I'm using those!**\" \r\n\r\nI just spent a week building an [add-on powered by Livemarks][fireriver]. I've been using [Fireriver](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireriver/) on a daily basis, and I've been thinking about trying more experiments. But, if livemarks are going away, then [I'm working toward a dead end][deadend].\r\n\r\n[deadend]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c11\r\n[fireriver]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/27/introducing-fireriver-a-river-of-news-for-firefox-4\r\n\r\nLike tagging bookmarks, the UI and feed polling code behind livemarks could use some work. My add-on was an attempt to improve the interface, but I did [report a bug][bug 629742] on performance issues raised by my import of around 700 subscriptions from Google Reader. That's just one more strike against livemarks for [bug 622049][].\r\n\r\n[bug 629742]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=629742\r\n[bug 622049]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049 \"Get rid of livemark support\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, if livemarks go away [I'd still have Google Reader][mygr]. I'll have blown a week or so on this add-on, though I did learn some interesting things. And, if Google Reader goes away, [it's not like I've never written a feed reader before][rssbook].\r\n\r\n[mygr]: http://www.google.com/reader/shared/l.m.orchard\r\n[rssbook]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764597582?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&c%0D%0Areative=9325&creativeASIN=0764597582\r\n\r\nStill, this one bothers me the most, in terms of what I want to see for the web itself. [This is better explored in another blog post][browserfeeds], but I want my browser to do more of the surfing for me. I think of bookmarks as long-term relationships to web resources—and livemarks turn those static links into live updates. I can think of a lot of uses for this functionality built into the browser, rather than delegated to [lobster traps][] and content silos.\r\n\r\n[browserfeeds]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/27/what-should-be-done-about-feeds-in-browsers\r\n[lobster traps]: http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848\r\n\r\nBut, livemarks do complicate things for Firefox engineers. They don't interact well with Sync, and the feed polling code has cases where it can really drag down the whole browser. And, of course, livemarks aren't good for much when a laptop's closed or if Firefox isn't running. Granted, the former happens more often than the latter for me, but we're not talking about an always-on server here in any case.\r\n\r\nAre livemarks a pay phone feature? Personally, I don't think so. I think Firefox is diminished if it loses this feature, rather than taking it further.\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm reticent to do so, I might just rebuild livemarks in some form with an add-on if they go away. The good news is that add-ons are getting easier to write, which also deserves its own blog post. The bad news is, I might not have time or motivation to do the work myself. But, either, I'm not all that comfortable clamoring for other people's time for this [beyond registering my disagreement](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c11) and [backing off](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c14).\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nMost of these things do indeed look like pay phones to me. Most of them seem not to offer enough value to pay for upkeep. \r\n\r\nLivemarks are the exception, in my mind, but I don't have answers as to how to fix their flaws. Maybe they're inherently doomed in the face of ubiquitous computing, maybe they're just in need of a better execution. But, I won't expect other busy engineers to drop what they're doing to come up with those answers in the meantime.\r\n\r\n**Update:** <em>Feel free to comment on this blog post.

I have bookmarks going back over a decade. Until about a year ago, they were a huge mess and nearly impossible to deal with. The big problem was that the folders were too restrictive and, so, the placement of many bookmarks was pretty arbitrary. So, I finally decided to go through every bookmark, delete all the useless stuff (the vast majority of bookmarks), and attach one or more tag to each bookmark. It took about a week. The result: the organization system now makes sense, and I have few enough bookmarks that I actually use them quite a lot. The problem is that the interface is designed for folders and not tags. I cannot drill down tags like I can with folders. Tags don’t appear in the bookmarks menu like folders. I had to create smart bookmarks to work around this limitation. Even with these artificial limitations in the interface, tags are <em>much</em> more humane than folders.</p>\n\n<p>My suggestion: deprecate folders altogether. In a future version of Firefox, migrate everyone to tags by converting them to tags. Moreover, fix the interface so as to make sense for tags instead of folders. Do that, and you’ll find that people start using tags. I agree that it’s kind of overkill to have both folders and tags. But the solution is to get rid of the archaic system of forced hierarchy (folders) and give tags the chance they deserve (by greatly improving the tagging interface).</p></div>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085116\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085116\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T07:40:18\">2011-02-07T07:40:18</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>FWIW, if I used bookmarks in Firefox, this is exactly what I'd do.

I don't know where it would show up in my web browser.  I had to Google to find The MozillaWiki describing them as \"Microsummaries are better for labeling bookmarks than static page titles, because they give users quicker access to the most interesting information behind a bookmark, and they give web sites a way to notify users of updates and entice them to revisit the site.\"  If you have your bookmarks open constantly, and are monitoring something, then sure that would be helpful.  But usually if we want real-time monitoring of something, there are other methods that we use.  We have moved to increasing screen real-estate, making tabs into just icons and hiding the bookmark toolbar.  </p>\n\n<p>I never got the hang of LiveMarks in the browser.  That definitely has a lot to do with UI.  But trying to turn a web browser into a full-fledged feed-reader, as part of the core technology, isn't the right direction.  There are addons, websites, and stand-alone readers that do a much better job.  The more RSS feeds you subscribe to, it quickly overwhelms the basics.  Personally, I do like having the little orange button in my URL bar to subscribe (I have it auto-routing to Google Reader), but that's mostly because it provides a fast way to subscribe instead of me hunting for a link.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, Smart Bookmarks and Tags have a lot of potential, especially as the volume of bookmarks grows.  I don't use either of them, but I wouldn't want to see them gone.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085135\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ff6fac10b30d4f19bc083164c4c9b328&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Gruber</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085135\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T14:35:08\">2011-02-07T14:35:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>One more thing, I wonder if these arguments against these \"pay phones\" could/will also be made for Panorama and Tab Groups, I personally wouldn't shed a tear for it.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085138\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5406d41679a6d770aac64a86a1d1c815&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">augustm</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085138\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T19:16:39\">2011-02-07T19:16:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Firstly SQL has been broken in Firefox 3.6.x and 4.0b since the summer.\nIt makes searching on tags in bookmarks almost impossible. \nSo tags are mostly broken.

It's somewhat difficult to create microsummaries or smart bookmarks (as a user, without the web site supporting it).  Tags are easy to create, but are presented everywhere as a single list, which makes large numbers of them infeasible (rather than something closer to a tag cloud).  Livemarks... well, they basically have no useful way of showing the summary, just... half a headline :p  Only if it actually opened the feed preview page rather than a useless dropdown...</p>\n\n<p>As I understand it, it's mostly things getting cut to make the release, then... well, just getting dropped on the floor once the release is out, really.  There's never a focus on polishing things.  But that's pretty much true of all the projects I've looked close enough at, sadly.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder which ones would be next?  Devtools, with the backend sticking around for Firebug? More changes to the URL display on hovering links?

I looked up her phone number in my contacts and called her from the nearest payphone though it was a struggle to find the payphone in one of the most modern building complexes here in Tokyo.</p>\n\n<p>Another payphone story that came to mind was shortly after the recent Earthquake. Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people walked home. Some walking several hours. In my short walk to camp out a nearby friend's house, I saw people queuing up for payphones after their mobile phones had become unusable due to the mobile network congestion. The line to use the payphone was hundreds of people long. I'm sure that the maximum queue length at that phone in the previous 10 years was 2 people. This experience changed my mind. </p>\n\n<p>There are much fewer payphones than their heyday 15 years ago when we had payphones with ISDN jacks to plug in your laptop. It is difficult to find one now. Also, payphones are clunky and in Tokyo at least, very reliable. They are going to work, if nothing else works.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>Browsers need help doing a better job using feeds for discovery, aggregation, and publishing on the web to keep us from swimming into self-destructing lobster traps.</em></p>\n<p>Last week, I wrote <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967\">some blog posts</a> about <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967\">Bug 578967</a>, wherein the feed auto-discovery icon in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">Firefox 4</a> has been moved off the URL bar and hidden by default. I support that decision of <a href=\"http://planet.firefox.com/ux/\">the UX team</a>, because <a href=\"https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/\">that feed button is a slacker</a>. And even if it does get used, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/what-happened-to-feed-autodiscovery-in-firefox-4#serving\">I&#39;m not a fan of what it does anyway</a>.</p>\n<p>But, I&#39;ve got lots more rattling around in my head about this stuff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-the-point-of-feeds\">What&#39;s the point of feeds?</h3>\n<p>Feeds—that&#39;s RSS and Atom and maybe even JSON—let robots pull lots of stuff from a bunch of places and pile it all together in one spot for your perusal, analysis, and remixing pleasure. Feed readers and news aggregators do the surfing for you, so you don&#39;t have to.</p>\n<p>But, Twitter and Facebook and others have managed to make <em>the people themselves</em> all gather in one spot. So, to see what those people are saying and doing, you just have to go <em>there</em>—kind of like what feeds promised, right? Only, you go <em>there</em> rather than all that stuff coming <em>here</em>.</p>\n<p>The problem is, even if the logo says it <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dunstan/524137648/\">loves you</a>, the people who made it say that <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/\">won&#39;t always stay in charge</a>. And, someday, when whomever&#39;s left rides off into the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/\">sunset</a>, you&#39;ll learn how much <a href=\"http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Why_Back_Up%3F\">they didn&#39;t care about you</a> in the end.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/herzogbr/2261662706/\" title=\"Flickr Loves You by herzogbr, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2003/2261662706_db086ea4bb_m.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"64\" alt=\"Flickr Loves You\" /></a> <strong style=\"font-size: 200%; padding: 0.5em;\">vs</strong> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/en-us/flickr-yahoo-logo.png\" height=\"50\" style=\"padding: 7px; background: #fff\"></a></p>\n\n<p>For some people and some places, that&#39;s no big tragedy. It&#39;s just a party; you go home when it&#39;s over. You made memories, you hope to find some of those people again elsewhere. <a href=\"http://blog.pownce.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-hello-six-apart/\">Pownce croaked</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/09/six-apart-shuts-down-vox/\">so did Vox</a>, but who cares? There&#39;s always Twitter next door for the afterparty.</p>\n<p>But, what if a world you lived in <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2444\">evaporated while you were on vacation elsewhere for the holidays</a>? I guess you could say that was just a game and, again, who cares?</p>\n<p>What if <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a> went away just like that? People are not only partying there—they&#39;re leaving their visual memories at the coat check. Things are a little more real there, by some definitions thereof.</p>\n<p>What if you never swam into that <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848\">lobster trap</a>, though? What if your words and images and creations were borrowed and copied, but never wholly kept in someone else&#39;s bucket? What if <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a> were just like <a href=\"http://google.com\">Google Search</a>? That is, a collector and an index—but never the host—of photos and conversations?</p>\n<p>Feeds can help make that happen, but not by themselves.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-feeds-belong-in-the-browser\">Do feeds belong in the browser?</h3>\n<p>Well, yeah. Would sites like Twitter and Facebook have been as successful if feeds worked better in the browser? I think so. But, by working better, I don&#39;t just mean improvements to that funky blue thing that showed up in the location bar every now and then. No, I mean all of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Discovery</strong> — help me find and follow interesting people and things</li>\n<li><strong>Aggregation</strong> — give me one spot where what I find and follow is delivered to me</li>\n<li><strong>Publishing</strong> — enable me to post things where people (and their agents) can find and follow</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To me, this is where Twitter and Facebook are totally nailing it. But, much of this can happen in the browser, and I think more of it should. Projects like <a href=\"http://www.rockmelt.com/\">RockMelt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flock.com/\">Flock</a> have seemed promising to me in this context, but have yet to really thrill me. I don&#39;t think they go far enough.</p>\n<p>There is a point where the rubber (client) meets the road (server)—but that point can live <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/howToShareABucketOnS3.html\">so much farther down the stack than it does now</a>. Mind you, I don&#39;t want a revival of <a href=\"http://www.zisman.ca/netgold/\">Netscape Gold</a> as such—but recall that <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm\">&quot;the first browser was an editor, it was a writer as well as a reader&quot;</a>.</p>\n<p>We need some services and hosts out there as rendezvous points for our browsers and agents, but we really don&#39;t need any of those services to collapse into <a href=\"http://buddycloud.com/cms/content/we-are-aol-days-social-networking\">the next all-encompassing AOL-style singularity</a>. There&#39;s money to be made there, but most of us are the product.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whose-job-is-it-anyway\">Whose job is it anyway?</h3>\n<p>I&#39;d like to see my employer, Mozilla, do more with feeds in the browser—and I suspect we will. <a href=\"http://mozillalabs.com/blog/2010/03/online-identity-concept-series/\">Mozilla Labs has had some interesting Concept Series topics</a>, and I look forward to seeing some of those things get pursued further. If I can carve out the time, I wouldn&#39;t mind helping.</p>\n<p>Something I find interesting about feed auto-discovery—the thing that started this latest round of buzz—is that it didn&#39;t originate with browser makers. <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery\">RSS auto-discovery</a> was itself discovered <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/31/oooago\">by bloggers</a>, way back in 2002. It wasn&#39;t until we sussed out the details of that <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links\">HTML link tag</a> and shoved it into our pages that browsers like Firefox started looking for it.</p>\n<p>Hell, even though <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss#History\">RSS started with Netscape</a>, it took <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss.html\">Dave Winer and UserLand and friends running with it</a> to keep it alive and kicking. Now, Dave&#39;s <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/krocCamenProvesRssIsVeryMu.html\">suggested forking an open source browser</a> to show Mozilla how it&#39;s done. I support the sentiment, but there are easier ways to go about this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"making-it-your-job\">Making it your job</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply\">Christopher Blizzard</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>We created add-ons with the original Firefox as a way to be able to say “no” in a constructive manner. If you want something that you think is important to you, you can make an add-on.</blockquote>\n\n<p>That could be taken as a cop-out, but it&#39;s not. With the efforts behind <a href=\"https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/\">Jetpack</a>—now just <em>the</em> <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/12/09/announcing-add-on-sdk-1-0b1/\">Add-on SDK</a>—building add-ons for Firefox is being made easier. Rather than dealing with a morass of XUL and obscure APIs that I know has scared me personally away all these years, you can now do most everything you&#39;d like though <a href=\"https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/sdk/1.0b1/docs/#package/addon-kit\">much-simplified JavaScript APIs</a> and HTML/CSS.</p>\n<p>In other words, if you are a web developer—albeit a fairly advanced one—you can make an add-on for Firefox. Hopefully, as the Add-on SDK advances, the bar to participation will continue to drop.</p>\n<h3 id=\"to-be-continued\">To be continued</h3>\n<p>I&#39;m running out of steam and it&#39;s time for bed, so I think I&#39;ll just trail off for now.

Several nights it happened that they didn't write down what they had and then we had to remember to check periodically because the homework wasn't updated right away.  </p>\n<p>Right now they're sent home with books with it all written down and I'm supposed to sign that I saw it, but who remembers to look at a book all the time? It's such a complicated process - kids have to write it down in the first place, then one of us has to remember to show it to me. FEEDS!!!

You send a message to a server, which then sends it to their server, and eventually their mail client picks it up. There are intermediaries.</p>\n<p>BitTorrent relies on trackers (ie. rendezvous points) before you can start transferring chunks, though the distributed hash stuff helps get away from that. But, if all that were easy (including discovery), it would have taken off long, long ago.</p>\n<p>You can't go P2P for everything, at least not easily. Not every P is online at all times, so we need store-and-forward services. Some P's have multiple devices and agents, and most of those are behind firewalls and NAT. So, we need servers out there as accessible fixed points that are (mostly) always available. We can try to build P2P meshes that do the same thing, but servers are simpler.</p>\n<p>And, yeah, I do believe that running your own server is the ultimate solution. Or, at least, finding someone to run it for you who cares about keeping it up, whether through direct payment or other direct incentive (ie. they're family or friends). Otherwise, you still have the problem where what they care about doesn't match what you care about (eg. ad supported services).\n</p><p>But, with the way the user agent picture is splitting up across devices (eg. the cloud, ambient computing), I don't think Firefox will ever be the server. Even if you connect user agents together with something like Jabber/XMPP, you still need a server out there—though at least that's pushing things in the right direction, since an XMPP server can be agnostic about the messages that go through it</p>\n<p>I do have another blog post rattling around in my head about hosting.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>Browsers need help doing a better job using feeds for discovery, aggregation, and publishing on the web to keep us from swimming into self-destructing lobster traps.</em>\r\n\r\nLast week, I wrote [some blog posts](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discovery icon in [Firefox 4](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been moved off the URL bar and hidden by default. I support that decision of [the UX team](http://planet.firefox.com/ux/), because [that feed button is a slacker](https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/). And even if it does get used, [I'm not a fan of what it does anyway](http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/what-happened-to-feed-autodiscovery-in-firefox-4#serving).\r\n\r\nBut, I've got lots more rattling around in my head about this stuff.\r\n\r\n### What's the point of feeds?\r\n\r\nFeeds—that's RSS and Atom and maybe even JSON—let robots pull lots of stuff from a bunch of places and pile it all together in one spot for your perusal, analysis, and remixing pleasure. Feed readers and news aggregators do the surfing for you, so you don't have to.\r\n\r\nBut, Twitter and Facebook and others have managed to make *the people themselves* all gather in one spot. So, to see what those people are saying and doing, you just have to go *there*—kind of like what feeds promised, right? Only, you go *there* rather than all that stuff coming *here*.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, even if the logo says it [loves you](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dunstan/524137648/), the people who made it say that [won't always stay in charge](http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/). And, someday, when whomever's left rides off into the [sunset](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/), you'll learn how much [they didn't care about you](http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Why_Back_Up%3F) in the end.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/herzogbr/2261662706/\" title=\"Flickr Loves You by herzogbr, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2003/2261662706_db086ea4bb_m.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"64\" alt=\"Flickr Loves You\" /></a> <strong style=\"font-size: 200%; padding: 0.5em;\">vs</strong> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/en-us/flickr-yahoo-logo.png\" height=\"50\" style=\"padding: 7px; background: #fff\"></a></p>\r\n\r\nFor some people and some places, that's no big tragedy. It's just a party; you go home when it's over. You made memories, you hope to find some of those people again elsewhere. [Pownce croaked](http://blog.pownce.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-hello-six-apart/), and [so did Vox](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/09/six-apart-shuts-down-vox/), but who cares? There's always Twitter next door for the afterparty.\r\n\r\nBut, what if a world you lived in [evaporated while you were on vacation elsewhere for the holidays](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2444)? I guess you could say that was just a game and, again, who cares?\r\n\r\nWhat if [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) went away just like that? People are not only partying there—they're leaving their visual memories at the coat check. Things are a little more real there, by some definitions thereof.\r\n\r\nWhat if you never swam into that [lobster trap](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848), though? What if your words and images and creations were borrowed and copied, but never wholly kept in someone else's bucket? What if [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) were just like [Google Search](http://google.com)? That is, a collector and an index—but never the host—of photos and conversations?\r\n\r\nFeeds can help make that happen, but not by themselves.\r\n\r\n### Do feeds belong in the browser?\r\n\r\nWell, yeah. Would sites like Twitter and Facebook have been as successful if feeds worked better in the browser? I think so. But, by working better, I don't just mean improvements to that funky blue thing that showed up in the location bar every now and then. No, I mean all of the following:\r\n\r\n* **Discovery** — help me find and follow interesting people and things\r\n* **Aggregation** — give me one spot where what I find and follow is delivered to me\r\n* **Publishing** — enable me to post things where people (and their agents) can find and follow\r\n\r\nTo me, this is where Twitter and Facebook are totally nailing it. But, much of this can happen in the browser, and I think more of it should. Projects like [RockMelt](http://www.rockmelt.com/) and [Flock](http://www.flock.com/) have seemed promising to me in this context, but have yet to really thrill me. I don't think they go far enough.\r\n\r\nThere is a point where the rubber (client) meets the road (server)—but that point can live [so much farther down the stack than it does now](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/howToShareABucketOnS3.html). Mind you, I don't want a revival of [Netscape Gold](http://www.zisman.ca/netgold/) as such—but recall that [\"the first browser was an editor, it was a writer as well as a reader\"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm).\r\n\r\nWe need some services and hosts out there as rendezvous points for our browsers and agents, but we really don't need any of those services to collapse into [the next all-encompassing AOL-style singularity](http://buddycloud.com/cms/content/we-are-aol-days-social-networking). There's money to be made there, but most of us are the product.\r\n\r\n### Whose job is it anyway?\r\n\r\nI'd like to see my employer, Mozilla, do more with feeds in the browser—and I suspect we will. [Mozilla Labs has had some interesting Concept Series topics](http://mozillalabs.com/blog/2010/03/online-identity-concept-series/), and I look forward to seeing some of those things get pursued further. If I can carve out the time, I wouldn't mind helping.\r\n\r\nSomething I find interesting about feed auto-discovery—the thing that started this latest round of buzz—is that it didn't originate with browser makers. [RSS auto-discovery](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery) was itself discovered [by bloggers](http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/31/oooago), way back in 2002. It wasn't until we sussed out the details of that [HTML link tag](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links) and shoved it into our pages that browsers like Firefox started looking for it.\r\n\r\nHell, even though [RSS started with Netscape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss#History), it took [Dave Winer and UserLand and friends running with it](http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss.html) to keep it alive and kicking. Now, Dave's [suggested forking an open source browser](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/krocCamenProvesRssIsVeryMu.html) to show Mozilla how it's done. I support the sentiment, but there are easier ways to go about this.\r\n\r\n### Making it your job\r\n\r\n[Christopher Blizzard](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply):\r\n<blockquote>We created add-ons with the original Firefox as a way to be able to say “no” in a constructive manner. If you want something that you think is important to you, you can make an add-on.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat could be taken as a cop-out, but it's not. With the efforts behind [Jetpack](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/)—now just *the* [Add-on SDK](http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/12/09/announcing-add-on-sdk-1-0b1/)—building add-ons for Firefox is being made easier. Rather than dealing with a morass of XUL and obscure APIs that I know has scared me personally away all these years, you can now do most everything you'd like though [much-simplified JavaScript APIs](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/sdk/1.0b1/docs/#package/addon-kit) and HTML/CSS.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if you are a web developer—albeit a fairly advanced one—you can make an add-on for Firefox. Hopefully, as the Add-on SDK advances, the bar to participation will continue to drop.\r\n\r\n### To be continued\r\n\r\nI'm running out of steam and it's time for bed, so I think I'll just trail off for now. I do have a bit more in me, though. The next thing is about taking my own advice in that last section and making some of this *my* job to fix.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086137\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=52674e2ce2d7671878b26ed534b0c662&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Majken \"Lucy\" Connor</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T06:38:04\">2011-01-27T06:38:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Yay!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feeds are soo soo soooo great, but not as live bookmarks.

You'd think that would be a simple and obvious thing that would just work, but even by hooking the two together with a selection of Heath Robinson-style scripts, it's still never been possible to get them to play nicely.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086149\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086149\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T15:06:57\">2011-01-27T15:06:57</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>That's a good point - a lot of this falls under the bailiwick of Mozilla Messaging, who work on Thunderbird.

This can be overcome with some hacks but that is a moot point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally, the browser will adhere to the content publisher&#039;s (or feed generator&#039;s) instructions on how to handle the presentation of the data.

You send a message to a server, which then sends it to their server, and eventually their mail client picks it up. There are intermediaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BitTorrent relies on trackers (ie. rendezvous points) before you can start transferring chunks, though the distributed hash stuff helps get away from that. But, if all that were easy (including discovery), it would have taken off long, long ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can't go P2P for everything, at least not easily. Not every P is online at all times, so we need store-and-forward services. Some P's have multiple devices and agents, and most of those are behind firewalls and NAT. So, we need servers out there as accessible fixed points that are (mostly) always available. We can try to build P2P meshes that do the same thing, but servers are simpler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, yeah, I do believe that running your own server is the ultimate solution. Or, at least, finding someone to run it for you who cares about keeping it up, whether through direct payment or other direct incentive (ie. they're family or friends). Otherwise, you still have the problem where what they care about doesn't match what you care about (eg. ad supported services).\r\n</p><p>But, with the way the user agent picture is splitting up across devices (eg. the cloud, ambient computing), I don't think Firefox will ever be the server. Even if you connect user agents together with something like Jabber/XMPP, you still need a server out there—though at least that's pushing things in the right direction, since an XMPP server can be agnostic about the messages that go through it</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do have another blog post rattling around in my head about hosting.

This post discusses how you can still use feed auto-discovery, even restoring the icon to the toolbar with a few clicks and a drag.</em></p>\n<p>There&#39;s <a href=\"http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply\">a brouhaha</a> about <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967\">Bug 578967</a>, wherein the feed auto-discover icon in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a> has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, <em>and</em> a Mozilla employee—I&#39;ve got at least a few opinions.</p>\n<p>This post is one of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967\">several on this subject</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feeds-are-too-ubiquitous-to-need-an-indicator\">Feeds are too ubiquitous to need an indicator</h3>\n<p>Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it&#39;s simpler to assume every site has one, rather than keeping an un-lit indicator around to tell you when one&#39;s missing. So, Firefox 4 has an option in the bookmark menu to subscribe to the current page:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-002.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-00.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\n\n<p>The only indicator of a missing feed is that the menu item greys out. Since feeds are everywhere, you should feel comfortable reaching for that subscription menu whenever you like. Of course, this assumes that subscribing to a page falls into the same thought process as bookmarking it—but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an unreasonable notion.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you didn&#39;t know that subscribing to a page was possible—or if you worry there might be people (ie. the potential readers of your feeds) who are in that position—this change may seem problematic. </p>\n<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an unreasonable notion, either. But, I&#39;ll get back to that in a future post.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-feed-icon-isnt-dead-its-just-hiding\">The feed icon isn&#39;t dead, it&#39;s just hiding</h3>\n<p>Even with the new bookmark menu item, the feed subscription button is still available and ready to return to your toolbar in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a>.</p>\n<p>First, right-click somewhere in the empty space of your Firefox 4 toolbar. Try somewhere after the tabs, or somewhere between the toolbar buttons. <a href=\"http://blog.fligtar.com/2011/01/16/how-to-customize-firefox-4s-ui/\">This is how it works on Windows</a>, and this is what it looks like on my Mac:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"220\" height=\"161\" />\n\n<p>Click Customize, and you&#39;ll get a panel like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-01.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\n\n<p>This lets you customize which buttons and controls appear on the toolbar. If you scroll down in the panel, you&#39;ll see a &quot;<strong>Subscribe</strong>&quot; button. Drag that from the panel to a position in the toolbar, and you&#39;ll get a result like this:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-02.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-02.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\n\n<p>Click &quot;<strong>Done</strong>&quot;, and your browser should end up like this:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-03.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-03.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"203\" />\n\n<p>I took my browser screenshots with <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/15/mozillaPleaseKeepTheRssIco.html\">Dave Winer&#39;s screenshot of the old Firefox feed icon</a> for comparison. The result is different, but not radically so. It even enables and darkens when you visit a site with a feed:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-04.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-04.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"271\" />\n\n<p>The main difference is that Dave&#39;s screenshot is the default in Firefox 3.6, whereas mine is the result of the last few screenshots of toolbar customization in Firefox 4 beta 9. That customization is easy, if you know it&#39;s possible—but the worry is, as they say: out of sight, out of mind. </p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082410\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e0ad94a966cfab0b02d938e4bf9cd1c1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\">Felix Pleșoianu</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082410\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T08:00:44\">2011-01-16T08:00:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I have to take issue with some of your points, based on my personal experience. :)</p>\n<p>\"Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it’s simpler to assume every site has one,\"</p>\n<p>Um, no. I follow a hundred webcomics, and while the situation has gotten better recently, many of them still don't have a feed. That's not unique to webcomics, either. Lack of a newsfeed is common enough that being able to tell at first glace is very useful. Heck, many people, even website owners, are ignorant of RSS. More about that in a moment.</p>\n<p>Besides, the feed button serves a second purpose, which is to allow easy access to the feed. Just as I don't want to hunt for an \"RSS\" or \"XML\" link inside the website, I don't want to hunt for it in the browser's interface.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, many people still don't know about RSS. That big prominent orange icon is a big auto-discovery feature, not just in the technical sense, but also because a newbie could see it and click it out of curiosity, and thus learn about feeds. I had to explain what RSS is to someone whose browser didn't have one, and that proved to be quite difficult.</p>\n<p>Of course, all this talk is for nothing as the decision has already been made but, you know. Just my two cents.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082411\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.factoetum.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d7a5934cd119837d75f98dc7e99043d8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.factoetum.com\">Bruce Wayne</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082411\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T11:34:59\">2011-01-16T11:34:59</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Nice explaination\nBut by removing the rss indicator Firefox has shifted content aggregation control from an open browser to closed siloed companies.\nThere is no valid excuse for this....

This could make it a lot easier to work with semi-social sites like del.icio.us and Bloglines.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>The feed button is not dead; it's just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it's not pulling its weight up front. This post discusses how you can still use feed auto-discovery, even restoring the icon to the toolbar with a few clicks and a drag.</em>\r\n\r\nThere's [a brouhaha](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discover icon in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, *and* a Mozilla employee—I've got at least a few opinions.\r\n\r\nThis post is one of [several on this subject](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967).\r\n\r\n### Feeds are too ubiquitous to need an indicator\r\n\r\nFeeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it's simpler to assume every site has one, rather than keeping an un-lit indicator around to tell you when one's missing. So, Firefox 4 has an option in the bookmark menu to subscribe to the current page:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-002.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-00.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\r\n\r\nThe only indicator of a missing feed is that the menu item greys out. Since feeds are everywhere, you should feel comfortable reaching for that subscription menu whenever you like. Of course, this assumes that subscribing to a page falls into the same thought process as bookmarking it—but I don't think that's an unreasonable notion.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you didn't know that subscribing to a page was possible—or if you worry there might be people (ie. the potential readers of your feeds) who are in that position—this change may seem problematic. \r\n\r\nI don't think that's an unreasonable notion, either. But, I'll get back to that in a future post.\r\n\r\n### The feed icon isn't dead, it's just hiding\r\n\r\nEven with the new bookmark menu item, the feed subscription button is still available and ready to return to your toolbar in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/).\r\n\r\nFirst, right-click somewhere in the empty space of your Firefox 4 toolbar. Try somewhere after the tabs, or somewhere between the toolbar buttons. [This is how it works on Windows](http://blog.fligtar.com/2011/01/16/how-to-customize-firefox-4s-ui/), and this is what it looks like on my Mac:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"220\" height=\"161\" />\r\n\r\nClick Customize, and you'll get a panel like this:\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-01.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThis lets you customize which buttons and controls appear on the toolbar. If you scroll down in the panel, you'll see a \"**Subscribe**\" button. Drag that from the panel to a position in the toolbar, and you'll get a result like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-02.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-02.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\r\n\r\nClick \"**Done**\", and your browser should end up like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-03.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-03.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"203\" />\r\n\r\nI took my browser screenshots with [Dave Winer's screenshot of the old Firefox feed icon](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/15/mozillaPleaseKeepTheRssIco.html) for comparison. The result is different, but not radically so. It even enables and darkens when you visit a site with a feed:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-04.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-04.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"271\" />\r\n\r\nThe main difference is that Dave's screenshot is the default in Firefox 3.6, whereas mine is the result of the last few screenshots of toolbar customization in Firefox 4 beta 9. That customization is easy, if you know it's possible—but the worry is, as they say: out of sight, out of mind. \r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082410\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e0ad94a966cfab0b02d938e4bf9cd1c1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\">Felix Pleșoianu</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082410\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T08:00:44\">2011-01-16T08:00:44</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I have to take issue with some of your points, based on my personal experience. :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it’s simpler to assume every site has one,\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Um, no. I follow a hundred webcomics, and while the situation has gotten better recently, many of them still don't have a feed. That's not unique to webcomics, either. Lack of a newsfeed is common enough that being able to tell at first glace is very useful. Heck, many people, even website owners, are ignorant of RSS. More about that in a moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, the feed button serves a second purpose, which is to allow easy access to the feed. Just as I don't want to hunt for an \"RSS\" or \"XML\" link inside the website, I don't want to hunt for it in the browser's interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, many people still don't know about RSS. That big prominent orange icon is a big auto-discovery feature, not just in the technical sense, but also because a newbie could see it and click it out of curiosity, and thus learn about feeds. I had to explain what RSS is to someone whose browser didn't have one, and that proved to be quite difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, all this talk is for nothing as the decision has already been made but, you know. Just my two cents.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082411\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.factoetum.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d7a5934cd119837d75f98dc7e99043d8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.factoetum.com\">Bruce Wayne</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082411\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T11:34:59\">2011-01-16T11:34:59</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Nice explaination\r\nBut by removing the rss indicator Firefox has shifted content aggregation control from an open browser to closed siloed companies.\r\nThere is no valid excuse for this....

A built-in HTTP server would be a good start (is there one yet?), plus support for (say) Atom protocol for shoving data out. This could make it a lot easier to work with semi-social sites like del.icio.us and Bloglines. It's notable that these kind of tools have traditionally been very server-driven, with browsers playing (limited) catch up with plugins.

    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>The feed button is not dead; it&#39;s just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it&#39;s not pulling its weight. This post talks about why things have changed.</em></p>\n<p>There&#39;s <a href=\"http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply\">a brouhaha</a> about <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967\">Bug 578967</a>, wherein the feed auto-discover icon in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a> has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, <em>and</em> a Mozilla employee—I&#39;ve got at least a few opinions.</p>\n<p>This post is one of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967\">several on this subject</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defaults-are-hard-to-pare-down\">Defaults are hard to pare down</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/how-to-use-feed-auto-discovery-in-firefox-4\">feed icon still lives</a> in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a>; it&#39;s just not there by default any more. But, if you look at the controls available in <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png\">the toolbar customization panel</a>, you&#39;ll notice a <em>lot</em> of things that don&#39;t show up by default—there are a lot of things in there, period.</p>\n<p>This is the dilemma for <a href=\"http://planet.firefox.com/ux/\">the Firefox User Experience team at Mozilla</a>: Like it or not, one of the main themes of this next generation of browsers is minimalism—faster, smaller, less browser to get in the way of what you&#39;re browsing. Yet, at the same time, Firefox 4 has the features of Firefox 3.6 and more.</p>\n<p>You can&#39;t just cram it all in there, so what gets prime real estate by default? People say it&#39;s just a few pixels, that feed button—but is it so much more important than anything else that could go there? And before you answer, consider that not just for your personal use, but for the 100&#39;s of millions of people using Firefox. How do you check your own biases and make a decision on that scale? You could make an educated guess, make a gut check. A lot of brilliant design happens that way.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/\">gather some telemetry from beta installs to see what people really use</a>. Looking at a heatmap of clicks, the feed button is an absolute stinker. This isn&#39;t a random whim of the UX team—seriously, it&#39;s an <strong>order of magnitude</strong> less used than anything else in the toolbar (notice the one black spot):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/heatmap.png\" alt=\"heatmap.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"75\" /></a></p>\n<p>There have been comments dismissing the validity of that heatmap study. But, as far as I can tell, none of them really stick. So, for the sake of argument and a shorter blog post, let&#39;s assume barely anyone is using the feed icon and that it&#39;s not pulling its weight in this new age of browser minimalism.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that Firefox isn&#39;t the only browser to deprioritize the feed button: <em>Google Chrome doesn&#39;t even have a feed button at all</em>, and for many people that&#39;s the gold standard for minimal browser UI:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-chrome.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-chrome.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\n\n<p><a name=\"serving\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"serving-the-users\">Serving the users</h3>\n<p>Let&#39;s hammer on the point of disuse some more—what&#39;s the payoff for clicking that thing, anyway?</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-styling.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-styling.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" />\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>+1 — You get an option to create a <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/livebookmarks.html\">Live Bookmark</a>, which is really handy for things like Bugzilla searches or light headline reading. (I like those so much that I tried building them on the server at Delicious once, but we never quite worked it out at scale.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>0 — You get a list of sites to which Firefox will delegate subscription, if you happen to have <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM:window.navigator.registerContentHandler\">installed a content handler</a>. Useful if you know what it&#39;s about; a mystery if you don&#39;t—not much more useful than a bookmarklet, to me.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>-1 — You get a plainly-styled version of what you were probably already looking at on a site, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/02/firefox-20-breaks-client-side-xsl-for-rss-and-atom-feeds\">something I criticized back in 2006</a>, like some are criticizing the feed icon change now.  (At the time, I was working for <a href=\"http://organic.com\">a marketing company</a>, and the change cost me days trying to incorporate branding in feeds on <a href=\"http://www.jeep.com/en/autoshow/feeds/jeep-all.xml\">a client&#39;s site</a>. I think we gave up after a bit, but I suspect that <a href=\"http://feedburner.com\">FeedBurner</a> built a nice business routing around that change.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#39;s been status quo for years, and it&#39;s less than compelling—I&#39;ve even had people ask me if they broke the page when the button was clicked on accident.</p>\n<p>So, given little reward for clicking that feed icon, <em>pushing it into the background in <strong>its current state</strong> is a service to the users of Firefox<em>. In other words, that feed button has to get a lot more interesting if it&#39;s going to serve alongside UI all-stars like <strong>Back</strong>, <strong>Reload</strong>, and **Location</em></em>. </p>\n<p>Hell, even with Firebug installed, I use <strong>View Source</strong> more than the feed button these days, and I&#39;ve never stuck <em>that</em> on the toolbar.</p>\n<h3 id=\"leading-the-web\">Leading the web</h3>\n<p>The most compelling response I&#39;ve seen to the &quot;removal&quot; of the feed auto-discovery button is the challenge that Mozilla and other browser makers should be <em>improving</em> feed-related features, rather than pushing them into the background. With this, I wholeheartedly agree—but I&#39;m not entirely sure what to do about it.</p>\n<p>So, there&#39;s a balance here: Make the <strong>experience of the web better</strong> by improving how Firefox handles what&#39;s already out there, and <strong>make the web itself better</strong> by building more powerful and enabling technologies into Firefox and other products. In the best of times, Mozilla can do and has done both at once. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL\">WebGL</a> and technologies associated with HTML5 represent great examples of this.</p>\n<p>But, alas, syndication feeds in the browser have stagnated. The feed button has been a weak feature <em>for years</em>. In the meantime, other things have taken priority in the Firefox project. The rise of Twitter and Facebook and more complex applications on the web have reduced the need for most people to interact directly with feeds, so demands for attention to the feed button haven&#39;t exactly topped the charts in comparison to things like <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/The%20Adobe%20Flash%20plugin%20has%20crashed\">making sure Flash doesn&#39;t crash the browser</a> and <a href=\"http://arewefastyet.com/\">getting super fast</a> for everything else. </p>\n<h3 id=\"ship-it\">Ship it!</h3>\n<p>In the end, Mozilla has a browser to ship. The decision on the feed button <em>has been made</em> and, believe it or not, with a great deal of thought behind it. </p>\n<p>I know that this is the first time many people have heard of this change, but many already have heard and have given the UX team a number of earsful. Coming in at this late stage and requesting—nay <strong>demanding</strong>—a reversal of that decision will do nothing but piss off all the people who&#39;ve been banging away at this and many other things up to now. They&#39;re people who&#39;ve worked hard, stayed up late—and the last thing anyone wants to do is rehash every conversation ever about the topic.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089393\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=478a310fc648c632ba1a3c120437289b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jacques</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089393\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T07:22:31\">2011-01-16T07:22:31</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I understand that we always try to enhance UI of any software and that it takes a lot of time and discussions to make decisions.

There's no way to fit a large number of beta users with eye-tracking gear. Also, I personally don't buy that people just like to have the feed indicator around because it's nice to see it light up.

This post talks about why things have changed.</em>\r\n\r\nThere's [a brouhaha](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discover icon in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, *and* a Mozilla employee—I've got at least a few opinions.\r\n\r\nThis post is one of [several on this subject](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967).\r\n\r\n### Defaults are hard to pare down\r\n\r\nThe [feed icon still lives](http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/how-to-use-feed-auto-discovery-in-firefox-4) in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/); it's just not there by default any more. But, if you look at the controls available in [the toolbar customization panel](http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png), you'll notice a *lot* of things that don't show up by default—there are a lot of things in there, period.\r\n\r\nThis is the dilemma for [the Firefox User Experience team at Mozilla](http://planet.firefox.com/ux/): Like it or not, one of the main themes of this next generation of browsers is minimalism—faster, smaller, less browser to get in the way of what you're browsing. Yet, at the same time, Firefox 4 has the features of Firefox 3.6 and more.\r\n\r\nYou can't just cram it all in there, so what gets prime real estate by default? People say it's just a few pixels, that feed button—but is it so much more important than anything else that could go there? And before you answer, consider that not just for your personal use, but for the 100's of millions of people using Firefox. How do you check your own biases and make a decision on that scale? You could make an educated guess, make a gut check. A lot of brilliant design happens that way.\r\n\r\nYou can also [gather some telemetry from beta installs to see what people really use](https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/). Looking at a heatmap of clicks, the feed button is an absolute stinker. This isn't a random whim of the UX team—seriously, it's an **order of magnitude** less used than anything else in the toolbar (notice the one black spot):\r\n\r\n[<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/heatmap.png\" alt=\"heatmap.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"75\" />](https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/)\r\n\r\nThere have been comments dismissing the validity of that heatmap study. But, as far as I can tell, none of them really stick. So, for the sake of argument and a shorter blog post, let's assume barely anyone is using the feed icon and that it's not pulling its weight in this new age of browser minimalism.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that Firefox isn't the only browser to deprioritize the feed button: *Google Chrome doesn't even have a feed button at all*, and for many people that's the gold standard for minimal browser UI:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-chrome.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-chrome.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\r\n\r\n<a name=\"serving\"></a>\r\n### Serving the users\r\n\r\nLet's hammer on the point of disuse some more—what's the payoff for clicking that thing, anyway?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-styling.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-styling.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" />\r\n\r\n* +1 — You get an option to create a [Live Bookmark](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/livebookmarks.html), which is really handy for things like Bugzilla searches or light headline reading. (I like those so much that I tried building them on the server at Delicious once, but we never quite worked it out at scale.)\r\n\r\n* 0 — You get a list of sites to which Firefox will delegate subscription, if you happen to have [installed a content handler](https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM:window.navigator.registerContentHandler). Useful if you know what it's about; a mystery if you don't—not much more useful than a bookmarklet, to me.\r\n\r\n* -1 — You get a plainly-styled version of what you were probably already looking at on a site, [something I criticized back in 2006](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/02/firefox-20-breaks-client-side-xsl-for-rss-and-atom-feeds), like some are criticizing the feed icon change now.  (At the time, I was working for [a marketing company](http://organic.com), and the change cost me days trying to incorporate branding in feeds on [a client's site](http://www.jeep.com/en/autoshow/feeds/jeep-all.xml). I think we gave up after a bit, but I suspect that [FeedBurner](http://feedburner.com) built a nice business routing around that change.)\r\n\r\nThat's been status quo for years, and it's less than compelling—I've even had people ask me if they broke the page when the button was clicked on accident.\r\n\r\nSo, given little reward for clicking that feed icon, *pushing it into the background in **its current state** is a service to the users of Firefox*. In other words, that feed button has to get a lot more interesting if it's going to serve alongside UI all-stars like **Back**, **Reload**, and **Location**. \r\n\r\nHell, even with Firebug installed, I use **View Source** more than the feed button these days, and I've never stuck *that* on the toolbar.\r\n\r\n### Leading the web\r\n\r\nThe most compelling response I've seen to the \"removal\" of the feed auto-discovery button is the challenge that Mozilla and other browser makers should be *improving* feed-related features, rather than pushing them into the background. With this, I wholeheartedly agree—but I'm not entirely sure what to do about it.\r\n\r\nSo, there's a balance here: Make the **experience of the web better** by improving how Firefox handles what's already out there, and **make the web itself better** by building more powerful and enabling technologies into Firefox and other products. In the best of times, Mozilla can do and has done both at once. [WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) and technologies associated with HTML5 represent great examples of this.\r\n\r\nBut, alas, syndication feeds in the browser have stagnated. The feed button has been a weak feature *for years*. In the meantime, other things have taken priority in the Firefox project. The rise of Twitter and Facebook and more complex applications on the web have reduced the need for most people to interact directly with feeds, so demands for attention to the feed button haven't exactly topped the charts in comparison to things like [making sure Flash doesn't crash the browser](https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/The%20Adobe%20Flash%20plugin%20has%20crashed) and [getting super fast](http://arewefastyet.com/) for everything else. \r\n\r\n### Ship it!\r\n\r\nIn the end, Mozilla has a browser to ship. The decision on the feed button *has been made* and, believe it or not, with a great deal of thought behind it. \r\n\r\nI know that this is the first time many people have heard of this change, but many already have heard and have given the UX team a number of earsful. Coming in at this late stage and requesting—nay **demanding**—a reversal of that decision will do nothing but piss off all the people who've been banging away at this and many other things up to now. They're people who've worked hard, stayed up late—and the last thing anyone wants to do is rehash every conversation ever about the topic.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089393\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=478a310fc648c632ba1a3c120437289b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Jacques</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089393\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T07:22:31\">2011-01-16T07:22:31</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I understand that we always try to enhance UI of any software and that it takes a lot of time and discussions to make decisions.

In reality, with respect to <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\">Firefox Sync</a>, Mozilla has done all of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Published <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Sync/1.0/API\">the Sync API spec</a>;</li>\n<li>Released <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/services/sync-server/\">the source code for the server used in-house</a>;</li>\n<li>Explicitly included the option to use a custom server when setting up sync in the browser.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This means that, although Mozilla offers servers to go along with <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/\">Firefox Sync</a>, you&#39;re totally free to take your data elsewhere. Since your sync data is encrypted and practically opaque to the server, there&#39;s no direct profit for Mozilla in offering free sync hosting—not even through any clandestine data mining for devious purposes. It&#39;s just that sync makes Firefox a better browser, and <em>somebody</em> has to run some servers to make it work.</p>\n<p>So, there&#39;s every incentive to make it easy for you to switch sync providers and <em>stop freeloading</em> on Mozilla&#39;s servers. Building a server on <a href=\"http://appengine.google.com/\">Google App Engine</a> means I can freeload on <em>Google&#39;s</em> servers!</p>\n<p>I kid, of course. No one&#39;s really complaining about freeloaders, and App Engine has quotas in place to head off any serious mooching—which is why I&#39;m not telling you where to find <em>my</em> sync server deployed on Google App Engine, by the way. </p>\n<p>No, I did this because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firefox Sync and Google App Engine are interesting and important technologies;</li>\n<li>I&#39;ve already done a bit of work on the PHP-based Firefox Sync server at Mozilla;</li>\n<li>I really wanted to take a break from PHP and spend some time with my old friend Python.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are, of course, a number of bugs in this server. But, it seems to be working between a number of machines and browser profiles I have at home. Things are really in need of optimization, it suffers from my inexperience with App Engine, and I keep running into those aforementioned App Engine resource limits—especially when updating or deleting large numbers of items (ie. 1000&#39;s to 10000&#39;s of items).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/firefox-sync-appengine\"><em>Pull requests and issue reports on GitHub are welcome!</em></a></p>\n<p>A next step I&#39;d like to take with this thing is to revisit another old friend, the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer\">desktop web app server</a>.

But, although\n        <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, and\n        <code>mouseup</code> made it possible, the implementation has been\n        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,\n        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,\n        there's a challenge to find the subject of the drop when\n        the interaction is completed.\n    </p><p>\n\n<pre><code>    Of course, that doesn&#39;t prevent most modern JavaScript\n    frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and\n    throwing in some flourishes while they&#39;re at it.  But, wouldn&#39;t\n    it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and\n    drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd&quot;&gt;section on new drag-and-drop events&lt;/a&gt;, and \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop&quot;&gt;Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation&lt;/a&gt; of those events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    If you want to jump straight to the code, I&#39;ve put together \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html&quot;&gt;some simple demos&lt;/a&gt; \n    of the new events.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n    I&#39;ve even scratched an itch of my own and\n    built &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html&quot;&gt;the beginnings of an outline editor&lt;/a&gt;,\n    where every draggable element is also a drop target—of which\n    there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something\n    that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past\n    while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from \n    &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop&quot;&gt;a GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;\n    I&#39;ve created especially for this article—which continues after the jump.\n&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<div id=\"events\">\n\n<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;The New Drag and Drop Events&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n    So, with no further ado, here are the new drag and drop events,\n    in roughly the order you might expect to see them fired:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;dl&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        A drag has been initiated, with the dragged element as the\n        event target.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;drag&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        The mouse has moved, with the dragged element as the event target.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;dragenter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        The dragged element has been moved into a drop listener,\n        with the drop listener element as the event target.\n    &lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;dragover&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n\n    &lt;dd&gt;\n        The dragged element has been moved over a drop listener,\n        with the drop listener element as the event target.

Rather than needing to attach listeners\n            or otherwise fiddle with all 1000 items, simply attach\n            a listener to the parent node (eg. the\n            &lt;code&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element) and all events from\n            the children will propagate up to the single parent listener.\n            As a bonus, all new child elements added after page\n            load will enjoy the same benefits.\n        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n            &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#delegated&quot;&gt;Check out this demo&lt;/a&gt;, \n            and \n            &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-delegated.js&quot;&gt;the associated JS code&lt;/a&gt; \n            to see more about these events and Event Delegation.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"datatransfer\">\n    <h2>Using dataTransfer</h2>\n    <p>\n        As mentioned in the last section, the new drag and drop events\n        let you send data along with a dragged element.  But, it's even\n        better than that:  Your drop targets can receive data\n        transferred by content objects dragged into the window from \n        other browser windows, and even <i>other applications</i>.\n    </p><p>\n\n<pre><code>    Since the example is a bit longer,  \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#data_transfer&quot;&gt;check out the live demo&lt;/a&gt;\n    and \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-datatransfer.js&quot;&gt;associated code&lt;/a&gt;\n    to get an idea of what&#39;s possible with &lt;code&gt;dataTransfer&lt;/code&gt;.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    In a nutshell, the stars of this show are the\n    &lt;code&gt;setData()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getData()&lt;/code&gt; methods of\n    the &lt;code&gt;dataTransfer&lt;/code&gt; property exposed by the Event object.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n    The &lt;code&gt;setData()&lt;/code&gt; method is typically called in the \n    &lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt; listener, loading &lt;code&gt;dataTransfer&lt;/code&gt;\n    up with one or more strings of content with associated\n    &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Recommended_Drag_Types#link&quot;&gt;recommended content types&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n    For illustration, here&#39;s a quick snippet from the example code:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot; line=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;<br>dt.setData(&#39;text/plain&#39;, $(&#39;#logo&#39;).parent().text());\ndt.setData(&#39;text/html&#39;, $(&#39;#logo&#39;).parent().html());\ndt.setData(&#39;text/uri-list&#39;, $(&#39;#logo&#39;)[0].src);\n    </pre>\n    </p><p>\n        On the other end, <code>getData()</code> allows you to query\n        for content by type (eg. <code>text/html</code> followed by\n        <code>text/plain</code>).  This, in turn, allows you to decide\n        on acceptable content types at the time of the\n        <code>drop</code> event or even during <code>dragover</code></p>\n<pre><code>    to offer feedback for unacceptable types during the drag.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    Here&#39;s another example from the receiving end of the example code:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot; line=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;<br>$(&#39;.content_url .content&#39;).text(dt.getData(&#39;text/uri-list&#39;));\n$(&#39;.content_text .content&#39;).text(dt.getData(&#39;text/plain&#39;));\n$(&#39;.content_html .content&#39;).html(dt.getData(&#39;text/html&#39;));\n    </pre>\n    <p>\n        Where <code>dataTransfer</code> really shines, though, is that\n        it allows your drop targets to receive content from \n        sources outside your defined draggable elements and even from\n        outside the browser altogether.  Firefox accepts such drags, \n        and attempts to populate <code>dataTransfer</code> with\n        appropriate content types extracted from the external object.\n    </p><p></p>\n<pre><code>    Thus, you could select some text in a word processor window and\n    drop it into one of your elements, and at least expect to find\n    it available as &lt;code&gt;text/plain&lt;/code&gt; content.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    You can also select content in \n    another browser window, and expect to see &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt;\n    appear in your events.

For dragging from external applications (such as the Desktop) is a normal webpage able to get the data from the drop?  I was just playing with it and seem to always get what seems to be a security error with getData or mozGetDataAt.  However, the documentation seems to state that on drop that data should be made available to the page.  Likewise, in the same way an image can be dragged off the page onto the desktop, can an arbitrary element be dragged onto the desktop with whatever file content to be saved?

I don't work on the browser itself, but I noticed that unexpected behavior on drag &amp; drop.  The window really should scroll when you get toward the top or bottom while dragging - and, in fact, most pre-HTML5 JS frameworks do that in their own drag &amp; drop abstractions.  </p>\n<p>Until / unless Firefox gets this fixed, the same sort of auto-scrolling could be hacked in to HTML5 drag and drop.  Not perfect, but it's doable.  That is, in the drag event, you can check if the mouse is near the upper or lower edge of the viewport - and if so, start scrolling appropriately. That's pretty much how the JS frameworks do it with old-school D&D</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090975\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.copperbot.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=df48b2c2a3a2be51b1e15f10c5fb05da&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.copperbot.net\">CopperBot</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090975\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-07-23T21:41:07\">2009-07-23T21:41:07</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Very cool article!

I've just come across a problem that's driving me nuts. I'm not fully comfortable with D&amp;D, but managed to move a crosshairs image over a map to very precisely controlled positions. It worked great on FF 3.6 and FF 4. After a couple of days of successful testing, the image suddenly refused to de dropped after being dragged (it rather flew back to its previous position). Do you know if there is a bug in FF that might cause this? </p>\n<p>BTW, during the programming process I updated Firebug, which also is getting a little cranky.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your prompt answer, Raul</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-324410737\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/google-4014af7ac4ea5d00df95bef4503b78dd.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Alexander Plutov</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-324410737\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-10-01T11:51:12\">2011-10-01T11:51:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Good post about Drag & Drop http://plutov.by/post/html5_drag_and_drop</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

In one gesture, it\r\n        allows users to pair the selection of an object with the\r\n        execution of an action, often including a second object in the\r\n        operation.  It's a simple yet powerful UI concept used to\r\n        support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),\r\n        and even the creation of link relationships.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        Since it's so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web\r\n        applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first\r\n        offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although\r\n        <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, and\r\n        <code>mouseup</code> made it possible, the implementation has been\r\n        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,\r\n        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,\r\n        there's a challenge to find the subject of the drop when\r\n        the interaction is completed.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        Of course, that doesn't prevent most modern JavaScript\r\n        frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and\r\n        throwing in some flourishes while they're at it.  But, wouldn't\r\n        it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and\r\n        drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd\">section on new drag-and-drop events</a>, and \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop\">Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation</a> of those events.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        If you want to jump straight to the code, I've put together \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html\">some simple demos</a> \r\n        of the new events.  \r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        I've even scratched an itch of my own and\r\n        built <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html\">the beginnings of an outline editor</a>,\r\n        where every draggable element is also a drop target—of which\r\n        there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something\r\n        that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past\r\n        while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from \r\n        <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop\">a GitHub repository</a>\r\n        I've created especially for this article—which continues after the jump.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"events\">\r\n\r\n    <h2>The New Drag and Drop Events</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        So, with no further ado, here are the new drag and drop events,\r\n        in roughly the order you might expect to see them fired:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <dl>\r\n        <dt><code>dragstart</code></dt>\r\n        <dd>\r\n            A drag has been initiated, with the dragged element as the\r\n            event target.\r\n        </dd>\r\n\r\n        <dt><code>drag</code></dt>\r\n        <dd>\r\n            The mouse has moved, with the dragged element as the event target.\r\n        </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>dragenter</code></dt>\r\n        <dd>\r\n            The dragged element has been moved into a drop listener,\r\n            with the drop listener element as the event target.\r\n        </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>dragover</code></dt>\r\n\r\n        <dd>\r\n            The dragged element has been moved over a drop listener,\r\n            with the drop listener element as the event target.

But, it's even\r\n        better than that:  Your drop targets can receive data\r\n        transferred by content objects dragged into the window from \r\n        other browser windows, and even <i>other applications</i>.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        Since the example is a bit longer,  \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#data_transfer\">check out the live demo</a>\r\n        and \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-datatransfer.js\">associated code</a>\r\n        to get an idea of what's possible with <code>dataTransfer</code>.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        In a nutshell, the stars of this show are the\r\n        <code>setData()</code> and <code>getData()</code> methods of\r\n        the <code>dataTransfer</code> property exposed by the Event object.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        The <code>setData()</code> method is typically called in the \r\n        <code>dragstart</code> listener, loading <code>dataTransfer</code>\r\n        up with one or more strings of content with associated\r\n        <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Recommended_Drag_Types#link\">recommended content types</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        For illustration, here's a quick snippet from the example code:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    \r\ndt.setData('text/plain', $('#logo').parent().text());\r\ndt.setData('text/html', $('#logo').parent().html());\r\ndt.setData('text/uri-list', $('#logo')[0].src);\r\n    </pre>\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        On the other end, <code>getData()</code> allows you to query\r\n        for content by type (eg. <code>text/html</code> followed by\r\n        <code>text/plain</code>).  This, in turn, allows you to decide\r\n        on acceptable content types at the time of the\r\n        <code>drop</code> event or even during <code>dragover</code>\r\n\r\n        to offer feedback for unacceptable types during the drag.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        Here's another example from the receiving end of the example code:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    \r\n$('.content_url .content').text(dt.getData('text/uri-list'));\r\n$('.content_text .content').text(dt.getData('text/plain'));\r\n$('.content_html .content').html(dt.getData('text/html'));\r\n    </pre>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Where <code>dataTransfer</code> really shines, though, is that\r\n        it allows your drop targets to receive content from \r\n        sources outside your defined draggable elements and even from\r\n        outside the browser altogether.  Firefox accepts such drags, \r\n        and attempts to populate <code>dataTransfer</code> with\r\n        appropriate content types extracted from the external object.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        Thus, you could select some text in a word processor window and\r\n        drop it into one of your elements, and at least expect to find\r\n        it available as <code>text/plain</code> content.  \r\n    </p><p>\r\n        You can also select content in \r\n        another browser window, and expect to see <code>text/html</code>\r\n        appear in your events.

But,\r\n       the <code>dataTransfer</code> property of the original Event\r\n       object exposes the method <code>setDragImage()</code> for use\r\n       in customizing this representation.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        There's\r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#feedback_image\">a live demo</a> of this feature, as well as\r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-feedback-images.js\">associated JS code</a> \r\n        available.

If the value does\r\n        not match up with <code>effectAllowed</code>, the drop will\r\n        be considered cancelled on completion.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        In the \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#drag_effects\">a live demo</a>,\r\n        you should be able to see that only elements with matching\r\n        effects can be dropped into the appropriate drop zones.  This\r\n        is accomplished with code like the following:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;\r\nswitch (ev.target.id) {\r\n    case 'effectdrop0': dt.dropEffect = 'copy'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop1': dt.dropEffect = 'move'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop2': dt.dropEffect = 'link'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop3': dt.dropEffect = 'all'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop4': dt.dropEffect = 'none'; break;\r\n}\r\n    </pre>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Although the OS itself can provide some feedback, you \r\n        can also use these properties to update your own visible \r\n        feedback, both on the dragged element and on the drop zone\r\n        itself.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"conclusion\">\r\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        The new first-class drag and drop events in HTML5 and Firefox\r\n        make supporting this form of UI interaction simple, concise,\r\n        and powerful in the browser.

For dragging from external applications (such as the Desktop) is a normal webpage able to get the data from the drop?

However, the documentation seems to state that on drop that data should be made available to the page.  Likewise, in the same way an image can be dragged off the page onto the desktop, can an arbitrary element be dragged onto the desktop with whatever file content to be saved?

I don't work on the browser itself, but I noticed that unexpected behavior on drag &amp; drop.  The window really should scroll when you get toward the top or bottom while dragging - and, in fact, most pre-HTML5 JS frameworks do that in their own drag &amp; drop abstractions.  </p>\n\n<p>Until / unless Firefox gets this fixed, the same sort of auto-scrolling could be hacked in to HTML5 drag and drop.  Not perfect, but it's doable.  That is, in the drag event, you can check if the mouse is near the upper or lower edge of the viewport - and if so, start scrolling appropriately.

I've just come across a problem that's driving me nuts. I'm not fully comfortable with D&amp;D, but managed to move a crosshairs image over a map to very precisely controlled positions. It worked great on FF 3.6 and FF 4. After a couple of days of successful testing, the image suddenly refused to de dropped after being dragged (it rather flew back to its previous position). Do you know if there is a bug in FF that might cause this? </p>\n\n<p>BTW, during the programming process I updated Firebug, which also is getting a little cranky.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your prompt answer, Raul</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-324410737\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/google-4014af7ac4ea5d00df95bef4503b78dd.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Alexander Plutov</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-324410737\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-10-01T11:51:12\">2011-10-01T11:51:12</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Good post about Drag & Drop http://plutov.by/post/html5_drag_and_drop</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

It&apos;s another blog post&#x2014;and this one\n<a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/html5-drag-and-drop/\">is cross-posted on hacks.mozilla.com</a>.\nI won&apos;t say this is the start of a renewed blogging habit, but let&apos;s see what happens.\n</i></p>\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\ndl { margin-left: 2em; }\ndd { margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.25em; }\n</style>\n<div id=\"introduction\">\n    <p>\n        Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions\n        afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it\n        allows users to pair the selection of an object with the\n        execution of an action, often including a second object in the\n        operation.  It&apos;s a simple yet powerful UI concept used to\n        support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),\n        and even the creation of link relationships.\n    </p><p>\n        Since it&apos;s so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web\n        applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first\n        offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although\n        <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, and\n        <code>mouseup</code> made it possible, the implementation has been\n        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,\n        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,\n        there&apos;s a challenge to find the subject of the drop when\n        the interaction is completed.\n    </p><p>\n\n</p><pre><code>    Of course, that doesn&apos;t prevent most modern JavaScript\n    frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and\n    throwing in some flourishes while they&apos;re at it.  But, wouldn&apos;t\n    it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and\n    drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd&quot;&gt;section on new drag-and-drop events&lt;/a&gt;, and \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop&quot;&gt;Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation&lt;/a&gt; of those events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    If you want to jump straight to the code, I&apos;ve put together \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html&quot;&gt;some simple demos&lt;/a&gt; \n    of the new events.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n    I&apos;ve even scratched an itch of my own and\n    built &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html&quot;&gt;the beginnings of an outline editor&lt;/a&gt;,\n    where every draggable element is also a drop target&#x2014;of which\n    there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something\n    that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past\n    while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from \n    &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop&quot;&gt;a GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;\n    I&apos;ve created especially for this article&#x2014;which continues after the jump.\n&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n"

    "html": "<p>After writing up my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/09/01/writing-a-delicious-command-for-ubiquity\">first stab at a Delicious command for Ubiquity</a>, I planned to continue revising it based on feedback and to work on exploring more of what Ubiquity enables.  I started looking into writing my own nouns for tag suggestions, as well as playing with page load and browser startup hooks.  And, I also started poking at a little bit of deeper extension development, which took up most of my time today.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/UbiquityCommands/\">updated my UbiquityCommands</a> page and checked in my latest revision of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/hgwebdir.cgi/UbiquityCommands/file/tip/delicious.ubiq.js\">the Delicious command</a>.  </p>\n<p>The main new feature is a status bar item reporting bookmarks for the current page:</p>\n<p><img style=\"padding: 0.25em\" src=\"http://decafbad.com/2008/ubiq-del-status.jpg\" />&nbsp;<img style=\"padding: 0.25em\" src=\"http://decafbad.com/2008/ubiq-del-tip.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see above, the command now comes with a status bar panel powered by the <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/feeds\">Delicious URL info JSON feed</a>, providing bookmarking info on every page visited.  It shows a bookmark count, a tooltip with further information, and sends the user to the URL info page on Delicious when clicked.  It mostly works, but it could use some looking at.  This is my first time really cracking open the hood on Firefox and XUL, and so I&#39;m feeling around in the dark.</p>\n<p>Specifically, I&#39;m using Ubiquity&#39;s page load hook—but I&#39;m also trying to augment that by tracking tab selection events, in order to keep the status bar info updated for the active tab.  But then, that leads me to trying to track new windows, to attach the tab selection event handler for every newly opened window.  Or I could just be barking up the wrong tree entirely.  At any rate, the code is probably brain-dead dumb, so I hope someone can clue me into a better way.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088289\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ef1b5a29836fa211b938d8ccbbd3e0a1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/\">Gen Kanai</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088289\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-07T08:10:39\">2008-09-07T08:10:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Les, you may want to let R/RW know about your new command.</p>\n<p>http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_ultimate_list_of_custom_ubiquity_verbs.php</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088292\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://abcdefu.wordpress.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=af8b180d6d4092fb42fe6b5e0b21536c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://abcdefu.wordpress.com/\">Abimanyu Raja</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088292\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-07T08:55:52\">2008-09-07T08:55:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I disagree...

    "body": "After writing up my [first stab at a Delicious command for Ubiquity][first], I planned to continue revising it based on feedback and to work on exploring more of what Ubiquity enables.  I started looking into writing my own nouns for tag suggestions, as well as playing with page load and browser startup hooks.  And, I also started poking at a little bit of deeper extension development, which took up most of my time today.\r\n\r\nI've [updated my UbiquityCommands][ub] page and checked in my latest revision of [the Delicious command][cmd].  \r\n\r\nThe main new feature is a status bar item reporting bookmarks for the current page:\r\n\r\n<img style=\"padding: 0.25em\" src=\"http://decafbad.com/2008/ubiq-del-status.jpg\" />&nbsp;<img style=\"padding: 0.25em\" src=\"http://decafbad.com/2008/ubiq-del-tip.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nAs you can see above, the command now comes with a status bar panel powered by the [Delicious URL info JSON feed][urlinfo], providing bookmarking info on every page visited.  It shows a bookmark count, a tooltip with further information, and sends the user to the URL info page on Delicious when clicked.  It mostly works, but it could use some looking at.  This is my first time really cracking open the hood on Firefox and XUL, and so I'm feeling around in the dark.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'm using Ubiquity's page load hook—but I'm also trying to augment that by tracking tab selection events, in order to keep the status bar info updated for the active tab.  But then, that leads me to trying to track new windows, to attach the tab selection event handler for every newly opened window.  Or I could just be barking up the wrong tree entirely.  At any rate, the code is probably brain-dead dumb, so I hope someone can clue me into a better way.\r\n\r\n[urlinfo]: http://delicious.com/help/feeds\r\n[cmd]: http://decafbad.com/hgwebdir.cgi/UbiquityCommands/file/tip/delicious.ubiq.js\r\n[ub]: http://decafbad.com/UbiquityCommands/\r\n[first]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/09/01/writing-a-delicious-command-for-ubiquity\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088289\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ef1b5a29836fa211b938d8ccbbd3e0a1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/\">Gen Kanai</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088289\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-07T08:10:39\">2008-09-07T08:10:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Les, you may want to let R/RW know about your new command.</p>\n\n<p>http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_ultimate_list_of_custom_ubiquity_verbs.php</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088292\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://abcdefu.wordpress.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=af8b180d6d4092fb42fe6b5e0b21536c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://abcdefu.wordpress.com/\">Abimanyu Raja</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088292\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-07T08:55:52\">2008-09-07T08:55:52</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I disagree...

But, how that I think about it I wonder if I should make those work together.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088314\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://FromTheGut.us\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3be27db3db50892929ef892ab04621a4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://FromTheGut.us\">Frank</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088314\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-09T17:40:39\">2008-09-09T17:40:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hello, </p>\n\n<p>I was wondering if there was any chance you could put together a post annotating/explaining the changes/additions to your improved Delicious command.

    "html": "<p>In my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/08/31/ubiquity-cracks-open-personal-mashup-tinkering\" title=\"Ubiquity cracks open personal mashup tinkering\">last post</a>, I got all fluffy about how cool <a href=\"http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/\">Ubiquity</a> is but didn&#39;t share any code to prove the point.  As it happens, I have come up with at least one useful command that I&#39;m starting to use habitually in posting bookmarks to Delicious.  You can <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/UbiquityCommands/\">subscribe to my command</a> or <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/hg/UbiquityCommands/file/tip/delicious.ubiq.js\">check out the full source</a>—this post will serve as a dissection of the thing.  Since this will be fairly lengthy, follow along after the jump.</p>\n<p>Oh, and it&#39;s been awhile since I posted something this in-depth around here, so feel free to let me know how this first draft works.  And, bug reports and patches are of course welcome.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>To begin, consider the following code starting off the command source code:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\n/**\n * share-on-delicious - an Ubiquity command for sharing bookmarks on\n * delicious.com\n *\n * l.m.orchard@pobox.com\n * http://decafbad.com/\n * Share and Enjoy!\n */\nvar uext = Application.extensions.get('ubiquity@labs.mozilla.com');\n\nvar cookie_mgr = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/cookiemanager;1\"]\n    .getService(Components.interfaces.nsICookieManager);\n</pre>\n\n<p>The first thing to note here is that a short header comment introduces the command.  This isn&#39;t required, but it&#39;s a good idea.  It&#39;s also something you can&#39;t really do with bookmarklets.  On the other hand, Greasemonkey user scripts expect metadata about the script to be provided here, but Ubiquity doesn&#39;t use this convention.</p>\n<p>Second, notice that the code accesses some chrome-level resources.  Again, this is something unavailable to bookmarklets and Greasemonkey user scripts.  Just take a look at the <a href=\"http://developer.mozilla.org/en/FUEL\">FUEL library documentation</a> to get a quick sense of what&#39;s available using that simplified API, not to mention what&#39;s available using the lower-level browser APIs.</p>\n<p>Now, check out this next chunk of code, which begins the construction of an Ubiquity command:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"13\">\nCmdUtils.CreateCommand({\n\n    name:        \n        'share-on-delicious',\n    icon:\n        'http://delicious.com/favicon.ico',\n    description: \n        'Share the current page as a bookmark on delicious.com',\n    help:        \n        'Select text on the page to use as notes, or enter your own ' + \n        'text after the command word.  You can also assign tags to the '+ \n        'bookmark with the \"tagged\" modifier, and alter the bookmark ' + \n        'default page title with the \"entitled\" modifier.  Note that ' + \n        'you must also already be logged in at delicious.com to use ' +\n        'this command.',\n\n    homepage:   \n        'http://decafbad.com',\n    author: { \n        name: 'Leslie Michael Orchard', \n        email: 'l.m.orchard@pobox.com' \n    },\n    license:\n        'MPL/GPL/LGPL',\n</pre>\n\n<p>Whereas Greasemonkey scripts support metadata in the header comment, the Ubiquity command script API works a little differently.  </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hg.toolness.com/ubiquity-firefox/file/tip/ubiquity/chrome/content/cmdutils.js\"><code>CmdUtils</code> module</a> provided by Ubiquity offers a <code>CreateCommand</code> function, which expects an object as a parameter.  The object literal whose construction is begun in the code above serves as a self-contained package for the command, bearing metadata describing the command as well as containing all the code necessary to implement it.</p>\n<p>So, in the above code block, you can see the machine-readable description of the command—including a command name, display icon, home page URL, author information, and license.  The command name (<code>share-on-delicious</code>) will be used by the Ubiquity command parser, but the rest of the description will also be used in the list of commands available to the user, invoked by the <code>command-list</code> command, like so:</p>\n<img src=\"/2008/ubiq-share-on-delicious-list.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333; margin: 0.25em; padding: 0.25em\" />\n\n<p>Moving along, this next chunk of code introduces the first functional bits of the command:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"37\">\n    takes: { notes: noun_arb_text },\n    modifiers: { \n        tagged:  noun_arb_text,\n        entitled: noun_arb_text\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>Like smart keyword shortcut bookmarks, Ubiquity commands accept user-supplied input.  But, what&#39;s unique to Ubiquity is that it employs a parser whose goal is to support something approximating natural language.  At present, this results in commands that support a single primary argument—declared above with the <code>takes</code> property—and any number of additional keyword modifiers—declared above by the <code>modifiers</code> property.</p>\n<p>For the command under construction here, this establishes a pattern something like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>share-on-delicious {notes} [tagged {tags} entitled {title}]</code></pre>\n<p>Content for the <code>{notes}</code> argument can either be typed directly by hand, or it can be supplied by text highlighted on the page.  To use highlighted text, you can either issue the command alone, or use the word <code>this</code> for the <code>{notes}</code> argument before including further modifiers.</p>\n<p>The modifiers <code>tagged</code> and <code>entitled</code> are optional, and can be used in any order.  Each of these keywords signifies the start of a different argument—which unfortunately can collide with the literal data supplied for notes, which will hopefully be a rare occurrence.</p>\n<p>All of this adds up command invocations including the following:</p>\n<pre><code>share-on-delicious\nshare-on-delicious I really like this page tagged nifty amusing\nshare-on-delicious this entitled This bookmark has no tags\nsh this tagged osx software apple entitled This is good OS X software</code></pre>\n<p>That last example is important—since I have no other commands starting with &quot;<code>sh</code>&quot;, I can abbreviate the full command.  Ubiquity only requires enough of a command name to disambiguate it within your collection of commands.</p>\n<p>Another thing to note is the use of the constant value <code>noun_arb_text</code>, which declares that these arguments should expect any arbitrary text as input.  </p>\n<p>This facility is not exploited for the present command, but Ubiquity defines <a href=\"http://hg.toolness.com/ubiquity-firefox/file/tip/ubiquity/chrome/content/nlparser/en/nountypes.js\">noun types</a>.  These include concepts such as plain text, dates, address book contacts, browser tabs, bookmark tags, and more.  You can define your own noun types, as well as implement suggestion schemes that help guide the user toward constructing useful input values in the command interface.  You can <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1_Author_Tutorial#Introduction_to_Noun_Types\">read more about this</a> in the official author tutorial.</p>\n<p>Next up is a quick bit of command-specific configuration:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"42\">\n    /**\n     * Command configuration settings.\n     */\n    _config: {\n        // Base URL for the delicious v1 API\n        api_base:      'https://api.del.icio.us',\n\n        // Domain and name of the delicious login session cookie.\n        cookie_domain: '.delicious.com',\n        cookie_name:   '_user'\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>Since this command will be posting to Delicious via the V1 API, it&#39;s handy to declare the base URL for the API in an easily changed spot.  That way, you could change this value later on to point the command at another implementation of the API.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this command will employ a little-known authentication trick supported by the Delicious API that accepts the user&#39;s login cookie set by the Delicious website—this &quot;cookie god&quot; auth is used by the official Delicious addon for Firefox.  It&#39;s handy for piggybacking on the website login and removing the need to ask the user for their username and password again and possibly storing it in an insecure manner.</p>\n<p>In fact, this next chunk of code defines a utility method to rummage through the cookie jar:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"53\">\n    /**\n     * Dig up the Delicious login session cookie.\n     */\n    _getUserCookie: function() {\n        var iter = cookie_mgr.enumerator;\n        while (iter.hasMoreElements()) {\n            var cookie = iter.getNext();\n            if( cookie instanceof Components.interfaces.nsICookie && \n                cookie.host.indexOf(this._config.cookie_domain) != -1 && \n                cookie.name == this._config.cookie_name) {\n                return decodeURIComponent(cookie.value);\n            }\n        }\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>The method defined above, <code>._getUserCookie()</code>, uses the browser&#39;s cookie manager and the values defined in the previous configuration section to find the login session cookie set for Delicious.  Take note that this is far beyond the allowed capabilities of bookmarklets and Greasemoney user scripts—this is digging straight into the browser itself, skipping past the usual content-space security restrictions.  </p>\n<p>In other words: In Ubiquity, <em>the gun is loaded</em> and you should be careful.  </p>\n<p>Moving along, consider this next utility method:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"67\">\n    /**\n     * Given input data and modifiers, attempt to assemble data necessary to\n     * post a bookmark.\n     */\n    _extractBookmarkData: function(input_obj, mods) {\n        return {\n            _user:\n                this._getUserCookie(),\n            url:\n                context.focusedWindow.location,\n            description:\n                mods.entitled.text || context.focusedWindow.document.title,\n            extended: \n                input_obj.text,\n            tags:\n                mods.tagged.text\n        };\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>Named <code>._extractBookmarkData()</code>, this utility method accepts the results of Ubiquity&#39;s parser interpreting the primary argument and modifier arguments supplied by the user.  Using these data structures, it attempts to build a structure representing the fields of a Delicious bookmark.</p>\n<p>The <code>_user</code> field is used for authentication via the site login cookie.  The <code>url</code> is set from the location bar of the current page.  The <code>description</code>, or title, field of the bookmark is taken from either the <code>entitled</code> modifier or the title of the current page.  The <code>tags</code>, if any, come from the <code>tagged</code> modifier.  And, finally, the <code>extended</code> notes for the bookmark are taken from the primary input argument of the command.</p>\n<p>As you&#39;ll see shortly, this utility method will be used in both the preview and the execution of the command.</p>\n<p>Next, there&#39;s one more utility method to cover:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"85\">\n    /**\n     * Given an object, build a URL query string\n     */\n    _buildQueryString: function(data) {\n        var qs = [];\n        for (k in data) if (data[k]) \n            qs.push( encodeURIComponent(k) + '=' + \n                encodeURIComponent(data[k]) );\n        return qs.join('&');\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>In anticipation of using the Delicious V1 API, the <code>._buildQueryString()</code> method accepts an object and constructs a URL query string from the encoded properties of the object.  This will be paired with the <code>._extractBookmarkData()</code> method to supply data for API calls.</p>\n<p>Moving along, it&#39;s time to start digging into the meat of this Ubiquity command:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"95\">\n    /**\n     * Present a preview of the bookmark under construction during the course\n     * of composing the command.\n     */\n    preview: function(pblock, input_obj, mods) {\n\n        var bm          = this._extractBookmarkData(input_obj, mods);\n        var user_cookie = this._getUserCookie();\n        var user_name   = (user_cookie) ? user_cookie.split(' ')[0] : '';\n\n        var ns = { user_name: user_name, bm: bm };\n        var tmpl;\n</pre>\n\n<p>With this code, the implementation of command method <code>.preview()</code> has begun.  This method is used by Ubiquity to generate a live preview of the command.  Called with a DOM node (<code>pblock</code>) and partially completed command input (<code>input_obj</code> and <code>mods</code>), this method is expected to build a representation of the command&#39;s results in the DOM node.  As the user types, this method will be called over and over again, ideally offering feedback as the user composes a command.</p>\n<p>Continuing on, consider this next chunk of code checking the validity of command input:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"107\">\n        if (!user_name) {\n\n            // If there's no user name, there's no login, so this command won't work. \n            tmpl = [ \n                '<p style=\"color: #d44\">No active user found - log in at ', \n                '<img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\n                '<b><a style=\"color: #3774D0\" href=\"http://delicious.com\">delicious.com</a></b> ', \n                'to use this command.</p>'\n            ].join('');\n\n        } else if (!bm.description) {\n\n            // If there's no title, then this is an error too.\n            tmpl = [ \n                '<p style=\"color: #d44\">A title is required for bookmarks on ', \n                '<img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\n                '<b><a style=\"color: #3774D0\" href=\"http://delicious.com\">delicious.com</a></b> ', \n                '</p>'\n            ].join('');\n</pre>\n\n<p>This chunk of code first checks for a user name, which can be extracted from a valid Delicious login cookie, if one was found.  If not found, the command will fail—so the preview built here will instruct the user to login at Delicious before going further.</p>\n<p>The second precondition for using the command is that the bookmark has been given a title.  By default, this is the title of the current page—but, some pages don&#39;t offer titles.  So, an error needs to be flagged if the user hasn&#39;t manually supplied a title in this case.</p>\n<p>Finally, notice in both of these error cases, a string of HTML is composed in the variable <code>tmpl</code>.  This will be used at the end of the method to populate the DOM node passed in as <code>pblock</code>.</p>\n<p>Now, assuming that all the command&#39;s prerequisites have been met, it&#39;s time to try constructing a proper preview for the results of this command: </p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"126\">\n        } else {\n\n            // Attempt to construct a vaguely delicious-esque preview of a bookmark.\n            tmpl = [ \n                '<style type=\"text/css\">',\n                    '.preview a { color: #3774D0 }',\n                    '.del-bookmark { font: 12px arial; color: #ddd; background: #eee; line-height: 1.25em }',\n                    '.del-bookmark a.title { color: #1259C7 }',\n                    '.del-bookmark .full-url { color: #396C9B; font-size: 12px; display: block; padding: 0.25em 0 }',\n                    '.del-bookmark .notes { color: #4D4D4D }',\n                    '.del-bookmark .tags { color: #787878; padding-top: 0.25em; text-align: right }',\n                '</style>',\n                '<div class=\"preview\">',\n                    '<p>Share a bookmark at <img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\n                        '<b><a href=\"http://delicious.com/${user_name}\">delicious.com/${user_name}</a></b>:</p>',\n                    '<div class=\"del-bookmark\">',\n                        '<div style=\"padding: 1em;\">',\n                        '<a class=\"title\" href=\"${bm.url}\">${bm.description}</a>',\n                        '<a class=\"full-url\" href=\"${bm.url}\">${bm.url}</a>',\n                        bm.extended ? \n                            '<div class=\"notes\">${bm.extended}</div>' : '',\n                        bm.tags ?\n                            '<div class=\"tags\"><span>tags:</span> ${bm.tags}</div>' : '',\n                    '</div>',\n                '</div>'\n            ].join(\"\\n\");\n\n        }\n\n        pblock.innerHTML = CmdUtils.renderTemplate(tmpl, ns);\n    },\n</pre>\n\n<p>Building on the notion that previews are built in a DOM node, the code above uses both CSS and HTML to assemble a quick-and-dirty facsimile of a Delicious bookmark—which will be rendered like this:</p>\n<img src=\"/2008/ubiq-share-on-delicious-preview.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333; margin: 0.25em; padding: 0.25em\" />\n\n<p>Also note that Ubiquity provides a template engine for use in generating content—namely the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/JavaScriptTemplates\">JavaScript Templates</a> engine from the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/TrimPath\">TrimPath</a> project.  This engine may eventually be replaced with another, but the notion is that Ubiquity will provide tools to more easily generate previews and more.</p>\n<p>The conclusion of the <code>.preview()</code> method uses the template engine with a call to <code>CmdUtils.renderTemplate()</code> to inject content into the preview element by way of the <code>.innerHTML</code> property.</p>\n<p>Now that the preview is out of the way, it&#39;s time to get down to implementing the execution of the command:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"157\">    \n    /**\n     * Attempt to use the delicious v1 API to post a bookmark using the \n     * command input\n     */\n    execute: function(input_obj, mods) {\n        var bm          = this._extractBookmarkData(input_obj, mods);\n        var user_cookie = this._getUserCookie();\n        var user_name   = (user_cookie) ? user_cookie.split(' ')[0] : '';\n\n        if (!user_name) {\n            // If there's no user name, there's no login, so this command won't work. \n            displayMessage('No active user found - log in at delicious.com ' +\n                'to use this command.');\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        if (!bm.description) {\n            // If there's no title, somehow, then this is an error too.\n            displayMessage(\"A title is required for bookmarks at delicious.com\");\n            return false;\n        }\n</pre>\n\n<p>Mirroring the <code>.preview()</code> method, the <code>.execute()</code> method first checks for validity of the arguments given by the user.  A missing user name or title result in a notification that the command has failed.</p>\n<p>But, if the arguments are all valid, it&#39;s time to actually issue a request to the Delicious V1 API:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"178\">\n        var path = '/v1/posts/add';\n        var url  = this._config.api_base + path;\n\n        var req = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/xmlextras/xmlhttprequest;1\"].\n            createInstance();\n\n        req.open('POST', url, true);\n\n        req.onload = function(ev) { \n            displayMessage('Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n                'shared at delicious.com/' + user_name);\n        }\n\n        req.onerror = function(ev) { \n            displayMessage('ERROR: Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n                ' NOT shared on delicious.com/' + user_name);\n        }\n</pre>\n\n<p>Using the base URL for the Delicious API declared earlier in the configuration section, the <code>.execute()</code> method constructs an API URL for the <code>/v1/posts/add</code> method.  Then, it creates an instance of <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> from the browser to be used in sending the API request.  Event handlers are registered with the object to present notifications to the user indicating whether or not the API request was successful.</p>\n<p>At long last, it&#39;s time to wrap up this method and make the API request:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"195\">\n        req.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Basic Y29va2llOmNvb2tpZQ=='); // btoa('cookie:cookie')\n\n        var mediator = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/appshell/window-mediator;1\"].\n            getService(Components.interfaces.nsIWindowMediator);\n        var win = mediator.getMostRecentWindow(null);\n        var user_agent = win.navigator.userAgent + \";Ubiquity-share-on-delicious\";\n\n        req.setRequestHeader(\"User-Agent\", user_agent);      \n\n        req.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');\n        req.send(this._buildQueryString(bm));\n    },\n\n    EOF:null // I hate trailing commas\n});\n</pre>\n\n<p>The login cookie authentication supported by the Delicious V1 API is triggered by supplying a user name / password pair of <code>cookie</code>, which is done by setting the <code>Authorization</code> request header.  The login cookie is then expected to be passed in as the POST variable <code>_user</code>, which is done in the <code>._extractBookmarkData()</code> utility method.</p>\n<p>Another bit here that shows more access of browser resources is the construction of a unique User-Agent header for this API call based on the browser&#39;s own User-Agent string, something that&#39;s suggested in the guidelines for using the Delicious API.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <code>.execute()</code> method—and the command itself—is wrapped up with by sending off the bookmark data encoded as POST form variables with the <code>._buildQueryString()</code> utility method.</p>\n<p>And, that&#39;s it—a command-driven Delicious browser extension in a little over 200 lines of code.  There&#39;s still more to be done to really make this thing full-featured, but I think this shows off the basic features of Ubiquity.  I&#39;m hoping to dig in deeper and explore further, taking a look at running Greasemonkey-style code at <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1_Author_Tutorial#Running_on_page_load_and_startup\">browser startup and page load</a>, as well as playing with some more browser chrome features.  </p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085986\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0a9ab4b71ce193e98b7284ca257e327&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\">Jason Clark</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085986\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-01T14:47:35\">2008-09-01T14:47:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>First off-  fantastic post.  Great to see a lengthy post here again, although I'm one to talk.  This is an excellent introduction to Ubiquity command development, and tres useful to boot.</p>\n<p>I'm wondering why you chose to construct and post the XMLHttpRequest manually instead of using jQuery, which is included with Ubiquity.  I don't know that there's any benefit other than some simplicity, but I took a crack at converting your code to use jQuery, which works nicely.  In the 'execute' function, replace everything after \"var url  = this._config.api_base + path;\" with this (hope code blocks work in comments):</p>\n<p><code>\nvar win = context.focusedWindow;\nvar user_agent = win.navigator.userAgent + \";Ubiquity-share-on-delicious\";</code></p>\n<pre><code>    jQuery.ajax({\ntype: \"POST\",\nurl: url,\ndata: this._buildQueryString(bm),\nusername: \"cookie\",\npassword: \"cookie\",\nbeforeSend: function( req ) {\nreq.setRequestHeader(\"User-Agent\", user_agent); \n},\nerror: function() {\ndisplayMessage('ERROR: Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n' NOT shared on delicious.com/' + user_name);\n},\nsuccess: function() {\ndisplayMessage('Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n'shared at delicious.com/' + user_name);\n},\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, with both versions of the code, I'm seeing some unexpected behavior around authentication.  Assume I'm logged in to delicious, with \"stay logged in\" checked, and I restart my browser.  Trying to post with the command fails with a 401 unauthorized, even though I can see the cookie was sent (via Live HTTP Headers extension).  Going to delicious.com shows me logged in, and once I've viewed the site, the command works.  Except that now I can't reproduce; but I know it happened because I've got the headers.  At any rate, it is working nicely, but the previous failure is bugging me... feel like I'm overlooking something.  </p>\n<p>Thanks again for an awesome post.  Hope to see more of the same.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085988\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e799a79441c7543be48562403411cd13&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Ryan Scott Scheel</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085988\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-01T15:07:01\">2008-09-01T15:07:01</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>You should be helping with the documentation, if you aren't already.

    "body": "In my [last post][last], I got all fluffy about how cool [Ubiquity][] is but didn't share any code to prove the point.  As it happens, I have come up with at least one useful command that I'm starting to use habitually in posting bookmarks to Delicious.  You can [subscribe to my command][subs] or [check out the full source][source]—this post will serve as a dissection of the thing.  Since this will be fairly lengthy, follow along after the jump.\r\n\r\nOh, and it's been awhile since I posted something this in-depth around here, so feel free to let me know how this first draft works.  And, bug reports and patches are of course welcome.\r\n\r\n[ubiquity]: http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/\r\n[last]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/08/31/ubiquity-cracks-open-personal-mashup-tinkering \"Ubiquity cracks open personal mashup tinkering\"\r\n[subs]: http://decafbad.com/UbiquityCommands/\r\n[source]: http://decafbad.com/hg/UbiquityCommands/file/tip/delicious.ubiq.js\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nTo begin, consider the following code starting off the command source code:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\n/**\r\n * share-on-delicious - an Ubiquity command for sharing bookmarks on\r\n * delicious.com\r\n *\r\n * l.m.orchard@pobox.com\r\n * http://decafbad.com/\r\n * Share and Enjoy!\r\n */\r\nvar uext = Application.extensions.get('ubiquity@labs.mozilla.com');\r\n\r\nvar cookie_mgr = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/cookiemanager;1\"]\r\n    .getService(Components.interfaces.nsICookieManager);\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe first thing to note here is that a short header comment introduces the command.  This isn't required, but it's a good idea.  It's also something you can't really do with bookmarklets.  On the other hand, Greasemonkey user scripts expect metadata about the script to be provided here, but Ubiquity doesn't use this convention.\r\n\r\nSecond, notice that the code accesses some chrome-level resources.  Again, this is something unavailable to bookmarklets and Greasemonkey user scripts.  Just take a look at the [FUEL library documentation][fuel] to get a quick sense of what's available using that simplified API, not to mention what's available using the lower-level browser APIs.\r\n\r\n[fuel]: http://developer.mozilla.org/en/FUEL\r\n\r\nNow, check out this next chunk of code, which begins the construction of an Ubiquity command:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"13\">\r\nCmdUtils.CreateCommand({\r\n    \r\n    name:        \r\n        'share-on-delicious',\r\n    icon:\r\n        'http://delicious.com/favicon.ico',\r\n    description: \r\n        'Share the current page as a bookmark on delicious.com',\r\n    help:        \r\n        'Select text on the page to use as notes, or enter your own ' + \r\n        'text after the command word.  You can also assign tags to the '+ \r\n        'bookmark with the \"tagged\" modifier, and alter the bookmark ' + \r\n        'default page title with the \"entitled\" modifier.  Note that ' + \r\n        'you must also already be logged in at delicious.com to use ' +\r\n        'this command.',\r\n\r\n    homepage:   \r\n        'http://decafbad.com',\r\n    author: { \r\n        name: 'Leslie Michael Orchard', \r\n        email: 'l.m.orchard@pobox.com' \r\n    },\r\n    license:\r\n        'MPL/GPL/LGPL',\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nWhereas Greasemonkey scripts support metadata in the header comment, the Ubiquity command script API works a little differently.  \r\n\r\nThe [`CmdUtils` module][cmdutils] provided by Ubiquity offers a `CreateCommand` function, which expects an object as a parameter.  The object literal whose construction is begun in the code above serves as a self-contained package for the command, bearing metadata describing the command as well as containing all the code necessary to implement it.\r\n\r\nSo, in the above code block, you can see the machine-readable description of the command—including a command name, display icon, home page URL, author information, and license.  The command name (`share-on-delicious`) will be used by the Ubiquity command parser, but the rest of the description will also be used in the list of commands available to the user, invoked by the `command-list` command, like so:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/2008/ubiq-share-on-delicious-list.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333; margin: 0.25em; padding: 0.25em\" />\r\n\r\n[cmdutils]: http://hg.toolness.com/ubiquity-firefox/file/tip/ubiquity/chrome/content/cmdutils.js\r\n\r\nMoving along, this next chunk of code introduces the first functional bits of the command:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"37\">\r\n    takes: { notes: noun_arb_text },\r\n    modifiers: { \r\n        tagged:  noun_arb_text,\r\n        entitled: noun_arb_text\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nLike smart keyword shortcut bookmarks, Ubiquity commands accept user-supplied input.  But, what's unique to Ubiquity is that it employs a parser whose goal is to support something approximating natural language.  At present, this results in commands that support a single primary argument—declared above with the `takes` property—and any number of additional keyword modifiers—declared above by the `modifiers` property.\r\n\r\nFor the command under construction here, this establishes a pattern something like the following:\r\n\r\n    share-on-delicious {notes} [tagged {tags} entitled {title}]\r\n\r\nContent for the `{notes}` argument can either be typed directly by hand, or it can be supplied by text highlighted on the page.  To use highlighted text, you can either issue the command alone, or use the word `this` for the `{notes}` argument before including further modifiers.\r\n\r\nThe modifiers `tagged` and `entitled` are optional, and can be used in any order.  Each of these keywords signifies the start of a different argument—which unfortunately can collide with the literal data supplied for notes, which will hopefully be a rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nAll of this adds up command invocations including the following:\r\n\r\n    share-on-delicious\r\n    share-on-delicious I really like this page tagged nifty amusing\r\n    share-on-delicious this entitled This bookmark has no tags\r\n    sh this tagged osx software apple entitled This is good OS X software\r\n\r\nThat last example is important—since I have no other commands starting with \"`sh`\", I can abbreviate the full command.  Ubiquity only requires enough of a command name to disambiguate it within your collection of commands.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is the use of the constant value `noun_arb_text`, which declares that these arguments should expect any arbitrary text as input.  \r\n\r\nThis facility is not exploited for the present command, but Ubiquity defines [noun types][noun].  These include concepts such as plain text, dates, address book contacts, browser tabs, bookmark tags, and more.  You can define your own noun types, as well as implement suggestion schemes that help guide the user toward constructing useful input values in the command interface.  You can [read more about this][noun_tut] in the official author tutorial.\r\n\r\n[noun]: http://hg.toolness.com/ubiquity-firefox/file/tip/ubiquity/chrome/content/nlparser/en/nountypes.js\r\n[noun_tut]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1_Author_Tutorial#Introduction_to_Noun_Types\r\n\r\nNext up is a quick bit of command-specific configuration:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"42\">\r\n    /**\r\n     * Command configuration settings.\r\n     */\r\n    _config: {\r\n        // Base URL for the delicious v1 API\r\n        api_base:      'https://api.del.icio.us',\r\n\r\n        // Domain and name of the delicious login session cookie.\r\n        cookie_domain: '.delicious.com',\r\n        cookie_name:   '_user'\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nSince this command will be posting to Delicious via the V1 API, it's handy to declare the base URL for the API in an easily changed spot.  That way, you could change this value later on to point the command at another implementation of the API.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this command will employ a little-known authentication trick supported by the Delicious API that accepts the user's login cookie set by the Delicious website—this \"cookie god\" auth is used by the official Delicious addon for Firefox.  It's handy for piggybacking on the website login and removing the need to ask the user for their username and password again and possibly storing it in an insecure manner.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this next chunk of code defines a utility method to rummage through the cookie jar:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"53\">\r\n    /**\r\n     * Dig up the Delicious login session cookie.\r\n     */\r\n    _getUserCookie: function() {\r\n        var iter = cookie_mgr.enumerator;\r\n        while (iter.hasMoreElements()) {\r\n            var cookie = iter.getNext();\r\n            if( cookie instanceof Components.interfaces.nsICookie && \r\n                cookie.host.indexOf(this._config.cookie_domain) != -1 && \r\n                cookie.name == this._config.cookie_name) {\r\n                return decodeURIComponent(cookie.value);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe method defined above, `._getUserCookie()`, uses the browser's cookie manager and the values defined in the previous configuration section to find the login session cookie set for Delicious.  Take note that this is far beyond the allowed capabilities of bookmarklets and Greasemoney user scripts—this is digging straight into the browser itself, skipping past the usual content-space security restrictions.  \r\n\r\nIn other words: In Ubiquity, *the gun is loaded* and you should be careful.  \r\n\r\nMoving along, consider this next utility method:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"67\">\r\n    /**\r\n     * Given input data and modifiers, attempt to assemble data necessary to\r\n     * post a bookmark.\r\n     */\r\n    _extractBookmarkData: function(input_obj, mods) {\r\n        return {\r\n            _user:\r\n                this._getUserCookie(),\r\n            url:\r\n                context.focusedWindow.location,\r\n            description:\r\n                mods.entitled.text || context.focusedWindow.document.title,\r\n            extended: \r\n                input_obj.text,\r\n            tags:\r\n                mods.tagged.text\r\n        };\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nNamed `._extractBookmarkData()`, this utility method accepts the results of Ubiquity's parser interpreting the primary argument and modifier arguments supplied by the user.  Using these data structures, it attempts to build a structure representing the fields of a Delicious bookmark.\r\n\r\nThe `_user` field is used for authentication via the site login cookie.  The `url` is set from the location bar of the current page.  The `description`, or title, field of the bookmark is taken from either the `entitled` modifier or the title of the current page.  The `tags`, if any, come from the `tagged` modifier.  And, finally, the `extended` notes for the bookmark are taken from the primary input argument of the command.\r\n\r\nAs you'll see shortly, this utility method will be used in both the preview and the execution of the command.\r\n\r\nNext, there's one more utility method to cover:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"85\">\r\n    /**\r\n     * Given an object, build a URL query string\r\n     */\r\n    _buildQueryString: function(data) {\r\n        var qs = [];\r\n        for (k in data) if (data[k]) \r\n            qs.push( encodeURIComponent(k) + '=' + \r\n                encodeURIComponent(data[k]) );\r\n        return qs.join('&');\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of using the Delicious V1 API, the `._buildQueryString()` method accepts an object and constructs a URL query string from the encoded properties of the object.  This will be paired with the `._extractBookmarkData()` method to supply data for API calls.\r\n\r\nMoving along, it's time to start digging into the meat of this Ubiquity command:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"95\">\r\n    /**\r\n     * Present a preview of the bookmark under construction during the course\r\n     * of composing the command.\r\n     */\r\n    preview: function(pblock, input_obj, mods) {\r\n\r\n        var bm          = this._extractBookmarkData(input_obj, mods);\r\n        var user_cookie = this._getUserCookie();\r\n        var user_name   = (user_cookie) ? user_cookie.split(' ')[0] : '';\r\n\r\n        var ns = { user_name: user_name, bm: bm };\r\n        var tmpl;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nWith this code, the implementation of command method `.preview()` has begun.  This method is used by Ubiquity to generate a live preview of the command.  Called with a DOM node (`pblock`) and partially completed command input (`input_obj` and `mods`), this method is expected to build a representation of the command's results in the DOM node.  As the user types, this method will be called over and over again, ideally offering feedback as the user composes a command.\r\n\r\nContinuing on, consider this next chunk of code checking the validity of command input:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"107\">\r\n        if (!user_name) {\r\n\r\n            // If there's no user name, there's no login, so this command won't work. \r\n            tmpl = [ \r\n                '<p style=\"color: #d44\">No active user found - log in at ', \r\n                '<img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\r\n                '<b><a style=\"color: #3774D0\" href=\"http://delicious.com\">delicious.com</a></b> ', \r\n                'to use this command.</p>'\r\n            ].join('');\r\n\r\n        } else if (!bm.description) {\r\n\r\n            // If there's no title, then this is an error too.\r\n            tmpl = [ \r\n                '<p style=\"color: #d44\">A title is required for bookmarks on ', \r\n                '<img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\r\n                '<b><a style=\"color: #3774D0\" href=\"http://delicious.com\">delicious.com</a></b> ', \r\n                '</p>'\r\n            ].join('');\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThis chunk of code first checks for a user name, which can be extracted from a valid Delicious login cookie, if one was found.  If not found, the command will fail—so the preview built here will instruct the user to login at Delicious before going further.\r\n\r\nThe second precondition for using the command is that the bookmark has been given a title.  By default, this is the title of the current page—but, some pages don't offer titles.  So, an error needs to be flagged if the user hasn't manually supplied a title in this case.\r\n\r\nFinally, notice in both of these error cases, a string of HTML is composed in the variable `tmpl`.  This will be used at the end of the method to populate the DOM node passed in as `pblock`.\r\n\r\nNow, assuming that all the command's prerequisites have been met, it's time to try constructing a proper preview for the results of this command: \r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"126\">\r\n        } else {\r\n\r\n            // Attempt to construct a vaguely delicious-esque preview of a bookmark.\r\n            tmpl = [ \r\n                '<style type=\"text/css\">',\r\n                    '.preview a { color: #3774D0 }',\r\n                    '.del-bookmark { font: 12px arial; color: #ddd; background: #eee; line-height: 1.25em }',\r\n                    '.del-bookmark a.title { color: #1259C7 }',\r\n                    '.del-bookmark .full-url { color: #396C9B; font-size: 12px; display: block; padding: 0.25em 0 }',\r\n                    '.del-bookmark .notes { color: #4D4D4D }',\r\n                    '.del-bookmark .tags { color: #787878; padding-top: 0.25em; text-align: right }',\r\n                '</style>',\r\n                '<div class=\"preview\">',\r\n                    '<p>Share a bookmark at <img src=\"http://delicious.com/favicon.ico\"> ',\r\n                        '<b><a href=\"http://delicious.com/${user_name}\">delicious.com/${user_name}</a></b>:</p>',\r\n                    '<div class=\"del-bookmark\">',\r\n                        '<div style=\"padding: 1em;\">',\r\n                        '<a class=\"title\" href=\"${bm.url}\">${bm.description}</a>',\r\n                        '<a class=\"full-url\" href=\"${bm.url}\">${bm.url}</a>',\r\n                        bm.extended ? \r\n                            '<div class=\"notes\">${bm.extended}</div>' : '',\r\n                        bm.tags ?\r\n                            '<div class=\"tags\"><span>tags:</span> ${bm.tags}</div>' : '',\r\n                    '</div>',\r\n                '</div>'\r\n            ].join(\"\\n\");\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        pblock.innerHTML = CmdUtils.renderTemplate(tmpl, ns);\r\n    },\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nBuilding on the notion that previews are built in a DOM node, the code above uses both CSS and HTML to assemble a quick-and-dirty facsimile of a Delicious bookmark—which will be rendered like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/2008/ubiq-share-on-delicious-preview.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333; margin: 0.25em; padding: 0.25em\" />\r\n\r\nAlso note that Ubiquity provides a template engine for use in generating content—namely the [JavaScript Templates][jst] engine from the [TrimPath][] project.  This engine may eventually be replaced with another, but the notion is that Ubiquity will provide tools to more easily generate previews and more.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the `.preview()` method uses the template engine with a call to `CmdUtils.renderTemplate()` to inject content into the preview element by way of the `.innerHTML` property.\r\n\r\n[jst]: http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/JavaScriptTemplates\r\n[trimpath]: http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/TrimPath\r\n\r\nNow that the preview is out of the way, it's time to get down to implementing the execution of the command:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"157\">    \r\n    /**\r\n     * Attempt to use the delicious v1 API to post a bookmark using the \r\n     * command input\r\n     */\r\n    execute: function(input_obj, mods) {\r\n        var bm          = this._extractBookmarkData(input_obj, mods);\r\n        var user_cookie = this._getUserCookie();\r\n        var user_name   = (user_cookie) ? user_cookie.split(' ')[0] : '';\r\n\r\n        if (!user_name) {\r\n            // If there's no user name, there's no login, so this command won't work. \r\n            displayMessage('No active user found - log in at delicious.com ' +\r\n                'to use this command.');\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (!bm.description) {\r\n            // If there's no title, somehow, then this is an error too.\r\n            displayMessage(\"A title is required for bookmarks at delicious.com\");\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nMirroring the `.preview()` method, the `.execute()` method first checks for validity of the arguments given by the user.  A missing user name or title result in a notification that the command has failed.\r\n\r\nBut, if the arguments are all valid, it's time to actually issue a request to the Delicious V1 API:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"178\">\r\n        var path = '/v1/posts/add';\r\n        var url  = this._config.api_base + path;\r\n\r\n        var req = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/xmlextras/xmlhttprequest;1\"].\r\n            createInstance();\r\n\r\n        req.open('POST', url, true);\r\n\r\n        req.onload = function(ev) { \r\n            displayMessage('Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \r\n                'shared at delicious.com/' + user_name);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        req.onerror = function(ev) { \r\n            displayMessage('ERROR: Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \r\n                ' NOT shared on delicious.com/' + user_name);\r\n        }\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nUsing the base URL for the Delicious API declared earlier in the configuration section, the `.execute()` method constructs an API URL for the `/v1/posts/add` method.  Then, it creates an instance of `XMLHttpRequest` from the browser to be used in sending the API request.  Event handlers are registered with the object to present notifications to the user indicating whether or not the API request was successful.\r\n\r\nAt long last, it's time to wrap up this method and make the API request:\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"195\">\r\n        req.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Basic Y29va2llOmNvb2tpZQ=='); // btoa('cookie:cookie')\r\n\r\n        var mediator = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/appshell/window-mediator;1\"].\r\n            getService(Components.interfaces.nsIWindowMediator);\r\n        var win = mediator.getMostRecentWindow(null);\r\n        var user_agent = win.navigator.userAgent + \";Ubiquity-share-on-delicious\";\r\n\r\n        req.setRequestHeader(\"User-Agent\", user_agent);      \r\n\r\n        req.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');\r\n        req.send(this._buildQueryString(bm));\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    EOF:null // I hate trailing commas\r\n});\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe login cookie authentication supported by the Delicious V1 API is triggered by supplying a user name / password pair of `cookie`, which is done by setting the `Authorization` request header.  The login cookie is then expected to be passed in as the POST variable `_user`, which is done in the `._extractBookmarkData()` utility method.\r\n\r\nAnother bit here that shows more access of browser resources is the construction of a unique User-Agent header for this API call based on the browser's own User-Agent string, something that's suggested in the guidelines for using the Delicious API.\r\n\r\nFinally, the `.execute()` method—and the command itself—is wrapped up with by sending off the bookmark data encoded as POST form variables with the `._buildQueryString()` utility method.\r\n\r\nAnd, that's it—a command-driven Delicious browser extension in a little over 200 lines of code.  There's still more to be done to really make this thing full-featured, but I think this shows off the basic features of Ubiquity.  I'm hoping to dig in deeper and explore further, taking a look at running Greasemonkey-style code at [browser startup and page load][load], as well as playing with some more browser chrome features.  \r\n\r\n[load]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1_Author_Tutorial#Running_on_page_load_and_startup\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085986\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0a9ab4b71ce193e98b7284ca257e327&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\">Jason Clark</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085986\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-01T14:47:35\">2008-09-01T14:47:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>First off-  fantastic post.  Great to see a lengthy post here again, although I'm one to talk.  This is an excellent introduction to Ubiquity command development, and tres useful to boot.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering why you chose to construct and post the XMLHttpRequest manually instead of using jQuery, which is included with Ubiquity.  I don't know that there's any benefit other than some simplicity, but I took a crack at converting your code to use jQuery, which works nicely.  In the 'execute' function, replace everything after \"var url  = this._config.api_base + path;\" with this (hope code blocks work in comments):</p>\n\n<p><code>\n        var win = context.focusedWindow;\n        var user_agent = win.navigator.userAgent + \";Ubiquity-share-on-delicious\";</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>    jQuery.ajax({\n      type: \"POST\",\n      url: url,\n      data: this._buildQueryString(bm),\n      username: \"cookie\",\n      password: \"cookie\",\n      beforeSend: function( req ) {\n        req.setRequestHeader(\"User-Agent\", user_agent); \n      },\n      error: function() {\n        displayMessage('ERROR: Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n            ' NOT shared on delicious.com/' + user_name);\n      },\n      success: function() {\n        displayMessage('Bookmark \"' + bm.description + '\" ' + \n            'shared at delicious.com/' + user_name);\n      },\n    });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Also, with both versions of the code, I'm seeing some unexpected behavior around authentication.  Assume I'm logged in to delicious, with \"stay logged in\" checked, and I restart my browser.  Trying to post with the command fails with a 401 unauthorized, even though I can see the cookie was sent (via Live HTTP Headers extension).  Going to delicious.com shows me logged in, and once I've viewed the site, the command works.  Except that now I can't reproduce; but I know it happened because I've got the headers.  At any rate, it is working nicely, but the previous failure is bugging me... feel like I'm overlooking something.  </p>\n\n<p>Thanks again for an awesome post.  Hope to see more of the same.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085988\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e799a79441c7543be48562403411cd13&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Ryan Scott Scheel</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085988\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-09-01T15:07:01\">2008-09-01T15:07:01</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>You should be helping with the documentation, if you aren't already.

    "html": "<p>When I was a wee hacker, I lived my digital life though a <a href=\"http://www.virtualsky.net/iadoremyc64/\">Commodore 64</a>.  I played games on it, did homework, talked to people far away—you know, all the stuff they showed in the pictures on the box.  I also took things apart—both the machine itself and software running on it.  I grew up learning that my digital environment was ultimately understandable, <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/\">susceptible to tinkering</a>, and open to being bent to my own purposes.</p>\n<p>From the Commodore 64, I graduated eventually to terminals and text editors, opening portals mostly onto computers elsewhere via powerful UNIX command shells.  And, of course, over the past decade, this has largely given way to life in a browser.  </p>\n<p>Yet, for a little while, particularly in the first few years of browsers, freedom to tinker seemed cramped.  JavaScript had yet to arrive, and was a little messy when it did.  There was no relatively easy addon development.  And, though the portals opened by a browser were richer than those provided by terminals, the paths of navigation defined by links controlled by site owners offered less freedom of movement than UNIX commands.  I could create my own pages, but I couldn&#39;t do much to others&#39; pages.</p>\n<p>But then, javascript: URLs came around, dots were connected, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet\">bookmarklets</a> were born.  Suddenly, it was possible to customize <em>my</em> browsing environment with arbitrary JavaScript code having access to the current page—no matter <em>whose</em> page it was.  And, through the various tricks of the AJAX trade, bookmarklets have only gotten more capable throughout the years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/docs/end-user/keywords.html\">Smart keyword shortcuts</a> came around a little later, allowing quick access to bookmarks via simple keywords typed into the location bar.  The smart part, though, came in the form of bookmarked URLs with placeholders and keywords given arguments to fill the placeholders—allowing not only quick access to bookmarked pages but also search engine forms bookmarked with late-bound fields.</p>\n<p>Bookmarklets inherited the benefits of smart keyword shortcuts.  The same placeholder in http: URLs can be inserted into the code of a javascript: URL, thus parameterizing the JavaScript code and incidentally turning the location bar into a kind of primitive command line.  For example, one of my most heavily used &quot;<a href=\"http://naeblis.cx/weblog/2004/08/09/DeliciousAddresslets\">addresslets</a>&quot; is based on <a href=\"http://ejohn.org/blog/super-fast-delicious-bookmarklet/\">John Resig&#39;s original &quot;Super-Fast Delicious Bookmarklet&quot;</a>.</p>\n<p>Another leap in prying open the browser tinkering space came in the form of <a href=\"http://www.greasespot.net/\">Greasemonkey</a>—an addon-powered environment created explicitly for the purpose of end-user scripting applied to others&#39; pages.  <a href=\"http://www.greasespot.net/\">Greasemonkey</a> user scripts can do more than bookmarklets, and with a much better development environment to boot.

    "body": "When I was a wee hacker, I lived my digital life though a [Commodore 64][c64].  I played games on it, did homework, talked to people far away—you know, all the stuff they showed in the pictures on the box.  I also took things apart—both the machine itself and software running on it.  I grew up learning that my digital environment was ultimately understandable, [susceptible to tinkering][transactor], and open to being bent to my own purposes.\r\n\r\nFrom the Commodore 64, I graduated eventually to terminals and text editors, opening portals mostly onto computers elsewhere via powerful UNIX command shells.  And, of course, over the past decade, this has largely given way to life in a browser.  \r\n\r\nYet, for a little while, particularly in the first few years of browsers, freedom to tinker seemed cramped.  JavaScript had yet to arrive, and was a little messy when it did.  There was no relatively easy addon development.  And, though the portals opened by a browser were richer than those provided by terminals, the paths of navigation defined by links controlled by site owners offered less freedom of movement than UNIX commands.  I could create my own pages, but I couldn't do much to others' pages.\r\n\r\nBut then, javascript: URLs came around, dots were connected, and [bookmarklets][] were born.  Suddenly, it was possible to customize *my* browsing environment with arbitrary JavaScript code having access to the current page—no matter *whose* page it was.  And, through the various tricks of the AJAX trade, bookmarklets have only gotten more capable throughout the years.\r\n\r\n[Smart keyword shortcuts][shortcuts] came around a little later, allowing quick access to bookmarks via simple keywords typed into the location bar.  The smart part, though, came in the form of bookmarked URLs with placeholders and keywords given arguments to fill the placeholders—allowing not only quick access to bookmarked pages but also search engine forms bookmarked with late-bound fields.\r\n\r\nBookmarklets inherited the benefits of smart keyword shortcuts.  The same placeholder in http: URLs can be inserted into the code of a javascript: URL, thus parameterizing the JavaScript code and incidentally turning the location bar into a kind of primitive command line.  For example, one of my most heavily used \"[addresslets](http://naeblis.cx/weblog/2004/08/09/DeliciousAddresslets)\" is based on [John Resig's original \"Super-Fast Delicious Bookmarklet\"](http://ejohn.org/blog/super-fast-delicious-bookmarklet/).\r\n\r\nAnother leap in prying open the browser tinkering space came in the form of [Greasemonkey][]—an addon-powered environment created explicitly for the purpose of end-user scripting applied to others' pages.  [Greasemonkey][] user scripts can do more than bookmarklets, and with a much better development environment to boot.  And, though a user script can't do quite as much as a proper browser addon, they're much easier to hack on and distribute.\r\n\r\nNow, consider one of [Mozilla Labs][labs]' [newest projects][ubiquity], named [Ubiquity][].  This rough and experimental addon for Firefox combines and improves upon everything I've described so far:\r\n\r\n* [Ubiquity][] is a hackable command line environment, better than [bookmarklets][] and smart [keyword shortcuts][shortcuts];\r\n* [Ubiquity][] enables persistent customization of others' pages, not unlike [Greasemonkey][]; \r\n* [Ubiquity][] facilitates live in-browser creation and web-based subscription to user commands and scripts;\r\n* [Ubiquity][] gives access to browser chrome resources without a need for frequent restarts;\r\n\r\nSo far, most of the [commands][] I see popping up since the 0.1 release have not accomplished much more than [smart keyword shortcuts][shortcuts] in the location bar could.  But, it's early yet, and [Ubiquity][] is far from limited to these commands.\r\n\r\nOnce the basics have been well-explored, I expect to see more people taking a crack at the broader capabilities offered by [Ubiquity][].  [Bookmarklets][] and [Greasemonkey][] can't access browser chrome—but [Ubiquity][] can.  [Ubiquity][] also offers a user interface that's so much more promising than keyword shortcuts, including command previews and typed parameters with suggestions.\r\n\r\nUbiquity promises web-wide mashups directed by a conversational command interface.  All in all, the potential of this makes me feel like my digital environment—browser and web as a whole—is getting even more intimately, personally hackable.  \r\n\r\nIt'll be very interesting to see where this project goes.\r\n\r\n[labs]: http://labs.mozilla.com/\r\n[transactor]: http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/\r\n[c64]: http://www.virtualsky.net/iadoremyc64/\r\n[shortcuts]: http://www.mozilla.org/docs/end-user/keywords.html\r\n[greasemonkey]: http://www.greasespot.net/\r\n[bookmarklets]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet\r\n[ubiquity]: http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/\r\n[commands]: https://labs.toolness.com/ubiquity-herd/\r\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089574\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=22b4e824255828f5aedd0e6e2558dc52&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Raul</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089574\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-08-31T10:20:58\">2008-08-31T10:20:58</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hi, was using the original delicious command linked from the Ubiquity wiki, just tried yours and its definitely more polished and functional.

    "html": "<p>Reminiscent of this time <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/24/go-west-young-man\">almost two years ago</a>, it&#39;s been a busy period so far.  I&#39;ve been working on another book, entitled <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047038459X.html\">Professional JavaScript Frameworks</a>, and have changed jobs twice <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/787565793\">since leaving Yahoo! in early April</a>.  </p>\n<p>I think I&#39;m done bouncing around now, though: As you may or may not already know, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/804009957\">I&#39;ve started working for the Mozilla Corporation</a>—I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~lorchard/\">got a username and everything</a>!  I&#39;m a little overwhelmed at the moment by changes and drinking from a new firehose, so my enthusiasm may not yet be readily apparent.  But, remember that I&#39;m a complete web geek—and it&#39;s hard to get closer to web geekery than this.</p>\n<p>But, one of the nicest things about this new Mozilla gig is that I&#39;m going to start telecommuting.  And the reason that&#39;s nice is because—and here&#39;s the next big thing—<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/missadroit/2493000246/\">my wife and I have bought a beautiful house in Livonia, Michigan</a>, and we&#39;re moving back to the Midwest in a month and some change.</p>\n<p>Why?  Because, after almost two years out here in the valley, we&#39;ve discovered that being away from family and old friends while trying to make new friends and adjust to a very different locale was a lot harder than first imagined.  And, well, it would&#39;ve been much longer than we&#39;d&#39;ve liked before we could have afforded a house at all—let alone something anything like what we&#39;ll be enjoying back in Michigan.</p>\n<p>The thing is, though, I&#39;ve still got a lot of love for the Bay Area and its goings on—I&#39;ve been pining for this place since at least the age of eight, after all.  And, we have made a few good friends out here, despite the difficulties we&#39;ve experienced.  </p>\n<p>So luckily, this Mozilla gig looks like the ideal thing.  I&#39;m hoping it will ensure regular return visits to enjoy <a href=\"http://superhappydevhouse.org/\">SuperHappyDevHouses</a>, the scent of <a href=\"http://transplanted-californian.blogspot.com/2007/10/star-jasmine.html\">star jasmine</a> in the summer, and amazing cloudless skies lasting for days.</p>\n<p>But, on the other hand—although I&#39;m certainly not relishing the thought of readjusting to cold, clouds, and snow in a few months—I&#39;m getting excited about the prospects of being back in southeastern Michigan.  Our house will be pretty close to both Ann Arbor and Detroit, and it seems like some interesting things have started warming up since we left.  Also, I suspect (and hope) we&#39;ll discover a lot of friends and like-minded associates in short order upon our return.</p>\n<p>Lots of change.  Very busy.  Not a little exciting.  But, I&#39;m hopeful that things are going to get a lot better very soon.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086631\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.entish.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8b70790f2d886a2568bf35f10a3af9b1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.entish.org/\">Will Fitzgerald</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086631\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-05-15T01:27:47\">2008-05-15T01:27:47</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Welcome back to the Midwest!

    "body": "Reminiscent of this time [almost two years ago](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/24/go-west-young-man), it's been a busy period so far.  I've been working on another book, entitled [Professional JavaScript Frameworks][book], and have changed jobs twice [since leaving Yahoo! in early April][leavey].  \r\n\r\nI think I'm done bouncing around now, though: As you may or may not already know, [I've started working for the Mozilla Corporation][moz]—I've [got a username and everything][people]!  I'm a little overwhelmed at the moment by changes and drinking from a new firehose, so my enthusiasm may not yet be readily apparent.  But, remember that I'm a complete web geek—and it's hard to get closer to web geekery than this.\r\n\r\nBut, one of the nicest things about this new Mozilla gig is that I'm going to start telecommuting.  And the reason that's nice is because—and here's the next big thing—[my wife and I have bought a beautiful house in Livonia, Michigan][house], and we're moving back to the Midwest in a month and some change.\r\n\r\nWhy?  Because, after almost two years out here in the valley, we've discovered that being away from family and old friends while trying to make new friends and adjust to a very different locale was a lot harder than first imagined.  And, well, it would've been much longer than we'd've liked before we could have afforded a house at all—let alone something anything like what we'll be enjoying back in Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, though, I've still got a lot of love for the Bay Area and its goings on—I've been pining for this place since at least the age of eight, after all.  And, we have made a few good friends out here, despite the difficulties we've experienced.  \r\n\r\nSo luckily, this Mozilla gig looks like the ideal thing.  I'm hoping it will ensure regular return visits to enjoy [SuperHappyDevHouses][shdh], the scent of [star jasmine][jasmine] in the summer, and amazing cloudless skies lasting for days.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand—although I'm certainly not relishing the thought of readjusting to cold, clouds, and snow in a few months—I'm getting excited about the prospects of being back in southeastern Michigan.  Our house will be pretty close to both Ann Arbor and Detroit, and it seems like some interesting things have started warming up since we left.  Also, I suspect (and hope) we'll discover a lot of friends and like-minded associates in short order upon our return.\r\n\r\nLots of change.  Very busy.  Not a little exciting.  But, I'm hopeful that things are going to get a lot better very soon.\r\n\r\n[jasmine]: http://transplanted-californian.blogspot.com/2007/10/star-jasmine.html\r\n[shdh]: http://superhappydevhouse.org/\r\n[house]: http://www.flickr.com/photos/missadroit/2493000246/\r\n[twit]: http://twitter.com/lmorchard\r\n[leavey]: http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/787565793\r\n[moz]: http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/804009957\r\n[people]: http://people.mozilla.org/~lorchard/\r\n[book]: http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047038459X.html\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086631\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.entish.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8b70790f2d886a2568bf35f10a3af9b1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.entish.org/\">Will Fitzgerald</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086631\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-05-15T01:27:47\">2008-05-15T01:27:47</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Welcome back to the Midwest!
