          <description>TL;DR: This is a story about what might happen if one takes life hacks, GTD, and IFTTT a bit too far.
Okay, so maybe that’s not a great intro. But, it’s the first thing my brain spewed out. I’ve had this story rattling around in my head for a few years, and just tonight managed to finish banging out a first draft. I’m hoping to work on it a bit more, and I’m not entirely happy with it yet, so comments welcome!</description>
