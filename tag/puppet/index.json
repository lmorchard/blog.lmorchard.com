Unfortunately, many of these projects are really hard to get into as a contributor.

Although Mozilla has a core group of employees, we&#39;re not nearly enough to build all of these projects and pursue <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/about/mission.html\">the mission</a> on our own. We&#39;ve gotten to where we are thanks to the volunteer efforts of thousands of contributors—and the only way we&#39;ll get where we want to go is through the efforts of thousands (or *<a href=\"http://commonspace.wordpress.com/2011/02/22/nmm-redux/\">millions</a>*) more.
