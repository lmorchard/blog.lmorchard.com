Apropos of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2007/02/15/thoughts-on-pipes-on-the-web-part-ii\">pipes-via-web ramblings</a> back in February, I&#39;m trying out a few different approaches to pipelining feed content through processor modules.  My original FeedMagick relied on feeding URLs to URLs as parameters.  That, unfortunately, can be mighty cumbersome and inefficient.  So, FeedMagick2 explores a few more approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The first and obvious approach is to chain them together in a single script.  So, I&#39;ve got objects instances that pass content from one to the next.  The thing is, the pipe works in reverse:  The driver script asks the last module in the pipe for content, which then asks the one before it for content, and so on.  At any point along the way, modules can cache the output of previous modules, and refrain from calling up the chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The second way to chain pipelines together is just like the first FeedMagick:  Some pipelines start with fetching a URL.  That can be an original feed, or a URL leading to the output of an antecedent pipeline.  And, oh yeah, most pipelines are run via parameterized URLs, so there&#39;s that bit of handy recursion.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The third way to chain pipelines together is with HTTP POST:  A pipeline can accept feed data via the request body of an HTTP POST, thus allowing antecedent pipelines (or even cURL scripts) to <em>push</em> data into the pipeline rather than getting <em>pulled</em> via URL.  This is kind of like my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/?s=xmlrpc+pipe\">years-old jiggery pokery</a> with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">pipelines via XML-RPC</a>, only much <em>much</em> simpler.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#39;m also poking around at making all of the above available at the command line via PHP-CLI, and I&#39;m having gratuitous fun exploring PEAR to roll my own stripped-down web framework.  I still hate PHP, but I&#39;m at least finding ways to entertain myself while I&#39;m holding my nose.  Of course, I find weird things entertaining.</p>\n<p>And, as a side note, the only reason I&#39;m using PHP is because I&#39;d like to play around with the idea of the de facto WordPress installation requirements standard.  That is:  If you can run WordPress, you can run this.  In reality, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m there, but I&#39;m hoping to get close.  For one, I&#39;m refusing to play with anything older than PHP 5.</p>\n<p>Anyway, play with it, tell me what you think and give me a reason to keep hacking at it.  :)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082761\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jamesv.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c82c72ca4f9eab33a80a7bd839c1ae0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jamesv.org\">jamesv</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082761\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-04-30T11:39:15\">2007-04-30T11:39:15</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Aw man, now I've got to port all the code you wrote while you were here over to this new hotness ;) I really like (and appreciate) the single script approach.</p>\n<p>Is caching at a module level done automatically, or is that something I need to flag in my original call?

Of course, I find weird things entertaining.\r\n\r\nAnd, as a side note, the only reason I'm using PHP is because I'd like to play around with the idea of the de facto WordPress installation requirements standard.  That is:  If you can run WordPress, you can run this.  In reality, I don't think I'm there, but I'm hoping to get close.  For one, I'm refusing to play with anything older than PHP 5.\r\n\r\nAnyway, play with it, tell me what you think and give me a reason to keep hacking at it.  :)\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082761\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jamesv.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c82c72ca4f9eab33a80a7bd839c1ae0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jamesv.org\">jamesv</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082761\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-04-30T11:39:15\">2007-04-30T11:39:15</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Aw man, now I've got to port all the code you wrote while you were here over to this new hotness ;) I really like (and appreciate) the single script approach.</p>\n\n<p>Is caching at a module level done automatically, or is that something I need to flag in my original call?

Well, <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo! Pipes</a> looks like a pretty self-contained pipes engine — data goes in one end, <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/F/frobnicate.html\">frobnication</a> happens in the middle, data comes out the other side.</p>\n<p>But, what I like about the notion of <a href=\"http://207.22.26.166/bytecols/2001-08-15.html\">the URL-line</a> is that you can take one URL and <em>supply it as a parameter to another URL</em> — making <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/18/oooaod\">messy pipelined URLs</a> while building a crazy web-wide distributed execution environment powered by HTTP and REST.

Consider an idempotent GET request as a pure function call with no side-effects.  Then, consider a GET request that accepts a URL as a parameter — it&#39;s a nested function call: the outer GET must make an inner GET to fetch the parameter-supplied URL.  Give the inner URL another URL as a parameter, and you&#39;ve got yet another nested function call.  </p>\n<p>But, if you like, ignore the theoretical <a href=\"http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html\">benefits of functional programming</a> — flip the nested function calls inside out and you&#39;ve got a pipe.
