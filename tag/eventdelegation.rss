        <title>HTML5 drag and drop in Firefox 3.5</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
Oh hey, look! It&amp;apos;s another blog post&amp;#x2014;and this one
&lt;a href=&quot;http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/html5-drag-and-drop/&quot;&gt;is cross-posted on hacks.mozilla.com&lt;/a&gt;.
I won&amp;apos;t say this is the start of a renewed blogging habit, but let&amp;apos;s see what happens.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
dl { margin-left: 2em; }
dd { margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.25em; }
&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions
        afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it
        allows users to pair the selection of an object with the
        execution of an action, often including a second object in the
        operation.  It&amp;apos;s a simple yet powerful UI concept used to
        support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),
        and even the creation of link relationships.
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Since it&amp;apos;s so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web
        applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first
        offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although
        &lt;code&gt;mousedown&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mousemove&lt;/code&gt;, and
        &lt;code&gt;mouseup&lt;/code&gt; made it possible, the implementation has been
        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,
        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,
        there&amp;apos;s a challenge to find the subject of the drop when
        the interaction is completed.
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

        Of course, that doesn&amp;apos;t prevent most modern JavaScript
        frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and
        throwing in some flourishes while they&amp;apos;re at it.  But, wouldn&amp;apos;t
        it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and
        drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification 
        &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd&quot;&gt;section on new drag-and-drop events&lt;/a&gt;, and 
        &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop&quot;&gt;Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation&lt;/a&gt; of those events.
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        If you want to jump straight to the code, I&amp;apos;ve put together 
        &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html&quot;&gt;some simple demos&lt;/a&gt; 
        of the new events.&lt;br&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

        I&amp;apos;ve even scratched an itch of my own and
        built &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html&quot;&gt;the beginnings of an outline editor&lt;/a&gt;,
        where every draggable element is also a drop target&amp;#x2014;of which
        there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something
        that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past
        while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from 
        &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop&quot;&gt;a GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;
        I&amp;apos;ve created especially for this article&amp;#x2014;which continues after the jump.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
