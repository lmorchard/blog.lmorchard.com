          <title>The web is awesome</title>
          <description>TL;DR: The open web is a beautiful thing that empowers makers while offering users leverage. There&#39;s nothing else like it. It&#39;s constantly improving. It&#39;s up to you what you do with it.</description>

          <title>Microblogging like it&amp;#8217;s 2002</title>
          <description>Every year or so, I (re)join the ranks of hackers who decide they’d like to try building a microblogging tool. It’s sometimes after Twitter or Facebook does something cruddy to remind me that I’m the product. Sometimes, it’s when jerks have the run of the place and no one can do anything about it. Often these things are highly correlated.</description>

          <title>I like it when services treat me like I treat my pets</title>
          <description>I like animals, and I’ve been told that I’m good with them. I’d like to think that’s due to a mix of empathy and respect that I’ve developed over the years.
It occurred to me the other day that my favorite online services treat me like I imagine my pets like to be treated.</description>

          <title>Privacy and Social Media</title>
          <description>Somewhat apropos of what I posted recently about freedoms, there’s been a kerfuffle about Facebook and privacy (again). A particular post I just read kind of set me off, so I decided to expand on a comment I left there.</description>
