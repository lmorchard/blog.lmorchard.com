          <title>Things I learned from my High School science teacher</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; display: block&quot; href=&quot;http://www.oocities.org/sunsetstrip/stage/9868/aboutme.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/alek_sabo_me.jpg&quot; alt title=&quot;&amp;quot;This is my friend Alek, my high school physics teacher Mr. Sabo, and me.&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;191&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-388&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That&amp;#x2019;s not actually me in this picture: It&amp;#x2019;s something I found in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oocities.org/sunsetstrip/stage/9868/aboutme.html&quot;&gt;an archive of a defunct GeoCities page&lt;/a&gt;, from who knows when. (Though, apparently, it was forged in the era of the Counting Crows.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, anyway, that&amp;#x2019;s Mr. Sabo there in the middle. He was my High School science teacher, and nearly every day I remember something that he taught me. Let&amp;#x2019;s see if I can come up with a few off the top of my head&amp;#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;
