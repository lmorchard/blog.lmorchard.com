    "summary": "\n\n<p>I’ve been interested in developing <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/apps\">open web apps</a> (aka the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application\">single-page app</a>) for years. But, it feels like the space is really on fire now, since the advent of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML5\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/html5?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&amp;utm_medium=content%20link&amp;utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML5</a> tech and the recent moves by <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&amp;utm_medium=content%20link&amp;utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a> and Google toward truly “appifying” these things to compete with offerings from iOS and Android. Lots of pieces have come into alignment, and <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Kilimanjaro\">great things are coming together</a>—<a href=\"http://groovecoder.com/2012/09/12/facebook-never-bet-on-html5/\">never mind what the folks at Facebook say</a>.</p>\n<p>So, I think I’m going to build a simple app and blog about it. And, these days, the first thing I think about when starting a web app is: How do I get it onto the web?</p>\n",
