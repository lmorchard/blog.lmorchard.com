Perhaps the Flash folks are part of a massive conspiracy to keep us juicing up our hardware, eh?</p>\n\n<p>I do think that some components can't be reasonably manufactured to last for fifteen years of continuous use, like power supplies and hard drives, but that's more of a corner case.</p>\n\n<p>And if you'd like to consider a field moving from a tradition of finely-manufactured heirloom objects that you could leave to your grandkids, to the upgrade treadmill of the eighteen-month semiconductor manufacturing cycle, consider photography. Yes, the marginal cost of a digital photo is nil, but instead of buying new film, you have to buy a new camera every year or two. <a href=\"http://www.luminous-landscape.com/essays/enough-already.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">People who work in the field have written on this.</a></p>\n\n<p>I have a (roughly?) five year old DSLR, and I can't tell if it feels ancient because I'm used to electronics aging like that, or because it was one of the first non-professional (i.e., affordable by mere mortals) models. If I could afford it, I'd have probably bought a new one by now.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088009\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://williamtozier.com/slurry\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4c08a99da7938c3ce0aeb6580c731070&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://williamtozier.com/slurry\">Bill Tozier</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088009\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-10-21T12:32:27\">2008-10-21T12:32:27</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Unlike pens and watches, computers (\"computing infrastructure\") are still expanding to fill cultural niches, still breaking out into the wave of creative destruction. Phones and computers and smart dust and sensor-laden clothes are all still vying for resources like weed species colonizing an empty continent.</p>\n\n<p>But like weed species, they have limited lifetimes. They're depending on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-selection\" rel=\"nofollow\">r-selection</a>, still. Not K-selection, which is what you want. I expect r-selection is part of the marketing culture surrounding all this tech.</p>\n\n<p>And now I think about it, I wonder if maybe it works the other way around: you can't \"market\" something that's long-lived, especially something you interact with communicatively and increasingly like a peer (unlike your pen or your watch).</p>\n\n<p>I think it's time for a new shade tree in the back yard. That cow is looking kindof slow compared to these new cows they have, maybe we should replace it. I was thinking of a new left hand; what do you think of yours?</p>\n\n<p>That'll be the real Andy Clark moment, by the way. And the counterpoint to the one you're waiting for.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",
