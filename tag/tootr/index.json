It expects documentation to be read and training to be had. For a busy person with non-developer things do to, it&#8217;s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure\">a twisty maze of passages, all alike</a>.

Filling out forms with personal data is part of the problem web wonks call &#8220;identity&#8221;. Apropos of that, did you know that <a href=\"http://login.amazon.com/website\">Amazon has an identity service</a>? I didn&#8217;t, at least not until last weekend. (<a href=\"http://mobile.awsblog.com/post/Tx3UKF4SV4V0LV3/Announcing-Web-Identity-Federation\">Man, am I behind</a>!)\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  I can put a &#8220;<a href=\"http://login.amazon.com/\">Login with Amazon</a>&#8221; button on my web app. You login with your Amazon username & password, but my app doesn&#8217;t see them. Instead, Amazon offers my app some simple profile details &#8211; user ID, email, & full name.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  But, having access to your Amazon identity offers even more power:\n</p>\n\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  Clicking &#8220;<a href=\"http://login.amazon.com/\">Login with Amazon</a>&#8221; gives your Amazon identity to my app.\n</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  My app can use your Amazon identity to assume a temporary role.\n</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  This temporary role enables use of a portion of an S3 bucket.\n</li>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  This is hewing pretty close to <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/09/separating-publishing-from-hosting-on-the-web\">the publishing app / hosting service notions I laid out in my last post</a>. So, how does it work?\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  Well, one of the things my app receives when you click the &#8220;Login&#8221; button is an <a href=\"http://login.amazon.com/glossary#access_token\"><code>access_token</code></a>. Chasing that <code>access_token</code> down the rabbit hole, I rediscovered Amazon IAM and STS &#8211; <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">Identity & Access Management</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html\">Secure Token Service</a>.\n</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  <span id=\"IAM_and_Roles\">IAM and Roles</span>\n</h2>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  Among other things, Amazon IAM lets you define roles and associate them with apps. Roles contain policies that grant access to resources controlled by your account &#8211; e.g. an S3 bucket.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  For example, here&#8217;s a policy snippet for a role I created on IAM:\n</p>\n\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\" style=\"text-align: left;\">{\n \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n \"Action\": [\n   \"s3:PutObject\",\n   \"s3:PutObjectAcl\",\n   \"s3:DeleteObject\",\n   \"s3:GetObject\",\n   \"s3:GetObjectAcl\"\n ],\n \"Resource\": [\n   \"arn:aws:s3:::tootr/users/amazon/${www.amazon.com:user_id}\",\n   \"arn:aws:s3:::tootr/users/amazon/${www.amazon.com:user_id}/*\"\n ]\n}</pre>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  This role grants access to GET, PUT, & DELETE web resources in my S3 bucket named &#8220;tootr&#8221; &#8211; but only as long as the resources are under the &#8220;<code>users/amazon/{USER_ID}</code>&#8221; URLspace, where <code>{USER_ID}</code> is a uniquely generated identifier supplied by an Amazon profile.\n</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  <span id=\"STS_and_Temporary_Credentials\">STS and Temporary Credentials</span>\n</h2>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  So, how can someone assume such a role? That&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr/blob/master/src/javascript/publishers/AmazonS3.js#L103\">where Amazon STS comes in</a>:\n</p>\n\n<pre style=\"text-align: left;\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">$.ajax('https://sts.amazonaws.com/?' + $.param({\n\n  'Action': 'AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity',\n  'Version': '2011-06-15',\n  'RoleArn': 'arn:aws:iam::8675309:role/tootr-amazon-user-buckets',\n  'RoleSessionName': 'web-identity-federation',\n  'ProviderId': 'www.amazon.com',\n  'DurationSeconds': '900',\n  'WebIdentityToken': access_token\n\n})).then(function (dataXML, status, xhr) {\n\n  var data = <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr/blob/master/src/javascript/misc.js#L11\">misc.xmlToObj</a>(dataXML);\n  var credentials = data\n    .AssumeRoleWithWebIdentityResponse\n    .AssumeRoleWithWebIdentityResult\n    .Credentials;\n\n});</code></pre>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  The <code>RoleArn</code> parameter identifies the IAM role created earlier. The <code>access_token</code> is what my app got when you logged in. The <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html\"><code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> API on Amazon STS</a> lets me <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr/blob/master/src/javascript/publishers/AmazonS3.js#L103\">connect the two and generate temporary credentials</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  Those credentials look something like this:\n</p>\n\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\" style=\"text-align: left;\">{\n  \"SessionToken\":\"NIweiunfiunIUWNLFIsd87\",\n  \"Expiration\":\"2014-10-11T19:15:58Z\",\n  \"AccessKeyId\":\"ASIAQWERTYUIOP\",\n  \"SecretAccessKey\":\"SKLN9869KJnisdhfli\"\n}</pre>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  As it turns out, <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr/blob/master/src/javascript/publishers/AmazonS3.js#L148\">these credentials work with Amazon S3</a>. So, after accepting a login and doing the <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> dance, my app can manage web hosting at Amazon S3 on your behalf.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  For further reading, check out &#8220;<a href=\"docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/CreatingWIF.html\">Creating Temporary Security Credentials for Mobile Apps Using Identity Providers</a>&#8221; in Amazon&#8217;s documentation. That&#8217;s from where I stole most of this stuff.\n</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  <span id=\"Demo_time_and_next_steps\">Demo time and next steps</span>\n</h2>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  I&#8217;ve rolled all of this into <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr\">a microblogging app called &#8220;tootr&#8221;</a>. Here&#8217;s a demo:\n</p>\n\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  <a href=\"https://lmorchard.github.io/tootr/\">https://lmorchard.github.io/tootr/</a>\n</li>\n\n<p>You can visit the app, click &#8220;Login with Amazon&#8221;, and you&#8217;ll soon be tooting up a storm. But, you should notice some serious drawbacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The app is terrible and missing almost every interesting feature.</li>\n<li>Your username is something like <a href=\"https://tootr.s3.amazonaws.com/users/amazon/amzn1.account.AF5OSES2YSFJEKYBANBHRFB25RXQ/index.html\">AF5OSES2YSFJEKYBANBHRFB25RXQ</a> and that&#8217;s also terrible.</li>\n<li>You&#8217;re tooting into my Amazon S3 bucket. You&#8217;re not paying me or Amazon. I <em>will</em> vandalize &amp; delete your stuff and not feel bad about it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a proof-of-concept, though, I think it works: The &#8220;tootr&#8221; app at <a href=\"https://lmorchard.github.io/tootr/\">lmorchard.github.io</a> publishes to a hosting API at <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com\">s3.amazonaws.com</a>. The on-ramp is a single button click and an Amazon sign-in dialog.</p>\n<p>But, I think all the above issues can be addressed. Also, Amazon is an interesting core for this stuff: Many people have an Amazon account, and Amazon is a place where people generally pay for things. So, it&#8217;s different territory than most social media sites.</p>\n<p>The challenge will be keeping the on-ramp simple while improving the app and switching to a user-owned web hosting space. Still, I think this is promising stuff. At any rate, it&#8217;s tinkering I&#8217;ve been procrastinating for years now, so I&#8217;ve got plenty of ideas to chase down.</p>\n",

Chasing that <code>access_token</code> down the rabbit hole, I rediscovered Amazon IAM and STS &#8211; <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">Identity & Access Management</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html\">Secure Token Service</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  <span id=\"IAM_and_Roles\">IAM and Roles</span>\r\n</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  Among other things, Amazon IAM lets you define roles and associate them with apps. Roles contain policies that grant access to resources controlled by your account &#8211; e.g. an S3 bucket.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  For example, here&#8217;s a policy snippet for a role I created on IAM:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\" style=\"text-align: left;\">{\r\n \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\r\n \"Action\": [\r\n   \"s3:PutObject\",\r\n   \"s3:PutObjectAcl\",\r\n   \"s3:DeleteObject\",\r\n   \"s3:GetObject\",\r\n   \"s3:GetObjectAcl\"\r\n ],\r\n \"Resource\": [\r\n   \"arn:aws:s3:::tootr/users/amazon/${www.amazon.com:user_id}\",\r\n   \"arn:aws:s3:::tootr/users/amazon/${www.amazon.com:user_id}/*\"\r\n ]\r\n}</pre>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  This role grants access to GET, PUT, & DELETE web resources in my S3 bucket named &#8220;tootr&#8221; &#8211; but only as long as the resources are under the &#8220;<code>users/amazon/{USER_ID}</code>&#8221; URLspace, where <code>{USER_ID}</code> is a uniquely generated identifier supplied by an Amazon profile.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  <span id=\"STS_and_Temporary_Credentials\">STS and Temporary Credentials</span>\r\n</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  So, how can someone assume such a role? That&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr/blob/master/src/javascript/publishers/AmazonS3.js#L103\">where Amazon STS comes in</a>:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<pre style=\"text-align: left;\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">$.ajax('https://sts.amazonaws.com/?' + $.param({\r\n\r\n  'Action': 'AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity',\r\n  'Version': '2011-06-15',\r\n  'RoleArn': 'arn:aws:iam::8675309:role/tootr-amazon-user-buckets',\r\n  'RoleSessionName': 'web-identity-federation',\r\n  'ProviderId': 'www.amazon.com',\r\n  'DurationSeconds': '900',\r\n  'WebIdentityToken': access_token\r\n\r\n})).then(function (dataXML, status, xhr) {\r\n\r\n  var data = <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr/blob/master/src/javascript/misc.js#L11\">misc.xmlToObj</a>(dataXML);\r\n  var credentials = data\r\n    .AssumeRoleWithWebIdentityResponse\r\n    .AssumeRoleWithWebIdentityResult\r\n    .Credentials;\r\n\r\n});</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  The <code>RoleArn</code> parameter identifies the IAM role created earlier. The <code>access_token</code> is what my app got when you logged in. The <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html\"><code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> API on Amazon STS</a> lets me <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr/blob/master/src/javascript/publishers/AmazonS3.js#L103\">connect the two and generate temporary credentials</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  Those credentials look something like this:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\" style=\"text-align: left;\">{\r\n  \"SessionToken\":\"NIweiunfiunIUWNLFIsd87\",\r\n  \"Expiration\":\"2014-10-11T19:15:58Z\",\r\n  \"AccessKeyId\":\"ASIAQWERTYUIOP\",\r\n  \"SecretAccessKey\":\"SKLN9869KJnisdhfli\"\r\n}</pre>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  As it turns out, <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr/blob/master/src/javascript/publishers/AmazonS3.js#L148\">these credentials work with Amazon S3</a>. So, after accepting a login and doing the <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> dance, my app can manage web hosting at Amazon S3 on your behalf.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  For further reading, check out &#8220;<a href=\"docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/CreatingWIF.html\">Creating Temporary Security Credentials for Mobile Apps Using Identity Providers</a>&#8221; in Amazon&#8217;s documentation. That&#8217;s from where I stole most of this stuff.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  <span id=\"Demo_time_and_next_steps\">Demo time and next steps</span>\r\n</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  I&#8217;ve rolled all of this into <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr\">a microblogging app called &#8220;tootr&#8221;</a>. Here&#8217;s a demo:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  <a href=\"https://lmorchard.github.io/tootr/\">https://lmorchard.github.io/tootr/</a>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\nYou can visit the app, click &#8220;Login with Amazon&#8221;, and you&#8217;ll soon be tooting up a storm. But, you should notice some serious drawbacks:\r\n\r\n*   The app is terrible and missing almost every interesting feature.\r\n*   Your username is something like [AF5OSES2YSFJEKYBANBHRFB25RXQ][3] and that&#8217;s also terrible.\r\n*   You&#8217;re tooting into my Amazon S3 bucket. You&#8217;re not paying me or Amazon. I *will* vandalize & delete your stuff and not feel bad about it.\r\n\r\nAs a proof-of-concept, though, I think it works: The &#8220;tootr&#8221; app at [lmorchard.github.io][4] publishes to a hosting API at [s3.amazonaws.com][5]. The on-ramp is a single button click and an Amazon sign-in dialog.\r\n\r\nBut, I think all the above issues can be addressed. Also, Amazon is an interesting core for this stuff: Many people have an Amazon account, and Amazon is a place where people generally pay for things. So, it&#8217;s different territory than most social media sites.\r\n\r\nThe challenge will be keeping the on-ramp simple while improving the app and switching to a user-owned web hosting space. Still, I think this is promising stuff. At any rate, it&#8217;s tinkering I&#8217;ve been procrastinating for years now, so I&#8217;ve got plenty of ideas to chase down.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/08/microblogging-like-its-2002\r\n [2]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/09/separating-publishing-from-hosting-on-the-web\r\n [3]: https://tootr.s3.amazonaws.com/users/amazon/amzn1.account.AF5OSES2YSFJEKYBANBHRFB25RXQ/index.html\r\n [4]: https://lmorchard.github.io/tootr/\r\n [5]: http://s3.amazonaws.com\r\n",
