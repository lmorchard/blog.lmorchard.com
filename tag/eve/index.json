It's easily the toughest MMORPG ever made.  You can lose 6 months of work in 30 seconds with no recourse if you don't take precautions.  Conversely, you can ruin 10 people's day in about an hour or so if you're really good.  Many roles in EVE require actual understanding of economics.  And EVE's current fanbase is pretty solid in terms of legitimate community.  The game actually red-shifts and blue-shifts stuff when you're travelling fast enough -- the level of detail on some things is mind-blowing.  Highly recommended, but be aware that often this game is as much work as play.

I would not like to be planning the next masive EVE Onine scam, or the one after it, or the one after that. For now the comforting strains of \"it's just a game\" are paying, but some day, some day soon, the weasel will pop.</blockquote><div class=\"quotesource\">Source: <a href=\"http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1768\">LawMeme - When Virtual Banks Fail</a></div>\r\n\r\nIf the day comes when in-game offences are punishable by out-of-game laws, I quit the internet.  Or, at least the MMORPG side of it - not that I've got that much an investment in it anyway.  \r\n\r\nI mean, sure, some people are making significant real money from play money.  There's value in time spent and time saved running the treadmills.  But no one should be delusioned to think that there's anything other than a service purchase involved, and the laws of the game world are part of the purchase.  If the game world allows a scam, then you bought the fun of an in-game scam along with your rupees or ISK or gold or whatever.  Ignorance of that fact is ignorance, but it ain't an excuse.\r\n\r\nSomeone has to have thought of this:  What about forming governments, laws, police, and courts inside EVE?  Get scammed once too many times?  Don't escape to the meta level and cry for mommy in the outside world.  Organize and fend for yourselves.  Does the game specifically make this sort of thing impossible?  If so, then the game's broken - stop playing it.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085374\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ffe238ed68da35e8037df461552234&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085374\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-29T18:37:45\">2006-08-29T18:37:45</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Being a 3-year EvEer I've gotta say, it's quite possible to do such things.
