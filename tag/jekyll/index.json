The\ncore of it, handling the posts, looks something <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/master/lib/tasks/posts.js#L34\">like this</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function posts (path) {\n  return gulp.src(path)\n    .pipe(frontMatter({property: &#39;page&#39;, remove: true}))\n    .pipe(taskUtils.filename2date())\n    .pipe(marked())\n    .pipe(taskUtils.summarize(&#39;&lt;!--more--&gt;&#39;))\n    .pipe(rename(taskUtils.postNameToDatePath))\n    .pipe(taskUtils.applyTemplate(&#39;design/layouts/post.html&#39;))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(&#39;build&#39;));\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Pretty clean &amp; straightforward, at least to my eyes.</p>\n<p>Starting from <a href=\"https://github.com/rioki/www.rioki.org/blob/master/gulpfile.js\">Rioki&#39;s gulpfile.js</a>, I hacked and iterated until I had\na <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/master/gulpfile.js\">gulpfile.js</a> of my own, split into <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/master/lib/tasks/posts.js#L34\">a directory of small task\nmodules</a>.  At this point, I&#39;ve got a bunch of in-memory post indexes,\ndate &amp; tag based archive pages, RSS feeds, and a handful of other templated\npages. I can push all the content to an Amazon S3 bucket <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/master/gulpfile.js#L32\">with one\ncommand</a>. </p>\n<p>Oh, and building the whole site only takes around 30 seconds.

But, <a href=\"https://github.com/pgherveou/gulp-awspublish\">gulp-awspublish</a>\nkeeps track of MD5 hashes. So, next time I generate and upload, it skips all the\npages that haven&#39;t changed. That&#39;s just a handful of files, if\nall I&#39;m doing is publishing one new post.</p>\n<p>It also seems like this module uploads one file at a time. I wonder if I might\nhack it to queue up a few dozen or so in parallel to speed things up? I doubt\nthat uploading thousands of files was the original use case, so it might do\nwith some tweaking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"page-sections-loaded-via-ajax\">Page sections loaded via AJAX</h2>\n<p>I&#39;ve got a simple template for this new blog, and I hope to keep it that way.\nBut, there&#39;s a lot of stuff in that sidebar. Well, I decided to tweak a few\nthings and suddenly I had 4750 files to upload to S3.</p>\n<p>Just because the site is statically published doesn&#39;t mean some parts\ncan&#39;t be dynamic with the help of the client. Rather than put up wth\nregenerating &amp; uploading all the things in the future, I yanked the sidebar\nout of almost every page and generated it as <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/master/design/sidebar.html\">a separate resource</a>.</p>\n<p>Then, with <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/master/design/js/main.js\">a tiny bit of jQuery magic</a>, I load that sidebar into\nthe page via AJAX. That shrank the size of the site overall, and it&#39;s so fast\nand cacheable that I never see any difference.</p>\n<p>I think this will be one of the little keys to maintaining the site: Try to\nextract any common element used throughout the site, and push it into a\ndynamically loaded asset. Not everything can be done that way, but I think\nplenty can.</p>\n<h2 id=\"disqus-and-comment-archival\">Disqus and comment archival</h2>\n<p>I&#39;m also back to using Disqus for comments. They&#39;ve got a great service, and\nthey&#39;re not a roach motel. They have a great API, and I even wrote a Python\nscript for decafbad.com that <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.decafbad.com/blob/master/_bin/archive_disqus_comments.py\">archives comments from closed\nthreads</a> right into the blog post itself.</p>\n<p>At some point, I need to get that working again and maybe transliterate it\nover to node.js. </p>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\">Next steps</h2>\n<p>I&#39;ve got some more I&#39;d like to do with this stuff, but the main next steps are\nthese:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write more often</li>\n<li>Write more consistently</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, having skimmed through my posts over the years on this blog, I&#39;d\nestimate about 25% of the whole thing is me grousing out loud about the long\nstretches I spend neglecting this place. </p>\n<p>So, who knows?

    "html": "<p>So, I read about <a href=\"http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html\">Blogging Like a Hacker</a> a few years ago. It sounded like a neat idea. A little over a year ago, after much procrastination, I <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/06/08/moved-to-jekyll\">switched to Jekyll and Disqus</a> for blogging and comments.</p>\n<p>Well, guess what? Though the process was novel, I didn&#8217;t blog with any more frequency than I have over the past couple of years. I think I&#8217;ve discovered this about myself: I like <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/\">hacking like a hacker</a>, and I might even like writing a book like a hacker using <a href=\"http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/\">AsciiDoc</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/schacon/git-scribe\">git-scribe</a>. But, those are things which tend to demand deliberation and attention to detail.</p>\n<p>But for blogging? Forget all that fuss. At least, not the way I want to blog. I usually want to spew things that are longer than a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard\">tweet</a>, but shorter than a formal essay. I might iterate by reviewing &amp; revising a few times, because I can&#8217;t resist. But, then, I&#8217;ll move on.</p>\n<p>And, for that kind of writing, the process of using git &amp; jekyll just throws too much friction into my brain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have to create a text file with a filename of proper form,</li>\n<li>edit the text with whatever&#8217;s floating in my brain stew,</li>\n<li>start up jekyll for a preview, wait, <code>Ctrl-C</code> after a few minutes,</li>\n<li>make sure I don&#8217;t have my other 1001 posts in the way because generating things takes <em>ffoorreevveerr</em>. (Tools like <a href=\"http://markedapp.com/\">Marked</a> help here, quite a lot.) </li>\n<li>start up jekyll again and load the new post in a browser</li>\n<li>repeat a few times</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh, and then once I&#8217;m happy with the post, I get to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>compose a commit message, </li>\n<li>push to my web server and github for good measure</li>\n<li>wander off while a post-receive hook regenerates my site on my server</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And then, very recently, I decided to check out WordPress again. I almost forgot how stupidly quick &amp; simple it was to set up. Things like that make me want to hack PHP again.</p>\n<p>In WordPress, my process is this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>visit my blog in my browser, create a new post; </li>\n<li>go tappy-tappy like a monkey writing Shakespeare, watch the preview pane;</li>\n<li>hit publish</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I&#8217;m feeling frisky, I can update a few more times and also hit some buttons to light up Facebook and Twitter with my new brain vomit.</p>\n<p>In my brain, this process makes it feel like so much less of a pain, lame as that might sound.

    "body": "So, I read about [Blogging Like a Hacker][1] a few years ago. It sounded like a neat idea. A little over a year ago, after much procrastination, I [switched to Jekyll and Disqus][2] for blogging and comments.\r\n\r\nWell, guess what? Though the process was novel, I didn&#8217;t blog with any more frequency than I have over the past couple of years. I think I&#8217;ve discovered this about myself: I like [hacking like a hacker][3], and I might even like writing a book like a hacker using [AsciiDoc][4] and [git-scribe][5]. But, those are things which tend to demand deliberation and attention to detail.\r\n\r\nBut for blogging? Forget all that fuss. At least, not the way I want to blog. I usually want to spew things that are longer than a [tweet][6], but shorter than a formal essay. I might iterate by reviewing & revising a few times, because I can&#8217;t resist. But, then, I&#8217;ll move on.\r\n\r\nAnd, for that kind of writing, the process of using git & jekyll just throws too much friction into my brain:\r\n\r\n*   I have to create a text file with a filename of proper form,\r\n*   edit the text with whatever&#8217;s floating in my brain stew,\r\n*   start up jekyll for a preview, wait, `Ctrl-C` after a few minutes,\r\n*   make sure I don&#8217;t have my other 1001 posts in the way because generating things takes *ffoorreevveerr*. (Tools like [Marked][7] help here, quite a lot.) \r\n*   start up jekyll again and load the new post in a browser\r\n*   repeat a few times\r\n\r\nOh, and then once I&#8217;m happy with the post, I get to:\r\n\r\n*   compose a commit message, \r\n*   push to my web server and github for good measure\r\n*   wander off while a post-receive hook regenerates my site on my server\r\n\r\nAnd then, very recently, I decided to check out WordPress again. I almost forgot how stupidly quick & simple it was to set up. Things like that make me want to hack PHP again.\r\n\r\nIn WordPress, my process is this:\r\n\r\n*   visit my blog in my browser, create a new post; \r\n*   go tappy-tappy like a monkey writing Shakespeare, watch the preview pane;\r\n*   hit publish\r\n\r\nIf I&#8217;m feeling frisky, I can update a few more times and also hit some buttons to light up Facebook and Twitter with my new brain vomit.\r\n\r\nIn my brain, this process makes it feel like so much less of a pain, lame as that might sound. And it&#8217;s still self-hosted. And I can still do weird things, if I even care about that anymore. Which I don&#8217;t, at least not [as much as I did back in 2002][8].\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, a pile of static <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML</a> generated from text files kept in git is a great way to archive & mothball a site.

And then it worked again. I never had to ssh into my server, just click buttons in my browser. And that&#8217;s about my speed when I&#8217;m in a lazy blogging state of mind.\r\n\r\nWhew.

    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>My blog is now produced by <a href=\"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a>, with comments hosted by <a href=\"http://disqus.com/\">Disqus</a>.</em></p>\n<p>This blog has transitioned between a handful of publishing platforms -\nincluding Movable Type, blosxom, and Wordpress. Well, apparently, it&#39;s that\ntime again.  I&#39;ve been toying with making a change again for a few years,\nand finally just got all the pieces together over the past week. This blog\nis now just a pile of static files produced by <a href=\"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a>, and the comments\nare now hosted by <a href=\"http://disqus.com/\">Disqus</a>.</p>\n<p>This has a lot of interesting implications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I can neglect my server for long periods of time without worrying that my\nlong-outdated copy of Wordpress has been exploited. Really, there&#39;s no\nreason for me to have a full-featured CMS running here.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I could host my entire blog on Amazon S3 or something similar, and be\nmore neglectful by reducing active code even further. The only crappy\nthing is that I don&#39;t think I can send <code>decafbad.com</code> directly to S3, and\nwould need to redirect to a CNAME on a subdomain on <code>blog.decafbad.com</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I can edit my blog directly on GitHub and, assuming I get the webhooks\nset up, have my server rebuild the HTML automatically on a <code>git push</code>. I\ncould probably use <a href=\"http://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> and the Jekyll support there,\nbut I suspect I&#39;ll be doing some Weird Things that they won&#39;t handle.\n(And probably for good reason.) </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Since Disqus has all my comments now, I can stop worrying about running\nthat code on my server too. I&#39;m a little antsy about putting that in the\ncloud, but the escape routes are well lit and I should be able to replace\nit easily if I need to. Self-hosted, JS-include-based comments is a\nproject in my TODO list.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>My writing here is now all stored in individual text files, formatted with\nMarkdown, annotated with YAML metadata, and subject to revision control\nunder git. This combination feels like it has a lot of longevity and\npotential for survival even beyond this current experiment with <a href=\"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Writing, editing, and publishing entries here can now more closely match\nmy daily reality of living in MacVim and git. It sounds lame, but the\nnotion of swapping over to a Wordpress admin page and working in a\nbrowser textarea has often kept me from even starting a post.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But, some things are broken, now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.decafbad.com/commit/a79678828ab612c2edb8a8ac3f796199cb922a2e\">Fixed</a> <strike>No more tag pages. I don&#39;t think very many humans visit these pages, but\na lot of search engines do.</strike></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.decafbad.com/commit/a79678828ab612c2edb8a8ac3f796199cb922a2e\">Fixed</a> <strike>No more tag feeds. I expect to hear about this soon, since this blog gets\nsyndicated to Planet Mozilla via my &quot;mozilla&quot; tag feed.</strike></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>No more year / month archive pages or sidebar widget. Not sure how many\npeople actually stroll down memory lane here on my blog, but I do have a\n<a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/archives\">gigantor huge list of all my posts evar</a>, now.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A general lack of contextual links to related posts and such. Turns out\nthat running the LSI option on Jekyll is completely horrible.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Regeneration seems less-than-happy in general, and I wish it did\nconditional regneration. That is, only produce the HTML for things that\nneed it because dependencies have changed. No need to rebake the whole\nworld just because I changed one file.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bright side is that there are solutions to all the broken things, and\nnow I have something to tinker with again on my blog.  So, let me know if\nanything else looks broken, and hopefully this will get me spewing some\nmore words out onto this thing soon.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221397880\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.com/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/lmorchard.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.com/\">Les Orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221397880\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-08T17:45:54\">2011-06-08T17:45:54</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Testing a comment here on my new post.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221404263\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/bkclements.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">bkclements</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221404263\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-08T17:59:01\">2011-06-08T17:59:01</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Hi, did you happen to look at blogofile for similar functionality?\nI'm still trying to decide which way to  go.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>My blog is now produced by [Jekyll][], with comments hosted by [Disqus][].</em>\n\n[jekyll]: https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\n[disqus]: http://disqus.com/\n\nThis blog has transitioned between a handful of publishing platforms -\nincluding Movable Type, blosxom, and Wordpress. Well, apparently, it's that\ntime again.  I've been toying with making a change again for a few years,\nand finally just got all the pieces together over the past week. This blog\nis now just a pile of static files produced by [Jekyll][], and the comments\nare now hosted by [Disqus][].\n\n[pages]: http://pages.github.com/\n\nThis has a lot of interesting implications:\n\n* I can neglect my server for long periods of time without worrying that my\n  long-outdated copy of Wordpress has been exploited. Really, there's no\n  reason for me to have a full-featured CMS running here.\n\n* I could host my entire blog on Amazon S3 or something similar, and be\n  more neglectful by reducing active code even further. The only crappy\n  thing is that I don't think I can send `decafbad.com` directly to S3, and\n  would need to redirect to a CNAME on a subdomain on `blog.decafbad.com`.\n\n* I can edit my blog directly on GitHub and, assuming I get the webhooks\n  set up, have my server rebuild the HTML automatically on a `git push`. I\n  could probably use [GitHub Pages][pages] and the Jekyll support there,\n  but I suspect I'll be doing some Weird Things that they won't handle.\n  (And probably for good reason.) \n\n* Since Disqus has all my comments now, I can stop worrying about running\n  that code on my server too. I'm a little antsy about putting that in the\n  cloud, but the escape routes are well lit and I should be able to replace\n  it easily if I need to. Self-hosted, JS-include-based comments is a\n  project in my TODO list.\n\n* My writing here is now all stored in individual text files, formatted with\n  Markdown, annotated with YAML metadata, and subject to revision control\n  under git. This combination feels like it has a lot of longevity and\n  potential for survival even beyond this current experiment with [Jekyll][]\n\n* Writing, editing, and publishing entries here can now more closely match\n  my daily reality of living in MacVim and git. It sounds lame, but the\n  notion of swapping over to a Wordpress admin page and working in a\n  browser textarea has often kept me from even starting a post.\n\nBut, some things are broken, now:\n\n* [Fixed][tags] <strike>No more tag pages. I don't think very many humans visit these pages, but\n  a lot of search engines do.</strike>\n\n* [Fixed][tags] <strike>No more tag feeds. I expect to hear about this soon, since this blog gets\n  syndicated to Planet Mozilla via my \"mozilla\" tag feed.</strike>\n\n* No more year / month archive pages or sidebar widget. Not sure how many\n  people actually stroll down memory lane here on my blog, but I do have a\n  [gigantor huge list of all my posts evar][archives], now.\n\n* A general lack of contextual links to related posts and such. Turns out\n  that running the LSI option on Jekyll is completely horrible.\n\n* Regeneration seems less-than-happy in general, and I wish it did\n  conditional regneration. That is, only produce the HTML for things that\n  need it because dependencies have changed. No need to rebake the whole\n  world just because I changed one file.\n\n[tags]: https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.decafbad.com/commit/a79678828ab612c2edb8a8ac3f796199cb922a2e\n\nThe bright side is that there are solutions to all the broken things, and\nnow I have something to tinker with again on my blog.  So, let me know if\nanything else looks broken, and hopefully this will get me spewing some\nmore words out onto this thing soon.\n\n[archives]: http://decafbad.com/blog/archives\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221397880\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/lmorchard.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com/\">Les Orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221397880\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-08T17:45:54\">2011-06-08T17:45:54</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Testing a comment here on my new post.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221404263\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/bkclements.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">bkclements</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221404263\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-08T17:59:01\">2011-06-08T17:59:01</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Hi, did you happen to look at blogofile for similar functionality?\n\nI'm still trying to decide which way to  go.
