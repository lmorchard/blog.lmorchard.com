    "summary": "I've long agreed that many sites, like blogs, are better baked than\nfried. It makes for web hosting that's cheaper to run and simpler to\nmaintain. I've also often thought that using a database can be an\nanti-pattern for managing content. But, what I've also found is\nthat baked sites often yield a poor writing environment. That said, I think\nI'm going to give it another try, because I think I might have found a new\napproach that works for me.",

Finally, after much procrastination, I switched to Jekyll and Disqus for blogging and comments a little over a year ago. Well, guess what? Though the process was novel, I didn't blog with any more frequency than I have over the past couple of years.",
