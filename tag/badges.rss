        <title>Looking for a Django app to manage Roles within Groups</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to add some team-based features to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmorchard/django-badger&quot;&gt;django-badger&lt;/a&gt;. I was hoping that someone had already built a reusable app to do most of the work for me. This happens quite a lot when I&amp;#x2019;m working with Django. Unfortunately, I haven&amp;#x2019;t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; found what I&amp;#x2019;m looking for yet. Consider this blog post either the product of my thinking out loud toward a rough spec, or a long-winded lazyweb search query.&lt;/p&gt;
