    "html": "<p>Listening to this <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2006/02/12/530652.aspx\">podcast about OPML and Reading Lists</a> and enjoying the various perspectives on RSS, OPML, and Semantic Web tech.  It&#39;s also the first time I&#39;ve heard Danny Ayers&#39; voice, so that was pretty cool after having been a textual blog acquaintance for a few years now.  As for the rest of the guys on the call, I&#39;m not quite as familiar with all of them yet, but I&#39;ll be adding them to my Reading Lists shortly.</p>\n<p>Apropos of this podcast, I&#39;ve lately gotten a bit of a fresh take on the RSS/OPML versus XHTML versus Semantic Web tech merry-go-round.  Here&#39;s the basic gist:  Invest time into tools that solve problems first and formats that enable possibilities second, if you want to get any attention and subsequent help.</p>\n<p>And then I say &quot;tools&quot;, I don&#39;t mean a GraphViz construct that makes really cool charts for people willing to chase down and install the dependencies.  No, I mean something like the OPML Editor.  The OPML Editor comes in a single package, and you launch it from a single icon.  The OPML Editor is <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty piece of software</a> that&#39;s nonetheless helping me achieve some practical goals that I&#39;ve heretofore been vaguely stymied in reaching.  The OPML Editor is making me think more favorably about OPML, <i>despite</i> OPML being <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty format</a>.</p>\n<p>The utility of the OPML Editor is giving me the motivation to build filters and workarounds to transmute OPML into XOXO and RDF formats, but only when the need arises.  I could also see putting an OPML-to-triples bridge in front of a semweb crawler or tool.  And, there&#39;s no reason why outlines in the OPML Editor couldn&#39;t be rendered in XOXO and RDF formats by the tool itself, if there&#39;s something useful around to consume it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I&#39;ve done enough with RDF and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo_outliner_experiment\">XOXO</a> to see the clear potential in both.  With enough RDF data around, you can turn the whole wide web into a single massively networked database ripe for the querying thanks to a uniform data model and clear specs for representation of that model.  With XOXO and microformats, you get a <a href=\"http://www.sudoku.com/\">Sudoku-esque</a> solution to providing both human and machine readable data in the same format and file, while sterring close to the inherent design principles of the web.</p>\n<p>The problem with these formats, though, is that they open potential avenues but don&#39;t provide value until there&#39;s some foot traffic on the avenues.  This is just establishing a world in which there can exist both chickens and eggs, but not doing much with respect to concrete instantiations of poultry.\nNow, to be fair, there have been efforts to make practical usage of RDF (see: <a href=\"http://musicbrainz.org/\">MusicBrainz</a>) and these are early days for microformats.  But, I think a lot more effort needs to be given toward making useful, personally rewarding tools - and less effort given toward expressing awe toward the potentials given by formats and models.  You can have both, but you&#39;ve got to pick one to start with.</p>\n<p>And, the reason you need to make tools first that use formats second is attention.  (That&#39;s been a buzzword lately, hasn&#39;t it?)  You need attention if you want adoption and help.  And, you can get attention - and subsequent help - by scratching someone&#39;s itch.</p>\n<p>Now, some people&#39;s itches are scratched by the fun of abstract symbol manipulation and the perception of elegance.  Others&#39; itches are scratched by getting work done, like writing or organizing thoughts or expanding awareness of more information sources.  Personally, I&#39;ve got itches of both of these varieties.  The problem is that there are many fewer people with itches in that first category.  And, no offense to anyone, that seems to be the bulk of the RDF and XOXO fanbase at the moment.  For the second category, even if things are shitty, smoke a bit and catch on fire - as long as some work gets done at the end of the day, there&#39;s a lot of tolerance to go around and a lot of motivation to pitch in to improve the situation.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I firmly believe that ATOM, RDF, and XHTML-based microformats trounce OPML, RSS, and the like in terms of clear definition, affordance in manipulation, and technical elegance.  But, OPML and RSS are still winning in the world because the tools using these formats are scratching some damn annoying itches.  And, though towers built atop shitty tools and formats seem Jenga-shaky, somehow they never quite come crashing down.  Maybe they will come crashing down someday, but we seem to be getting work done in the meantime.</p>\n<p>So, to wrap up:  My take on this whole mess is that your format will gain adoption to the degree that the tools producing it help people get work done.  I can&#39;t find tools today for RDF and XOXO that are as rewardingly useful as the OPML Editor has become.  When that happens, the story may change.</p>\n<!-- tags: metablogging rdf semweb webdev opml rss syndication microformats xoxo podcasting -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086877\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e377f3e2140297d32460ae9a4b38ff98&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086877\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-14T02:32:49\">2006-02-14T02:32:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>There's a lot to be said for rough consensus and running code, and there's a lot more running code that speaks OPML than there is that speaks XOXO or RDF.

This Frontier / Radio / OPML Editor environment is undeniably satisfying for me to work in.  It&#39;s like potato chips:  Jump to an outline here, tweak some code there, mangle an outline node up there, reload a browser page, watch things go—lots of moments of instant gratification all building incrementally atop one another.</p>\n<p>In one package—which reminds me a lot of <a href=\"http://www.squeak.org/\">Squeak</a>—the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/\">OPML Editor</a> bundles a crazy amount of integrated machinery for both Windows and Mac OS X:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UserTalk, a very capable scripting language</li>\n<li>An IDE based on outlining, somewhat like Python&#39;s syntactic indentation</li>\n<li>Persistent on-disk hierarchical hashtables (aka the Object Database)</li>\n<li>Code and data all live in the same object database</li>\n<li>A web server and a host of other networking code—including Jabber messaging, although I can&#39;t attest to its freshness.</li>\n<li>Blog editing and no-effort external web hosting file synch</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/26/oooabf\">Hot patching</a> and easy upgrades that most other software packages dream of</li>\n<li>Years and years and years of (mostly) working code with datestamped change notes and living history.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the thing is?  This was the state of the art for Radio back in 2002—and earlier than that even for Frontier.  Fast forward from then till today, and you&#39;ll find that <a href=\"http://frontierkernel.sourceforge.net/\">Frontier is now Open Source</a>—with many of the same sorts of warts Mozilla&#39;s open source release helpfully revealed back in 1997.  (Some hero needs to come along and port this beast to Linux!  Good luck!)  And now, much of the guts of Radio are released as the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/\">OPML Editor</a>.  </p>\n<p>In a lot of ways, this whole family of apps built on this common ancestry of code is <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">really shitty software</a>.  Kind of like <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/02/24/ancient-software-and-programmer-archaeologists\">all that code on the <em>Qeng Ho</em> from Vernor Vinge&#39;s <em>A Deepness in the Sky</em></a>.  This stuff crashes and sets itself on fire a lot, but then again it&#39;s amazing to see just how many wheels have been reinvented and re-reinvented since 2002 (and before) when I fire up this code today.</p>\n<p>And now, it looks like the embers are stirring for this thing again.  There&#39;s been a lot of time for a lot of angst to fade from a lot of places, and it looks like there&#39;s a new crop of fresh people rediscovering this stuff.  </p>\n<p>So, anyway, I like these potato chips.  I think I want to start munching on them again, as time permits.  Oh, and while I&#39;m talking about potato chips—I have to say, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/28/dont-pee-in-the-potato-chips\">don&#39;t pee in the potato chips</a> and be nice to the guy holding the bag.</p>\n<!-- tags: winer rss syndication radio usertalk frontier vinge opml -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084407\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=760b4002b07650d4ef654f9fc17e8154&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Robert Brook</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084407\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-28T15:03:50\">2006-01-28T15:03:50</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Serious question: why not use Squeak?</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084408\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084408\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-28T16:01:26\">2006-01-28T16:01:26</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Robert: Short answer is that I saw Radio first for the RSS aggregator and blogging support, started hacking on that, and got sucked into other aspects of it along the way.  </p>\n<p>For Squeak, I saw some fun colorful things and kind of got the gist of the environment, but never got hooked on any daily uses of it after a weekend or two of playing.

    "html": "<p>Although I have <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/18/not-so-deep-php-thoughts\">my grousing about PHP in general</a>, I have to say that it makes much better template language as-is before pulling something like <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> into the mix.  </p>\n<p>At this point, I consider <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> to be evil—though I&#39;m willing to admit that I haven&#39;t grokked it fully yet.  And this is coming from <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/25/templates-good-or-evil\">a templating addict</a> who has been at times in love with <a href=\"http://www.template-toolkit.org/\">Template Toolkit</a> in Perl,  <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/\">Velocity</a> in Java, and <a href=\"http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/\">Cheetah</a> and <a href=\"http://twisted.sourceforge.net/TwistedDocs-1.2.0rc3/howto/woven.html\">Woven</a> and <a href=\"http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/\">ZPT/TAL</a> in Python.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> seems to have put native-PHP-as-templating to good use, so I&#39;ve already got a favorite for comparison.  But the use of <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> in <a href=\"http://www.reblog.org/\">reBlog</a> rubs me the wrong way.  Of course, <a href=\"http://www.reblog.org/\">reBlog</a> has a lot of highly-abstracted MVC architecture going on.  And this, itself, is something I haven&#39;t much in my PHP explorations thus far.  (In fact, I almost hate to see PHP chopped up in this J2EE-esque fashion, but that&#39;s another story.  Oh, and <a href=\"http://www.reblog.org/\">reBlog</a> rocks, by the way.)</p>\n<p>But either way, <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> makes this right-handed hacker feel like he&#39;s writing with his left.  It seems to have a lot of weird conventions and terminology for which neither knowledge of PHP nor knowledge of other templating systems in general seem much help.  It could just be a learning curve, but to me it seems like an odd <em>sideways</em> curve at the moment.  </p>\n<p>In fact, you know what?  <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> reminds me a lot of <a href=\"http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Guides/DTML-HTML/DTML.html\">DTML in Zope</a>.  I hate <a href=\"http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Guides/DTML-HTML/DTML.html\">DTML</a>—it, also, is most firmly on my evil list.</p>\n<p>Yuck.  Again, it could be just that I haven&#39;t known <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> long enough to like it... but yuck.</p>\n<!-- tags: templating php smarty dtml python perl cheetah webdev programming syndication reblog wordpress evil -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082526\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://luka.kladaric.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=78b0e32da6ce10e17db345a9aa8cde78&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://luka.kladaric.net/\">Luka Kladaric</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082526\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-08T11:55:40\">2006-01-08T11:55:40</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with you...

Anyway, a rewrite of the first project is in negotiations and I'm 100% sure I will <em>NOT</em> be using Smarty there, either.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082527\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082527\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-08T14:34:57\">2006-01-08T14:34:57</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Agreed.

Of course, I used others but it was getting sick coming to a new phase in a project and finding out the template system had become RIP....abandoned before their time.</p>\n<p>Smarty has done two great things for me, and I'll speak about them until the day that PHP is abolished:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Smarty has reduced my code to a reasonably sized, scan-able, masterpiece.  Having the logic and presentation seperate is so nice.  I recently rewrote one of my old projects using smarty and all of a sudden it made sense!  No more php in the html and no more html in the php.  And that's something you can't solve without templates for you juniors out there.</p></li>\n<li><p>Smarty's caching has turned monster db queries into non issues.  Consider this.  A top 10 list from all-time sales.  I'm talking about searching a db with sales spanning 6 years for all items purchased and creating a top sales page.  Easy!  Smarty does it once and caches the results until I decide they need to be refreshed.  Took a 4 second execution time down to less than 0.4 seconds.  And all without having to implement a CMS or otherwise.  Even if you have limitless resources to buy new hardware, caching like this still makes sense.  And the intermediate php/html cache is brilliant.  Everything is so much faster with smarty.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I can't deny, I love Smarty.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082542\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082542\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-01T11:43:36\">2006-02-01T11:43:36</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Tali: I'm usually opinionated, but I try to listen &amp; learn :)</p>\n<p>The benefits you describe with Smarty would seem to come with any decent web development system.

It's definitely got its problems. A large part of the choice was based on my perception of Smarty as having much thought &amp; effort behind it, plus I like the idea of templates caching down to plain PHP. I've done a few PHP projects where I used PHP as the templating language, and frequently succumbed to the temptation to stash app logic into the templates where it didn't really belong. Smarty has a pretty extensive vocabulary, but has (so far) resisted the pull to incorporate more real-language features, like PHP did. It's worth remembering that PHP was originally supposed to be a template language for \"real\" code to be written in C. <em>shudder</em></p>\n<p>When we forked Reblog from Feed On Feeds, we were starting with raw-PHP display code mixed in with database calls, and it was a freaking disaster. One of my first design goals was to make it hacker-friendly, clarifying and documenting as many seams as possible so people could make localized changes more easily. I'd like to be using Python under the hood with Smarty on top, though there's a lot to be said for using commonly-known tools like Smarty in apps where you want to encourage modifications.</p>\n<p>And Wordpress.... oh, Wordpress. My eyes roll back in my head when I'm forced to touch its convoluted innards. I pushed hard for a Reblog plug-in API specifically so I could cheerfully deprecate the old-style Wordpress plug-in. =)</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "Although I have [my grousing about PHP in general][gphp], I have to say that it makes much better template language as-is before pulling something like [Smarty][smarty] into the mix.  \r\n\r\nAt this point, I consider [Smarty][] to be evil—though I'm willing to admit that I haven't grokked it fully yet.  And this is coming from [a templating addict][tmpl] who has been at times in love with [Template Toolkit][tt] in Perl,  [Velocity][] in Java, and [Cheetah][] and [Woven][] and [ZPT/TAL][zpt] in Python.  \r\n\r\n[WordPress][] seems to have put native-PHP-as-templating to good use, so I've already got a favorite for comparison.  But the use of [Smarty][] in [reBlog][] rubs me the wrong way.  Of course, [reBlog][] has a lot of highly-abstracted MVC architecture going on.  And this, itself, is something I haven't much in my PHP explorations thus far.  (In fact, I almost hate to see PHP chopped up in this J2EE-esque fashion, but that's another story.  Oh, and [reBlog][] rocks, by the way.)\r\n\r\nBut either way, [Smarty][] makes this right-handed hacker feel like he's writing with his left.  It seems to have a lot of weird conventions and terminology for which neither knowledge of PHP nor knowledge of other templating systems in general seem much help.  It could just be a learning curve, but to me it seems like an odd *sideways* curve at the moment.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, you know what?  [Smarty][] reminds me a lot of [DTML in Zope][dtml].  I hate [DTML][]—it, also, is most firmly on my evil list.\r\n\r\nYuck.  Again, it could be just that I haven't known [Smarty][] long enough to like it... but yuck.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: templating php smarty dtml python perl cheetah webdev programming syndication reblog wordpress evil -->\r\n\r\n[dtml]: http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Guides/DTML-HTML/DTML.html\r\n[tt]: http://www.template-toolkit.org/\r\n[velocity]: http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/\r\n[gphp]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/18/not-so-deep-php-thoughts\r\n[cheetah]: http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/\r\n[zpt]: http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/\r\n[smarty]: http://smarty.php.net\r\n[wordpress]: http://wordpress.org/\r\n[reblog]: http://www.reblog.org/\r\n[woven]: http://twisted.sourceforge.net/TwistedDocs-1.2.0rc3/howto/woven.html\r\n[tmpl]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/25/templates-good-or-evil\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082526\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://luka.kladaric.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=78b0e32da6ce10e17db345a9aa8cde78&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://luka.kladaric.net/\">Luka Kladaric</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082526\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-08T11:55:40\">2006-01-08T11:55:40</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with you...

A top 10 list from all-time sales.  I'm talking about searching a db with sales spanning 6 years for all items purchased and creating a top sales page.  Easy!  Smarty does it once and caches the results until I decide they need to be refreshed.  Took a 4 second execution time down to less than 0.4 seconds.  And all without having to implement a CMS or otherwise.  Even if you have limitless resources to buy new hardware, caching like this still makes sense.  And the intermediate php/html cache is brilliant.  Everything is so much faster with smarty.</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>I can't deny, I love Smarty.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082542\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082542\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-01T11:43:36\">2006-02-01T11:43:36</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Tali: I'm usually opinionated, but I try to listen &amp; learn :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The benefits you describe with Smarty would seem to come with any decent web development system.

(Indeed, Template Toolkit has no such facilities.) But there’s the Cache::Cache family of modules on the CPAN, which you can use to cache things completely independently of <em>what</em> is being cached – whether it be the output of a template, or the query results themselves, or anything else, which might not even have anything to do without any output you generate.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082546\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bab1c370ad7b246023e23e87c8e206c4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">M.</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082546\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-16T14:13:18\">2006-02-16T14:13:18</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I've good experiences with the Expose PHP template engine (www.kwasd.nl/expose).

By setting up a shared folder which contains the templates, they can safely work on design and never need to touch my controller or module files. Especially since this template engine has a tokenizer/compiler, they can't call unsafe PHP functions (only those that you, the programmer, register).</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082549\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e3b46099c3fd3844c4539b27f143fd97&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\">Michal Migurski</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082549\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-05T23:16:25\">2006-03-05T23:16:25</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Smarty appealed to us because it offered a (relatively) clean way to separate the code from the HTML output. It's definitely got its problems. A large part of the choice was based on my perception of Smarty as having much thought &amp; effort behind it, plus I like the idea of templates caching down to plain PHP. I've done a few PHP projects where I used PHP as the templating language, and frequently succumbed to the temptation to stash app logic into the templates where it didn't really belong. Smarty has a pretty extensive vocabulary, but has (so far) resisted the pull to incorporate more real-language features, like PHP did. It's worth remembering that PHP was originally supposed to be a template language for \"real\" code to be written in C. <em>shudder</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we forked Reblog from Feed On Feeds, we were starting with raw-PHP display code mixed in with database calls, and it was a freaking disaster. One of my first design goals was to make it hacker-friendly, clarifying and documenting as many seams as possible so people could make localized changes more easily. I'd like to be using Python under the hood with Smarty on top, though there's a lot to be said for using commonly-known tools like Smarty in apps where you want to encourage modifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Wordpress.... oh, Wordpress. My eyes roll back in my head when I'm forced to touch its convoluted innards. I pushed hard for a Reblog plug-in API specifically so I could cheerfully deprecate the old-style Wordpress plug-in. =)</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

I&#39;ve had this running for well over a year, and it&#39;s always my first stop in the feed reader.  Almost without fail, this tends to surface what&#39;s buzzworthy.</p>\n<p>Basically, this script scans all the current entries of all my subscribed feeds for unique hyperlink URLs found in descriptions and summaries.  It collates all entries by these links, then sorts by the number of entries under each link.  A threshold is applied, filtering for links pointed to by 3 or more entries.  </p>\n<p>At the end, I see a new feed entry displaying the most linked-to things of the moment.  Think of this as a kind of real-time PageRank.  How&#39;s that for network effects?</p>\n<p>I think this is <em>sort of</em> how <a href=\"http://memeorandum.com/\">Memeorandum</a> works, only this is constrained to the feeds in my subscription list.  I&#39;ve been considering making this script a full-on service:  Upload an OPML export from your aggregator, get your own Popular Links feed.  I&#39;ve got all the parts laying around but I haven&#39;t yet had time to put them together—<strong>but if it sounds like something useful, and possibly worth clicking a Paypal donation button, let me know!</strong></p>\n<p>Secondly:  <a href=\"http://tantek.com/presentations/2005/01/attentionxml.html\">Attention.xml</a> makes a lot of sense with regard to the above-quoted article.  When I first heard about <a href=\"http://tantek.com/presentations/2005/01/attentionxml.html\">Attention.xml</a>, I merely cocked my head at it and made a confused sound.  This was before I caught the microformats bug, and before I realized that I <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/01/blogrolls-grow-up-to-become-feedrolls\">started reinventing it</a> a bit in my own ramblings.</p>\n<p>Basically, <a href=\"http://tantek.com/presentations/2005/01/attentionxml.html\">Attention.xml</a> is a feedroll enriched with data about the entries you&#39;ve lately read from each feed.  It&#39;s in an XHTML-based format which—albeit ugly in my opinion and in need of more elegant microformat influence—is indeed viewable in a browser.

    "body": "<blockquote cite=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/SAAS/?p=82\">Instead of reading their individual selections of RSS feeds privately, everyone should be encouraged to publish those aggregated feeds on the Web. ... the simple act of publishing those aggregations then makes them available to others, and thus makes them amenable to network effects in a way that they never can be if they're kept private.</blockquote>\r\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/SAAS/?p=82\">» It's time to bury RSS | Software as services | ZDNet.com</a></small>\r\n\r\nMy current two responses to the above:\r\n\r\n* I love my [popular links][pl] summary feed.\r\n* [Attention.xml][att] is starting to make sense to me.\r\n\r\nPutting these two together could be a very powerful tool for bringing network effects to feed reading.\r\n\r\nFirst off, one of the most useful feeds I have is my private Popular Links feed.  [Touting my book again][book], I showcase the [script behind this thing][pl] in Chapter 15.  I've had this running for well over a year, and it's always my first stop in the feed reader.  Almost without fail, this tends to surface what's buzzworthy.\r\n\r\nBasically, this script scans all the current entries of all my subscribed feeds for unique hyperlink URLs found in descriptions and summaries.  It collates all entries by these links, then sorts by the number of entries under each link.  A threshold is applied, filtering for links pointed to by 3 or more entries.  \r\n\r\nAt the end, I see a new feed entry displaying the most linked-to things of the moment.  Think of this as a kind of real-time PageRank.  How's that for network effects?\r\n\r\nI think this is *sort of* how [Memeorandum][meme] works, only this is constrained to the feeds in my subscription list.  I've been considering making this script a full-on service:  Upload an OPML export from your aggregator, get your own Popular Links feed.  I've got all the parts laying around but I haven't yet had time to put them together—**but if it sounds like something useful, and possibly worth clicking a Paypal donation button, let me know!**\r\n\r\nSecondly:  [Attention.xml][att] makes a lot of sense with regard to the above-quoted article.  When I first heard about [Attention.xml][att], I merely cocked my head at it and made a confused sound.  This was before I caught the microformats bug, and before I realized that I [started reinventing it][blogroll] a bit in my own ramblings.\r\n\r\nBasically, [Attention.xml][att] is a feedroll enriched with data about the entries you've lately read from each feed.  It's in an XHTML-based format which—albeit ugly in my opinion and in need of more elegant microformat influence—is indeed viewable in a browser.  In a sense, this format is an auto-blog of my feed consumption.  I was looking for hacks for my NetNewsWire in AppleScript, when I found [this Attention.xml generator][gen].  Seeing the output of that, it all clicked.\r\n\r\nCombining [Attention.xml][att] with my Popular Links algorithm could be a very powerful thing, methinks.  Rather than waiting for my friends to tip over the laziness point to blogging about something, I could digest their shared [Attention.xml][att] files and collate the links they've merely *read*.  In this way, I could build an *AttentionRank* for various things, and cause the cream to rise to the top in my feed reader.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that I'm playing catch-up here, but this all suddenly seems hot to me.  And not to mention, it seems neat that I have all the pieces laying around to build it.  The only bad thing is that I just don't have the time to spare—I've already spent too much time writing this blog post!\r\n\r\nAnyway, maybe you'll hear more from me about this soon.\r\n\r\n[gen]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/01/blogrolls-grow-up-to-become-feedrolls\r\n[blogroll]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/01/blogrolls-grow-up-to-become-feedrolls\r\n[att]: http://tantek.com/presentations/2005/01/attentionxml.html\r\n[meme]: http://memeorandum.com/\r\n[pl]: http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/hacking_rss_and_atom/ch15_popular_links.py\r\n[book]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085102\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.wakingideas.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c3a79b6f40ba93496389e42cd76ad2f1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.wakingideas.com\">Daniel Nicolas</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085102\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-03T15:39:45\">2006-01-03T15:39:45</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I think you could get away with charging $5 for a service like that.

And because of that, these tools are unfortunately brittle and prone to future shock.</p>\n<p>For example, take <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb\"><code>Syndication.framework</code> on OS X</a>:  Amongst the monkeys and ninjas and pirates and robots, you&#39;ve got your standard <em>title-date-link-description</em> columns with a few other bits for good measure.  But, where&#39;s the data from <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/static/iTunesRSS.html\">iTunes RSS extensions</a>?  Nowhere, gone, lost.  If it was in the feed when <code>Syndication.framework</code> found it, it wasn&#39;t understood and so it wasn&#39;t retained after the parser finished chewing up and spitting the data into that DB table.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/building-a-proper-shared-syndication-feed-foundation\">I&#39;ve written about shared feed processing foundations before</a>, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve totally gotten the idea to gel in my head until now.  Here&#39;s the thing:  If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.  Rather than intrusively breaking apart and recasting feed data into a predetermined data structure, you&#39;ve got to remain hands-off as much as possible.</p>\n<p>This is what I did in <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a>.  This code can subscribe to feeds, poll feed data periodically, and even work out which items in a feed are new—but it punts on everything else by only caring about where a feed starts and ends, and where its individual entries start and end.  <em>The rest is left in its original XML form.</em>  So, if there was data in there for iTunes?  It&#39;s still there, because <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a> didn&#39;t know enough to do anything to it.</p>\n<p>This is the major difference in feed processing model.  <code>Syndication.framework</code> loses information when it encounters things it doesn&#39;t understand.  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a> retains the information, because it leaves things alone when it doesn&#39;t know any better.</p>\n<p>Now, this is not to pick on just <code>Syndication.framework</code>.  Despite the general-sounding name,  this framework is pretty much just around to power <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/\">Safari RSS</a> and not <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/\">iTunes</a> or anything else.  And as I said, pretty much every other feed processing framework and tool works in this manner.  Just about everybody uses a destructive process when they parse and marshal feed data into local-idiom structures.  </p>\n<p>And this destructive process is fine when all you want to do is satisfy a specific purpose—display a few headlines, for example.  But if you&#39;re trying to build general-case feed plumbing, this is unacceptable and untenable.  If most everything in a feed item gets lost as it goes through a pipeline, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/05/the-right-place-for-data-in-your-feed\">we might as well abandon feed extensions entirely in favor of microformats stuffed into the <code>description</code> tag</a>—an idea to which I&#39;m not <em>entirely</em> opposed.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, consider this:  This past summer, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/four-thoughts-on-ms-rss-so-far\">Microsoft released an architectural overview about an OS-wide RSS framework in the upcoming Vista</a>.  Unfortunately, like many RSS and Vista related things from this past summer, all links have evaporated into a redirect to a single developers portal.  I can&#39;t figure out why they didn&#39;t just <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/rss/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/rsssupportinlonghorn.asp\">redirect over to here</a>, which took me a search and a few clicks to rediscover.</p>\n<p>At any rate, there&#39;s one sentence in this overview that gives me hope for RSS as a general service in Windows Vista:  </p>\n<p>&quot;<em>It is also possible to access the item XML for applications that want to perform operations on the XML instead of using the item&#39;s properties.</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>So, dig that.  If it works the way I hope it does, RSS in Vista will take care of the subscriptions for you, poll the feed data, grab new stuff—but then it leaves the data intact for you to process whatever new and unanticipated feed payloads that may arrive.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s how it <em>should</em> work.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084486\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=622a34307765c2f7c1dfdc7345842418&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\">Darren Chamberlain</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-13T15:03:07\">2005-12-13T15:03:07</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n<p>If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.

The <code>dc:subject</code> elements encoding del.icio.us tags are gone, even in the RSS-1.0-to-RSS-1.0 transformation.

More general and extensible than creating custom classes for filtering by specific fields, and I think if you were to ever write a general filter app where users can specify filter fields and values, you'd basically be reimplementing SPARQL.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084487\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084487\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-13T15:51:47\">2005-12-13T15:51:47</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Well, a triplestore would be great if these feeds were RDF.

(And that's not to mention the 7-8 step form I had to go through to start filtering.  Definitely not a URL-line application.)  But, with respect to their filtering and conversion, check out these feeds:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>http://del.icio.us/rss/deusx</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/RSS0.91</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/RSS1.0</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/RSS2.0</li>\n<li>http://feeds.blogsieve.com/192/ATOM0.3</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you compare these to each other, you'll find information loss and even just plain corruption.  The <code>dc:subject</code> elements encoding del.icio.us tags are gone, even in the RSS-1.0-to-RSS-1.0 transformation.  And somehow, in the Atom version, they managed to jumble up titles and authors.  Granted, my stuff doesn't do <em>conversion</em> yet, but I wouldn't want to do it like this.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't tried it yet, but I'd have to guess that a podcast feed with iTunes and/or Yahoo!

So the combination of iTunes loading feed-delivered video enclosures onto an iPod equipped with an AV cable and a remote sounds like a genius combination for really jump starting the next phase of the vidcasting rise.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: apple ipod video syndication rss atom podcasting vidcasting hacks xbox -->\r\n\r\n[xbmc]: http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/\r\n[rb]: http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/\r\n[cn]: http://www.commandn.net/\r\n[oa]: http://openalpha.tv\r\n[shows]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/13/internet-tv-wheres-the-feed\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086753\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086753\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-21T19:27:21\">2005-10-21T19:27:21</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I really wish I had a enough spare parts of bucks lying around to build a MythTV box, because I could create quite a freaking videoblog aggregating machine out of it, and view it all on the big screen TV...

I'll leave as exercises for the reader issues of \"obfuscating\" URLs so that people can't easily skip ahead through the story.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: rss atom syndication rest http podcasting -->\r\n\r\n[anc]: http://www.project-daemon.net/\r\n[sw]: http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/09/01/track\r\n[rb]: http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008220.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086694\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086694\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-21T04:16:34\">2005-10-21T04:16:34</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>My favorite example of this is Matt Webb's service which offers <a href=\"http://interconnected.org/home/more/lightcone/\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS feed of your personal light cone</a></p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086695\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a0b347907bfaf05694805210ec595d6c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Martin Atkins</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086695\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-21T07:06:00\">2005-10-21T07:06:00</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>This scheme falls down in two ways.

I just happened to be working with it for a project this week, and I have to say that that's some nice stuff there.  That's a platform that feels like some magic.  I don't think I could've built *that* from scratch, though it sure is fun building things atop it.\r\n\r\n[gr]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/07/google-reader-big-blue-chunky-water-wings\r\n[gma]: http://www.google.com/apis/maps/\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: google rss syndication rants googlemaps -->\r\n",

Problem is, I haven&#39;t gotten much closer now, but I figured I&#39;d at least post a few thoughts and conjure up a vague sketch of the issue.</p>\n<p>You see, I think it all goes back to <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/12/13/oooced\">thoughts about which I posted almost three years ago</a>.  On the one hand, producing something like XML using &quot;proper&quot; DOM invocations and handwavings seems like the &quot;correct&quot; thing to do.  Yet, on the other hand, using a templating system lets me get down to business much more quickly and with much more clarity and succinct code.  </p>\n<p>Yeah, templates provide a range of flexibility sufficient to aim the barrel at your own toes, while an API like the XML DOM keeps everything on the rails--but sometimes you know where you&#39;re going and don&#39;t need the rails to get you there.  Furthermore, isn&#39;t it possible to make a template system that Does The Right Thing?</p>\n<p>Anyway, it&#39;s rather apparent that I&#39;m solidly in favor of templates:  After all, a book of mine just hit the shelves which is just rife with template-based generation of RSS and Atom feeds.  </p>\n<p>My only issue, really, is that I feel vaguely guilty about it.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084924\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=821395fe70906c8290df7f18ac4ac6cf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">rick</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084924\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T02:27:37\">2005-09-26T02:27:37</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Ruby has the nice Builder module for this (http://builder.rubyforge.org/).

Don&#8217;t do that.\nCheck <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henri Sivonen</a>&#8217;s suggestions just published in his <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/producing-xml/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HOWTO Avoid Being Called a Bozo When Producing XML</a>. Instead of building a DOM, generate SAX events, using the program structure to ensure proper nesting &#8211; or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.\nThe emission of synthesised SAX events can be generalised by writing a datastructure-to-SAX serialiser, so that you can build your data within your language&#8217;s native datastructures prior to outputting it, for maximum comfort. (Of course you serialise piecemeal too, f.ex. by outputting the head of a feed manually, then for each item, building the data structure and immediately serialising it, then emitting the final events to complete the document.)\nDepending on the complexity of the output, you could directly emit the otuput format or feed the events into to an XSLT transform that generates the full-blown thing from an easy to generate document structure. In both cases this can be done with or without the involvement of a serialiser as middle man.\nThere are plenty of ways to make sure that the entire toolchain from one end to the other consists only of steps that conserve well-formedness, and they need not be any less convenient than using templates.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084926\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084926\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:16:35\">2005-09-26T04:16:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.</blockquote>\nAristotle:  Now here's where I think certain templating technologies get interesting, and may Do the Right Thing.  My so-far-favorite templating kit, ZPT, wants well-formed XML as templates--although I think that restriction is unfortunately relaxed as a nod to HTML.  On the other hand, my possibly-new-favorite templating kit, Kid, [demands well-formed XML as templates](http://lesscode.org/projects/kid/wiki/KidFaq#must-templates-be-well-formed-xml).\nIn case you haven't played with them, these two template languages center around the idea that certain attributes on elements define where content provided in a data structure should be inserted / swapped in by the template engine.  The engine handles character encodings and such to ensure that the well-formed template results in a well-formed document.\nDoes this match up with what you say up there?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084928\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084928\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:28:49\">2005-09-26T04:28:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I guess the other thing that bugs me about constructing documents via DOM or via generating SAX events—which I'd first discovered in <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/12/py-xml.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this XML.com article by Uche Ogbuji</a>—is how awkward and removed it is from the view-source XML I've gotten used to hacking around with.

I confess I actually kind of liked <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI.pm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CGI.pm</a> &#8211; because nesting is automatically taken care of without so much typing of end tags, and you can seamlessly weave <code>map</code>s into the code for output loops.\nI have to note though that I used it as a sort of template language in its own right &#8211; I never littered <code>print</code>s all over my code, I kept all the calls in a single place, in fact, usually a single expression. That is also why I find it strange that people create template languages for PHP, which was itself born as a template language. What matters is that the output generation is separate from the processing logic, whether or not the template and the code are in different languages.\nAnyway, I digress.\nWhat I wanted to say is, no, I hadn&#8217;t seen either ZPT or Kid.

Problem is, I haven't gotten much closer now, but I figured I'd at least post a few thoughts and conjure up a vague sketch of the issue.\r\n\r\nYou see, I think it all goes back to [thoughts about which I posted almost three years ago][lazy].  On the one hand, producing something like XML using \"proper\" DOM invocations and handwavings seems like the \"correct\" thing to do.  Yet, on the other hand, using a templating system lets me get down to business much more quickly and with much more clarity and succinct code.  \r\n\r\nYeah, templates provide a range of flexibility sufficient to aim the barrel at your own toes, while an API like the XML DOM keeps everything on the rails--but sometimes you know where you're going and don't need the rails to get you there.  Furthermore, isn't it possible to make a template system that Does The Right Thing?\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's rather apparent that I'm solidly in favor of templates:  After all, a book of mine just hit the shelves which is just rife with template-based generation of RSS and Atom feeds.  \r\n\r\nMy only issue, really, is that I feel vaguely guilty about it.\r\n\r\n[lazy]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/12/13/oooced\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084924\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=821395fe70906c8290df7f18ac4ac6cf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">rick</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084924\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T02:27:37\">2005-09-26T02:27:37</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Ruby has the nice Builder module for this (http://builder.rubyforge.org/).

In both cases this can be done with or without the involvement of a serialiser as middle man.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to make sure that the entire toolchain from one end to the other consists only of steps that conserve well-formedness, and they need not be any less convenient than using templates.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084926\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084926\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:16:35\">2005-09-26T04:16:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.</blockquote>\nAristotle:  Now here's where I think certain templating technologies get interesting, and may Do the Right Thing.  My so-far-favorite templating kit, ZPT, wants well-formed XML as templates--although I think that restriction is unfortunately relaxed as a nod to HTML.  On the other hand, my possibly-new-favorite templating kit, Kid, [demands well-formed XML as templates](http://lesscode.org/projects/kid/wiki/KidFaq#must-templates-be-well-formed-xml).\n\nIn case you haven't played with them, these two template languages center around the idea that certain attributes on elements define where content provided in a data structure should be inserted / swapped in by the template engine.  The engine handles character encodings and such to ensure that the well-formed template results in a well-formed document.\n\nDoes this match up with what you say up there?</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084928\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084928\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:28:49\">2005-09-26T04:28:49</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">I guess the other thing that bugs me about constructing documents via DOM or via generating SAX events—which I'd first discovered in <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/12/py-xml.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this XML.com article by Uche Ogbuji</a>—is how awkward and removed it is from the view-source XML I've gotten used to hacking around with.

I confess I actually kind of liked <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI.pm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CGI.pm</a> &#8211; because nesting is automatically taken care of without so much typing of end tags, and you can seamlessly weave <code>map</code>s into the code for output loops.\n\nI have to note though that I used it as a sort of template language in its own right &#8211; I never littered <code>print</code>s all over my code, I kept all the calls in a single place, in fact, usually a single expression. That is also why I find it strange that people create template languages for PHP, which was itself born as a template language. What matters is that the output generation is separate from the processing logic, whether or not the template and the code are in different languages.\n\nAnyway, I digress.\n\nWhat I wanted to say is, no, I hadn&#8217;t seen either ZPT or Kid.

Logic and presentation in separate blocks / files / etc.  And then, my take is that if you're going to have your presentation/view separate from the logic/controller, you may as well code the presentation in a form as close to the goal as possible (ie. in XML or HTML, not in s-expressions or the logic implementation idiom)—especially since oftimes you've got separate people or teams working primarily on each.\n\nI suspect, however, that a templating system like Kid goes quite a ways toward solving the problem of \"gluing strings together\".  I almost wish it had been further along / I'd been more aware of it before I'd reinvented my own wheels for my book using Python string templates and funky map classes.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084932\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=abfc88b96ae18c85ba7aac3bded2ec5e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/\">Ryan Tomayko</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084932\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T19:00:44\">2005-09-26T19:00:44</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>I suspect, however, that a templating system like Kid goes quite a ways toward solving the problem of “gluing strings together”.</blockquote>\n\nThat's the idea.

Again.  True, life itself has been pretty busy lately.  The days are booked, the weekends have been filling up--and in spare moments I&#39;ve been obsessed with <a href=\"http://www.hulkgames.com/us/\" title=\"THE INCREDIBLE HULK: ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION\">jumping from building to building</a>.  But, when it comes down to me and a pile of code on the screen, I find myself in ever further depths of recursion.</p>\n<p>For instance, I keep meaning to get down to posting some <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Asides\">lightweight &quot;asides&quot;</a> in place of my old <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/08/12/quick-and-random-thoughts\">&quot;quick bullets&quot;</a> posts I was doing.  But, of course, before I do that, I want to do some <a href=\"http://www.kottke.org/03/11/kottke-redesign\">Kottkesque template mungeing</a> to more properly present these smaller bits.  </p>\n<p>And, though I&#39;m actually most of the way done making another rev to the theme here, I also want to fold my linkblog back into the site.  The absence of these <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/12/redesigninprogress#comment-1850\">has already been noticed</a>, so I&#39;d like to give those a proper treatment.</p>\n<p>In addition, I still mean to start pimping my new book a bit; maybe even starting tonight.  I&#39;ve got a notion to post teasers highlighting a few of my favorite things.  And then, of course, there&#39;s the <a href=\"http://www.hackingfeeds.com/blog/\">neglected companion site</a> on which I&#39;ve yet to spend much time at all.  But I&#39;ve got grand plans, including some which go beyond the book itself and toward making <a href=\"http://www.hackingfeeds.com/blog/\">hackingfeeds.com</a> a regularly updated and relevant resource.</p>\n<p>Speaking of that...  I&#39;ve also continued working a bit with some feed hacks since finishing the book.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/feedspool/\">FeedSpool</a> is one of these: I&#39;ve revived some of FeedReactor&#39;s old code--this time aiming for a much higher degree of simplicity, trying to stick with standard Python modules, and dumping the database altogether.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to make a more formal announcement about this thing, once it&#39;s a bit more in usable shape.  In a nutshell:  It polls feeds and downloads the data.  New entries are split out into individual files, like an email or usenet spool.  That&#39;s it.  Other programs are expected to do the clever bits.</p>\n<p>And, to go along with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/feedspool/\">FeedSpool</a>, I&#39;ve been toying with building a Spotlight importer for OS X Tiger which indexes RSS and Atom feeds and entries.

    "body": "Well, of course I've lapsed pretty much right back into silence after [having shaken this place up][redesign] and [having announced the arrival of the book][book].\r\n\r\nThe culprit, of course, is [yak shaving][yak].  Again.  True, life itself has been pretty busy lately.  The days are booked, the weekends have been filling up--and in spare moments I've been obsessed with [jumping from building to building][hulk].  But, when it comes down to me and a pile of code on the screen, I find myself in ever further depths of recursion.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I keep meaning to get down to posting some [lightweight \"asides\"][asides] in place of my old [\"quick bullets\"][quick] posts I was doing.  But, of course, before I do that, I want to do some [Kottkesque template mungeing][kottke] to more properly present these smaller bits.  \r\n\r\nAnd, though I'm actually most of the way done making another rev to the theme here, I also want to fold my linkblog back into the site.  The absence of these [has already been noticed][noticed], so I'd like to give those a proper treatment.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I still mean to start pimping my new book a bit; maybe even starting tonight.  I've got a notion to post teasers highlighting a few of my favorite things.  And then, of course, there's the [neglected companion site][hackingfeeds] on which I've yet to spend much time at all.  But I've got grand plans, including some which go beyond the book itself and toward making [hackingfeeds.com][hackingfeeds] a regularly updated and relevant resource.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of that...  I've also continued working a bit with some feed hacks since finishing the book.  \r\n\r\n[FeedSpool][feedspool] is one of these: I've revived some of FeedReactor's old code--this time aiming for a much higher degree of simplicity, trying to stick with standard Python modules, and dumping the database altogether.  \r\n\r\nI've been meaning to make a more formal announcement about this thing, once it's a bit more in usable shape.  In a nutshell:  It polls feeds and downloads the data.  New entries are split out into individual files, like an email or usenet spool.  That's it.  Other programs are expected to do the clever bits.\r\n\r\nAnd, to go along with [FeedSpool][feedspool], I've been toying with building a Spotlight importer for OS X Tiger which indexes RSS and Atom feeds and entries.  Not in Subversion yet, and not nearly ready for public consumption, but it's been pretty fun to play with.  (And I totally forgot just how many feeds I have lying around on my hard drive!)\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's enough for now.

Well, lookee what landed on my doorstep late Friday afternoon--my author copies!</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog_attachments/IMG_3554-1.JPG\" onclick=\"window.open('http://www.decafbad.com/blog_attachments/IMG_3554-1.JPG','popup','width=1024,height=768,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false\"><img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog_attachments/IMG_3554-1-tm.jpg\" height=\"253\" width=\"337\" border=\"1\" align=\"middle\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Cue the angelic chorus\" title=\"Cue the angelic chorus\" /></a>\n</p>\n\n<p>This package was actually supposed to have been delivered on Thursday.  But, much to my consternation, I wasn&#39;t present to sign for the package.  But now, I&#39;ve got the surreal experience of holding a bound volume of around 600 pages with my name on the cover.  And inside?  There&#39;s all this stuff that once appeared on my PowerBook screen in MS Word and Terminal windows.  (Oh yeah, and there&#39;re a few photos of my iPod thrown in for good measure.)</p>\n<p>Funny thing is, this process started for me back in late <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/12/\">December 2004</a>.  But, you&#39;d barely know it, because--for whatever reason--I started off pretty cagey about the whole thing, and then plunged headlong into the effort.  I did manage to make <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/07/belated-happy-new-year\">a quick announcement of authorship</a>, but thereafter only managed to emerge for a few <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/02/19/writing-no-things-of-epic-import\">quick thought dumps</a>.</p>\n<p>I think part of my silence about things stemmed from a reticence to talk about or promise anything before I&#39;d written it--and also because this has been my first time doing anything like this and I didn&#39;t want to flub anything up along the way.  How I might&#39;ve done that, who knows?  But, I got a bit too busy to really worry about superstitions as the deadlines rolled on.</p>\n<p>But now, it&#39;s out!

Today, there&#39;s lots of support for it, and it&#39;s even found its way into browsers.  But, well, it still doesn&#39;t solve the problem of people clicking on those darn candy-like <img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/images/xml.gif\" /> buttons.</p>\n<p>So, then some folks came up with <a href=\"http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/06/feeddemon_and_t.html\">a new feed:// protocol for feed URLs</a>.  It seems there&#39;s just too much <a href=\"http://pirate.typepad.com/blog/2003/09/problems_with_m.html\">gone wrong with MIME types</a> and the like.  When I first heard of feed://, I thought it was a weird and ugly hack, but I never piped up because I was too busy at the time, didn&#39;t know much of the details, and was too busy to be bothered to catch up.  Besides, other people were <a href=\"http://alpha-geek.com/2004/09/20/inelegant\">grousing about it</a> already.  And, later, I saw that a slew of aggregators were supporting it, so I figured it must not have been that bad, although I still thought it was odd to kludge around a new URL &quot;protocol&quot; just to pass a feed URL to an aggregator.</p>\n<p>But, in the comment above, Phil makes a suggestion that seems ideal to me.  Don&#39;t link to feeds directly, don&#39;t use a funky protocol, link to a &quot;playlist&quot; of feeds.  URLs linking to MP3 playlists (ie. the <a href=\"http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=65772\">informally specified</a> M3U and PLS files) seem to get tossed and handled just fine by your preferred media player.  I don&#39;t even know how the MIME-type situation is handled with M3U or PLS links, but it seems to work just fine nonetheless.</p>\n<p>And, wasn&#39;t there this <a href=\"http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/rsd\">Really Simple Discovery</a> thing published a long time ago?  Point a weblog management tool at your site, it looks for <code>rsd.xml</code>, and it gets all the funky URLs it needs for web services from there?</p>\n<p>What if we circled back around with <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery\">autodiscovery</a> and published a file like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;feeds xmlns=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2005/01/feeds&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; title=&quot;Full RSS&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/index.rdf&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot; title=&quot;Full Atom&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/atom.xml&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; title=&quot;Blog-only RSS&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/index.rdf&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot; title=&quot;Blog-only Atom&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/atom.xml&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; title=&quot;Links-only RSS&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/links/index.rdf&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot; title=&quot;Links-only Atom&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/links/atom.xml&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/feeds&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Name it something like <code>feeds.fss</code>, link your candy-like buttons to it, and register applications to handle that extension.  Give it a MIME-type, and handle that too.  Sounds just like M3U and PLS files, to me.  Someone tell me why this is a dumb idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>:  Just to clarify, <a href=\"http://jaeger.blogmatrix.com/weblog/archives/2005_01.shtml#003186\">before anyone thinks</a> I&#39;m just railing against Dave Winer personally--I made a comment below about not liking OPML.

Since there is no path, the server typically returns a home page as some prespecified page or by redirection.\nTo find the feed playlist, the browser could do a default GET on the URL with an accept MIME type of \"application/atom+xml\" (which is already registered). The browser does not need to know the name of the file or its extension - it just needs to know the server and the MIME type.\nThe file returned by a default GET with an accept type of application/atom+xml would be the \"feed list\" for the site.

You're looking at the page, mouse hovering over a link to the feed, and you want to click on it, hoping it'll do the right thing.\nSo, really, you wouldn't ever need to autodiscover a \"playlist\".  If you want autodiscovery, put the playlist contents in the HTML head tag.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

Today, there's lots of support for it, and it's even found its way into browsers.  But, well, it still doesn't solve the problem of people clicking on those darn candy-like <img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/images/xml.gif\" /> buttons.\r\n\r\nSo, then some folks came up with [a new feed:// protocol for feed URLs][feed].  It seems there's just too much [gone wrong with MIME types][mimewrong] and the like.  When I first heard of feed://, I thought it was a weird and ugly hack, but I never piped up because I was too busy at the time, didn't know much of the details, and was too busy to be bothered to catch up.  Besides, other people were [grousing about it][grouse] already.  And, later, I saw that a slew of aggregators were supporting it, so I figured it must not have been that bad, although I still thought it was odd to kludge around a new URL \"protocol\" just to pass a feed URL to an aggregator.\r\n\r\nBut, in the comment above, Phil makes a suggestion that seems ideal to me.  Don't link to feeds directly, don't use a funky protocol, link to a \"playlist\" of feeds.  URLs linking to MP3 playlists (ie. the [informally specified][winamp] M3U and PLS files) seem to get tossed and handled just fine by your preferred media player.  I don't even know how the MIME-type situation is handled with M3U or PLS links, but it seems to work just fine nonetheless.\r\n\r\nAnd, wasn't there this [Really Simple Discovery][rsd] thing published a long time ago?  Point a weblog management tool at your site, it looks for `rsd.xml`, and it gets all the funky URLs it needs for web services from there?\r\n\r\nWhat if we circled back around with [autodiscovery][autodiscovery] and published a file like this:\r\n\r\n    <feeds xmlns=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/01/feeds\">\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" title=\"Full RSS\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/index.rdf\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/atom+xml\" title=\"Full Atom\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/atom.xml\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" title=\"Blog-only RSS\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/index.rdf\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/atom+xml\" title=\"Blog-only Atom\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/atom.xml\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" title=\"Links-only RSS\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/links/index.rdf\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/atom+xml\" title=\"Links-only Atom\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/links/atom.xml\" />\r\n    </feeds>\r\n    \r\nName it something like `feeds.fss`, link your candy-like buttons to it, and register applications to handle that extension.  Give it a MIME-type, and handle that too.  Sounds just like M3U and PLS files, to me.  Someone tell me why this is a dumb idea.\r\n\r\n**Update**:  Just to clarify, [before anyone thinks][anyone] I'm just railing against Dave Winer personally--I made a comment below about not liking OPML.  Well, I don't, at least not for this particular purpose.  But, my preferences aside, it's undeniable that most aggregators support OPML import/export in one form or another, so the above example could probably be expressed as OPML with all the same data.\r\n\r\nJust one thing, though (and this is part of why I don't like OPML for this):  On my machine, OPML outlines and files with an \".opml\" extension open with OmniOutliner.

Personally, I'd rather avoid OPML and re-use what we have for autodiscovery headers.  I wouldn't necessarily want to see this file used *literally* like a playlist or an OPML subscription list.  \r\n\r\nUsually OPML is used for wholesale import/export of your subscriptions, whereas autodiscovery headers tend to be used to provide a choice.  \r\n\r\nNot that OPML couldn't be used this way, too, but I do have to admit I don't like OPML much.

I certainly see a trivial \"pop up those titles in a list, when the user selects one, throw it at the configured reader\" app, if that format is nailed down I might toss one together...\r\n\r\nThe key is to have a well-known-extension *and* a mime type, so that both lame tools and Proper ones can do the right thing. (The extension can't be OPML of course, because it is the *verb*, but I don't care what syntax is used as long as it has a human readable label...)  Oh, and that extension should replace XML on the candy buttons - because the word XML has \"always\" been wrong, in that it made about much sense as saying \"ASCII\" or \"UTF-8\" there - but it *did* make the value of candy-like buttons really really clear, and it deserves credit for that...\r\n\r\nFSS will do, I don't see it in my local (aggressively updated debian) mime.types at least -- there's some artistic value in having it be \".feed\" instead though...</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090364\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090364\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-13T18:43:02\">2005-01-13T18:43:02</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Jim: A browser plugin - who'd install that? :)\r\n\r\nDid you have to install a browser plugin the last time you clicked on the URL to a streaming station to make it startup in WinAmp or iTunes?

It would be a bit like having a greeting card printing program register itself as the handler for all JPEGs.\r\n\r\nFunny thing about this idea, though: after I mentioned Atom being able to do mime-type handling, with a link rel=\"start\" included in the feed, I looked at the current version of the format spec, and it seems to not do that, but instead has a link to a separate introspection file, which is basically an Atom playlist.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090366\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=769084f2da2ebbc1e483af3f0e72adaa&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Jim</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090366\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-13T22:59:38\">2005-01-13T22:59:38</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">> A browser plugin - who’d install that?\r\n\r\nThe aggregator installer.\r\n\r\nThe only trouble I can imagine with the plugin idea is if different aggregators all wanted to install their own plugin.

Since there is no path, the server typically returns a home page as some prespecified page or by redirection.\r\n\r\nTo find the feed playlist, the browser could do a default GET on the URL with an accept MIME type of \"application/atom+xml\" (which is already registered). The browser does not need to know the name of the file or its extension - it just needs to know the server and the MIME type.\r\n\r\nThe file returned by a default GET with an accept type of application/atom+xml would be the \"feed list\" for the site. These are really the \"atom endpoints\" and is nothing more than an Atom feed with links pointing to the feeds and services on the site.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090370\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb7f2a3ba74af37415ab7df101a86c75&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090370\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-17T11:51:40\">2005-01-17T11:51:40</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Well, the thing about a \"playlist\" versus autodiscovery is this: \r\n\r\nWith autodiscovery, you give your aggregator the human-readable entry point ot a page and the aggregator uses various methods to find the feed.\r\n\r\nWith a \"playlist\" or feed:// or MIME types, you've already done the discovery work for the aggregator.  You're looking at the page, mouse hovering over a link to the feed, and you want to click on it, hoping it'll do the right thing.\r\n\r\nSo, really, you wouldn't ever need to autodiscover a \"playlist\".  If you want autodiscovery, put the playlist contents in the HTML head tag.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

But note that \"the judgment did not specifically prohibit 2600 from providing non-hyperlinked URLs of web sites that provide DeCSS\", which is why you'll find non-hyperlinked URLs at the end of, for example, some New York Times articles.\r\n\r\n[1] http://gsulaw.gsu.edu/lawand/papers/fa00/weiland/</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089741\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.DetroitWonk.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fffd82dd155e2315ef424947df052e21&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.DetroitWonk.com\">Ray</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089741\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-12T04:58:49\">2006-01-12T04:58:49</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Umm...Lutz has been blogging on FastLane for like...I dunno...half a year now?

    "html": "<p>I&#39;m a complete neophyte when it comes to machine learning, but I&#39;d like to get into learning more about the field in general.  In particular, I&#39;d like to make my news aggregator smarter.  I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/08/16/bayes_agg_one\">already tried using SpamBayes</a>, but that didn&#39;t make me happy.  Whether it was my approach or whether it was that Bayes itself is not suited toward this task, I&#39;m not sure, though I suspect it&#39;s a little of both.</p>\n<p>It seems like the magic Bayesian pixie dust works well for spam-vs-ham in my email box, so why shouldn&#39;t the magic for interesting-vs-yawn work for my aggregator firehose?    Well, here are the issues I&#39;m guessing at:</p>\n<p>In the case of spam-vs-ham, you want to classify things into this or that-- that which is kept, and that which is tossed away.  But in the case of items in my aggregator, I want a relative sort order or a score.  I want a fuzzy guess toward my interest with which to inform presentation of items.  Interesting-vs-yawn is more of a continuum than a pair of buckets.</p>\n<p>And then, there&#39;s the passive gathering of behavioral data from my interactions with the aggregator, because I&#39;m sure as hell not going to click ratings or thumbs-up/down all day.  In spam-vs-ham, I could build up two clean mailboxes for training the categorizer, with one containing all spam and the other all ham.  But, in the case of my aggregator, the only thing I&#39;m tracking are items in which I showed interest by revealing more information or by clicking through.  </p>\n<p>So, I can say that a particular pile of items are all interesting.  But, my interest level for the rest of the items received is a complete unknown-- maybe I&#39;m vehemently disinterested in those 50 items, but maybe I just never got around to looking at those other 20 and just let them fall off my date range for display.  Thus, I have a pile of ham, and a pile of undifferentiated unknown.  I&#39;m not bothering to provide any cues as to whether I <em>don&#39;t</em> like something, because that&#39;d be boring work-- I mean, I <em>am</em> disinterested in those items, after all.  So, I&#39;d like to leverage what the system knows from what I care to provide, but not jump to any conclusions about the items in the unknown pile.  There is no spam, only various flavors of ham.</p>\n<p>Given all this, then, is there anyone out there who knows more about machine learning than me who could maybe point me toward a better approach or algorithm that fits this profile?</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=further_smart_aggregator_musings</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088785\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088785\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-07T17:52:19\">2004-12-07T17:52:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">There's a package called Reverend out there, which is a Bayesian filter not specialized for spam.  It might be worth looking at.\nAlso, in training the system should tell you what it thinks you'll think, and then you'll correct it if it's wrong.  Without this you can overtrain, creating a continual positive feedback, where all you want is a corrective feedback.\nOTOH, there's rating systems, like (I think) on Amazon.  There they correlate your ratings to  other people's ratings.  There you can usefully rate anything, because determining your correlated users is separate from the rating it actually presents you -- it's not determining your preference, simply your demographic.  Bloglines could do this (and they try a little), but you couldn't in isolation.

Hmmm. The problems with bayes spam/ham sorting for news readers is down to the simplistic stats. The most simplistic statistical measure to take is on individual words.\nFor normal email spam/ham there are (or moreover, were) words that stood out as good/bad markers. But in something like an rss feed where you have already selected feeds that are reasonably close to your interest set, the individual words are no longer useful for sorting interesting vs yawn. \nAs you can probably tell, I had a go at doing this for an AI course I did last semester, and I wound up with a furball that didn't actually fly. I used python and wxpy to build an aggregator around an IE control with good/bad buttons for marking, my word distributions didn't wind up correlating. \nIs your aggregator open for hacking? I have a few theories that I'd like to testbed, and now owning a mac, my old code is nigh on useless :-)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088788\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.srijith.net/trinetre/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=71daea6c5696489ec1f7dd8efa55e2f2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.srijith.net/trinetre/\">Srijith</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088788\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T11:00:05\">2004-12-13T11:00:05</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Machine learning is not within my list of \"do-know-something\" areas, but I could suggest a bit of commensense logic to the system to learn from uninterested items. The fact that an item is uninteresting is denoted by the propertiy that you have not clicked on it. While one may not be able to deduce much pattern from a single item as such, it could be used to deduce useful information about the metadata associated with the item. For example, I found that I was reading less and less of items from blogger X's feed. There were days at a stretch where I would not find anything written by X interesting enough. If a cron job was run that could look through the last time I read any of X's item, it could have noticed this trend and thus lowered X's score, thus pushing his item below my \"casual-glance-view\". While doing this alone would cause one to miss a very interesting item  that X could write in a blue moon, if one uses other metadata associated with the feed item (like keyworkds etc.), it could be brought within my \"casual-glance-view\".\nIntellie-Aggie tries to use these logics to filter out items, but I have left the codes untouched for far too long to expect any wonders.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088789\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.drunkenblog.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=383b6331d8326615511cff5c243873fa&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.drunkenblog.com\">drunkenbatman</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088789\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T16:40:49\">2004-12-13T16:40:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I'm hoping that aggregators will get smarter too, because due to the info-glut RSS enables the computer is just going to have to get smarter about having a guess as to what we're going to be interested in.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088790\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.oshineye.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=199f0940163b371d85d1b18510e1d53d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.oshineye.com\">ade</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088790\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-28T17:27:18\">2004-12-28T17:27:18</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Take a look at my Aggrevator: http://www.oshineye.com/software/aggrevator.html\nwhich uses scoring to enable users to deal with very large numbers of feeds.

    "body": "I'm a complete neophyte when it comes to machine learning, but I'd like to get into learning more about the field in general.  In particular, I'd like to make my news aggregator smarter.  I've [already tried using SpamBayes](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/08/16/bayes_agg_one), but that didn't make me happy.  Whether it was my approach or whether it was that Bayes itself is not suited toward this task, I'm not sure, though I suspect it's a little of both.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the magic Bayesian pixie dust works well for spam-vs-ham in my email box, so why shouldn't the magic for interesting-vs-yawn work for my aggregator firehose?    Well, here are the issues I'm guessing at:\r\n\r\nIn the case of spam-vs-ham, you want to classify things into this or that-- that which is kept, and that which is tossed away.  But in the case of items in my aggregator, I want a relative sort order or a score.  I want a fuzzy guess toward my interest with which to inform presentation of items.  Interesting-vs-yawn is more of a continuum than a pair of buckets.\r\n\r\nAnd then, there's the passive gathering of behavioral data from my interactions with the aggregator, because I'm sure as hell not going to click ratings or thumbs-up/down all day.  In spam-vs-ham, I could build up two clean mailboxes for training the categorizer, with one containing all spam and the other all ham.  But, in the case of my aggregator, the only thing I'm tracking are items in which I showed interest by revealing more information or by clicking through.  \r\n\r\nSo, I can say that a particular pile of items are all interesting.  But, my interest level for the rest of the items received is a complete unknown-- maybe I'm vehemently disinterested in those 50 items, but maybe I just never got around to looking at those other 20 and just let them fall off my date range for display.  Thus, I have a pile of ham, and a pile of undifferentiated unknown.  I'm not bothering to provide any cues as to whether I *don't* like something, because that'd be boring work-- I mean, I *am* disinterested in those items, after all.  So, I'd like to leverage what the system knows from what I care to provide, but not jump to any conclusions about the items in the unknown pile.  There is no spam, only various flavors of ham.\r\n\r\nGiven all this, then, is there anyone out there who knows more about machine learning than me who could maybe point me toward a better approach or algorithm that fits this profile?\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=further_smart_aggregator_musings\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088785\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088785\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-07T17:52:19\">2004-12-07T17:52:19</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">There's a package called Reverend out there, which is a Bayesian filter not specialized for spam.  It might be worth looking at.\r\n\r\nAlso, in training the system should tell you what it thinks you'll think, and then you'll correct it if it's wrong.  Without this you can overtrain, creating a continual positive feedback, where all you want is a corrective feedback.\r\n\r\nOTOH, there's rating systems, like (I think) on Amazon.  There they correlate your ratings to  other people's ratings.  There you can usefully rate anything, because determining your correlated users is separate from the rating it actually presents you -- it's not determining your preference, simply your demographic.  Bloglines could do this (and they try a little), but you couldn't in isolation.

Hmmm. The problems with bayes spam/ham sorting for news readers is down to the simplistic stats. The most simplistic statistical measure to take is on individual words.\r\n\r\nFor normal email spam/ham there are (or moreover, were) words that stood out as good/bad markers. But in something like an rss feed where you have already selected feeds that are reasonably close to your interest set, the individual words are no longer useful for sorting interesting vs yawn. \r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, I had a go at doing this for an AI course I did last semester, and I wound up with a furball that didn't actually fly. I used python and wxpy to build an aggregator around an IE control with good/bad buttons for marking, my word distributions didn't wind up correlating. \r\n\r\nIs your aggregator open for hacking?

    "html": "<p>So, like I was saying:  I&#39;ve been working on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/kwiki?FeedReactor\">FeedReactor</a> and have been doing some things with it that I find rather interesting, independent of news aggregation.  </p>\n<p>One of the core goals I have for FeedReactor is to explore what it takes to build a web app that exploits <a href=\"http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html\">principles of REST architecture</a>.  Having already <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooccb\">sung the praises</a> of XML-RPC, I wanted to get immersed in REST and see what all the hubbub was about.  I&#39;ve got some ways to go, but I think I understand the major concepts now, and it&#39;s a pretty nifty frame within which to work.</p>\n<p>But, two other things I&#39;ve added to my mix have really made things interesting for me:  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>XSLT filtering</li>\n<li>The XmlHTTPRequest object</li>\n</ol>\n<p>XSLT and REST make a really good pair, as <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1\">Amazon Web Services already demonstrate</a>.  Inspired by that API (<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/02/xsl_scraper\">and earlier experiments</a>), I use XML for all the input and output formats in my API and accept a query string parameter that contains the path to an XSLT file.  When this parameter is supplied, the XML output by the API is first processed using the given XSLT.  (Think of it like piping API output through <code>xsltproc</code>.)</p>\n<p>So, with a properly constructed collection of XSLT, I can present a browser-viewable HTML user interface served up directly from REST API calls.  Links, frame sets, and iframes present in the HTML lead the user from that call to the next XSLT-wrapped REST API call. </p>\n<p>But, once the initial HTML-and-JavaScript payload reaches the browser, it gets better (<a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/10/22/43OPstrategic_1.html\">ala Gmail</a>):  </p>\n<p>On older browsers (if I happen to care about them), I can make new HTTP requests back to the server <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/iframe.html\">from JavaScript using iframes</a>.  In this case, XSLT filtering lets me retrofit the API&#39;s responses to the HTML-and-JavaScript crud I need to serve up to make things happen back in the browser client.  Unfortunately, passing data <em>to</em> the API (which expects XML, not form submissions) is still a bit wonky and requires some hacks and exceptions involving hidden forms and such.</p>\n<p>However, on the newer browsers, it&#39;s all about the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html\">XmlHTTPRequest object</a>.  With this facility, I can make clean asynchronous requests back to the REST API, including XML data in the request body if I feel like it.  Responses are handled by JavaScript callbacks, which twiddle the browser DOM to update the user interface in response.  </p>\n<p>So, after the major initial contact with the API to supply the browser with HTML by way of XSLT, most future interactions take place in the form of direct calls to the REST API using XML.  Although for some things, it&#39;s easier to just reload a page of HTML, it&#39;s nicer for most interactions to be handled via DOM manipulations in-place.  I&#39;ve been amazed at the Gmail-like responsiveness I get from FeedReactor when I&#39;m skimming through news items, marking some as seen or flagged, and popping open the descriptions on others.  </p>\n<p>I suppose I <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be amazed at the responsiveness, since I&#39;m using some of the same techniques as Gmail.

    "body": "So, like I was saying:  I've been working on [FeedReactor](http://www.decafbad.com/kwiki?FeedReactor) and have been doing some things with it that I find rather interesting, independent of news aggregation.  \r\n\r\nOne of the core goals I have for FeedReactor is to explore what it takes to build a web app that exploits [principles of REST architecture](http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html).  Having already [sung the praises](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooccb) of XML-RPC, I wanted to get immersed in REST and see what all the hubbub was about.  I've got some ways to go, but I think I understand the major concepts now, and it's a pretty nifty frame within which to work.\r\n\r\nBut, two other things I've added to my mix have really made things interesting for me:  \r\n\r\n1. XSLT filtering\r\n2. The XmlHTTPRequest object\r\n\r\nXSLT and REST make a really good pair, as [Amazon Web Services already demonstrate](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1).  Inspired by that API ([and earlier experiments](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/02/xsl_scraper)), I use XML for all the input and output formats in my API and accept a query string parameter that contains the path to an XSLT file.  When this parameter is supplied, the XML output by the API is first processed using the given XSLT.  (Think of it like piping API output through `xsltproc`.)\r\n\r\nSo, with a properly constructed collection of XSLT, I can present a browser-viewable HTML user interface served up directly from REST API calls.  Links, frame sets, and iframes present in the HTML lead the user from that call to the next XSLT-wrapped REST API call. \r\n\r\nBut, once the initial HTML-and-JavaScript payload reaches the browser, it gets better ([ala Gmail](http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/10/22/43OPstrategic_1.html)):  \r\n\r\nOn older browsers (if I happen to care about them), I can make new HTTP requests back to the server [from JavaScript using iframes](http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/iframe.html).  In this case, XSLT filtering lets me retrofit the API's responses to the HTML-and-JavaScript crud I need to serve up to make things happen back in the browser client.  Unfortunately, passing data *to* the API (which expects XML, not form submissions) is still a bit wonky and requires some hacks and exceptions involving hidden forms and such.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the newer browsers, it's all about the [XmlHTTPRequest object](http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html).  With this facility, I can make clean asynchronous requests back to the REST API, including XML data in the request body if I feel like it.  Responses are handled by JavaScript callbacks, which twiddle the browser DOM to update the user interface in response.  \r\n\r\nSo, after the major initial contact with the API to supply the browser with HTML by way of XSLT, most future interactions take place in the form of direct calls to the REST API using XML.  Although for some things, it's easier to just reload a page of HTML, it's nicer for most interactions to be handled via DOM manipulations in-place.  I've been amazed at the Gmail-like responsiveness I get from FeedReactor when I'm skimming through news items, marking some as seen or flagged, and popping open the descriptions on others.  \r\n\r\nI suppose I *shouldn't* be amazed at the responsiveness, since I'm using some of the same techniques as Gmail.  However, my daily-use installation of FeedReactor is presently running on an old 300Mhz Debian Linux PC at home, and it's taking me through the daily produce of 600 subscribed feeds faster than any desktop aggregator has yet.  Of course, this is partly a product of my familiarity with the UI I've cobbled together, but... *the server's running on a 300Mhz PC with 256MB of RAM!*  And the client is my 867Mhz G4 PowerBook, running Firefox or Safari, depending on my mood.\r\n\r\nAlthough I can't see when I'll have time for it, I really want to explore this approach further using desktop apps on OS X and accessing the API from Flash movies (maybe using [Laszlo](http://openlaszlo.org/)).  I'd also like to see how far I can go toward adapting the interface toward mobile devices like my Treo 600.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, this has been where most of my private hacking sessions have been taking me over the past year or so:  combining HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, XML, XSLT, and REST to build what I consider to be a next-generation web app.  \r\n\r\nNow, although I use FeedReactor on a daily basis to keep up with all my feeds, it's nowhere near any state suitable for public consumption.

Danah&#39;s writing about youth and feeds and intimate communication versus institutional communication resonates well with what I&#39;ve been tossing around in my head.</p>\n<p>When I was in high school, around about the time Ross Perot was getting into the presidential race, I remember putting a little item on my to-do list in my brand new day planner:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read the newspaper, watch the news.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I must&#39;ve been, what, 16 years old?  I suppose that would have made me one of the youths Danah&#39;s talking about, albeit of an earlier generation of online communicators.  At the time, the bulk of my disposable income earned as a grocery store bagger was spent on music CDs, gas, and the occasional upgrade to my Commodore Amiga.  I didn&#39;t even know was NPR was, though I knew there was this thing they did with news on the radio.  But newspapers and talk on the radio were things that my grandparents paid attention to, if anything.  </p>\n<p>The only reason I put that item on my to-do list--in fact, the only reason I even had a day planner with a to-do list in the first place--was because, according to the teachers trying to prepare me for college, this was what grownups did.  Planning your days and reading the news were things that adults did, and if I wanted to be an adult, I should get with the program.  And I wanted to get with the program, but I really didn&#39;t see the point yet.</p>\n<p>However, I did live most of my social life online.  Now, that needs a bit of qualification:  Of course, I am a big geek and many of my kind spend their days living in Mom&#39;s basement talking to men pretending to be 14-year-old girls.  But, back when I was first getting online, the main gateway for access was the dial-up BBS, preferably one that was a local call to your area code and prefix.  What that meant is that most of the people I was chatting with online were within a 16-year-old&#39;s parentally condoned driving radius.</p>\n<p>So, I never lived in the basement, and I <em>did</em> actually get out quite a bit.  The only real strange bit was that very few of my social group went to school together--and actually, most of us were misfits in school, some counting the minutes till we could get back to each other.  Having just finished Cory Doctorow&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.craphound.com/est/\"><em>Eastern Standard Tribe</em></a> (read on my Treo 600, my <em>comm</em>, no less), I can totally grok the tribes.  Mine was as small as an area code or two, rather than a time zone, but I had a tribe.  Still do, even though we&#39;ve since dispersed across many, many area codes.  Now there&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com\">LiveJournal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.xanga.com\">Xanga</a>, among other tribe-building technologies.</p>\n<p>But lately, in the past few years, I&#39;ve been changing.  I&#39;m only 29 now, but I&#39;ve learned what a day planner is for and my to-do list is crucial; I know enough about the news on TV not to watch it much, yet I pull in enormous volumes of news from online sources and magazines.  And, as I wrote earlier, NPR is now the only station on my radio dial.</p>\n<p>When I was 16, the presidential race was a curiosity about which I felt vague guilt for not knowing more. But, this time around I&#39;m giving it an attention and range of emotion akin to a rabid sports fan during playoffs.  I lost sleep over whether or not my voter registration was up to date with my correct address.  I do realize that for many, many reasons this particular presidential race is historic.  But I&#39;m a johnny-come-lately--there&#39;ve been historic presidential races before: history didn&#39;t start because I started paying attention.</p>\n<p>What&#39;s happened is that I&#39;ve changed.  If I could time-travel and stop by to say hello, my high-school-self would probably admire who I am now, but wouldn&#39;t quite understand me.  He&#39;d get the half-dozen IRC windows I have open, and the handful of IM windows I&#39;m floating at any particular moment, but I doubt he&#39;d get the lure of my news aggregator in the background.  I loved Jesus Jones at the time, but I didn&#39;t <em>really</em> know what it meant to be an <a href=\"http://www.jesusjonesarchive.com/lyrics.htm#Info%20Freako\">Info Freako</a>.</p>\n<p>What changed in me?  I&#39;m not quite sure.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something going on with hormones and the few grey hairs I have now.  But I think it has something to do with <em>actually</em> starting to become a grownup.  That is, I&#39;m paying taxes, I&#39;m acting in the world, I have responsibilities, and I&#39;ve left the shelter of my parents&#39; house.  All the way from elementary school through college, I was on rails, and there wasn&#39;t much I needed to know other than what they were teaching to get by.  Now, though, I&#39;m off the rails, and I feel I need all the information I can get, just to figure out how to navigate.  </p>\n<p>Maybe it&#39;s become obsessive, but I don&#39;t want to miss any vital data that will help lead me <a href=\"http://www.jcf.org/bliss.php\">toward my bliss</a>, to grow up without growing old.  And I know that, however small, my actions have consequence in the world, so I want to understand.  <a href=\"http://www.davidbrin.com/parting.html\">I am a member of a civilization.</a>  I think I get that now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So, anyway, if anything I&#39;m just underscoring with my own experience that usage divide between youth and older info freako adults Danah wrote about.  I&#39;ve been on both sides of it now, I think.  </p>\n<p>Where I think I disagree a bit is about trends: she asks if this Info Freako style of massive feed consumption will be relevant beyond the Web 2.0 crowd of today.  As an early adopter of a technologically-driven social life, I would have to guess that the current generation will produce some even more obsessive Info Freakos than the oldsters around today.  </p>\n<p>Because, if my own experience is any guide, we start off using the technology to talk to each other in tribes.  However, as (or, I guess, if) we grow up and become fully acting members of our civilization, we turn to the same sorts of tech to converse with the civilization itself.  Whether that will take the form of massive feed consumption, I don&#39;t know, because I have to assume the tech will be very much changed by then.

Danah's writing about youth and feeds and intimate communication versus institutional communication resonates well with what I've been tossing around in my head.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in high school, around about the time Ross Perot was getting into the presidential race, I remember putting a little item on my to-do list in my brand new day planner:\r\n\r\n* Read the newspaper, watch the news.\r\n\r\nI must've been, what, 16 years old?  I suppose that would have made me one of the youths Danah's talking about, albeit of an earlier generation of online communicators.  At the time, the bulk of my disposable income earned as a grocery store bagger was spent on music CDs, gas, and the occasional upgrade to my Commodore Amiga.  I didn't even know was NPR was, though I knew there was this thing they did with news on the radio.  But newspapers and talk on the radio were things that my grandparents paid attention to, if anything.  \r\n\r\nThe only reason I put that item on my to-do list--in fact, the only reason I even had a day planner with a to-do list in the first place--was because, according to the teachers trying to prepare me for college, this was what grownups did.  Planning your days and reading the news were things that adults did, and if I wanted to be an adult, I should get with the program.  And I wanted to get with the program, but I really didn't see the point yet.\r\n\r\nHowever, I did live most of my social life online.  Now, that needs a bit of qualification:  Of course, I am a big geek and many of my kind spend their days living in Mom's basement talking to men pretending to be 14-year-old girls.  But, back when I was first getting online, the main gateway for access was the dial-up BBS, preferably one that was a local call to your area code and prefix.  What that meant is that most of the people I was chatting with online were within a 16-year-old's parentally condoned driving radius.\r\n\r\nSo, I never lived in the basement, and I *did* actually get out quite a bit.  The only real strange bit was that very few of my social group went to school together--and actually, most of us were misfits in school, some counting the minutes till we could get back to each other.  Having just finished Cory Doctorow's [*Eastern Standard Tribe*][est] (read on my Treo 600, my *comm*, no less), I can totally grok the tribes.  Mine was as small as an area code or two, rather than a time zone, but I had a tribe.  Still do, even though we've since dispersed across many, many area codes.  Now there's [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com) and [Xanga](http://www.xanga.com), among other tribe-building technologies.\r\n\r\nBut lately, in the past few years, I've been changing.  I'm only 29 now, but I've learned what a day planner is for and my to-do list is crucial; I know enough about the news on TV not to watch it much, yet I pull in enormous volumes of news from online sources and magazines.  And, as I wrote earlier, NPR is now the only station on my radio dial.\r\n\r\nWhen I was 16, the presidential race was a curiosity about which I felt vague guilt for not knowing more. But, this time around I'm giving it an attention and range of emotion akin to a rabid sports fan during playoffs.  I lost sleep over whether or not my voter registration was up to date with my correct address.  I do realize that for many, many reasons this particular presidential race is historic.  But I'm a johnny-come-lately--there've been historic presidential races before: history didn't start because I started paying attention.\r\n\r\nWhat's happened is that I've changed.  If I could time-travel and stop by to say hello, my high-school-self would probably admire who I am now, but wouldn't quite understand me.  He'd get the half-dozen IRC windows I have open, and the handful of IM windows I'm floating at any particular moment, but I doubt he'd get the lure of my news aggregator in the background.  I loved Jesus Jones at the time, but I didn't *really* know what it meant to be an [Info Freako][infofreako].\r\n\r\nWhat changed in me?  I'm not quite sure.  I'm sure there's something going on with hormones and the few grey hairs I have now.  But I think it has something to do with *actually* starting to become a grownup.  That is, I'm paying taxes, I'm acting in the world, I have responsibilities, and I've left the shelter of my parents' house.  All the way from elementary school through college, I was on rails, and there wasn't much I needed to know other than what they were teaching to get by.  Now, though, I'm off the rails, and I feel I need all the information I can get, just to figure out how to navigate.  \r\n\r\nMaybe it's become obsessive, but I don't want to miss any vital data that will help lead me [toward my bliss][bliss], to grow up without growing old.  And I know that, however small, my actions have consequence in the world, so I want to understand.  [I am a member of a civilization.][memberciv]  I think I get that now.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nSo, anyway, if anything I'm just underscoring with my own experience that usage divide between youth and older info freako adults Danah wrote about.  I've been on both sides of it now, I think.  \r\n\r\nWhere I think I disagree a bit is about trends: she asks if this Info Freako style of massive feed consumption will be relevant beyond the Web 2.0 crowd of today.  As an early adopter of a technologically-driven social life, I would have to guess that the current generation will produce some even more obsessive Info Freakos than the oldsters around today.  \r\n\r\nBecause, if my own experience is any guide, we start off using the technology to talk to each other in tribes.  However, as (or, I guess, if) we grow up and become fully acting members of our civilization, we turn to the same sorts of tech to converse with the civilization itself.  Whether that will take the form of massive feed consumption, I don't know, because I have to assume the tech will be very much changed by then.  I can see the intimate communication habits progressing to civic and national and global communication habits, even in myself.  \r\n\r\nThe problem, though, is that once you start making ventures out of your tribe, you start running into the [limits of your neocortex][neocortex].  Communication must necessarily lose its intimacy and give way to group-to-group and one-to-many conversations.  That's where I see feeds coming in to supplement IM and email--though I certainly hope by then that there's a lot more intelligence behind feeds and microcontent routing and user interface, a lot of the principles will be the same.  \r\n\r\nBut, in any case, I think we're in for some interesting history coming up, as more youths used to texting each other take up roles as members of civilization.\r\n\r\n[neocortex]: http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/05/65/bbs00000565-00/bbs.dunbar.html\r\n[memberciv]: http://www.davidbrin.com/parting.html\r\n[bliss]: http://www.jcf.org/bliss.php\r\n[infofreako]: http://www.jesusjonesarchive.com/lyrics.htm#Info%20Freako\r\n[est]: http://www.craphound.com/est/\r\n[podhype]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/10/07/podcastinghype\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=allgrowedup\r\n",

Check it out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take one <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/10/podcasts.opml\">list of RSS feeds in OPML</a>.</li>\n<li>Throw in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/10/opml-to-playlist.xsl\">a bit of XSLT</a>.</li>\n<li>Combine using <code>xsltproc</code> to make <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/10/podcasts.pls\">a playlist</a> that works in iTunes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And, oh yeah, I just happen to have an <code>xsltproc</code> web service laying around, so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supply a URL to your OPML in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/10/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.decafbad.com%2F2004%2F10%2Fopml-to-playlist.xsl\">this form</a>.</li>\n<li>Get a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/10/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.decafbad.com%2F2004%2F10%2Fopml-to-playlist.xsl&amp;xml=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.decafbad.com%2F2004%2F10%2Fpodcasts.opml\">freshly-built playlist</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, this has been barely tested and is the product of a ten-minute hacking session.  There are likely an enormous number of things wrong with this.  That said, iTunes does seem to open the playlist happily, and it looks like only new streams are added with repeated openings of the playlist.</p>\n<p>You will want to be careful to ensure that your OPML is valid XML (mine wasn&apos;t, on initial export from iPodderX - escape those freaking ampersands in URLs already!), and I have no idea what would happen if any of the RSS feeds in your subscriptions turn up invalid.  </p>\n<p>Have I mentioned that, despite their unforgiving and sometimes fragile nature, I love XML technologies?</p>\n<p>If this looks useful, maybe I&apos;ll work it over a bit more and pair it up with some python to handle actually downloading the MP3s and torrents.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Oh yeah, and I&apos;m expecting this will be useful with an iTunes smart playlist crafted along these lines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date Added in the last 1 days</li>\n<li>Play Count is less than 1</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Update #2:</strong> Another use I just found for this playlist, is on my <a href=\"http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/\">Xbox Media Center</a>.  I generate this playlist via cronjob every few hours, and store it on an SMB share accessible to the XBMC.  Voila!  Listening to podcasts on my stereo system via the Xbox.  Yeah, nothing big, just kind of nifty.</p>\n"

Being a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/14/info_freako_or_whos_already_past_arguing_about_syndication_formats\">high-bandwidth Info Freako</a>, a feeling of time wasted comes upon me pretty quickly.  I can speed read and I want to get through this quickly, but I can&#39;t speed listen.  I want to throw a bookmark at <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">del.icio.us</a> if I like it, but I can&#39;t select any text.  Getting a bit bored, I start thinking about how maybe I might want to remix this crap, make a funky beat out of all the utterances of &#8220;um&#8221;, &#8220;ahh&#8221;, and &#8220;err&#8221;.</p>\n<p>So, yeah, this sucks.  Not picking on any particular audio blogger or post -- because they&#39;re almost all like this -- but I want that 4 minutes of my life back.</p>\n<p>But the thing is, I&#39;m a news radio junkie.  I abandoned listening to music over the air almost seven years ago, so when I&#39;m not listening to MP3 CDRs, my car tuner is almost perpetually locked on NPR.  I listen to people jabbering at me at almost all times while I&#39;m driving.  And at work, I mix listening to my MP3s with streaming talk, news, and old sci-fi radio stations.</p>\n<p>The difference here is that radio doesn&#39;t demand much of my attention.  I&#39;m usually doing something else while I&#39;m listening, like driving or working.  I don&#39;t have to navigate to anything, I don&#39;t have to provide any feedback or make any decisions--I just have to let it stream into my head.  The lower mental demands of audio and a lack of necessary interaction dovetail nicely with multitasking.</p>\n<p>So, in come <a href=\"http://ipodderx.com/\">iPodderX</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ipodder.org/directory/4/ipodderSoftware\">friends</a>.  They&#39;re feed aggregators specifically built to slurp down audio enclosures and sync them up to audio players like the iPod.  The idea is that, when you leave home, you take the digital audio player with you, loaded up with your own personal radio programming.  Not having an iPod, I&#39;ve been queuing these aggregated audio posts up in iTunes at work, and I&#39;ve been playing around with burning CDRW&#39;s for use in my car&#39;s in-dash MP3 player.  Once I get a headphone adapter for my Treo 600, maybe I&#39;ll start listening to them on there.</p>\n<p>With this switch of perspective, I think I&#39;m falling for the hype.  The key is to get out of the way: aggregate, queue, and play in the background.  Yeah, there&#39;s going to be a lot of awful crap out there, and lots of dorks eating breakfast and lipsmacking into the microphone as they blab (this is me, shuddering)--but as the number of podcasters expand, we will start to hear some <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/22/bloggingyourbliss\">blissful hams</a> showing up with things worth listening to.</p>\n<p>I&#39;d like to do <em>something</em>, but I doubt I have the time or insight to produce something worth listening to on a regular basis.  <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/categories/dailySourceCode/\">Adam Curry</a> suggested doing things like a daily quote, jokes, or skits--short, good things have value.  (Pete&#39;s encounter with frozen pizza instructions on <a href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/200408.html#08192004073000\">Rasterweb Audio</a> made me snort a bit.)</p>\n<p>The first thing that comes to my mind are these old sci-fi radio broacasts to which I&#39;m addicted.  While I have written stories of my own, I wonder how much public-domain or Creative Commons licensed content is out there available?  Could be fun to do some readings and a maybe do a little low-budget foley work.  Of course, there&#39;s the hosting and bandwidth to worry about, though I suppose BitTorrent could help if the aggregators support it (and they should!)</p>\n<p>In any case, I think the podcasters are on to something here.  I&#39;ll be listening.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=podcastinghype</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086381\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086381\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-07T12:19:31\">2004-10-07T12:19:31</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I knew we'd interest you at some point...\n\"Mad Computer Scientist Radio\" anyone?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086382\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a69a571df6948f1480bcd96c10d12c7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086382\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-07T12:50:20\">2004-10-07T12:50:20</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Heh, heh.

    "summary": "<p>So, over the last day or so, I&apos;ve found myself falling for the <a href=\"http://www.ipodder.org/\">Podcasting</a> hype.  </p>\n<p>Yeah, yeah, I know -- I listened to and read <a href=\"http://www.idlewords.com/audio-manifesto.txt\">Maciej&apos;s audioblogging manifesto</a> (and, yes, that&apos;s a link to the <strong>text</strong> version, which kind of helps support the argument therein) but I think the addition of portable digital audio players and RSS feeds with enclosures to the mix changes things.  </p>\n<p>The whole audioblogging thing has seemed incredibly stupid and annoying to me, since my experience of it so far has mostly consisted of this:  I navigate first to a text blog entry, click on a link to an MP3, then stare at the screen as the thing plays.  Being a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/14/info_freako_or_whos_already_past_arguing_about_syndication_formats\">high-bandwidth Info Freako</a>, a feeling of time wasted comes upon me pretty quickly.  I can speed read and I want to get through this quickly, but I can&apos;t speed listen.  I want to throw a bookmark at <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">del.icio.us</a> if I like it, but I can&apos;t select any text.  Getting a bit bored, I start thinking about how maybe I might want to remix this crap, make a funky beat out of all the utterances of &#x201C;um&#x201D;, &#x201C;ahh&#x201D;, and &#x201C;err&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>So, yeah, this sucks.  Not picking on any particular audio blogger or post -- because they&apos;re almost all like this -- but I want that 4 minutes of my life back.</p>\n<p>But the thing is, I&apos;m a news radio junkie.  I abandoned listening to music over the air almost seven years ago, so when I&apos;m not listening to MP3 CDRs, my car tuner is almost perpetually locked on NPR.  I listen to people jabbering at me at almost all times while I&apos;m driving.  And at work, I mix listening to my MP3s with streaming talk, news, and old sci-fi radio stations.</p>\n<p>The difference here is that radio doesn&apos;t demand much of my attention.  I&apos;m usually doing something else while I&apos;m listening, like driving or working.  I don&apos;t have to navigate to anything, I don&apos;t have to provide any feedback or make any decisions--I just have to let it stream into my head.  The lower mental demands of audio and a lack of necessary interaction dovetail nicely with multitasking.</p>\n<p>So, in come <a href=\"http://ipodderx.com/\">iPodderX</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ipodder.org/directory/4/ipodderSoftware\">friends</a>.  They&apos;re feed aggregators specifically built to slurp down audio enclosures and sync them up to audio players like the iPod.  The idea is that, when you leave home, you take the digital audio player with you, loaded up with your own personal radio programming.  Not having an iPod, I&apos;ve been queuing these aggregated audio posts up in iTunes at work, and I&apos;ve been playing around with burning CDRW&apos;s for use in my car&apos;s in-dash MP3 player.  Once I get a headphone adapter for my Treo 600, maybe I&apos;ll start listening to them on there.</p>\n<p>With this switch of perspective, I think I&apos;m falling for the hype.  The key is to get out of the way: aggregate, queue, and play in the background.  Yeah, there&apos;s going to be a lot of awful crap out there, and lots of dorks eating breakfast and lipsmacking into the microphone as they blab (this is me, shuddering)--but as the number of podcasters expand, we will start to hear some <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/22/bloggingyourbliss\">blissful hams</a> showing up with things worth listening to.</p>\n<p>I&apos;d like to do <em>something</em>, but I doubt I have the time or insight to produce something worth listening to on a regular basis.  <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/categories/dailySourceCode/\">Adam Curry</a> suggested doing things like a daily quote, jokes, or skits--short, good things have value.  (Pete&apos;s encounter with frozen pizza instructions on <a href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/200408.html#08192004073000\">Rasterweb Audio</a> made me snort a bit.)</p>\n<p>The first thing that comes to my mind are these old sci-fi radio broacasts to which I&apos;m addicted.  While I have written stories of my own, I wonder how much public-domain or Creative Commons licensed content is out there available?  Could be fun to do some readings and a maybe do a little low-budget foley work.  Of course, there&apos;s the hosting and bandwidth to worry about, though I suppose BitTorrent could help if the aggregators support it (and they should!)</p>\n<p>In any case, I think the podcasters are on to something here.  I&apos;ll be listening.</p>\n"

    "summary": "<p>Wow.  So it looks like there are some people starting to follow to what I&apos;m doing with <code>dbagg3</code>, and they&apos;re showing me how woefully prepared I am for the attention from tinkerers who are actually trying to, you know, <strong>run</strong> my code.  Things have been crazy busy for me at work, so I haven&apos;t been getting done what I&apos;ve planned.  But, I do need to pull a few things together and clean a few things up.  I&apos;ll soon be answering the smattering of email I&apos;ve gotten so far, but until then, a few quick thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>My source control is a bit of a mess at the moment.  Not only have I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/16/moving_time_from_cvs_to_subversion\">switched from CVS to SVN</a>-- but even if you followed me in that migration, I&apos;ve not kept committed code in working order.  I already know that this is a horrible habit, but since no one&apos;s really been looking, I haven&apos;t been called on it until now.  (Heh, heh--d&apos;oh.)  Planning this weekend (but hopefully today) to resolve this, so that moving forward, svn trunk will be (as far as possible) in a working state at any given moment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I&apos;ve hacked one of my dependencies, SQLObject, by applying <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=9122066\">a patch</a> to support SELECT DISTINCT queries.  This has understandably caused problems for some people who have no idea what I did.  This patch has turned out to be essential, though I don&apos;t know if/when it will or would be included in a release of SQLObject.  So...  I wonder if I should dump my working copy of SQLObject into source control?  Otherwise, applying the DISTINCT patch to your SQLObject install should work.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>At some point very soon, I want to change the name of this thing to <strong>feedReactor</strong>.  Yes, I know there&apos;s already a <em>feedparser</em>, and a <em>feeddemon</em>, and a <em>feedburner</em>, and someone&apos;s probably got a <em>feedkitchensink</em> in the works, but I like this name and want to run with it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, in the meantime while I straighten some things out, please excuse the mess and thanks for bearing with me!</p>\n"

But I just have to get this out: I&#39;m easily excited by shiny code and gadgets, but it&#39;s so much easier to get excited when I can see something in working condition before taking a screwdriver to it.  So... remember <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/30/dbagg3_makingprogress\">when I mentioned all those URLs</a>?  They&#39;re working out nicely.</p>\n<p>First, check out a simple two-pane view of news items, ala <a href=\"http://www.bloglines.com/\">Bloglines</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml?xsl=xsl/two-pane/index.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml?xsl=xsl/two-pane/index.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taking this apart, you can see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A user account: <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml</a></li>\n<li>Some XSL: <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/xsl/two-pane/index.xsl\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/xsl/two-pane/index.xsl</a></li>\n<li>... and a specified content type (text/html)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your curiosity is piqued by this, view source and pay attention to link URLs.  It&#39;s more of the same:  XML produced by a REST API, passed through XSL, delivered as HTML.</p>\n<p>Here, take a look at another view on this demo user&#39;s aggregated items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/outliner/index.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/outliner/index.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, this only seems to be working decently with Firefox and Safari.  MSIE seems to be balking at the dynamic stuff, though I&#39;ve had it working there in a previous incarnation of this code.  So hopefully this will be fixed soon.</p>\n<p>At any rate, what you should see is a single-pane outliner-style display of feed entries.  This is the style of aggregator UI I&#39;ve been using for almost 3 years now.  Disclosure triangles open entries up to show summaries and further content.  &#8220;[seen]&#8221; links hide the entries, while &#8220;[queue]&#8221; hides an entry while tossing it into a queue for viewing later.</p>\n<p>Speaking of that, you can see what&#39;s in the queue right now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;show_queued=1\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;show_queued=1</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a display of queued entries, with another stylesheet applied that shows everything in a flat and open blog-like template.  It&#39;s not reverse-chronological, but that&#39;s not hard to accomplish with a flag or a tweak to an &lt;xsl:sort&gt; tag.  </p>\n<p>So that&#39;s just the start of things.  Remember <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/23/slicing_and_dicing_to_make_atom_soup_in_dbagg3\">when I was rambling on about XML storage and query</a>?  A URL like this is one product of that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),'OS%20X')]\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),&#39;OS%20X&#39;)]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This should show you a flat listing of all entries whose titles contain &#8220;OS X&#8221;.  This is far from perfect, but it&#39;s very exciting to me-- it&#39;s got a lot of promise, stuff that first caught my eye when I saw <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/04/15/semanticblog.html\">Jon Udell playing</a> <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/06/10/xpathsearch.html?page=1\">awhile back</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, something that you might not notice until doing a bit more digging, is that all these attributes like &#8220;seen&#8221; and &#8220;query&#8221; are annotations made by the user on entries.  If you take a peek at <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/js/agg.js\">some of the Javascript</a> under the hood, you might notice some XmlHTTPRequest code going on.  To mark something as &#8220;seen&#8221; or &#8220;queued&#8221;, I POST XML to a URL like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The upshot of this is that these attributes are not limited to &#8220;seen&#8221; or &#8220;queued&#8221; flags-- in fact, these annotations can (well, in theory) be any pairing of arbitrary XML and a name.  This annotation then gets injected into the entry, when viewed by the user who owns the annotation, like so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In fact, you could invent a new annotation called &#39;tags&#39; and filter for entries with this annotation with a URL like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;entry%5C_notes%5C_xpath=//dbagg3:note%5B@name=&#39;tags&#39;\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;entry\\_notes\\_xpath=//dbagg3:note[@name=&#39;tags&#39;</a> and contains(text(),&#39;#food#&#39;) and contains(text(),&#39;#odd#&#39;)]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eventually, what I&#39;d <em>really</em> like to see this start doing is something akin to del.icio.us-style tagging while you&#39;re reading.  Then, you can have public queries that pull feeds based on your (and others&#39;) tags and spit things back out as feeds again with the proper XSL stylings.</p>\n<p>So at this point, it&#39;s all URLs and barely working HTML, but it&#39;s exciting to me at least.  And it&#39;s dogfood for me, since I&#39;m using this crud to get my daily (hourly?) fix.  Pretty soon, I&#39;ll be diving into wrapping more of a proper usable web app around this, with user management and stuff that works in MSIE.  Until then, maybe someone else will see this and catch a buzz from it.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=dbagg3alive</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090566\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e1cc8e7103bb0f77a7d7abf91b1a961b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Christopher</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090566\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-14T09:40:02\">2004-09-14T09:40:02</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Very cool!

Remember <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/23/slicing_and_dicing_to_make_atom_soup_in_dbagg3\">when I was rambling on about XML storage and query</a>?  A URL like this is one product of that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),&apos;OS%20X&apos;)]\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),&apos;OS%20X&apos;)]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This should show you a flat listing of all entries whose titles contain &#x201C;OS X&#x201D;.  This is far from perfect, but it&apos;s very exciting to me-- it&apos;s got a lot of promise, stuff that first caught my eye when I saw <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/04/15/semanticblog.html\">Jon Udell playing</a> <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/06/10/xpathsearch.html?page=1\">awhile back</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, something that you might not notice until doing a bit more digging, is that all these attributes like &#x201C;seen&#x201D; and &#x201C;query&#x201D; are annotations made by the user on entries.  If you take a peek at <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/js/agg.js\">some of the Javascript</a> under the hood, you might notice some XmlHTTPRequest code going on.  To mark something as &#x201C;seen&#x201D; or &#x201C;queued&#x201D;, I POST XML to a URL like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The upshot of this is that these attributes are not limited to &#x201C;seen&#x201D; or &#x201C;queued&#x201D; flags-- in fact, these annotations can (well, in theory) be any pairing of arbitrary XML and a name.  This annotation then gets injected into the entry, when viewed by the user who owns the annotation, like so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In fact, you could invent a new annotation called &apos;tags&apos; and filter for entries with this annotation with a URL like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry%5C_notes%5C_xpath=//dbagg3:note%5B@name=&apos;tags&apos;\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry\\_notes\\_xpath=//dbagg3:note[@name=&apos;tags&apos;</a> and contains(text(),&apos;#food#&apos;) and contains(text(),&apos;#odd#&apos;)]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eventually, what I&apos;d <em>really</em> like to see this start doing is something akin to del.icio.us-style tagging while you&apos;re reading.  Then, you can have public queries that pull feeds based on your (and others&apos;) tags and spit things back out as feeds again with the proper XSL stylings.</p>\n<p>So at this point, it&apos;s all URLs and barely working HTML, but it&apos;s exciting to me at least.  And it&apos;s dogfood for me, since I&apos;m using this crud to get my daily (hourly?) fix.  Pretty soon, I&apos;ll be diving into wrapping more of a proper usable web app around this, with user management and stuff that works in MSIE.  Until then, maybe someone else will see this and catch a buzz from it.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>\n"

This tends to produce about 1000-1500 entries in about 15 seconds on my PowerBook, which is better than I&apos;d expected.  </p>\n<p>Pretty soon, I&apos;ll be implementing the ability to post metadata onto feed entries under subscriptions.  Then, I can mark items as seen, attach categories, tags, and notes.  From there, I can exclude seen items from queries, produce new aggregate feeds based on my tagging or notes, among a few other ideas I&apos;ve got stewing.</p>\n<p>A little more work, and I think I&apos;ll be able to throw together the beginnings of a <a href=\"http://www.bloglines.com\">Bloglines</a>-style three-pane browser interface, as well as improving the functionality of my own outliner-style display with <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html\">XmlHTTPRequest</a>-based calls to the API to enable refresh-free interaction.  From there, I have some ideas for desktop apps and maybe even some <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/19/flash_agg\">tinkering in Flash</a>.  (Wow... has it really been over a year since I was writing about Flash &amp; REST?)</p>\n<p>And <em>then</em>, I want to implement the Atom API and allow users to create feeds to which they can post their own items and share read-only with others (or share writing with a group).  From there, this thing can turn into a read/write Atom storage tank, serving both as an aggregator and a blog publishing engine, given the appropriate XSL work.</p>\n<p>Lots of ideas stewing.  Now I just have to get the time and possibly a new web server, since I&apos;d like to eventually open up an installation of this to fellow tinkerers, but this poor little box can barely take what it&apos;s tasked with at present...</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and one other thing:  I&apos;ve been thinking about names better than <code>dbagg3</code>.  The one that&apos;s sticking around in my head so far is <strong>feedReactor</strong>.  What do you think?</p>\n"

This bugs me, though, since the most elegant solution to me is to use something XML-native to store and query piles of Atom feeds and entries.  I&#39;d really like to have <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/04/15/semanticblog.html\">XPath available as a query tool</a>.

But, I don&#39;t know the state of RDF art well enough to know whether there&#39;s a database available that can handle 10,000 Atom/RSS entries a week or more for a year without gagging.

But this time around, I want to play with much richer data: I want to include everything in the Atom spec, and try to take in some metadata from extensions.  So I threw together what I thought was a pretty decent relational model onto which I could map Atom XML data.

Nasty, ugly, fragile, and completely inelegant.  There&#39;s some of that in <code>dbagg3</code> <em>right now</em>, and I want it out.

Thinking hard about my use cases, I think I can cover 80% of what I need with being able to look things up by feed, by subscription, by user, by date, and a few other useful aspects.

Somewhat serendipitously, I just caught Bob DuCharme&#39;s xml.com <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/08/04/tr-xml.html\">article on Amazon.com&#39;s web services</a>, which <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1\">I really like</a> and have drawn inspiration from in thinking about this new aggregator.  Eventually, I want to offer the same sort of XML+XSL style of service that they&#39;ve put together, along with some futher inspiration from the <a href=\"http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/api/atom-api-spec.php\">Atom API</a>.  </p>\n<p>Anyway, as another teaser, check out this early demo involving the XML this thing has been producing, coupled with some experimental XSL:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/demo.xml\">dbagg3 demo page</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You&#39;ll notice that there are three URLs involved here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi\">An XSLT processor service</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl\">An XSLT stylesheet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/demo.xml\">Some aggregated Atom feeds</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The XSLT expects Atom (plus a few extensions of my own), so you can also do things like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.diveintomark.org/xml/atom.xml\">Dive Into Mark</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/index.atom\">Intertwingly</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.decafbad.com/blog/atom.xml\">0xDECAFBAD</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are the sorts of tricks I was looking forward to when I started thinking about things like a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/17/use_atom_for_a_universal_blog_transfer_protocol\">universal blog transfer format</a> and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/03/put_on_your_rsscolored_glasses_and_forget_about_atom\">rose-colored glasses</a>.  XSLT used like this could just as easily produce a blog or RSS 2.0 content.</p>\n<p>Anyway, hoping to get some code into CVS by this weekend that&#39;s not entirely embarassing.  So if you&#39;re interested in this stuff, stay tuned.  I&#39;m hoping that this thing can provide a base for others interested in feed aggregation--if you just want to play with UI, use the scanning and storage as-is and tinker with XSLT; if you want to play with storage and query, leave the scanning and UI alone; if you want to tinker with parsing... er, <a href=\"http://www.feedparser.org/\">talk to Mark Pilgrim</a>.</p>\n<p>More soon!  </p>\n<p>(Oh yeah, and I <em>will</em> be working on coming up with a better name than <code>dbagg3</code>.  Unfortunately, I probably won&#39;t be coming up with a more visually appealing design for the UI, since what you see is the best I can do.  Heh, heh.

    "body": "**Update**: I've just dumped what code I have into my CVS repository.  So, go ahead and poke fun at it:\r\n\r\n   * <http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg3/>\r\n\r\nOr, fetch it from CVS:\r\n\r\n    $ cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@www.decafbad.com:/cvsroot login\r\n    (Logging in to anoncvs@www.decafbad.com)\r\n    CVS password: anoncvs\r\n    $ cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@www.decafbad.com:/cvsroot co dbagg3\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nSo, besides the funk, there's a little project in which I've gotten immersed.  Here's a teaser diagram:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/dbagg3-phase1.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nIt's a feed aggregator, my third attempt at such.  At present, things are roughly close to the diagram above.  Everything is clunky and command-line driven at present--but I've got further plans, like a REST API for feed queries and manipulation of various things such as feed subscriptions and the read/unread state of items.  Pair this with an XSLT-driven browser UI, and the possibility of other clients (not the least of include other Atom-consuming aggregators).\r\n\r\nThe goal is to make a [Client/Server Aggregator][clientserveragg].  Somewhat serendipitously, I just caught Bob DuCharme's xml.com [article on Amazon.com's web services][amazonrest], which [I really like][wishes] and have drawn inspiration from in thinking about this new aggregator.  Eventually, I want to offer the same sort of XML+XSL style of service that they've put together, along with some futher inspiration from the [Atom API][atomapi].  \r\n\r\nAnyway, as another teaser, check out this early demo involving the XML this thing has been producing, coupled with some experimental XSL:\r\n\r\n* [dbagg3 demo page][dbagg3demo]\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that there are three URLs involved here:\r\n\r\n* [An XSLT processor service][dbagg3xsltproc]\r\n* [An XSLT stylesheet][dbagg3xsl]\r\n* [Some aggregated Atom feeds][dbagg3xml]\r\n\r\nThe XSLT expects Atom (plus a few extensions of my own), so you can also do things like this:\r\n\r\n* [Dive Into Mark][mark]\r\n* [Intertwingly][sam]\r\n* [0xDECAFBAD][me]\r\n\r\nThese are the sorts of tricks I was looking forward to when I started thinking about things like a [universal blog transfer format][blogxfer] and [rose-colored glasses][roseglasses].  XSLT used like this could just as easily produce a blog or RSS 2.0 content.\r\n\r\nAnyway, hoping to get some code into CVS by this weekend that's not entirely embarassing.  So if you're interested in this stuff, stay tuned.  I'm hoping that this thing can provide a base for others interested in feed aggregation--if you just want to play with UI, use the scanning and storage as-is and tinker with XSLT; if you want to play with storage and query, leave the scanning and UI alone; if you want to tinker with parsing... er, [talk to Mark Pilgrim][ufp].\r\n\r\nMore soon!  \r\n\r\n(Oh yeah, and I *will* be working on coming up with a better name than `dbagg3`.  Unfortunately, I probably won't be coming up with a more visually appealing design for the UI, since what you see is the best I can do.  Heh, heh.

At this point, all that seems to happen is that the same old threads get recycled.  No one&#39;s got anything new to bring, except maybe ad hominem grousing or possibly a Yo Mama joke (though I&#39;ve yet to see that particular innovation).  Anyone who cares can do a bit of Googling to catch up on the story.</p>\n<p>The fact is, I no longer care about RSS versus Atom versus $foo.  Mark Pilgrim enables me to do so with his <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/projects/feed_parser/\">feed parser</a>, and most other aggregators I might care about have also implemented support for both Atom and RSS.  And if they don&#39;t, I can <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/03/put_on_your_rsscolored_glasses_and_forget_about_atom\">route around the damage</a> just like I do when I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XslScraper\">scrape sites</a> devoid of any feeds.</p>\n<p>While I do prefer Atom over RSS, almost a year later I still say <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/07/07/syndications_formats\">the magic is in syndication, not the format</a>.  I&#39;ll let the tag-level grumblers foam on without comment and just thank them for their work when a good new spec  bubbles up or when something fun and useful comes out.  I&#39;m circling that whole area of concern and sticking a post-it on it that reads: <em>RSS and Atom both useful, neither perfect, neither going away.</em></p>\n<p>Whew.  That&#39;s a weight off my brain.  Now what is there left to talk about?</p>\n<p>Well, how about let&#39;s talk some more about what to do with the items we get, once we <em>do</em> manage to parse a feed?  (Sheesh, you mean we&#39;re not already fighting over that topic?)  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/2004/06/10.html#a1802\">Rogers Cadenhead wants gluttonous RSS feeders</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With thousands of information sources producing RSS and Atom feeds, we need people like Thauvin [whose linkblog is <a href=\"http://www.thauvin.net/linkblog/\">here</a>] who have integrated weblogging into their daily news-gathering routine. Weblog links are like ant trails -- a lot of people have to link to something good in order to get noticed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I self-identify as such, since my feed list has topped 550 in count.  But I&#39;m happily surprised to find that I&#39;m not even in the <a href=\"http://feeds.scripting.com/prolificSubscribers\">top 10 of prolific subscribers</a>--at least I&#39;m not the biggest Info Freako.  (Yet.)  </p>\n<p>I&#39;m adding between 2-3 feeds to my list daily, so I can see myself approaching 1000 eventually.  But I&#39;m starting to hesitate at adding one more feed now.  Even with my current streamlined multi-pass skimming process, I&#39;m starting to see diminishing returns.  I breeze past screen loads of chaff that I&#39;ll never view, but it still bogs me down.  I can only think that people with twice the subscriptions as I either have more free time, or have a better mousetrap.</p>\n<p>The usual response I get toward my subscriptions is, &quot;Why don&#39;t you cut that list down to about 100 essentials?&quot;  And even that&#39;s said with a smirk, usually by someone with under 50 subscriptions and usually by someone who&#39;s not as obsessive an <a href=\"http://www.jesusjonesarchive.com/lyrics.htm#Info%20Freako\" title=\"Jesus Jones lyrics\">Info Freako</a> as I am.  Thing is, though, good stuff has at one point or another shown up on each and every feed I monitor.  I want to figure out how to scale <em>up</em> from 1 to 10 to 100 to 1000 to 10000 sources and beyond.</p>\n<p>(Singing interlude: &quot;Info Freako / There is no end to what I want to know&quot;)</p>\n<p>Besides, this is an area where I can tinker with and learn about another area I&#39;m interested in: machine intelligence and intelligence amplification.  Rogers says, &quot;I want a Bayesian filter that can guess which new headlines I&#39;m most likely to read&quot;  Though someone else might apply Bayes in a way that works for them, I didn&#39;t find <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/08/16/bayes_agg_one\">my experiments with SpamBayes</a> very satisfying.  I suspect it has something to do with the fact that SpamBayes is geared toward sorting out a quasi-binary world of spam-versus-ham, while I&#39;m interested in a spectrum between must-read and shrugs.</p>\n<p>But, the idea of introducing another pass through items at the head of the process, this one partially or completely automated, has great appeal.  Done right, this could be the bit that adds an order of magnitude to my capacity to monitor feeds.  I need to investigate other machine learning approaches.</p>\n<p>The idea is that, while I freakishly want to catch as much info as possible, I can only handle so much in a day.  For certain, I can&#39;t handle everything that might be interesting to me, so I need some prioritization and some pre-filtering before my attention gets applied to the flow.</p>\n<p>The way I picture this is trying to apply a sort of <a href=\"http://mtsu32.mtsu.edu:11178/171/pyramid.htm\">inverted pyramid</a> approach to the incoming flow of items.</p>\n<p>I started with a few primitive tools in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/08/05/ooobbf\">AmphetaOutlines&#39; adaptivity to reading patterns</a>, limited mostly to just sorting channels by a count of items read historically.  I also introduced some information hiding and exploration aspects:  I tried to hide or de-emphasize older items by use of font size and weight; and I put items into a JavaScript-driven outline where item descriptions and more ancient items could be hidden or revealed via disclosure triangle.</p>\n<p>In my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg2\">latest attempt</a>, I&#39;ve not yet implemented any adaptive sorting, but I&#39;ve kept and improved the outline display (see: <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/06/dbagg2a.jpg\">screenshot #1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/06/dbagg2b.jpg\">screenshot #2</a>).

I don't read through my aggregator all day - I spend about an hour per day at lunch and maybe another at home skimming through items and maybe another hour or so reading longer stories.  \nThis isn't handwashing OCD behavior here - I don't read or even linger on more than a small fraction of what ends up on the screen.  It's a lot of quick glancing, page-down, and mass delete.  It's pretty much as much time as I used to spend just between a half-dozen sites like slashdot.org and cnet.com, only now my sources are so much more varied.\nThe challenge is that wanting to squeeze more coverage of more sources into my daily browsing has me wanting to learn more about certain technologies.  That, and just dealing with more volumes of data is kinda fun in a geeky sort of way.\nAnd, no, I don't record all the channels on the TV.  Besides watching 1 or 2 shows, and playing a few video games, this is what I do instead of sitting in front of the tube.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086593\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.reactuate.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=43e4a9fa1d0e5d52a6979ddad94bc483&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.reactuate.com/\">Ron</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086593\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-06-16T19:52:44\">2004-06-16T19:52:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">When I wrote that story I wasn't expecting people to jump into a fight about RSS vs Atom.

Moving content to the must-read front burner will always be deliberate, but improving the content we scan can probably be improved mechanically.  I doubt Brother Orchard thinks there&#8217;s an algorithm for the A-list.  We&#8217;re just talking about making more productive use of the proximate cloud.\nScenario #1:  You Google for topics of interest.  The hits returned can&#8217;t be reliably filtered by creation date, and they consider (in general) the entire indexed Web.  It&#8217;s a good thing, if scatter-shot.  Queries can only be refined so much.\nScenario #2:  You amass and manage a list of syndicated feeds in which you have a passing interest.  The feed content is indexed (Bloglines does this; Google does or will, too).  You can query this universe discretely, using Google-like devices and maybe a few new ones.\nWhat&#8217;s different about these two?\nIn #2, you selected (and casually manage) the universe.  Its chunks &#8212; though perhaps truncated or paraphrased by the author &#8212; are reliably date-stamped.  A free-text query of such data would be very different from an identical Google query.\nAdd a few more discriminators and it gets better.  Suppose you could discriminate by\n1. Paragraph length.  That might get you recent topical hits of terse or essay length, as you choose.\n2. Link-text density.  Filter in or out those link-collection posts.\n3. Query-term density or semantic weight.  Is the topic being addressed directly or simply mentioned?\n4. Item weight or image density.  Helps filter noisy or glitzy corporate feeds (think Ziff-Davis).\nThere are plenty more.\nThe main differences, though, are date discrimination and the pre-filter of a confined universe.  Me, I&#8217;m down to thirty feeds and ignore half of those.  Better tools might change that.\nLQ</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086596\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=85232f8499fd6ee91623408fc23835d1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\">Matt Brubeck</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086596\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-06-19T21:06:49\">2004-06-19T21:06:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I love the picture.

At this point, all that seems to happen is that the same old threads get recycled.  No one's got anything new to bring, except maybe ad hominem grousing or possibly a Yo Mama joke (though I've yet to see that particular innovation).  Anyone who cares can do a bit of Googling to catch up on the story.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, I no longer care about RSS versus Atom versus $foo.  Mark Pilgrim enables me to do so with his [feed parser][feedparser], and most other aggregators I might care about have also implemented support for both Atom and RSS.  And if they don't, I can [route around the damage][rss colored glasses] just like I do when I [scrape sites][scrape sites] devoid of any feeds.\r\n\r\nWhile I do prefer Atom over RSS, almost a year later I still say [the magic is in syndication, not the format][syndication magic].  I'll let the tag-level grumblers foam on without comment and just thank them for their work when a good new spec  bubbles up or when something fun and useful comes out.  I'm circling that whole area of concern and sticking a post-it on it that reads: *RSS and Atom both useful, neither perfect, neither going away.*\r\n\r\nWhew.  That's a weight off my brain.  Now what is there left to talk about?\r\n\r\nWell, how about let's talk some more about what to do with the items we get, once we *do* manage to parse a feed?  (Sheesh, you mean we're not already fighting over that topic?)  \r\n\r\n[Rogers Cadenhead wants gluttonous RSS feeders][cadenhead]:\r\n\r\n> With thousands of information sources producing RSS and Atom feeds, we need people like Thauvin [whose linkblog is [here][thauvin]] who have integrated weblogging into their daily news-gathering routine. Weblog links are like ant trails -- a lot of people have to link to something good in order to get noticed.\r\n\r\nI self-identify as such, since my feed list has topped 550 in count.  But I'm happily surprised to find that I'm not even in the [top 10 of prolific subscribers][prolific subs]--at least I'm not the biggest Info Freako.  (Yet.)  \r\n\r\nI'm adding between 2-3 feeds to my list daily, so I can see myself approaching 1000 eventually.  But I'm starting to hesitate at adding one more feed now.  Even with my current streamlined multi-pass skimming process, I'm starting to see diminishing returns.  I breeze past screen loads of chaff that I'll never view, but it still bogs me down.  I can only think that people with twice the subscriptions as I either have more free time, or have a better mousetrap.\r\n\r\nThe usual response I get toward my subscriptions is, \"Why don't you cut that list down to about 100 essentials?\"  And even that's said with a smirk, usually by someone with under 50 subscriptions and usually by someone who's not as obsessive an [Info Freako][info freako] as I am.  Thing is, though, good stuff has at one point or another shown up on each and every feed I monitor.  I want to figure out how to scale *up* from 1 to 10 to 100 to 1000 to 10000 sources and beyond.\r\n\r\n(Singing interlude: \"Info Freako / There is no end to what I want to know\")\r\n\r\nBesides, this is an area where I can tinker with and learn about another area I'm interested in: machine intelligence and intelligence amplification.  Rogers says, \"I want a Bayesian filter that can guess which new headlines I'm most likely to read\"  Though someone else might apply Bayes in a way that works for them, I didn't find [my experiments with SpamBayes][bayes] very satisfying.  I suspect it has something to do with the fact that SpamBayes is geared toward sorting out a quasi-binary world of spam-versus-ham, while I'm interested in a spectrum between must-read and shrugs.\r\n\r\nBut, the idea of introducing another pass through items at the head of the process, this one partially or completely automated, has great appeal.  Done right, this could be the bit that adds an order of magnitude to my capacity to monitor feeds.  I need to investigate other machine learning approaches.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that, while I freakishly want to catch as much info as possible, I can only handle so much in a day.  For certain, I can't handle everything that might be interesting to me, so I need some prioritization and some pre-filtering before my attention gets applied to the flow.\r\n\r\nThe way I picture this is trying to apply a sort of [inverted pyramid][inverted pyramid] approach to the incoming flow of items.\r\n\r\nI started with a few primitive tools in [AmphetaOutlines' adaptivity to reading patterns][amphetaoutlines], limited mostly to just sorting channels by a count of items read historically.  I also introduced some information hiding and exploration aspects:  I tried to hide or de-emphasize older items by use of font size and weight; and I put items into a JavaScript-driven outline where item descriptions and more ancient items could be hidden or revealed via disclosure triangle.\r\n\r\nIn my [latest attempt][dbagg2], I've not yet implemented any adaptive sorting, but I've kept and improved the outline display (see: [screenshot #1][dbagg2 screen1], [screenshot #2][dbagg2 screen2]).  Also, I can now mark items as seen and/or flag them to be viewed in a queue for later.  I've got some lame SpamBayes integration in there, but I've let it atrophy in daily use due to a complete lack of usefulness.\r\n\r\nI'm starting to think about next steps now toward a more advanced aggregator.  I've still got my [wishlist][wishlist] for AmphetaOutlines, and I've actually covered quite a few of the items with this new aggregator.  But, I'm thinking things like the following would be useful to pursue:\r\n\r\n* **What do you think is more important?**  Do you value one group of feeds over another?  Personally, I want to see every single web comic that appears in my queue, most items from [Engadget][engadget] and [Boing Boing][boing boing], and maybe only a few from some of the firehoses I've hooked myself up to.  Also, there are [some][blogger1] [bloggers][blogger2] who post somewhat infrequently, but I don't want to miss a thing when they *do* post.  I need to be able to group and prioritize manually.\r\n\r\n* **What do you *demonstrate* as important?**  Which feeds' items receive more of your attention, and within those feeds, what topics and phrases appear most frequently?  The machine should be able to make some observations about your history of behavior and give some input into the organization of items presented.  Also, it should give me some way to give feedback to its recommendations with a simple and lazy thumbs up and thumbs down.\r\n\r\n* **Republishing of interesting items to a linkblog is a must.**  On the flip-side, it would be nice to somehow pull in others' linkblogs in a more meaningful way than simply watching their feeds.  I should be able to triangulate some things and get some recommendations based on mutual links predicting future interest in items.  We need to start chasing ant trails unconsciously and automatically.\r\n\r\n* **Time-limited subscriptions which expire after a set time, or request renewal from the user.**  Use these to track comment threads which offer RSS feeds.  (Like [this one][comment feed].)\r\n\r\n* **More statistics and health monitoring of subscriptions.**  How active are your feeds?  Which are dead &#38; gone, or merely just in hiatus?  Have any moved?\r\n\r\nNow, I haven't done any sort of comprehensive survey of the aggregator landscape in a long time, so I'd be very intrigued if any existing software implements these sorts of things.  I've seen some progress toward monitoring feed health, but I've seen next to nothing toward automatic filtering of items and recommendations based on past behavior.

I don't read through my aggregator all day - I spend about an hour per day at lunch and maybe another at home skimming through items and maybe another hour or so reading longer stories.  \r\n\r\nThis isn't handwashing OCD behavior here - I don't read or even linger on more than a small fraction of what ends up on the screen.  It's a lot of quick glancing, page-down, and mass delete.  It's pretty much as much time as I used to spend just between a half-dozen sites like slashdot.org and cnet.com, only now my sources are so much more varied.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is that wanting to squeeze more coverage of more sources into my daily browsing has me wanting to learn more about certain technologies.  That, and just dealing with more volumes of data is kinda fun in a geeky sort of way.\r\n\r\nAnd, no, I don't record all the channels on the TV.

Moving content to the must-read front burner will always be deliberate, but improving the content we scan can probably be improved mechanically.  I doubt Brother Orchard thinks there&#8217;s an algorithm for the A-list.  We&#8217;re just talking about making more productive use of the proximate cloud.\r\n\r\nScenario #1:  You Google for topics of interest.  The hits returned can&#8217;t be reliably filtered by creation date, and they consider (in general) the entire indexed Web.  It&#8217;s a good thing, if scatter-shot.  Queries can only be refined so much.\r\n\r\nScenario #2:  You amass and manage a list of syndicated feeds in which you have a passing interest.  The feed content is indexed (Bloglines does this; Google does or will, too).  You can query this universe discretely, using Google-like devices and maybe a few new ones.\r\n\r\nWhat&#8217;s different about these two?\r\n\r\nIn #2, you selected (and casually manage) the universe.  Its chunks &#8212; though perhaps truncated or paraphrased by the author &#8212; are reliably date-stamped.  A free-text query of such data would be very different from an identical Google query.\r\n\r\nAdd a few more discriminators and it gets better.  Suppose you could discriminate by\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Paragraph length.  That might get you recent topical hits of terse or essay length, as you choose.\r\n\r\n2. Link-text density.  Filter in or out those link-collection posts.\r\n\r\n3. Query-term density or semantic weight.  Is the topic being addressed directly or simply mentioned?\r\n\r\n4. Item weight or image density.  Helps filter noisy or glitzy corporate feeds (think Ziff-Davis).\r\n\r\nThere are plenty more.\r\n\r\nThe main differences, though, are date discrimination and the pre-filter of a confined universe.  Me, I&#8217;m down to thirty feeds and ignore half of those.  Better tools might change that.\r\n\r\nLQ</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086596\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=85232f8499fd6ee91623408fc23835d1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\">Matt Brubeck</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086596\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-06-19T21:06:49\">2004-06-19T21:06:49</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I love the picture.

So...  I&#39;m off to post a trackback from my own blog!</p>\n<p>You could use some mashup of RSS and XML-RPC for this, but I&#39;d suggest using Atom.  It&#39;s a data model <em>and</em> an API, where the data model represents blog content quite well and the API complements it for the purposes of shuffling things around.  With a mix of XML-RPC and RSS, I could only imagine <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/10/15/dive.html\" title=\"Mark Pilgrim&#39;s overview of the Atom API.  In particular, check out the section about the metaWeblog API&#39;s relationship to RSS 2.0\">lots of fiddling</a> going on to transliterate between RSS and <a href=\"http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi\" title=\"The metaWeblog API specification\">metaWeblog API structs</a> or whatnot.</p>\n<p>Practically speaking, it seems to me that it&#39;d be <a href=\"http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/tutorials/api-quick-guide.php\" title=\"All the pieces are here in an Atom API tutorial\">pretty trivial</a> to build a little conduit between <a href=\"http://www.atomenabled.org/\">Atom Enabled</a> blogs.  Make a request to blog #1 for entries, then turn around and take the data returned by that request and post directly to blog #2.

So...  I'm off to post a trackback from my own blog!\r\n\r\nYou could use some mashup of RSS and XML-RPC for this, but I'd suggest using Atom.  It's a data model *and* an API, where the data model represents blog content quite well and the API complements it for the purposes of shuffling things around.  With a mix of XML-RPC and RSS, I could only imagine [lots of fiddling][meta_fiddling] going on to transliterate between RSS and [metaWeblog API structs][metaweblog] or whatnot.\r\n\r\nPractically speaking, it seems to me that it'd be [pretty trivial][atom_tut] to build a little conduit between [Atom Enabled][atomenabled] blogs.  Make a request to blog #1 for entries, then turn around and take the data returned by that request and post directly to blog #2.  I imagine there'd be just a *tad* more to do than that, such as splitting up the list of entries and posting each individually.
