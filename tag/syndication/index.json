    "summary": "<p>I'm a complete neophyte when it comes to machine learning, but I'd like to get into learning more about the field in general.  In particular, I'd like to make my news aggregator smarter.  I've <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/08/16/bayes_agg_one\">already tried using SpamBayes</a>, but that didn't make me happy.  Whether it was my approach or whether it was that Bayes itself is not suited toward this task, I'm not sure, though I suspect it's a little of both.</p>\n<p>It seems like the magic Bayesian pixie dust works well for spam-vs-ham in my email box, so why shouldn't the magic for interesting-vs-yawn work for my aggregator firehose?    Well, here are the issues I'm guessing at:</p>\n<p>In the case of spam-vs-ham, you want to classify things into this or that-- that which is kept, and that which is tossed away.  But in the case of items in my aggregator, I want a relative sort order or a score.  I want a fuzzy guess toward my interest with which to inform presentation of items.  Interesting-vs-yawn is more of a continuum than a pair of buckets.</p>\n<p>And then, there's the passive gathering of behavioral data from my interactions with the aggregator, because I'm sure as hell not going to click ratings or thumbs-up/down all day.  In spam-vs-ham, I could build up two clean mailboxes for training the categorizer, with one containing all spam and the other all ham.  But, in the case of my aggregator, the only thing I'm tracking are items in which I showed interest by revealing more information or by clicking through.  </p>\n<p>So, I can say that a particular pile of items are all interesting.  But, my interest level for the rest of the items received is a complete unknown-- maybe I'm vehemently disinterested in those 50 items, but maybe I just never got around to looking at those other 20 and just let them fall off my date range for display.  Thus, I have a pile of ham, and a pile of undifferentiated unknown.  I'm not bothering to provide any cues as to whether I <em>don't</em> like something, because that'd be boring work-- I mean, I <em>am</em> disinterested in those items, after all.  So, I'd like to leverage what the system knows from what I care to provide, but not jump to any conclusions about the items in the unknown pile.  There is no spam, only various flavors of ham.</p>\n<p>Given all this, then, is there anyone out there who knows more about machine learning than me who could maybe point me toward a better approach or algorithm that fits this profile?</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>So, like I was saying:  I've been working on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/kwiki?FeedReactor\">FeedReactor</a> and have been doing some things with it that I find rather interesting, independent of news aggregation.  </p>\n<p>One of the core goals I have for FeedReactor is to explore what it takes to build a web app that exploits <a href=\"http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html\">principles of REST architecture</a>.  Having already <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooccb\">sung the praises</a> of XML-RPC, I wanted to get immersed in REST and see what all the hubbub was about.  I've got some ways to go, but I think I understand the major concepts now, and it's a pretty nifty frame within which to work.</p>\n<p>But, two other things I've added to my mix have really made things interesting for me:  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>XSLT filtering</li>\n<li>The XmlHTTPRequest object</li>\n</ol>\n<p>XSLT and REST make a really good pair, as <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1\">Amazon Web Services already demonstrate</a>.  Inspired by that API (<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/02/xsl_scraper\">and earlier experiments</a>), I use XML for all the input and output formats in my API and accept a query string parameter that contains the path to an XSLT file.  When this parameter is supplied, the XML output by the API is first processed using the given XSLT.  (Think of it like piping API output through <code>xsltproc</code>.)</p>\n<p>So, with a properly constructed collection of XSLT, I can present a browser-viewable HTML user interface served up directly from REST API calls.  Links, frame sets, and iframes present in the HTML lead the user from that call to the next XSLT-wrapped REST API call. </p>\n<p>But, once the initial HTML-and-JavaScript payload reaches the browser, it gets better (<a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/10/22/43OPstrategic_1.html\">ala Gmail</a>):  </p>\n<p>On older browsers (if I happen to care about them), I can make new HTTP requests back to the server <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/iframe.html\">from JavaScript using iframes</a>.  In this case, XSLT filtering lets me retrofit the API's responses to the HTML-and-JavaScript crud I need to serve up to make things happen back in the browser client.  Unfortunately, passing data <em>to</em> the API (which expects XML, not form submissions) is still a bit wonky and requires some hacks and exceptions involving hidden forms and such.</p>\n<p>However, on the newer browsers, it's all about the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html\">XmlHTTPRequest object</a>.  With this facility, I can make clean asynchronous requests back to the REST API, including XML data in the request body if I feel like it.  Responses are handled by JavaScript callbacks, which twiddle the browser DOM to update the user interface in response.  </p>\n<p>So, after the major initial contact with the API to supply the browser with HTML by way of XSLT, most future interactions take place in the form of direct calls to the REST API using XML.  Although for some things, it's easier to just reload a page of HTML, it's nicer for most interactions to be handled via DOM manipulations in-place.  I've been amazed at the Gmail-like responsiveness I get from FeedReactor when I'm skimming through news items, marking some as seen or flagged, and popping open the descriptions on others.  </p>\n<p>I suppose I <em>shouldn't</em> be amazed at the responsiveness, since I'm using some of the same techniques as Gmail.  However, my daily-use installation of FeedReactor is presently running on an old 300Mhz Debian Linux PC at home, and it's taking me through the daily produce of 600 subscribed feeds faster than any desktop aggregator has yet.  Of course, this is partly a product of my familiarity with the UI I've cobbled together, but... <em>the server's running on a 300Mhz PC with 256MB of RAM!</em>  And the client is my 867Mhz G4 PowerBook, running Firefox or Safari, depending on my mood.</p>\n<p>Although I can't see when I'll have time for it, I really want to explore this approach further using desktop apps on OS X and accessing the API from Flash movies (maybe using <a href=\"http://openlaszlo.org/\">Laszlo</a>).  I'd also like to see how far I can go toward adapting the interface toward mobile devices like my Treo 600.</p>\n<p>So anyway, this has been where most of my private hacking sessions have been taking me over the past year or so:  combining HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, XML, XSLT, and REST to build what I consider to be a next-generation web app.  </p>\n<p>Now, although I use FeedReactor on a daily basis to keep up with all my feeds, it's nowhere near any state suitable for public consumption.  I add new subscriptions from a command-line script and still fiddle with the database directly for some operations.  I'd like to have a personal-server version of it ready for use by some alpha geeks before or not long into the new year, but I'd like to share some of the things I've been doing with it before then.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, I think I'll wrap up this entry and think about putting together a quick tutorial pico-project to demonstrate some of the concepts.  Maybe an address book, or something equally simple-yet-useful.  </p>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>\n",

Danah's writing about youth and feeds and intimate communication versus institutional communication resonates well with what I've been tossing around in my head.</p>\n<p>When I was in high school, around about the time Ross Perot was getting into the presidential race, I remember putting a little item on my to-do list in my brand new day planner:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read the newspaper, watch the news.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I must've been, what, 16 years old?  I suppose that would have made me one of the youths Danah's talking about, albeit of an earlier generation of online communicators.  At the time, the bulk of my disposable income earned as a grocery store bagger was spent on music CDs, gas, and the occasional upgrade to my Commodore Amiga.  I didn't even know was NPR was, though I knew there was this thing they did with news on the radio.  But newspapers and talk on the radio were things that my grandparents paid attention to, if anything.  </p>\n<p>The only reason I put that item on my to-do list--in fact, the only reason I even had a day planner with a to-do list in the first place--was because, according to the teachers trying to prepare me for college, this was what grownups did.  Planning your days and reading the news were things that adults did, and if I wanted to be an adult, I should get with the program.  And I wanted to get with the program, but I really didn't see the point yet.</p>\n<p>However, I did live most of my social life online.  Now, that needs a bit of qualification:  Of course, I am a big geek and many of my kind spend their days living in Mom's basement talking to men pretending to be 14-year-old girls.  But, back when I was first getting online, the main gateway for access was the dial-up BBS, preferably one that was a local call to your area code and prefix.  What that meant is that most of the people I was chatting with online were within a 16-year-old's parentally condoned driving radius.</p>\n<p>So, I never lived in the basement, and I <em>did</em> actually get out quite a bit.  The only real strange bit was that very few of my social group went to school together--and actually, most of us were misfits in school, some counting the minutes till we could get back to each other.  Having just finished Cory Doctorow's <a href=\"http://www.craphound.com/est/\"><em>Eastern Standard Tribe</em></a> (read on my Treo 600, my <em>comm</em>, no less), I can totally grok the tribes.  Mine was as small as an area code or two, rather than a time zone, but I had a tribe.  Still do, even though we've since dispersed across many, many area codes.  Now there's <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com\">LiveJournal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.xanga.com\">Xanga</a>, among other tribe-building technologies.</p>\n<p>But lately, in the past few years, I've been changing.  I'm only 29 now, but I've learned what a day planner is for and my to-do list is crucial; I know enough about the news on TV not to watch it much, yet I pull in enormous volumes of news from online sources and magazines.  And, as I wrote earlier, NPR is now the only station on my radio dial.</p>\n<p>When I was 16, the presidential race was a curiosity about which I felt vague guilt for not knowing more. But, this time around I'm giving it an attention and range of emotion akin to a rabid sports fan during playoffs.  I lost sleep over whether or not my voter registration was up to date with my correct address.  I do realize that for many, many reasons this particular presidential race is historic.  But I'm a johnny-come-lately--there've been historic presidential races before: history didn't start because I started paying attention.</p>\n<p>What's happened is that I've changed.  If I could time-travel and stop by to say hello, my high-school-self would probably admire who I am now, but wouldn't quite understand me.  He'd get the half-dozen IRC windows I have open, and the handful of IM windows I'm floating at any particular moment, but I doubt he'd get the lure of my news aggregator in the background.  I loved Jesus Jones at the time, but I didn't <em>really</em> know what it meant to be an <a href=\"http://www.jesusjonesarchive.com/lyrics.htm#Info%20Freako\">Info Freako</a>.</p>\n<p>What changed in me?  I'm not quite sure.  I'm sure there's something going on with hormones and the few grey hairs I have now.  But I think it has something to do with <em>actually</em> starting to become a grownup.  That is, I'm paying taxes, I'm acting in the world, I have responsibilities, and I've left the shelter of my parents' house.  All the way from elementary school through college, I was on rails, and there wasn't much I needed to know other than what they were teaching to get by.  Now, though, I'm off the rails, and I feel I need all the information I can get, just to figure out how to navigate.  </p>\n<p>Maybe it's become obsessive, but I don't want to miss any vital data that will help lead me <a href=\"http://www.jcf.org/bliss.php\">toward my bliss</a>, to grow up without growing old.  And I know that, however small, my actions have consequence in the world, so I want to understand.  <a href=\"http://www.davidbrin.com/parting.html\">I am a member of a civilization.</a>  I think I get that now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So, anyway, if anything I'm just underscoring with my own experience that usage divide between youth and older info freako adults Danah wrote about.  I've been on both sides of it now, I think.  </p>\n<p>Where I think I disagree a bit is about trends: she asks if this Info Freako style of massive feed consumption will be relevant beyond the Web 2.0 crowd of today.  As an early adopter of a technologically-driven social life, I would have to guess that the current generation will produce some even more obsessive Info Freakos than the oldsters around today.  </p>\n<p>Because, if my own experience is any guide, we start off using the technology to talk to each other in tribes.  However, as (or, I guess, if) we grow up and become fully acting members of our civilization, we turn to the same sorts of tech to converse with the civilization itself.  Whether that will take the form of massive feed consumption, I don't know, because I have to assume the tech will be very much changed by then.  I can see the intimate communication habits progressing to civic and national and global communication habits, even in myself.  </p>\n<p>The problem, though, is that once you start making ventures out of your tribe, you start running into the <a href=\"http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/05/65/bbs00000565-00/bbs.dunbar.html\">limits of your neocortex</a>.  Communication must necessarily lose its intimacy and give way to group-to-group and one-to-many conversations.  That's where I see feeds coming in to supplement IM and email--though I certainly hope by then that there's a lot more intelligence behind feeds and microcontent routing and user interface, a lot of the principles will be the same.  </p>\n<p>But, in any case, I think we're in for some interesting history coming up, as more youths used to texting each other take up roles as members of civilization.</p>\n",

Check it out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take one <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/10/podcasts.opml\">list of RSS feeds in OPML</a>.</li>\n<li>Throw in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/10/opml-to-playlist.xsl\">a bit of XSLT</a>.</li>\n<li>Combine using <code>xsltproc</code> to make <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/10/podcasts.pls\">a playlist</a> that works in iTunes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And, oh yeah, I just happen to have an <code>xsltproc</code> web service laying around, so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supply a URL to your OPML in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/10/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.decafbad.com%2F2004%2F10%2Fopml-to-playlist.xsl\">this form</a>.</li>\n<li>Get a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/10/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.decafbad.com%2F2004%2F10%2Fopml-to-playlist.xsl&amp;xml=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.decafbad.com%2F2004%2F10%2Fpodcasts.opml\">freshly-built playlist</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, this has been barely tested and is the product of a ten-minute hacking session.  There are likely an enormous number of things wrong with this.  That said, iTunes does seem to open the playlist happily, and it looks like only new streams are added with repeated openings of the playlist.</p>\n<p>You will want to be careful to ensure that your OPML is valid XML (mine wasn't, on initial export from iPodderX - escape those freaking ampersands in URLs already!), and I have no idea what would happen if any of the RSS feeds in your subscriptions turn up invalid.  </p>\n<p>Have I mentioned that, despite their unforgiving and sometimes fragile nature, I love XML technologies?</p>\n<p>If this looks useful, maybe I'll work it over a bit more and pair it up with some python to handle actually downloading the MP3s and torrents.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Oh yeah, and I'm expecting this will be useful with an iTunes smart playlist crafted along these lines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date Added in the last 1 days</li>\n<li>Play Count is less than 1</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Update #2:</strong> Another use I just found for this playlist, is on my <a href=\"http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/\">Xbox Media Center</a>.  I generate this playlist via cronjob every few hours, and store it on an SMB share accessible to the XBMC.  Voila!  Listening to podcasts on my stereo system via the Xbox.  Yeah, nothing big, just kind of nifty.</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>So, over the last day or so, I've found myself falling for the <a href=\"http://www.ipodder.org/\">Podcasting</a> hype.  </p>\n<p>Yeah, yeah, I know -- I listened to and read <a href=\"http://www.idlewords.com/audio-manifesto.txt\">Maciej's audioblogging manifesto</a> (and, yes, that's a link to the <strong>text</strong> version, which kind of helps support the argument therein) but I think the addition of portable digital audio players and RSS feeds with enclosures to the mix changes things.  </p>\n<p>The whole audioblogging thing has seemed incredibly stupid and annoying to me, since my experience of it so far has mostly consisted of this:  I navigate first to a text blog entry, click on a link to an MP3, then stare at the screen as the thing plays.  Being a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/14/info_freako_or_whos_already_past_arguing_about_syndication_formats\">high-bandwidth Info Freako</a>, a feeling of time wasted comes upon me pretty quickly.  I can speed read and I want to get through this quickly, but I can't speed listen.  I want to throw a bookmark at <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">del.icio.us</a> if I like it, but I can't select any text.  Getting a bit bored, I start thinking about how maybe I might want to remix this crap, make a funky beat out of all the utterances of “um”, “ahh”, and “err”.</p>\n<p>So, yeah, this sucks.  Not picking on any particular audio blogger or post -- because they're almost all like this -- but I want that 4 minutes of my life back.</p>\n<p>But the thing is, I'm a news radio junkie.  I abandoned listening to music over the air almost seven years ago, so when I'm not listening to MP3 CDRs, my car tuner is almost perpetually locked on NPR.  I listen to people jabbering at me at almost all times while I'm driving.  And at work, I mix listening to my MP3s with streaming talk, news, and old sci-fi radio stations.</p>\n<p>The difference here is that radio doesn't demand much of my attention.  I'm usually doing something else while I'm listening, like driving or working.  I don't have to navigate to anything, I don't have to provide any feedback or make any decisions--I just have to let it stream into my head.  The lower mental demands of audio and a lack of necessary interaction dovetail nicely with multitasking.</p>\n<p>So, in come <a href=\"http://ipodderx.com/\">iPodderX</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ipodder.org/directory/4/ipodderSoftware\">friends</a>.  They're feed aggregators specifically built to slurp down audio enclosures and sync them up to audio players like the iPod.  The idea is that, when you leave home, you take the digital audio player with you, loaded up with your own personal radio programming.  Not having an iPod, I've been queuing these aggregated audio posts up in iTunes at work, and I've been playing around with burning CDRW's for use in my car's in-dash MP3 player.  Once I get a headphone adapter for my Treo 600, maybe I'll start listening to them on there.</p>\n<p>With this switch of perspective, I think I'm falling for the hype.  The key is to get out of the way: aggregate, queue, and play in the background.  Yeah, there's going to be a lot of awful crap out there, and lots of dorks eating breakfast and lipsmacking into the microphone as they blab (this is me, shuddering)--but as the number of podcasters expand, we will start to hear some <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/22/bloggingyourbliss\">blissful hams</a> showing up with things worth listening to.</p>\n<p>I'd like to do <em>something</em>, but I doubt I have the time or insight to produce something worth listening to on a regular basis.  <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/categories/dailySourceCode/\">Adam Curry</a> suggested doing things like a daily quote, jokes, or skits--short, good things have value.  (Pete's encounter with frozen pizza instructions on <a href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/200408.html#08192004073000\">Rasterweb Audio</a> made me snort a bit.)</p>\n<p>The first thing that comes to my mind are these old sci-fi radio broacasts to which I'm addicted.  While I have written stories of my own, I wonder how much public-domain or Creative Commons licensed content is out there available?  Could be fun to do some readings and a maybe do a little low-budget foley work.  Of course, there's the hosting and bandwidth to worry about, though I suppose BitTorrent could help if the aggregators support it (and they should!)</p>\n<p>In any case, I think the podcasters are on to something here.  I'll be listening.</p>\n",

So it looks like there are some people starting to follow to what I'm doing with <code>dbagg3</code>, and they're showing me how woefully prepared I am for the attention from tinkerers who are actually trying to, you know, <strong>run</strong> my code.  Things have been crazy busy for me at work, so I haven't been getting done what I've planned.  But, I do need to pull a few things together and clean a few things up.  I'll soon be answering the smattering of email I've gotten so far, but until then, a few quick thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>My source control is a bit of a mess at the moment.  Not only have I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/16/moving_time_from_cvs_to_subversion\">switched from CVS to SVN</a>-- but even if you followed me in that migration, I've not kept committed code in working order.  I already know that this is a horrible habit, but since no one's really been looking, I haven't been called on it until now.  (Heh, heh--d'oh.)  Planning this weekend (but hopefully today) to resolve this, so that moving forward, svn trunk will be (as far as possible) in a working state at any given moment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I've hacked one of my dependencies, SQLObject, by applying <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=9122066\">a patch</a> to support SELECT DISTINCT queries.  This has understandably caused problems for some people who have no idea what I did.  This patch has turned out to be essential, though I don't know if/when it will or would be included in a release of SQLObject.  So...  I wonder if I should dump my working copy of SQLObject into source control?  Otherwise, applying the DISTINCT patch to your SQLObject install should work.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>At some point very soon, I want to change the name of this thing to <strong>feedReactor</strong>.  Yes, I know there's already a <em>feedparser</em>, and a <em>feeddemon</em>, and a <em>feedburner</em>, and someone's probably got a <em>feedkitchensink</em> in the works, but I like this name and want to run with it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, in the meantime while I straighten some things out, please excuse the mess and thanks for bearing with me!</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>Got some very good work in this weekend on switching servers and getting <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg3/\"><code>dbagg3</code></a> in some semblance of working order somewhere other than on my overworked and decidedly non-publicly-demonstrable laptop.</p>\n<p>This stuff is so this side of premature, that I'm probably about to cause <a href=\"http://www.johncompanies.com\">JohnCompanies</a> to send hit-men out to cancel <strong>me</strong>, along with my hosting account (have I said that I <em>really</em> appreciate the help so far?).  But I just have to get this out: I'm easily excited by shiny code and gadgets, but it's so much easier to get excited when I can see something in working condition before taking a screwdriver to it.  So... remember <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/30/dbagg3_makingprogress\">when I mentioned all those URLs</a>?  They're working out nicely.</p>\n<p>First, check out a simple two-pane view of news items, ala <a href=\"http://www.bloglines.com/\">Bloglines</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml?xsl=xsl/two-pane/index.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml?xsl=xsl/two-pane/index.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taking this apart, you can see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A user account: <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml</a></li>\n<li>Some XSL: <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/xsl/two-pane/index.xsl\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/xsl/two-pane/index.xsl</a></li>\n<li>... and a specified content type (text/html)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your curiosity is piqued by this, view source and pay attention to link URLs.  It's more of the same:  XML produced by a REST API, passed through XSL, delivered as HTML.</p>\n<p>Here, take a look at another view on this demo user's aggregated items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/outliner/index.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/outliner/index.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, this only seems to be working decently with Firefox and Safari.  MSIE seems to be balking at the dynamic stuff, though I've had it working there in a previous incarnation of this code.  So hopefully this will be fixed soon.</p>\n<p>At any rate, what you should see is a single-pane outliner-style display of feed entries.  This is the style of aggregator UI I've been using for almost 3 years now.  Disclosure triangles open entries up to show summaries and further content.  “[seen]” links hide the entries, while “[queue]” hides an entry while tossing it into a queue for viewing later.</p>\n<p>Speaking of that, you can see what's in the queue right now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;show_queued=1\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;show_queued=1</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a display of queued entries, with another stylesheet applied that shows everything in a flat and open blog-like template.  It's not reverse-chronological, but that's not hard to accomplish with a flag or a tweak to an &lt;xsl:sort&gt; tag.  </p>\n<p>So that's just the start of things.  Remember <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/23/slicing_and_dicing_to_make_atom_soup_in_dbagg3\">when I was rambling on about XML storage and query</a>?  A URL like this is one product of that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),'OS%20X')]\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),'OS%20X')]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This should show you a flat listing of all entries whose titles contain “OS X”.  This is far from perfect, but it's very exciting to me-- it's got a lot of promise, stuff that first caught my eye when I saw <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/04/15/semanticblog.html\">Jon Udell playing</a> <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/06/10/xpathsearch.html?page=1\">awhile back</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, something that you might not notice until doing a bit more digging, is that all these attributes like “seen” and “query” are annotations made by the user on entries.  If you take a peek at <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/js/agg.js\">some of the Javascript</a> under the hood, you might notice some XmlHTTPRequest code going on.  To mark something as “seen” or “queued”, I POST XML to a URL like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The upshot of this is that these attributes are not limited to “seen” or “queued” flags-- in fact, these annotations can (well, in theory) be any pairing of arbitrary XML and a name.  This annotation then gets injected into the entry, when viewed by the user who owns the annotation, like so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In fact, you could invent a new annotation called 'tags' and filter for entries with this annotation with a URL like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry%5C_notes%5C_xpath=//dbagg3:note%5B@name='tags'\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry\\_notes\\_xpath=//dbagg3:note[@name='tags'</a> and contains(text(),'#food#') and contains(text(),'#odd#')]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eventually, what I'd <em>really</em> like to see this start doing is something akin to del.icio.us-style tagging while you're reading.  Then, you can have public queries that pull feeds based on your (and others') tags and spit things back out as feeds again with the proper XSL stylings.</p>\n<p>So at this point, it's all URLs and barely working HTML, but it's exciting to me at least.  And it's dogfood for me, since I'm using this crud to get my daily (hourly?) fix.  Pretty soon, I'll be diving into wrapping more of a proper usable web app around this, with user management and stuff that works in MSIE.  Until then, maybe someone else will see this and catch a buzz from it.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>Work has been insanely busy lately, but I have made some more progress with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg3/\"><code>dbagg3</code></a>.  The code is all in CVS, so feel free to take a gander-- I don't have a ton of time for a proper write up, but I do want to spew a little bit. </p>\n<p>As per my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/23/slicing_and_dicing_to_make_atom_soup_in_dbagg3\">previous musings on XML in a SQL database</a>, I revamped the database.  Now things are sliced up by feed and entry tables, rows in each containing a few metadata columns and then one big column for an XML dump.  This lets me index on  date and parent feed and such, meanwhile punting on the issue of dicing things like authors or content up further.  And, as extension elements start to show up, this handling is dumb enough to simply store things it doesn't know about without mangling them.  This is a very good thing and one of my big goals for this beast.</p>\n<p>The other thing that I'm getting excited about is the REST API built atop the Atom store.  Rather than spend time on proper documentation, here's a quick dump from the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/dbagg3/lib/dbagg3/rest.py\">appropriate module</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>URL: GET /feeds/\nURL: GET /feeds/{id}.xml\nURL: GET /feeds/{id}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hstart}-{hend}.xml\nURL: GET /feeds/{id}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hh}.xml\nURL: GET /feeds/{id}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}.xml\nURL: GET /feeds/{id}/{yyyy}/{mm}.xml\nURL: GET /feeds/{id}/now-{nowoff}.xml\nURL: GET /feeds/{fid}/entries/{eid}.xml\nURL: GET /users/\nURL: GET /users/{uname}.xml\nURL: POST /users/\nURL: DELETE /users/{uname}.xml\nURL: PUT /users/{uname}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/prefs.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/prefs/\nURL: POST /users/{uname}/prefs/{pname}.{type}\nURL: PUT /users/{uname}/prefs/{pname}.{type}\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/prefs/{pname}.{type}\nURL: DELETE /users/{uname}/prefs/{pname}.{type}\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions.{type}\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/\nURL: POST /users/{uname}/subscriptions/\nURL: DELETE /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{id}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{sid}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hstart}-{hend}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{sid}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hh}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{sid}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{sid}/{yyyy}/{mm}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{sid}/now-{hours}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{sid}/now.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hstart}-{hend}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hh}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{yyyy}/{mm}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/now-{hours}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/now.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{sid}/entries/{eid}.xml\n</code></pre>\n<p>Hopefully, the structure of these URL patterns make a little bit of sense.  The too-clever thing about these is that they're both documentation in the module's docstrings, and parsed out to register methods with automagically-generated regexes applied to incoming URL requests.  (I may eventually realize just how stupid an idea this is, but not yet.)  </p>\n<p>This list is nowhere near complete or final or even all that well thought out yet.  But, it seems to be working out pretty well so far, and it's so easy to tinker with the API to sketch out ideas in working code.  Eating my own dogfood, my first browser window of the day tends to open on this URL:</p>\n<pre><code>http://localhost/~deusx/dbagg3.5/api/users/default/subscriptions/\nnow-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;#38;content-type=text/html\n</code></pre>\n<p>This grabs the last 12 hours' worth of items from <code>default</code>'s subscriptions, passing them through the XSL at <code>xsl/full.xsl</code> on the way to my browser with a content type of <code>text/html</code>.  This tends to produce about 1000-1500 entries in about 15 seconds on my PowerBook, which is better than I'd expected.  </p>\n<p>Pretty soon, I'll be implementing the ability to post metadata onto feed entries under subscriptions.  Then, I can mark items as seen, attach categories, tags, and notes.  From there, I can exclude seen items from queries, produce new aggregate feeds based on my tagging or notes, among a few other ideas I've got stewing.</p>\n<p>A little more work, and I think I'll be able to throw together the beginnings of a <a href=\"http://www.bloglines.com\">Bloglines</a>-style three-pane browser interface, as well as improving the functionality of my own outliner-style display with <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html\">XmlHTTPRequest</a>-based calls to the API to enable refresh-free interaction.  From there, I have some ideas for desktop apps and maybe even some <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/19/flash_agg\">tinkering in Flash</a>.  (Wow... has it really been over a year since I was writing about Flash &amp; REST?)</p>\n<p>And <em>then</em>, I want to implement the Atom API and allow users to create feeds to which they can post their own items and share read-only with others (or share writing with a group).  From there, this thing can turn into a read/write Atom storage tank, serving both as an aggregator and a blog publishing engine, given the appropriate XSL work.</p>\n<p>Lots of ideas stewing.  Now I just have to get the time and possibly a new web server, since I'd like to eventually open up an installation of this to fellow tinkerers, but this poor little box can barely take what it's tasked with at present...</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and one other thing:  I've been thinking about names better than <code>dbagg3</code>.  The one that's sticking around in my head so far is <strong>feedReactor</strong>.  What do you think?</p>\n",
