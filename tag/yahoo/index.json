    "html": "<p>I&#39;m no longer at Yahoo! and I no longer work on <a href=\"http://delicious.com\">Delicious</a>, but I&#39;m still a huge supporter.  And, since I&#39;m pretty sure everyone over there is either burnt out or still insanely busy at the moment, it might be awhile before anyone tells the full story of what this relaunch offers.  As it is, even I only know a bit of what all went into this effort.</p>\n<p>So, off the top of my head, I thought I might point out <strong>just a few</strong> of the easily-missed improvements the new site offers beyond the great new love-it-or-hate-it visual redesign that seems to have occupied most of the discussion I&#39;ve seen so far:</p>\n<p><strong>Search works and is incredibly fast.</strong>  In fact, search may really be the real star of the redesign show here—especially since del.icio.us often took 30 seconds or more for a simple search, rendering it all but useless.  Today, though, it&#39;s at ludicrous speed in comparison—and so finally, the real power of search applied to social bookmarking might start to shine with the critical mass of content found by real people using Delicious.</p>\n<p>To scratch my own itch, I&#39;ve created <a href=\"http://mycroft.mozdev.org/developer/devlist.html?email=l.m.orchard%40pobox.com\">an unofficial OpenSearch search engine plugin for Delicious</a> on Mycroft.  Though I think it comes along with <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/tools\">the browser extensions</a>, I&#39;ve yet to find this for <a href=\"http://mycroft.mozdev.org/developer/hosting.html\">autodiscovery</a> from the site itself.</p>\n<p><strong>The notes field in bookmarks has been expanded from 255 to 1000 characters.</strong>  Yes, this means that you can now include long running quotes from pages, or complete paragraphs of rambling discourse. </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/feeds\">The feeds have all been overhauled and reorganized</a>.</strong>  An attempt at backward compatibility was made, but the old feed URLs are all deprecated.  Replacing these, there&#39;s now <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/feeds\">a common and consistent URL namespace for feeds across formats</a>.  </p>\n<p>Almost all RSS feeds have <a href=\"http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/\">JSONP</a> counterparts, and further feed formats could be considered.  Additionally, the old mix of RSS 1.0 and 2.0 has been dropped in favor of RSS 2.0 format across the board to support podcast and media enclosure elements consistently.  The <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/tools\">linkrolls, tagrolls, network badges, and tagometers</a> now all use the new JSONP feeds—and the widgets can be examined as example code in using the feeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Tag bundles can now be viewed as combined bookmark views, complete with feeds.</strong>  This augments bundles from a simple visual organization tool to a more powerful content aggregation function.  Personally, I never had much use for tag bundles until now, but since they can actually be used to partition tags and bookmarks I might actually take the time to use them.

From there, you can subscribe to those partitioned bookmarks in different folders in readers, or use the bundled bookmark views in mashups through JSON feeds.

I work at Yahoo! — so I guess I&#39;m vulnerable to bias — but it seems like the guys on this team just can&#39;t get a break.  They open up public suggestion boards to get open feedback on products — something that I think is very cool and clueful.  They took inspiration from Digg and other prior examples of web-based voting, and what do they get for their trouble?  A few hundred lemmings marching to the beat of &quot;OMFG HAX YOU STOLE DIGGS SITE!&quot;</p>\n<p>It&#39;s not a major news site; it&#39;s not like the front page of Yahoo! turned into a Digg clone and they started offering to pay top Digg users.  Seriously - it&#39;s just a suggestion board with simple flat comment threads that invites voting to surface good suggestions.  So it&#39;s got a big thumbs-up button reminiscent of <a href=\"http://digg.com\">Digg</a>&#39;s counter badges - they mentioned that it&#39;s like <a href=\"http://digg.com\">Digg</a>.

I work at Yahoo! — so I guess I'm vulnerable to bias — but it seems like the guys on this team just can't get a break.  They open up public suggestion boards to get open feedback on products — something that I think is very cool and clueful.  They took inspiration from Digg and other prior examples of web-based voting, and what do they get for their trouble?  A few hundred lemmings marching to the beat of \"OMFG HAX YOU STOLE DIGGS SITE!\"\r\n\r\nIt's not a major news site; it's not like the front page of Yahoo! turned into a Digg clone and they started offering to pay top Digg users.  Seriously - it's just a suggestion board with simple flat comment threads that invites voting to surface good suggestions.  So it's got a big thumbs-up button reminiscent of [Digg][]'s counter badges - they mentioned that it's like [Digg][].  That's inspiration, maybe flattery-level imitation.  But theft?  If I were a thief, would I tell you where I stole my stuff from?\r\n\r\n[digg]: http://digg.com\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082493\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://negatendo.net/~brett/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4c39d783a464ec45de052c62873b4ac0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://negatendo.net/~brett/\">Brett</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082493\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-02-15T17:06:18\">2007-02-15T17:06:18</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Digg always makes me think of: <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/01/mob_justice.html\n\">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/01/mob_justice.html</a></p>\n\n<p>\"piling on is safe and fun\"</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082494\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\">Craig</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082494\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-02-15T18:37:08\">2007-02-15T18:37:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Delete this if you think this is off topic, but am I the only person on the planet that doesn't quite understand the allure of Digg?

Well, <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo!

Consider an idempotent GET request as a pure function call with no side-effects.  Then, consider a GET request that accepts a URL as a parameter — it&#39;s a nested function call: the outer GET must make an inner GET to fetch the parameter-supplied URL.  Give the inner URL another URL as a parameter, and you&#39;ve got yet another nested function call.  </p>\n<p>But, if you like, ignore the theoretical <a href=\"http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html\">benefits of functional programming</a> — flip the nested function calls inside out and you&#39;ve got a pipe.
