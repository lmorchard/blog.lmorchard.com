ClaimID is a model - just as blogs enabled millions of people to share their voice online, claimID lets people have a way to approach their identity.  Simple? Yes - but that's the point.  There are tons of people out there who have stuff about them online (mailing list archives, blog comments) who don't have the time, desire or expertiese to create a myname.com site, or even a html list of links about themselves.  ClaimID is designed so that these people can have a dead simple solution for a fundamental need.  </p>\n<p>Of course, on top of that you do get value adds...the personal SEO stuff is nice, having your links tied together for search engines are nice, the microformats stuff, link status checking, having an OpenID, and so on - but the main experience is the simplicity.  For as important as identity is, most people really still aren't going out of their way to protect/defend their names.  Maybe this will change in the future, maybe it won't - but we are betting that the way to get people in the door, to start them thinking about the process is through simplicity.</p>\n<p>Honestly, though, we're still figuring all of this out.  Identity is huge, complicated, loaded with meaning and interpretation - and we aren't going to say that we've got all the answers.  But reading posts, responding, listening - we really feel like we're learning a lot.  Our goal down the road is for ClaimID to be a place where you can simply an easily have your identity needs met.  That said, we're still working on it, and thanks for being part of the process! </p>\n<p>Best,\nFred</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

So far [claimID][] seems to be good for just people finding out about me.\r\n\r\nBy the way, this is not criticism or a put-down of [claimID][] - this is me thinking out loud and puzzling it out.\r\n\r\n*Update:*  Although, I certainly understand the utility of [microID][] in replacing [blog posts like this one](http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron/2006/08/for_technorati.html).\r\n\r\n[bb]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/18/see-also\r\n[microid]: http://microid.org/\r\n[claimid]: http://claimid.org/\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083474\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://chimprawk.blogspot.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=77afe52123d8667fe867cf1a707e397b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://chimprawk.blogspot.com\">Fred</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083474\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-20T18:01:06\">2006-08-20T18:01:06</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>These are really quite valid questions, and stuff as important as identity does deserve our puzzling.  ClaimID is a model - just as blogs enabled millions of people to share their voice online, claimID lets people have a way to approach their identity.  Simple? Yes - but that's the point.  There are tons of people out there who have stuff about them online (mailing list archives, blog comments) who don't have the time, desire or expertiese to create a myname.com site, or even a html list of links about themselves.  ClaimID is designed so that these people can have a dead simple solution for a fundamental need.  </p>\n\n<p>Of course, on top of that you do get value adds...the personal SEO stuff is nice, having your links tied together for search engines are nice, the microformats stuff, link status checking, having an OpenID, and so on - but the main experience is the simplicity.  For as important as identity is, most people really still aren't going out of their way to protect/defend their names.  Maybe this will change in the future, maybe it won't - but we are betting that the way to get people in the door, to start them thinking about the process is through simplicity.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, though, we're still figuring all of this out.  Identity is huge, complicated, loaded with meaning and interpretation - and we aren't going to say that we've got all the answers.  But reading posts, responding, listening - we really feel like we're learning a lot.  Our goal down the road is for ClaimID to be a place where you can simply an easily have your identity needs met.  That said, we're still working on it, and thanks for being part of the process! </p>\n\n<p>Best,\nFred</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

I would contend that FOAF's expressivity actually relies far, far more, simply on XML's ability to namespace things, and thus allow for extensions.  Something that a simple XML dialect would also have, but with the added bonus of an infinitely simpler parser, fewer confused programmers, and quite a bit less bandwidth consumed.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085270\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://tantek.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02cd45622e90350cc061aaaa02229195&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://tantek.com/\">Tantek Çelik</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085270\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-20T07:22:55\">2006-08-20T07:22:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Indeed Les, this is exactly what <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard\" rel=\"nofollow\">hCard</a> solves on the Web with the minimum of duplication of data into hidden places and mimetype hackery/configuration (problems of the other approaches mentioned).</p>\n<p>You can either use a 3rd party service like claimID as mentioned to claim your various profiles on the Web, or you can simply continue to publish your profile information on your about or author page, simply add just a bit of hCard markup, and use <a href=\"http://www.gmpg.org/xfn/and/#idconsolidation\" rel=\"nofollow\">XFN Identity Consolidation</a> (rel=\"me\") to turn your about page into your consolidated identity hub.</p>\n<p>While services will undoubtedly continue to ask you a hundred profile questions, the better ones will do something as simple as use the simple open source <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/hkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">hKit Microformats Toolkit</a> by <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drew McLellan</a> to let you simply enter your hCard URL and fill out all the questions automatically from that.</p>\n<p>And the best services will help you, the user, keep your profile as portable as you would like it, by marking it up with hCard as well.  Already, profiles on numerous services, in addition to the abovementioned claimID, like <a href=\"http://flickr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flickr</a> and <a href=\"http://technorati.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Technorati</a> are marked up with hCard and thus ready for reuse with services that use hKit.</p>\n<p>Finally, some have brought up \"extensibility\" as something that is desirable yet recent lessons have taught us that in terms of standards and interoperability, the opposite is true.  The more well-defined not-infinitely-extensible a standard is, the sooner implementers know they are \"done\" implementing it (interoperably even!), and the less chance there is of a zillion non-interoperable extensions randomly emerging (i.e. Tower of Babel problem) which then cause headaches not only for all implementers, but users as well as the users then have to contend with their data not quite working interoperably across all the different services that all support slightly different sets of incompatible/non-interoperable extensions.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085272\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://macgirvin.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=74685c9f342f159611317a68c2655218&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://macgirvin.com\">Mike Macgirvin</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085272\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-22T20:38:14\">2006-08-22T20:38:14</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with Steve. Who am I? It depends. Who are you, and based on that - what do I wish you to know about me? Who are my friends? Same thing. Even if I wanted to divulge them, I then need to  respect their privacy wishes and decide if they want you to know that they are a friend of mine (or not) and how they came to be tagged as friends. A web service which tries to consolidate all of this info is presented with too many privacy conflicts to ever get it right (IMAO). I can recall this concept being tried by a hundred different companies (not to mention open source projects) going back to the early 90's. It was never an issue of technology. The hurdles are primarily social and revolve around trust and privacy - and delegation of these rights to third parties in language even my mother would understand.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085274\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dekoration.cc\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f67e69a66a666638b4e3ba3b9fa68eda&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dekoration.cc\">Wohnaccessoires</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085274\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-16T22:04:59\">2007-03-16T22:04:59</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>But you’re forgetting that a lot of people, myself included, like to represent themselves in different ways on different sites.

Indeed, they also help considerably with the problem of expressing this kind of machine-readable data in HTML. But \"FOAF would be a lot more useful if it didn’t rely on RDF.\" - the power, the expressivity of FOAF comes from RDF. </p>\n\n<p>I suspect Bob (like Mad William) may be assuming RDF (including FOAF) has to mean RDF/XML. But RDF is a model, it doesn't have to serialize to XML, there are other formats - including HTML (via <a href=\"http://research.talis.com/2005/erdf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">eRDF</a>). Note too that microformats like XFN and hCard can be interpreted as RDF (including FOAF terms as appropriate) with <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/spec\" rel=\"nofollow\">GRDDL</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(Incidentally I got to this post before even looking in my personal agg via Marc Canter's on <a href=\"http://planetweb20.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planet Web 2.0</a>)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085268\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e664d95e68ab4e364b35fabb89c8fdee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Steve</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085268\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-19T17:37:36\">2006-08-19T17:37:36</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>But you're forgetting that a lot of people, myself included, like to represent themselves in different ways on different sites.

I would contend that FOAF's expressivity actually relies far, far more, simply on XML's ability to namespace things, and thus allow for extensions.  Something that a simple XML dialect would also have, but with the added bonus of an infinitely simpler parser, fewer confused programmers, and quite a bit less bandwidth consumed.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085270\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://tantek.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02cd45622e90350cc061aaaa02229195&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://tantek.com/\">Tantek Çelik</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085270\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-20T07:22:55\">2006-08-20T07:22:55</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Indeed Les, this is exactly what <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard\" rel=\"nofollow\">hCard</a> solves on the Web with the minimum of duplication of data into hidden places and mimetype hackery/configuration (problems of the other approaches mentioned).</p>\n\n<p>You can either use a 3rd party service like claimID as mentioned to claim your various profiles on the Web, or you can simply continue to publish your profile information on your about or author page, simply add just a bit of hCard markup, and use <a href=\"http://www.gmpg.org/xfn/and/#idconsolidation\" rel=\"nofollow\">XFN Identity Consolidation</a> (rel=\"me\") to turn your about page into your consolidated identity hub.</p>\n\n<p>While services will undoubtedly continue to ask you a hundred profile questions, the better ones will do something as simple as use the simple open source <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/hkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">hKit Microformats Toolkit</a> by <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drew McLellan</a> to let you simply enter your hCard URL and fill out all the questions automatically from that.</p>\n\n<p>And the best services will help you, the user, keep your profile as portable as you would like it, by marking it up with hCard as well.  Already, profiles on numerous services, in addition to the abovementioned claimID, like <a href=\"http://flickr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flickr</a> and <a href=\"http://technorati.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Technorati</a> are marked up with hCard and thus ready for reuse with services that use hKit.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, some have brought up \"extensibility\" as something that is desirable yet recent lessons have taught us that in terms of standards and interoperability, the opposite is true.  The more well-defined not-infinitely-extensible a standard is, the sooner implementers know they are \"done\" implementing it (interoperably even!), and the less chance there is of a zillion non-interoperable extensions randomly emerging (i.e. Tower of Babel problem) which then cause headaches not only for all implementers, but users as well as the users then have to contend with their data not quite working interoperably across all the different services that all support slightly different sets of incompatible/non-interoperable extensions.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085272\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://macgirvin.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=74685c9f342f159611317a68c2655218&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://macgirvin.com\">Mike Macgirvin</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085272\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-22T20:38:14\">2006-08-22T20:38:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with Steve. Who am I? It depends. Who are you, and based on that - what do I wish you to know about me? Who are my friends? Same thing. Even if I wanted to divulge them, I then need to  respect their privacy wishes and decide if they want you to know that they are a friend of mine (or not) and how they came to be tagged as friends. A web service which tries to consolidate all of this info is presented with too many privacy conflicts to ever get it right (IMAO). I can recall this concept being tried by a hundred different companies (not to mention open source projects) going back to the early 90's. It was never an issue of technology. The hurdles are primarily social and revolve around trust and privacy - and delegation of these rights to third parties in language even my mother would understand.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085274\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://dekoration.cc\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f67e69a66a666638b4e3ba3b9fa68eda&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://dekoration.cc\">Wohnaccessoires</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085274\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-16T22:04:59\">2007-03-16T22:04:59</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>But you’re forgetting that a lot of people, myself included, like to represent themselves in different ways on different sites.
