Well, it needs to be said that there are some strings attached to playing in this field:  That is, these are Dave Winer&#39;s potato chips I&#39;m enjoying.  </p>\n<p>And, well, when you&#39;re taking chips from another another guy&#39;s lunchpail, it&#39;s customary to at least be nice to the guy and be gracious about the sharing.  Granted, when I&#39;m done, there could end up being <em>more</em> potato chips left in the bag than when I found it—that&#39;s the nature of this sort of sharing, after all.  But the bag, nonetheless, was brought to the table by Dave.  </p>\n<p>Although I&#39;ve tried to bow out of it over the past few years, I have historically been found amongst the crowd who&#39;ve been known to take pokes at Dave when it affords a run of chuckles or guffaws.  Sometimes, this has been in the pursuit of making a technical point or two in dramatic fashion—but often this has just been done toward the goals of playground-level politics and tit-for-tat.    </p>\n<p>Well, this crap doesn&#39;t suit me.  Or at least, I don&#39;t want to be suited for it.  You see, I really just care about being friendly, working on decent code—and besides, my <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/21/whats_your_winer_number\">Winer Number</a> is right around <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)\">Mu</a>.</p>\n<p>Although I&#39;ve been witness to many clashes of ego involving the man with others of strong ego, I&#39;ve never actually been the personal victim of any slight from Mr. Winer that I care to count or remember.  It&#39;s been fashionable to poke at him, but my goal is to keep my ego at a calm distance from most things in life and I&#39;ve not got any personal gripes with Dave Winer.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, when I look at my career over the last few years, I see plain evidence that I&#39;ve benefitted well from the man&#39;s influence—even if indirectly from his work.  I&#39;ve successfully profited from implementations of XML-RPC and RSS.

Yeah, aggregators can already import and export OPML subscription lists—but I've never seen this feature *automated by subscription* until now.    This is the difference between an MP3 download and a **podcast**.\r\n\r\nAnd, if you check out the above-quoted blog post, these could even be *collaboratively maintained* by way of del.icio.us and a simple RSS-to-OPML gateway service.  I've got to say, this could be one of the niftiest bits of mojo to hit syndication and aggregation tech in awhile.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: syndication opml readinglists delicious rss atom newsriver  -->\r\n\r\n[sron]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/01/new-feed-reader-ideas-for-the-new-year\r\n[gro]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/11/27/i-wish-it-were-in-xoxo\r\n[nr]: http://www.newsriver.org/\r\n[opml]: http://www.opml.org/\r\n[dave]: http://scripting.wordpress.com/2005/12/29/why-im-working-on-an-aggregator/\r\n",
