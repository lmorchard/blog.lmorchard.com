          <title>Reviving my C64 history with a uIEC/SD</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;ve lived a very focused life. &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital&quot;&gt;From very early on&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;apos;ve been learning to make computers do things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And being as introspective as I am, I like spending time considering how I got here.  I suppose this is nostalgia, but I like to think of it as recentering and recapitulation. Contemplating the story so far, as a means to consider the story yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One huge benefit of this habit is that I&amp;apos;ve become ever more appreciative of today.  It&amp;apos;s easy to forget, but we&amp;apos;re living in the future these days&amp;#x2014;at least, with respect to &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital&quot;&gt;who I was in 1983&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No flying cars yet, but for US$55 I was able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbrain.net/products/uIEC%7B47%7DSD.html&quot;&gt;buy a tiny gadget called a uIED/SD&lt;/a&gt; that gives a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64&quot;&gt;Commodore 64&lt;/a&gt; access to modern SD cards for storage.  And, of course, I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2503&quot;&gt;Jason Scott&amp;apos;s review of the more general-use FC5025 5.25? Floppy to USB Adapter&lt;/a&gt; to blame in getting me started on this current mini-obsession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to talk about a magical device? Screw the iPad&amp;#x2014;this is magic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
