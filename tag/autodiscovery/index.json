    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>Browsers need help doing a better job using feeds for discovery, aggregation, and publishing on the web to keep us from swimming into self-destructing lobster traps.</em></p>\n<p>Last week, I wrote <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967\">some blog posts</a> about <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967\">Bug 578967</a>, wherein the feed auto-discovery icon in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">Firefox 4</a> has been moved off the URL bar and hidden by default. I support that decision of <a href=\"http://planet.firefox.com/ux/\">the UX team</a>, because <a href=\"https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/\">that feed button is a slacker</a>. And even if it does get used, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/what-happened-to-feed-autodiscovery-in-firefox-4#serving\">I&#39;m not a fan of what it does anyway</a>.</p>\n<p>But, I&#39;ve got lots more rattling around in my head about this stuff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-the-point-of-feeds\">What&#39;s the point of feeds?</h3>\n<p>Feeds—that&#39;s RSS and Atom and maybe even JSON—let robots pull lots of stuff from a bunch of places and pile it all together in one spot for your perusal, analysis, and remixing pleasure. Feed readers and news aggregators do the surfing for you, so you don&#39;t have to.</p>\n<p>But, Twitter and Facebook and others have managed to make <em>the people themselves</em> all gather in one spot. So, to see what those people are saying and doing, you just have to go <em>there</em>—kind of like what feeds promised, right? Only, you go <em>there</em> rather than all that stuff coming <em>here</em>.</p>\n<p>The problem is, even if the logo says it <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dunstan/524137648/\">loves you</a>, the people who made it say that <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/\">won&#39;t always stay in charge</a>. And, someday, when whomever&#39;s left rides off into the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/\">sunset</a>, you&#39;ll learn how much <a href=\"http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Why_Back_Up%3F\">they didn&#39;t care about you</a> in the end.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/herzogbr/2261662706/\" title=\"Flickr Loves You by herzogbr, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2003/2261662706_db086ea4bb_m.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"64\" alt=\"Flickr Loves You\" /></a> <strong style=\"font-size: 200%; padding: 0.5em;\">vs</strong> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/en-us/flickr-yahoo-logo.png\" height=\"50\" style=\"padding: 7px; background: #fff\"></a></p>\n\n<p>For some people and some places, that&#39;s no big tragedy. It&#39;s just a party; you go home when it&#39;s over. You made memories, you hope to find some of those people again elsewhere. <a href=\"http://blog.pownce.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-hello-six-apart/\">Pownce croaked</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/09/six-apart-shuts-down-vox/\">so did Vox</a>, but who cares? There&#39;s always Twitter next door for the afterparty.</p>\n<p>But, what if a world you lived in <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2444\">evaporated while you were on vacation elsewhere for the holidays</a>? I guess you could say that was just a game and, again, who cares?</p>\n<p>What if <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a> went away just like that? People are not only partying there—they&#39;re leaving their visual memories at the coat check. Things are a little more real there, by some definitions thereof.</p>\n<p>What if you never swam into that <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848\">lobster trap</a>, though? What if your words and images and creations were borrowed and copied, but never wholly kept in someone else&#39;s bucket? What if <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a> were just like <a href=\"http://google.com\">Google Search</a>? That is, a collector and an index—but never the host—of photos and conversations?</p>\n<p>Feeds can help make that happen, but not by themselves.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-feeds-belong-in-the-browser\">Do feeds belong in the browser?</h3>\n<p>Well, yeah. Would sites like Twitter and Facebook have been as successful if feeds worked better in the browser? I think so. But, by working better, I don&#39;t just mean improvements to that funky blue thing that showed up in the location bar every now and then. No, I mean all of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Discovery</strong> — help me find and follow interesting people and things</li>\n<li><strong>Aggregation</strong> — give me one spot where what I find and follow is delivered to me</li>\n<li><strong>Publishing</strong> — enable me to post things where people (and their agents) can find and follow</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To me, this is where Twitter and Facebook are totally nailing it. But, much of this can happen in the browser, and I think more of it should. Projects like <a href=\"http://www.rockmelt.com/\">RockMelt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flock.com/\">Flock</a> have seemed promising to me in this context, but have yet to really thrill me. I don&#39;t think they go far enough.</p>\n<p>There is a point where the rubber (client) meets the road (server)—but that point can live <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/howToShareABucketOnS3.html\">so much farther down the stack than it does now</a>. Mind you, I don&#39;t want a revival of <a href=\"http://www.zisman.ca/netgold/\">Netscape Gold</a> as such—but recall that <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm\">&quot;the first browser was an editor, it was a writer as well as a reader&quot;</a>.</p>\n<p>We need some services and hosts out there as rendezvous points for our browsers and agents, but we really don&#39;t need any of those services to collapse into <a href=\"http://buddycloud.com/cms/content/we-are-aol-days-social-networking\">the next all-encompassing AOL-style singularity</a>. There&#39;s money to be made there, but most of us are the product.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whose-job-is-it-anyway\">Whose job is it anyway?</h3>\n<p>I&#39;d like to see my employer, Mozilla, do more with feeds in the browser—and I suspect we will. <a href=\"http://mozillalabs.com/blog/2010/03/online-identity-concept-series/\">Mozilla Labs has had some interesting Concept Series topics</a>, and I look forward to seeing some of those things get pursued further. If I can carve out the time, I wouldn&#39;t mind helping.</p>\n<p>Something I find interesting about feed auto-discovery—the thing that started this latest round of buzz—is that it didn&#39;t originate with browser makers. <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery\">RSS auto-discovery</a> was itself discovered <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/31/oooago\">by bloggers</a>, way back in 2002. It wasn&#39;t until we sussed out the details of that <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links\">HTML link tag</a> and shoved it into our pages that browsers like Firefox started looking for it.</p>\n<p>Hell, even though <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss#History\">RSS started with Netscape</a>, it took <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss.html\">Dave Winer and UserLand and friends running with it</a> to keep it alive and kicking. Now, Dave&#39;s <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/krocCamenProvesRssIsVeryMu.html\">suggested forking an open source browser</a> to show Mozilla how it&#39;s done. I support the sentiment, but there are easier ways to go about this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"making-it-your-job\">Making it your job</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply\">Christopher Blizzard</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>We created add-ons with the original Firefox as a way to be able to say “no” in a constructive manner. If you want something that you think is important to you, you can make an add-on.</blockquote>\n\n<p>That could be taken as a cop-out, but it&#39;s not. With the efforts behind <a href=\"https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/\">Jetpack</a>—now just <em>the</em> <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/12/09/announcing-add-on-sdk-1-0b1/\">Add-on SDK</a>—building add-ons for Firefox is being made easier. Rather than dealing with a morass of XUL and obscure APIs that I know has scared me personally away all these years, you can now do most everything you&#39;d like though <a href=\"https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/sdk/1.0b1/docs/#package/addon-kit\">much-simplified JavaScript APIs</a> and HTML/CSS.</p>\n<p>In other words, if you are a web developer—albeit a fairly advanced one—you can make an add-on for Firefox. Hopefully, as the Add-on SDK advances, the bar to participation will continue to drop.</p>\n<h3 id=\"to-be-continued\">To be continued</h3>\n<p>I&#39;m running out of steam and it&#39;s time for bed, so I think I&#39;ll just trail off for now. I do have a bit more in me, though. The next thing is about taking my own advice in that last section and making some of this <em>my</em> job to fix.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086137\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=52674e2ce2d7671878b26ed534b0c662&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Majken \"Lucy\" Connor</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T06:38:04\">2011-01-27T06:38:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Yay!</p>\n<p>Feeds are soo soo soooo great, but not as live bookmarks. Google Reader is the place to be in terms of functionality, but there's no reason I have to put everything through google.</p>\n<p>When I find a site I like, why should I have to go to it to check for new content? A feed reader brings it to <em>me</em> AND it remembers where I was. I've been trying to get my kids hooked on it, though they seem to forget about it.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the kids, their teachers are getting all technical and they post the homework online, but I've been pulling my hair out for 2 years trying to get them to do it in a way that enables feeds. Several nights it happened that they didn't write down what they had and then we had to remember to check periodically because the homework wasn't updated right away.  </p>\n<p>Right now they're sent home with books with it all written down and I'm supposed to sign that I saw it, but who remembers to look at a book all the time? It's such a complicated process - kids have to write it down in the first place, then one of us has to remember to show it to me. FEEDS!!! No one has to remember, it just shows up where I'm already looking!</p>\n<p>So glad you're on board.</p></div>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086159\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086159\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T20:54:22\">2011-01-27T20:54:22</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Not sure if the homework lists online are behind a login or not, but if it's in HTML we can hack a feed out of it :)</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086141\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=adfd6aa4efe2aa64f5e091abf07f2766&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Bee</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086141\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T08:13:46\">2011-01-27T08:13:46</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>\"Discovery — help me find and follow interesting people and things\nAggregation — give me one spot where what I find and follow is delivered to me\nPublishing — enable me to post things where people (and their agents) can find and follow\"\n..

It also has some rudimentary publishing stuff, although IIRC it's in the form of a public RSS feed that other people subscribe to.

Whats your opinion on FF (and other browsers) handling of the direct feed url?\nI've long wanted browsers to back off from forcing their own baked-in handling (stylesheets, functionality etc).\nI've just wanted the simple alert dialog (now standardized for all alerts like geolocation, passwords etc) to appear when necessary before the browser takes over (Like you include with Fireriver auto-discovery).</p>\n<p>The obvious example is when a feed specifies its own XSL stylesheet but FF ignores this instruction and the sniffer only cares about the presence of the &lt;rss or &lt;feed element before treating this &#039;document&#039; differently than any other XML document.  This can be overcome with some hacks but that is a moot point.</p>\n<p>Ideally, the browser will adhere to the content publisher&#039;s (or feed generator&#039;s) instructions on how to handle the presentation of the data.  That plus XSLT is a W3C standard.</p>\n<p>Definitely interested in your thoughts on this angle of the &quot;feeds in browser&quot; discussion.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Sull</p></div>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086158\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086158\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T20:52:52\">2011-01-27T20:52:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/02/firefox-20-breaks-client-side-xsl-for-rss-and-atom-feeds\" rel=\"nofollow\">I'm not a fan of the built-in stylesheet for feeds</a>.

You send a message to a server, which then sends it to their server, and eventually their mail client picks it up. There are intermediaries.</p>\n<p>BitTorrent relies on trackers (ie. rendezvous points) before you can start transferring chunks, though the distributed hash stuff helps get away from that. But, if all that were easy (including discovery), it would have taken off long, long ago.</p>\n<p>You can't go P2P for everything, at least not easily. Not every P is online at all times, so we need store-and-forward services. Some P's have multiple devices and agents, and most of those are behind firewalls and NAT. So, we need servers out there as accessible fixed points that are (mostly) always available. We can try to build P2P meshes that do the same thing, but servers are simpler.</p>\n<p>And, yeah, I do believe that running your own server is the ultimate solution. Or, at least, finding someone to run it for you who cares about keeping it up, whether through direct payment or other direct incentive (ie. they're family or friends). Otherwise, you still have the problem where what they care about doesn't match what you care about (eg. ad supported services).\n</p><p>But, with the way the user agent picture is splitting up across devices (eg. the cloud, ambient computing), I don't think Firefox will ever be the server. Even if you connect user agents together with something like Jabber/XMPP, you still need a server out there—though at least that's pushing things in the right direction, since an XMPP server can be agnostic about the messages that go through it</p>\n<p>I do have another blog post rattling around in my head about hosting.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>Browsers need help doing a better job using feeds for discovery, aggregation, and publishing on the web to keep us from swimming into self-destructing lobster traps.</em>\r\n\r\nLast week, I wrote [some blog posts](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discovery icon in [Firefox 4](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been moved off the URL bar and hidden by default. I support that decision of [the UX team](http://planet.firefox.com/ux/), because [that feed button is a slacker](https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/). And even if it does get used, [I'm not a fan of what it does anyway](http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/what-happened-to-feed-autodiscovery-in-firefox-4#serving).\r\n\r\nBut, I've got lots more rattling around in my head about this stuff.\r\n\r\n### What's the point of feeds?\r\n\r\nFeeds—that's RSS and Atom and maybe even JSON—let robots pull lots of stuff from a bunch of places and pile it all together in one spot for your perusal, analysis, and remixing pleasure. Feed readers and news aggregators do the surfing for you, so you don't have to.\r\n\r\nBut, Twitter and Facebook and others have managed to make *the people themselves* all gather in one spot. So, to see what those people are saying and doing, you just have to go *there*—kind of like what feeds promised, right? Only, you go *there* rather than all that stuff coming *here*.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, even if the logo says it [loves you](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dunstan/524137648/), the people who made it say that [won't always stay in charge](http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/). And, someday, when whomever's left rides off into the [sunset](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/), you'll learn how much [they didn't care about you](http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Why_Back_Up%3F) in the end.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/herzogbr/2261662706/\" title=\"Flickr Loves You by herzogbr, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2003/2261662706_db086ea4bb_m.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"64\" alt=\"Flickr Loves You\" /></a> <strong style=\"font-size: 200%; padding: 0.5em;\">vs</strong> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/en-us/flickr-yahoo-logo.png\" height=\"50\" style=\"padding: 7px; background: #fff\"></a></p>\r\n\r\nFor some people and some places, that's no big tragedy. It's just a party; you go home when it's over. You made memories, you hope to find some of those people again elsewhere. [Pownce croaked](http://blog.pownce.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-hello-six-apart/), and [so did Vox](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/09/six-apart-shuts-down-vox/), but who cares? There's always Twitter next door for the afterparty.\r\n\r\nBut, what if a world you lived in [evaporated while you were on vacation elsewhere for the holidays](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2444)? I guess you could say that was just a game and, again, who cares?\r\n\r\nWhat if [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) went away just like that? People are not only partying there—they're leaving their visual memories at the coat check. Things are a little more real there, by some definitions thereof.\r\n\r\nWhat if you never swam into that [lobster trap](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848), though? What if your words and images and creations were borrowed and copied, but never wholly kept in someone else's bucket? What if [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) were just like [Google Search](http://google.com)? That is, a collector and an index—but never the host—of photos and conversations?\r\n\r\nFeeds can help make that happen, but not by themselves.\r\n\r\n### Do feeds belong in the browser?\r\n\r\nWell, yeah. Would sites like Twitter and Facebook have been as successful if feeds worked better in the browser? I think so. But, by working better, I don't just mean improvements to that funky blue thing that showed up in the location bar every now and then. No, I mean all of the following:\r\n\r\n* **Discovery** — help me find and follow interesting people and things\r\n* **Aggregation** — give me one spot where what I find and follow is delivered to me\r\n* **Publishing** — enable me to post things where people (and their agents) can find and follow\r\n\r\nTo me, this is where Twitter and Facebook are totally nailing it. But, much of this can happen in the browser, and I think more of it should. Projects like [RockMelt](http://www.rockmelt.com/) and [Flock](http://www.flock.com/) have seemed promising to me in this context, but have yet to really thrill me. I don't think they go far enough.\r\n\r\nThere is a point where the rubber (client) meets the road (server)—but that point can live [so much farther down the stack than it does now](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/howToShareABucketOnS3.html). Mind you, I don't want a revival of [Netscape Gold](http://www.zisman.ca/netgold/) as such—but recall that [\"the first browser was an editor, it was a writer as well as a reader\"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm).\r\n\r\nWe need some services and hosts out there as rendezvous points for our browsers and agents, but we really don't need any of those services to collapse into [the next all-encompassing AOL-style singularity](http://buddycloud.com/cms/content/we-are-aol-days-social-networking). There's money to be made there, but most of us are the product.\r\n\r\n### Whose job is it anyway?\r\n\r\nI'd like to see my employer, Mozilla, do more with feeds in the browser—and I suspect we will. [Mozilla Labs has had some interesting Concept Series topics](http://mozillalabs.com/blog/2010/03/online-identity-concept-series/), and I look forward to seeing some of those things get pursued further. If I can carve out the time, I wouldn't mind helping.\r\n\r\nSomething I find interesting about feed auto-discovery—the thing that started this latest round of buzz—is that it didn't originate with browser makers. [RSS auto-discovery](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery) was itself discovered [by bloggers](http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/31/oooago), way back in 2002. It wasn't until we sussed out the details of that [HTML link tag](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links) and shoved it into our pages that browsers like Firefox started looking for it.\r\n\r\nHell, even though [RSS started with Netscape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss#History), it took [Dave Winer and UserLand and friends running with it](http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss.html) to keep it alive and kicking. Now, Dave's [suggested forking an open source browser](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/krocCamenProvesRssIsVeryMu.html) to show Mozilla how it's done. I support the sentiment, but there are easier ways to go about this.\r\n\r\n### Making it your job\r\n\r\n[Christopher Blizzard](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply):\r\n<blockquote>We created add-ons with the original Firefox as a way to be able to say “no” in a constructive manner. If you want something that you think is important to you, you can make an add-on.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat could be taken as a cop-out, but it's not. With the efforts behind [Jetpack](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/)—now just *the* [Add-on SDK](http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/12/09/announcing-add-on-sdk-1-0b1/)—building add-ons for Firefox is being made easier. Rather than dealing with a morass of XUL and obscure APIs that I know has scared me personally away all these years, you can now do most everything you'd like though [much-simplified JavaScript APIs](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/sdk/1.0b1/docs/#package/addon-kit) and HTML/CSS.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if you are a web developer—albeit a fairly advanced one—you can make an add-on for Firefox. Hopefully, as the Add-on SDK advances, the bar to participation will continue to drop.\r\n\r\n### To be continued\r\n\r\nI'm running out of steam and it's time for bed, so I think I'll just trail off for now. I do have a bit more in me, though. The next thing is about taking my own advice in that last section and making some of this *my* job to fix.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086137\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=52674e2ce2d7671878b26ed534b0c662&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Majken \"Lucy\" Connor</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T06:38:04\">2011-01-27T06:38:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Yay!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feeds are soo soo soooo great, but not as live bookmarks.

Whats your opinion on FF (and other browsers) handling of the direct feed url?\r\nI've long wanted browsers to back off from forcing their own baked-in handling (stylesheets, functionality etc).\r\nI've just wanted the simple alert dialog (now standardized for all alerts like geolocation, passwords etc) to appear when necessary before the browser takes over (Like you include with Fireriver auto-discovery).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The obvious example is when a feed specifies its own XSL stylesheet but FF ignores this instruction and the sniffer only cares about the presence of the &lt;rss or &lt;feed element before treating this &#039;document&#039; differently than any other XML document.  This can be overcome with some hacks but that is a moot point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally, the browser will adhere to the content publisher&#039;s (or feed generator&#039;s) instructions on how to handle the presentation of the data.  That plus XSLT is a W3C standard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Definitely interested in your thoughts on this angle of the &quot;feeds in browser&quot; discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sull</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086158\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086158\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T20:52:52\">2011-01-27T20:52:52</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/02/firefox-20-breaks-client-side-xsl-for-rss-and-atom-feeds\" rel=\"nofollow\">I'm not a fan of the built-in stylesheet for feeds</a>.

You send a message to a server, which then sends it to their server, and eventually their mail client picks it up. There are intermediaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BitTorrent relies on trackers (ie. rendezvous points) before you can start transferring chunks, though the distributed hash stuff helps get away from that. But, if all that were easy (including discovery), it would have taken off long, long ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can't go P2P for everything, at least not easily. Not every P is online at all times, so we need store-and-forward services. Some P's have multiple devices and agents, and most of those are behind firewalls and NAT. So, we need servers out there as accessible fixed points that are (mostly) always available. We can try to build P2P meshes that do the same thing, but servers are simpler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, yeah, I do believe that running your own server is the ultimate solution. Or, at least, finding someone to run it for you who cares about keeping it up, whether through direct payment or other direct incentive (ie. they're family or friends). Otherwise, you still have the problem where what they care about doesn't match what you care about (eg. ad supported services).\r\n</p><p>But, with the way the user agent picture is splitting up across devices (eg. the cloud, ambient computing), I don't think Firefox will ever be the server. Even if you connect user agents together with something like Jabber/XMPP, you still need a server out there—though at least that's pushing things in the right direction, since an XMPP server can be agnostic about the messages that go through it</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do have another blog post rattling around in my head about hosting. It's too hard right now; charging money smothers a lot of use; etc.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086173\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vocal.ly\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8b71ac29d4c8fbc68955337e5143d549&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vocal.ly\">@sull</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086173\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-28T21:17:32\">2011-01-28T21:17:32</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Opera Unite is out there but it too leverages a centralized service as a proxy.

    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>The feed button is not dead; it&#39;s just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it&#39;s not pulling its weight up front. This post discusses how you can still use feed auto-discovery, even restoring the icon to the toolbar with a few clicks and a drag.</em></p>\n<p>There&#39;s <a href=\"http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply\">a brouhaha</a> about <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967\">Bug 578967</a>, wherein the feed auto-discover icon in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a> has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, <em>and</em> a Mozilla employee—I&#39;ve got at least a few opinions.</p>\n<p>This post is one of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967\">several on this subject</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feeds-are-too-ubiquitous-to-need-an-indicator\">Feeds are too ubiquitous to need an indicator</h3>\n<p>Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it&#39;s simpler to assume every site has one, rather than keeping an un-lit indicator around to tell you when one&#39;s missing. So, Firefox 4 has an option in the bookmark menu to subscribe to the current page:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-002.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-00.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\n\n<p>The only indicator of a missing feed is that the menu item greys out. Since feeds are everywhere, you should feel comfortable reaching for that subscription menu whenever you like. Of course, this assumes that subscribing to a page falls into the same thought process as bookmarking it—but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an unreasonable notion.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you didn&#39;t know that subscribing to a page was possible—or if you worry there might be people (ie. the potential readers of your feeds) who are in that position—this change may seem problematic. </p>\n<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an unreasonable notion, either. But, I&#39;ll get back to that in a future post.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-feed-icon-isnt-dead-its-just-hiding\">The feed icon isn&#39;t dead, it&#39;s just hiding</h3>\n<p>Even with the new bookmark menu item, the feed subscription button is still available and ready to return to your toolbar in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a>.</p>\n<p>First, right-click somewhere in the empty space of your Firefox 4 toolbar. Try somewhere after the tabs, or somewhere between the toolbar buttons. <a href=\"http://blog.fligtar.com/2011/01/16/how-to-customize-firefox-4s-ui/\">This is how it works on Windows</a>, and this is what it looks like on my Mac:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"220\" height=\"161\" />\n\n<p>Click Customize, and you&#39;ll get a panel like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-01.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\n\n<p>This lets you customize which buttons and controls appear on the toolbar. If you scroll down in the panel, you&#39;ll see a &quot;<strong>Subscribe</strong>&quot; button. Drag that from the panel to a position in the toolbar, and you&#39;ll get a result like this:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-02.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-02.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\n\n<p>Click &quot;<strong>Done</strong>&quot;, and your browser should end up like this:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-03.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-03.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"203\" />\n\n<p>I took my browser screenshots with <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/15/mozillaPleaseKeepTheRssIco.html\">Dave Winer&#39;s screenshot of the old Firefox feed icon</a> for comparison. The result is different, but not radically so. It even enables and darkens when you visit a site with a feed:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-04.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-04.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"271\" />\n\n<p>The main difference is that Dave&#39;s screenshot is the default in Firefox 3.6, whereas mine is the result of the last few screenshots of toolbar customization in Firefox 4 beta 9. That customization is easy, if you know it&#39;s possible—but the worry is, as they say: out of sight, out of mind. </p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082410\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e0ad94a966cfab0b02d938e4bf9cd1c1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\">Felix Pleșoianu</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082410\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T08:00:44\">2011-01-16T08:00:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I have to take issue with some of your points, based on my personal experience. :)</p>\n<p>\"Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it’s simpler to assume every site has one,\"</p>\n<p>Um, no. I follow a hundred webcomics, and while the situation has gotten better recently, many of them still don't have a feed. That's not unique to webcomics, either. Lack of a newsfeed is common enough that being able to tell at first glace is very useful. Heck, many people, even website owners, are ignorant of RSS. More about that in a moment.</p>\n<p>Besides, the feed button serves a second purpose, which is to allow easy access to the feed. Just as I don't want to hunt for an \"RSS\" or \"XML\" link inside the website, I don't want to hunt for it in the browser's interface.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, many people still don't know about RSS. That big prominent orange icon is a big auto-discovery feature, not just in the technical sense, but also because a newbie could see it and click it out of curiosity, and thus learn about feeds. I had to explain what RSS is to someone whose browser didn't have one, and that proved to be quite difficult.</p>\n<p>Of course, all this talk is for nothing as the decision has already been made but, you know. Just my two cents.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082411\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.factoetum.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d7a5934cd119837d75f98dc7e99043d8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.factoetum.com\">Bruce Wayne</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082411\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T11:34:59\">2011-01-16T11:34:59</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Nice explaination\nBut by removing the rss indicator Firefox has shifted content aggregation control from an open browser to closed siloed companies.\nThere is no valid excuse for this....

A built-in HTTP server would be a good start (is there one yet?), plus support for (say) Atom protocol for shoving data out. This could make it a lot easier to work with semi-social sites like del.icio.us and Bloglines. It's notable that these kind of tools have traditionally been very server-driven, with browsers playing (limited) catch up with plugins. Why can't the client set the agenda for a while?</p></div>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082451\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082451\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-19T03:16:41\">2011-01-19T03:16:41</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>FWIW: Firefox Sync does some shifting of things to the web.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>The feed button is not dead; it's just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it's not pulling its weight up front. This post discusses how you can still use feed auto-discovery, even restoring the icon to the toolbar with a few clicks and a drag.</em>\r\n\r\nThere's [a brouhaha](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discover icon in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, *and* a Mozilla employee—I've got at least a few opinions.\r\n\r\nThis post is one of [several on this subject](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967).\r\n\r\n### Feeds are too ubiquitous to need an indicator\r\n\r\nFeeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it's simpler to assume every site has one, rather than keeping an un-lit indicator around to tell you when one's missing. So, Firefox 4 has an option in the bookmark menu to subscribe to the current page:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-002.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-00.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\r\n\r\nThe only indicator of a missing feed is that the menu item greys out. Since feeds are everywhere, you should feel comfortable reaching for that subscription menu whenever you like. Of course, this assumes that subscribing to a page falls into the same thought process as bookmarking it—but I don't think that's an unreasonable notion.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you didn't know that subscribing to a page was possible—or if you worry there might be people (ie. the potential readers of your feeds) who are in that position—this change may seem problematic. \r\n\r\nI don't think that's an unreasonable notion, either. But, I'll get back to that in a future post.\r\n\r\n### The feed icon isn't dead, it's just hiding\r\n\r\nEven with the new bookmark menu item, the feed subscription button is still available and ready to return to your toolbar in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/).\r\n\r\nFirst, right-click somewhere in the empty space of your Firefox 4 toolbar. Try somewhere after the tabs, or somewhere between the toolbar buttons. [This is how it works on Windows](http://blog.fligtar.com/2011/01/16/how-to-customize-firefox-4s-ui/), and this is what it looks like on my Mac:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"220\" height=\"161\" />\r\n\r\nClick Customize, and you'll get a panel like this:\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-01.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThis lets you customize which buttons and controls appear on the toolbar. If you scroll down in the panel, you'll see a \"**Subscribe**\" button. Drag that from the panel to a position in the toolbar, and you'll get a result like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-02.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-02.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\r\n\r\nClick \"**Done**\", and your browser should end up like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-03.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-03.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"203\" />\r\n\r\nI took my browser screenshots with [Dave Winer's screenshot of the old Firefox feed icon](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/15/mozillaPleaseKeepTheRssIco.html) for comparison. The result is different, but not radically so. It even enables and darkens when you visit a site with a feed:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-04.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-04.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"271\" />\r\n\r\nThe main difference is that Dave's screenshot is the default in Firefox 3.6, whereas mine is the result of the last few screenshots of toolbar customization in Firefox 4 beta 9. That customization is easy, if you know it's possible—but the worry is, as they say: out of sight, out of mind. \r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082410\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e0ad94a966cfab0b02d938e4bf9cd1c1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\">Felix Pleșoianu</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082410\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T08:00:44\">2011-01-16T08:00:44</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I have to take issue with some of your points, based on my personal experience. :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it’s simpler to assume every site has one,\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Um, no. I follow a hundred webcomics, and while the situation has gotten better recently, many of them still don't have a feed. That's not unique to webcomics, either. Lack of a newsfeed is common enough that being able to tell at first glace is very useful. Heck, many people, even website owners, are ignorant of RSS. More about that in a moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, the feed button serves a second purpose, which is to allow easy access to the feed. Just as I don't want to hunt for an \"RSS\" or \"XML\" link inside the website, I don't want to hunt for it in the browser's interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, many people still don't know about RSS. That big prominent orange icon is a big auto-discovery feature, not just in the technical sense, but also because a newbie could see it and click it out of curiosity, and thus learn about feeds. I had to explain what RSS is to someone whose browser didn't have one, and that proved to be quite difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, all this talk is for nothing as the decision has already been made but, you know. Just my two cents.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082411\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.factoetum.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d7a5934cd119837d75f98dc7e99043d8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.factoetum.com\">Bruce Wayne</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082411\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T11:34:59\">2011-01-16T11:34:59</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Nice explaination\r\nBut by removing the rss indicator Firefox has shifted content aggregation control from an open browser to closed siloed companies.\r\nThere is no valid excuse for this....

A built-in HTTP server would be a good start (is there one yet?), plus support for (say) Atom protocol for shoving data out. This could make it a lot easier to work with semi-social sites like del.icio.us and Bloglines. It's notable that these kind of tools have traditionally been very server-driven, with browsers playing (limited) catch up with plugins.

    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>The feed button is not dead; it&#39;s just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it&#39;s not pulling its weight. This post talks about why things have changed.</em></p>\n<p>There&#39;s <a href=\"http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply\">a brouhaha</a> about <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967\">Bug 578967</a>, wherein the feed auto-discover icon in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a> has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, <em>and</em> a Mozilla employee—I&#39;ve got at least a few opinions.</p>\n<p>This post is one of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967\">several on this subject</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defaults-are-hard-to-pare-down\">Defaults are hard to pare down</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/how-to-use-feed-auto-discovery-in-firefox-4\">feed icon still lives</a> in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a>; it&#39;s just not there by default any more. But, if you look at the controls available in <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png\">the toolbar customization panel</a>, you&#39;ll notice a <em>lot</em> of things that don&#39;t show up by default—there are a lot of things in there, period.</p>\n<p>This is the dilemma for <a href=\"http://planet.firefox.com/ux/\">the Firefox User Experience team at Mozilla</a>: Like it or not, one of the main themes of this next generation of browsers is minimalism—faster, smaller, less browser to get in the way of what you&#39;re browsing. Yet, at the same time, Firefox 4 has the features of Firefox 3.6 and more.</p>\n<p>You can&#39;t just cram it all in there, so what gets prime real estate by default? People say it&#39;s just a few pixels, that feed button—but is it so much more important than anything else that could go there? And before you answer, consider that not just for your personal use, but for the 100&#39;s of millions of people using Firefox. How do you check your own biases and make a decision on that scale? You could make an educated guess, make a gut check. A lot of brilliant design happens that way.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/\">gather some telemetry from beta installs to see what people really use</a>. Looking at a heatmap of clicks, the feed button is an absolute stinker. This isn&#39;t a random whim of the UX team—seriously, it&#39;s an <strong>order of magnitude</strong> less used than anything else in the toolbar (notice the one black spot):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/heatmap.png\" alt=\"heatmap.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"75\" /></a></p>\n<p>There have been comments dismissing the validity of that heatmap study. But, as far as I can tell, none of them really stick. So, for the sake of argument and a shorter blog post, let&#39;s assume barely anyone is using the feed icon and that it&#39;s not pulling its weight in this new age of browser minimalism.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that Firefox isn&#39;t the only browser to deprioritize the feed button: <em>Google Chrome doesn&#39;t even have a feed button at all</em>, and for many people that&#39;s the gold standard for minimal browser UI:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-chrome.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-chrome.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\n\n<p><a name=\"serving\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"serving-the-users\">Serving the users</h3>\n<p>Let&#39;s hammer on the point of disuse some more—what&#39;s the payoff for clicking that thing, anyway?</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-styling.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-styling.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" />\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>+1 — You get an option to create a <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/livebookmarks.html\">Live Bookmark</a>, which is really handy for things like Bugzilla searches or light headline reading. (I like those so much that I tried building them on the server at Delicious once, but we never quite worked it out at scale.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>0 — You get a list of sites to which Firefox will delegate subscription, if you happen to have <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM:window.navigator.registerContentHandler\">installed a content handler</a>. Useful if you know what it&#39;s about; a mystery if you don&#39;t—not much more useful than a bookmarklet, to me.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>-1 — You get a plainly-styled version of what you were probably already looking at on a site, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/02/firefox-20-breaks-client-side-xsl-for-rss-and-atom-feeds\">something I criticized back in 2006</a>, like some are criticizing the feed icon change now.  (At the time, I was working for <a href=\"http://organic.com\">a marketing company</a>, and the change cost me days trying to incorporate branding in feeds on <a href=\"http://www.jeep.com/en/autoshow/feeds/jeep-all.xml\">a client&#39;s site</a>. I think we gave up after a bit, but I suspect that <a href=\"http://feedburner.com\">FeedBurner</a> built a nice business routing around that change.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#39;s been status quo for years, and it&#39;s less than compelling—I&#39;ve even had people ask me if they broke the page when the button was clicked on accident.</p>\n<p>So, given little reward for clicking that feed icon, <em>pushing it into the background in <strong>its current state</strong> is a service to the users of Firefox<em>. In other words, that feed button has to get a lot more interesting if it&#39;s going to serve alongside UI all-stars like <strong>Back</strong>, <strong>Reload</strong>, and **Location</em></em>. </p>\n<p>Hell, even with Firebug installed, I use <strong>View Source</strong> more than the feed button these days, and I&#39;ve never stuck <em>that</em> on the toolbar.</p>\n<h3 id=\"leading-the-web\">Leading the web</h3>\n<p>The most compelling response I&#39;ve seen to the &quot;removal&quot; of the feed auto-discovery button is the challenge that Mozilla and other browser makers should be <em>improving</em> feed-related features, rather than pushing them into the background. With this, I wholeheartedly agree—but I&#39;m not entirely sure what to do about it.</p>\n<p>So, there&#39;s a balance here: Make the <strong>experience of the web better</strong> by improving how Firefox handles what&#39;s already out there, and <strong>make the web itself better</strong> by building more powerful and enabling technologies into Firefox and other products. In the best of times, Mozilla can do and has done both at once. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL\">WebGL</a> and technologies associated with HTML5 represent great examples of this.</p>\n<p>But, alas, syndication feeds in the browser have stagnated. The feed button has been a weak feature <em>for years</em>. In the meantime, other things have taken priority in the Firefox project. The rise of Twitter and Facebook and more complex applications on the web have reduced the need for most people to interact directly with feeds, so demands for attention to the feed button haven&#39;t exactly topped the charts in comparison to things like <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/The%20Adobe%20Flash%20plugin%20has%20crashed\">making sure Flash doesn&#39;t crash the browser</a> and <a href=\"http://arewefastyet.com/\">getting super fast</a> for everything else. </p>\n<h3 id=\"ship-it\">Ship it!</h3>\n<p>In the end, Mozilla has a browser to ship. The decision on the feed button <em>has been made</em> and, believe it or not, with a great deal of thought behind it. </p>\n<p>I know that this is the first time many people have heard of this change, but many already have heard and have given the UX team a number of earsful. Coming in at this late stage and requesting—nay <strong>demanding</strong>—a reversal of that decision will do nothing but piss off all the people who&#39;ve been banging away at this and many other things up to now. They&#39;re people who&#39;ve worked hard, stayed up late—and the last thing anyone wants to do is rehash every conversation ever about the topic.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089393\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=478a310fc648c632ba1a3c120437289b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jacques</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089393\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T07:22:31\">2011-01-16T07:22:31</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I understand that we always try to enhance UI of any software and that it takes a lot of time and discussions to make decisions.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>The feed button is not dead; it's just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it's not pulling its weight. This post talks about why things have changed.</em>\r\n\r\nThere's [a brouhaha](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discover icon in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, *and* a Mozilla employee—I've got at least a few opinions.\r\n\r\nThis post is one of [several on this subject](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967).\r\n\r\n### Defaults are hard to pare down\r\n\r\nThe [feed icon still lives](http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/how-to-use-feed-auto-discovery-in-firefox-4) in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/); it's just not there by default any more. But, if you look at the controls available in [the toolbar customization panel](http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png), you'll notice a *lot* of things that don't show up by default—there are a lot of things in there, period.\r\n\r\nThis is the dilemma for [the Firefox User Experience team at Mozilla](http://planet.firefox.com/ux/): Like it or not, one of the main themes of this next generation of browsers is minimalism—faster, smaller, less browser to get in the way of what you're browsing. Yet, at the same time, Firefox 4 has the features of Firefox 3.6 and more.\r\n\r\nYou can't just cram it all in there, so what gets prime real estate by default? People say it's just a few pixels, that feed button—but is it so much more important than anything else that could go there? And before you answer, consider that not just for your personal use, but for the 100's of millions of people using Firefox. How do you check your own biases and make a decision on that scale? You could make an educated guess, make a gut check. A lot of brilliant design happens that way.\r\n\r\nYou can also [gather some telemetry from beta installs to see what people really use](https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/). Looking at a heatmap of clicks, the feed button is an absolute stinker. This isn't a random whim of the UX team—seriously, it's an **order of magnitude** less used than anything else in the toolbar (notice the one black spot):\r\n\r\n[<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/heatmap.png\" alt=\"heatmap.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"75\" />](https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/)\r\n\r\nThere have been comments dismissing the validity of that heatmap study. But, as far as I can tell, none of them really stick. So, for the sake of argument and a shorter blog post, let's assume barely anyone is using the feed icon and that it's not pulling its weight in this new age of browser minimalism.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that Firefox isn't the only browser to deprioritize the feed button: *Google Chrome doesn't even have a feed button at all*, and for many people that's the gold standard for minimal browser UI:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-chrome.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-chrome.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\r\n\r\n<a name=\"serving\"></a>\r\n### Serving the users\r\n\r\nLet's hammer on the point of disuse some more—what's the payoff for clicking that thing, anyway?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-styling.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-styling.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" />\r\n\r\n* +1 — You get an option to create a [Live Bookmark](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/livebookmarks.html), which is really handy for things like Bugzilla searches or light headline reading. (I like those so much that I tried building them on the server at Delicious once, but we never quite worked it out at scale.)\r\n\r\n* 0 — You get a list of sites to which Firefox will delegate subscription, if you happen to have [installed a content handler](https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM:window.navigator.registerContentHandler). Useful if you know what it's about; a mystery if you don't—not much more useful than a bookmarklet, to me.\r\n\r\n* -1 — You get a plainly-styled version of what you were probably already looking at on a site, [something I criticized back in 2006](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/02/firefox-20-breaks-client-side-xsl-for-rss-and-atom-feeds), like some are criticizing the feed icon change now.  (At the time, I was working for [a marketing company](http://organic.com), and the change cost me days trying to incorporate branding in feeds on [a client's site](http://www.jeep.com/en/autoshow/feeds/jeep-all.xml). I think we gave up after a bit, but I suspect that [FeedBurner](http://feedburner.com) built a nice business routing around that change.)\r\n\r\nThat's been status quo for years, and it's less than compelling—I've even had people ask me if they broke the page when the button was clicked on accident.\r\n\r\nSo, given little reward for clicking that feed icon, *pushing it into the background in **its current state** is a service to the users of Firefox*. In other words, that feed button has to get a lot more interesting if it's going to serve alongside UI all-stars like **Back**, **Reload**, and **Location**. \r\n\r\nHell, even with Firebug installed, I use **View Source** more than the feed button these days, and I've never stuck *that* on the toolbar.\r\n\r\n### Leading the web\r\n\r\nThe most compelling response I've seen to the \"removal\" of the feed auto-discovery button is the challenge that Mozilla and other browser makers should be *improving* feed-related features, rather than pushing them into the background. With this, I wholeheartedly agree—but I'm not entirely sure what to do about it.\r\n\r\nSo, there's a balance here: Make the **experience of the web better** by improving how Firefox handles what's already out there, and **make the web itself better** by building more powerful and enabling technologies into Firefox and other products. In the best of times, Mozilla can do and has done both at once. [WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) and technologies associated with HTML5 represent great examples of this.\r\n\r\nBut, alas, syndication feeds in the browser have stagnated. The feed button has been a weak feature *for years*. In the meantime, other things have taken priority in the Firefox project. The rise of Twitter and Facebook and more complex applications on the web have reduced the need for most people to interact directly with feeds, so demands for attention to the feed button haven't exactly topped the charts in comparison to things like [making sure Flash doesn't crash the browser](https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/The%20Adobe%20Flash%20plugin%20has%20crashed) and [getting super fast](http://arewefastyet.com/) for everything else. \r\n\r\n### Ship it!\r\n\r\nIn the end, Mozilla has a browser to ship. The decision on the feed button *has been made* and, believe it or not, with a great deal of thought behind it. \r\n\r\nI know that this is the first time many people have heard of this change, but many already have heard and have given the UX team a number of earsful. Coming in at this late stage and requesting—nay **demanding**—a reversal of that decision will do nothing but piss off all the people who've been banging away at this and many other things up to now. They're people who've worked hard, stayed up late—and the last thing anyone wants to do is rehash every conversation ever about the topic.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089393\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=478a310fc648c632ba1a3c120437289b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Jacques</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089393\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T07:22:31\">2011-01-16T07:22:31</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I understand that we always try to enhance UI of any software and that it takes a lot of time and discussions to make decisions.
