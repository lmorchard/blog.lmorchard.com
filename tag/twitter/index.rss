          <title>There are no ushers on Mastodon</title>
          <description>TL;DR: There are no ushers on Mastodon. There&#39;s no one paid to show you to your seat, no one whose job it is to ease you into comfort and remove friction.</description>

          <title>Random thoughts for 2014 Oct 23</title>
          <description>TL;DR: This is a bunch of stuff I just randomly collected throughout the day.
Look here for a bit of explanation. I may or may not do this again.
I&#39;m experimenting and entertaining myself.</description>

          <title>Toot = Tiny Outburst of Text</title>
          <description>I&#39;ve been toying with something Twitterish lately, and thought I needed a
different word to describe the central social object. So, I started using
toot, which means &quot;tiny outburst of text&quot;. Of course, I started by
making fart jokes to myself before that expansion appeared in my head. But, I
think it&#39;s fun.</description>

          <title>Separating publishing from hosting on the web</title>
          <description>Social media like Twitter and Facebook combine web publishing and hosting. You can’t run different software, and you can’t move your stuff. So, if you’re unhappy, your choices are a) deal with it or b) abandon your stuff and your friends. Those are pretty rough options.
But, what if you could move your stuff? And what if you could switch apps?</description>

          <title>Microblogging like it&amp;#8217;s 2002</title>
          <description>Every year or so, I (re)join the ranks of hackers who decide they’d like to try building a microblogging tool. It’s sometimes after Twitter or Facebook does something cruddy to remind me that I’m the product. Sometimes, it’s when jerks have the run of the place and no one can do anything about it. Often these things are highly correlated.</description>

          <title>Half-formed thoughts about Twitter, social silos, web APIs, and mashups</title>
          <description>TL;DR: Turns out, the way to derive value from web APIs is to let your community run off and do free research and development. Harvest the results, and profit. We were never promised participation, but it felt like it was a 2-way street. Silly us. Where do we go from here?</description>

          <title>I (used to) like rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</title>
          <description>Update 4/14: So, I liked rev=&quot;canonical&quot;, but I like the notion of pages offering sets of alternative URLs better.  There are enough cracks in the case for rev=&quot;canonical&quot; to stop caring about it and instead focus on the notion behind it.  However it&#39;s expressed—is it rel=&quot;shortlink&quot; now?—the final remaining things I&#39;d like to see are:

An more generalized scope for alternate URL choices asserted by publishers, not just URL shortening.  Other criteria beyond character length include ease of entry on mobile devices (eg. short, but also simple, maybe mostly numeric), ease of verbal mention (eg. billboards, postcards, etc).

HTTP headers are great where available—hooray for HEAD—but it still needs to be in the page for publishers who can&#39;t set custom headers.

Microformats are great, but I&#39;d rather not parse a whole page to the footer to lift out the desired URLs.

Don&#39;t panic. Have fun.


And with that, I&#39;m going to try coming up with other things to write about so this blog doesn&#39;t stay dormant.  The rest of this entry remains unedited below...</description>

          <title>Why I&#39;m playing with Laconica</title>

          <title>Getting Laconica up and running</title>
          <description>Update, 30 Sep 2008: 
You don&#39;t want to follow the directions on this page—instead, leave this page and read this:  
http://laconi.ca/darcs/README
At one point, very early on in Laconica-time, this blog post offered useful information on getting Laconica up and running.  But since then, my time has taken me away from playing with Laconica and thus this guide has fallen far behind.  Hopefully soon I&#39;ll get back around to Laconica hacking, but not today.
I&#39;m leaving the original text of this post here for posterity, but this is no longer current and following this guide will do more harm than good in confusing you about Laconica installation!
Again, to learn about getting Laconica up and running, leave this page and read this:
http://laconi.ca/darcs/README
The latest mini-sensations to arrive through my firehoses are identi.ca, a Twitter-clone / microblogging site, and the Open Source software Laconica, which powers the aforementioned site.
Having started and neglected two Twitter cloning attempts of my own, Cuckoo and OpenInterocitor, seeing someone else carry the torch with any modicum of momentum is attractive to me.  So, I spent a little bit last night getting the code running on my own servers, and managed to do it twice:

decafbad.com/laconica
lmorchard.com/laconica

See, the interesting thing promised by Laconica—and something I wanted in my own clones—is the ability to federate instances of the software.  That is, users on one Laconica-based site should be able to subscribe to the updates from users on another site, by way of the OpenMicroblogging specification.  Although federation isn&#39;t a silver bullet to a web-scale Twitter clone, I do think it&#39;s one of the most important bootstrap steps—but that&#39;s another blog post entirely.
Thus, since I&#39;d like to see you run a Laconica site (or something like it) for mine to talk to, I figured I&#39;d document how I got the thing running.  My server is running Ubuntu Gutsy, so your mileage may vary.  This is a long one, so check out the how-to after the jump...</description>
