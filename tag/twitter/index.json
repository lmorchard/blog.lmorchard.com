I&#8217;m sure I could assemble a list of UI innovations cobbled up by 3rd-party Twitter clients that are now folded back into Twitter itself.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying the Twitter crew have nothing to be proud of, but a quite a lot of it started with users and developers outside the company. But now, the company <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience\">is talking about more thoroughly enforcing certain guidelines for a &#8220;consistent Twitter experience&#8221;</a>.</p>\n<p>To me as a user and sometimes developer, that sounds like: &#8220;Thanks, we&#8217;ll take it from here. Enjoy the show!&#8221; Which, having somehow fooled myself into thinking this was a 2-way street, comes as a bit of cold water to the face. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2010/04/26/theToxicCoralReef.html#p10\">I can&#8217;t say I wasn&#8217;t warned early and often, though.</a> It&#8217;s not like Twitter is suddenly going rogue &amp; evil, or even going away soon. They&#8217;re just more firmly grabbing the reins on the product that was never ever really ours to begin with. That&#8217;s their prerogative, and they&#8217;ll enjoy success.</p>\n<p>But, still, it kind of sucks. In the 2000&#8217;s, I was gonzo about web services and APIs. One of the things I&#8217;d looked most forward to when I joined del.icio.us and Yahoo! back in 2006 was to build up their web APIs. Of course, no one really knew how these things would get monetized &#8211; <strong>but damn, weren&#8217;t mashups cool</strong>?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2012/07/07/twitterIsACorporateApi.html\">They&#8217;ve figured out how to derive value by now, though</a>: Not everything yields a charge-per-request billing concern. It turns out that you can harvest free research and development from your community and fold the good stuff back into the main product. We even did this at del.icio.us &#8211; see also, the old <code>for:{username}</code> tag convention and the inbox that followed later. (Do they even have that any more?) But, it seems like Twitter is reaching a point where they&#8217;ve harvested enough, and want to polish things up.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s left behind are things that aren&#8217;t owned by a single entity. RSS, rssCloud, Atom, AtomPub, PubSubHubbub, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JSON\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JSON?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JSON</a> Activity Streams, Salmon, WebFinger, OStatus, etc and so forth. <a href=\"http://inessential.com/2012/06/29/matthew_on_twitter_restrictions\">We could talk to each other with these things, and make beautiful mashups</a>.</p>\n<p>But, a lot of us have been distracted by shiny corporate APIs, building value for others and sometimes making a little for ourselves. Why bother writing a web spider chasing microformatted relationships to build a social graph, when we could make a single HTTP GET and have a <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JSON\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JSON?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JSON</a>-formatted friends list tossed back &#8211; and thus, get on with the real thing we wanted to do with that list?</p>\n<p>And honestly a lot of us fail at things like basic usability and design, making it so much easier for someone to just sign up for a social silo than muck around with trying to get some PHP witchery working on some strange webhost. WordPress may be a relative dream to set up, these days, but not in comparison to a sign-up form.</p>\n<p>Sure, back in circa-2000&#8217;s era blogosphere, we were figuring out things like feeds and aggregators and autodiscovery and trackbacks and blogrolls and mashups. But, along the way, startups wrapped the best of those things up in packages friendly to broader swaths of humanity. You know, kind of like how Apple is now making glued-together laptops.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where I think the social silos like Twitter and Facebook have won: They&#8217;ve made things practical for users that we blogosphereans never did. And on the other end, they gave us nerds free access to APIs that let us build things that were rewarded by real use. Because, for many of us, that&#8217;s the real payoff beyond a literal paycheck: seeing our stuff get used and praised as clever.</p>\n<p>Now, the social silos don&#8217;t need us nerds as much. If they do, they hire us. But, out on the open web, things are a bit stale. The users don&#8217;t care to use our complex crap, and don&#8217;t even know what it is or why to bother. And we don&#8217;t spend much time on it, because how rewarding is it without users?</p>\n<p>So now what? Seems like a hard catch-22 to break, and I haven&#8217;t had much time lately to do my part in breaking it. Maybe I will soon, so I&#8217;m thinking about what to hack on next.</p>\n",

Enjoy the show!&#8221; Which, having somehow fooled myself into thinking this was a 2-way street, comes as a bit of cold water to the face. [I can&#8217;t say I wasn&#8217;t warned early and often, though.][7] It&#8217;s not like Twitter is suddenly going rogue & evil, or even going away soon. They&#8217;re just more firmly grabbing the reins on the product that was never ever really ours to begin with. That&#8217;s their prerogative, and they&#8217;ll enjoy success.\r\n\r\nBut, still, it kind of sucks. In the 2000&#8217;s, I was gonzo about web services and APIs. One of the things I&#8217;d looked most forward to when I joined del.icio.us and Yahoo! back in 2006 was to build up their web APIs. Of course, no one really knew how these things would get monetized &#8211; **but damn, weren&#8217;t mashups cool**?\r\n\r\n[They&#8217;ve figured out how to derive value by now, though][8]: Not everything yields a charge-per-request billing concern. It turns out that you can harvest free research and development from your community and fold the good stuff back into the main product. We even did this at del.icio.us &#8211; see also, the old `for:{username}` tag convention and the inbox that followed later. (Do they even have that any more?) But, it seems like Twitter is reaching a point where they&#8217;ve harvested enough, and want to polish things up.\r\n\r\nWhat&#8217;s left behind are things that aren&#8217;t owned by a single entity. RSS, rssCloud, Atom, AtomPub, PubSubHubbub, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JSON\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JSON?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JSON</a> Activity Streams, Salmon, WebFinger, OStatus, etc and so forth. [We could talk to each other with these things, and make beautiful mashups][9].\r\n\r\nBut, a lot of us have been distracted by shiny corporate APIs, building value for others and sometimes making a little for ourselves. Why bother writing a web spider chasing microformatted relationships to build a social graph, when we could make a single HTTP GET and have a <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JSON\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JSON?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JSON</a>-formatted friends list tossed back &#8211; and thus, get on with the real thing we wanted to do with that list?\r\n\r\nAnd honestly a lot of us fail at things like basic usability and design, making it so much easier for someone to just sign up for a social silo than muck around with trying to get some PHP witchery working on some strange webhost. WordPress may be a relative dream to set up, these days, but not in comparison to a sign-up form.\r\n\r\nSure, back in circa-2000&#8217;s era blogosphere, we were figuring out things like feeds and aggregators and autodiscovery and trackbacks and blogrolls and mashups. But, along the way, startups wrapped the best of those things up in packages friendly to broader swaths of humanity. You know, kind of like how Apple is now making glued-together laptops.\r\n\r\nThat&#8217;s where I think the social silos like Twitter and Facebook have won: They&#8217;ve made things practical for users that we blogosphereans never did. And on the other end, they gave us nerds free access to APIs that let us build things that were rewarded by real use. Because, for many of us, that&#8217;s the real payoff beyond a literal paycheck: seeing our stuff get used and praised as clever.\r\n\r\nNow, the social silos don&#8217;t need us nerds as much. If they do, they hire us. But, out on the open web, things are a bit stale. The users don&#8217;t care to use our complex crap, and don&#8217;t even know what it is or why to bother. And we don&#8217;t spend much time on it, because how rewarding is it without users?\r\n\r\nSo now what? Seems like a hard catch-22 to break, and I haven&#8217;t had much time lately to do my part in breaking it. Maybe I will soon, so I&#8217;m thinking about what to hack on next.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/42834/\r\n [2]: https://www.google.com/search?q=paving+cow+paths\r\n [3]: http://anarchogeek.com/2012/07/09/origin-of-the-reply-digging-through-twitters-history/\r\n [4]: http://gigaom.com/2010/04/30/the-short-and-illustrious-history-of-twitter-hashtags/\r\n [5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reblogging#Twitter\r\n [6]: https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience\r\n [7]: http://scripting.com/stories/2010/04/26/theToxicCoralReef.html#p10\r\n [8]: http://scripting.com/stories/2012/07/07/twitterIsACorporateApi.html\r\n [9]: http://inessential.com/2012/06/29/matthew_on_twitter_restrictions",

    "html": "<p><em>Update 4/14</em>: So, I liked <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code>, but I like the notion of pages offering sets of alternative URLs better.  <a href=\"http://www.mnot.net/blog/2009/04/14/rev_canonical_bad\">There are enough cracks in the case</a> for <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> to stop caring about it and instead focus on the notion behind it.  However it&#39;s expressed—is it <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/shortlink\"><code>rel=&quot;shortlink&quot;</code></a> now?—the final remaining things I&#39;d like to see are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>An more generalized scope for alternate URL choices asserted by publishers, not just URL shortening.  Other criteria beyond character length include ease of entry on mobile devices (eg. short, but also simple, maybe mostly numeric), ease of verbal mention (eg. billboards, postcards, etc).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>HTTP headers are great where available—hooray for HEAD—but it still needs to be in the page for publishers who can&#39;t set custom headers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Microformats are great, but I&#39;d rather not parse a whole page to the footer to lift out the desired URLs.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Don&#39;t panic. Have fun.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And with that, I&#39;m going to try coming up with other things to write about so this blog doesn&#39;t stay dormant.  The rest of this entry remains unedited below...</p>\n<!--more-->\n<hr />\n\n<p><strike>So, like it says up there: I like <a href=\"http://revcanonical.appspot.com/\">rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</a>.</strike></p>\n<p>Basically, it&#39;s a way of saying—instead of using that 3rd-party service <em>you</em> like for munging <em>my</em> URLs, use one of these pre-munged URLs I&#39;ve provided.  Ideally, the URLs I provide will be shorter for your needs, but my URLs won&#39;t be subject to <a href=\"http://joshua.schachter.org/2009/04/on-url-shorteners.html\">potentially distasteful things I object to with respect to a service you might pick</a>.</p>\n<p>I like keeping control of URL spaces in the hands of their publishers.  This also opens the field for more individual choice in URL shortening services, allowing more people to try their hand at building a better mouse trap—or allowing publishers to opt out of the mess altogether.  </p>\n<p>And, apropos of that, I tend to like <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> as the means of expressing this choice.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s a lot more background on this whole shebang, but I&#39;ll just stick to my $0.02 on the discussion so far.</p>\n<h3 id=\"its-too-alpha-geeky-to-get-adoptedalso-nerds\"><a href=\"http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2009/04/11/revcanonicalDiggBarOutrageCausesBadIdeasToComeOutOfTheWoodWork.aspx\">It&#39;s too alpha geeky to get adopted—also: NERDS!</a></h3>\n<p>Alpha geeks write plugins for web publishing systems used by less-alpha geeks, who eventually install web publishing systems for those even further down the geek scale.  It&#39;s not unheard of for something incredibly nerdy to become relatively common, if it proves useful.</p>\n<p>Feed auto-discovery is in blogging software and browsers now—it was once considered a somewhat arcane usage of the <code>rel</code> attribute on <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags in HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"everyone-needs-to-implement-their-own-url-shortener\"><a href=\"http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2009/04/11/revcanonicalDiggBarOutrageCausesBadIdeasToComeOutOfTheWoodWork.aspx\">Everyone needs to implement their own URL shortener.</a></h3>\n<p>No, but everyone gets to pick a shortener for their own URLs—which could coincidentally be self-hosted or third-party.  Isn&#39;t the web great?</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-rev-attribute-is-too-hard-to-understand-people-will-get-it-wrong\"><a href=\"http://benramsey.com/archives/a-revcanonical-rebuttal/\">The <code>rev</code> attribute is too hard to understand, people will get it wrong</a>.</h3>\n<p>I hadn&#39;t paid much attention to the <code>rev</code> attribute until a week or so ago.  I <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#adef-rev\">read the HTML spec on links</a> again.  Within 10 minutes of reading the spec, my understanding became this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>rel=&quot;{X}&quot;</code> — &quot;this link means {X} in relation to the current page&quot;.</li>\n<li><code>rev=&quot;{X}&quot;</code> — &quot;this current page means {X} in relation to this link&quot;.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I may have misunderstood it—if so, explain to me how and I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s harder to understand than I think.  There are harder concepts in the HTML 4 spec.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-rev-attribute-is-removed-in-html5\">The <code>rev</code> attribute is removed in HTML5</h3>\n<p>That&#39;s too bad for HTML5.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-July/006888.html\">The rationale given for the removal</a> seems sensible enough.  But, I&#39;d say the rationale for removal is weakened if someone finds a use for the attribute and uses it correctly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"relshorter--relshort-is-better-and-more-explicit\"><code>rel=&quot;shorter&quot;</code> / <code>rel=&quot;short&quot;</code> is better and more explicit.</h3>\n<p>I like this idea in general, and I don&#39;t <em>really</em> care strongly enough about <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> vs <code>rel=&quot;short&quot;</code> to make much noise beyond this blog post.  </p>\n<p>But, I prefer the semantics of <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code>, I don&#39;t think <code>rel=&quot;short(er)&quot;</code> is better, and actually I think the less explicit assertion is a feature.  I&#39;ve not yet been convinced otherwise—but realistically, if either catches on, I&#39;ll probably use the most popular.</p>\n<h3 id=\"revcanonical-doesnt-mean-shorter-url\"><code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> doesn&#39;t mean &quot;shorter URL&quot;</h3>\n<p>That&#39;s okay—what if I don&#39;t <em>want</em> you to have shortened versions of my URLs?  Doesn&#39;t fit in your tweet?  Screw you.  I didn&#39;t want you to link to me that badly anyway.  Bah.  </p>\n<p>That, of course, is self-defeating.  Conventional use of the attribute will probably yield shorter URLs out of self-interest.  Furthermore, I could even offer a half-dozen URL variations, and you could use the string length function in the language of your choice to pick one on the basis of shortness.  There&#39;s a lot of choice to go around here.</p>\n<p>Also, feed auto-discovery links don&#39;t always lead to truly alternate versions of the current page—but instead to a useful set of items, many of which may currently appear somewhere on the page.  So, even the &quot;clear&quot; semantics have some play in them as used in the wild.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-revcanonical-http-header-is-better\"><a href=\"http://shiflett.org/blog/2009/apr/a-rev-canonical-http-header\">A <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> HTTP header is better.</a></h3>\n<p>Hmm, maybe.  It would certainly allow for possibly lighter-weight HEAD requests in determining the alternative URL for a given URL.  But, I would expect it to fall apart in collections of static HTML pages baked by an offline script where web server configuration might not make setting custom headers easy.</p>\n<p>Not everyone has the luxury / inclination to have a dynamic language capable of setting headers running in their web server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"revcanonical-should-appear-on-hyperlinks-in-the-body-of-the-page\"><a href=\"http://adactio.com/journal/1568/\"><code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> should appear on hyperlinks in the body of the page</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/08/whats-old-scraping-is-new-again-microformats\">I like microformats</a>, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/17/magic-microformat-forms\">in general</a>.  But, I don&#39;t really want to potentially parse a whole page to find the shorter URL that might be in the footer.  With <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, I only have to parse so far before I find it or give up.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s a lot of prior art on this with relation to feed autodiscovery—we used to mainly look for RSS feed URLs inside the page, too.  It sucked.</p>\n<h3 id=\"claiming-to-be-canonical-for-another-url-is-trouble\"><a href=\"http://benramsey.com/archives/a-revcanonical-rebuttal/#comment-288465\">Claiming to be canonical for another URL is trouble.</a></h3>\n<p>Okay, how about requiring a reciprocal <code>rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> on the same page with <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p>Trust but verify—and only accept <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> where <code>rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> matches the current URL <em>and</em> <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> yields a 301 redirect to the <code>rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p>I can&#39;t see this verification process being necessarily more burdensome than using a 3rd-party shortener API—and that&#39;s <em>if</em> you&#39;re paranoid and building an index that needs some measure of resistance to gaming.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-single-character-slip-from-revcanonical-to-relcanonical-could-wreck-your-googlejuice\"><a href=\"http://samj.net/2009/04/revcanonical-considered-harmful.html?showComment=1239617160000#c7231589643969293690\">A single character slip from <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> to <code>rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> could wreck your Googlejuice!</a></h3>\n<p>So, don&#39;t do that.  </p>\n<p>Maybe Googlejuice should be more resilient.  Maybe it actually is—has anyone actually soured their juice yet with a mistake like this and lived to tell the tale?  </p>\n<p>Either way, characters mean things in computer languages, so make sure you use the right ones in the right order.</p>\n<h3 id=\"you-guys-are-moving-on-this-stuff-too-fast\">You guys are moving on this stuff too fast!</h3>\n<p>Welcome to 2002, when lots of us had more spare time than employment and we deployed new crap like this on our blogs and sites daily.  </p>\n<p>Back in those olden days, we manipulated raw HTML with our bare hands and deployed radioactive code using our teeth—all without benefit of protective change control.  We probably all have cancer of the access logs now, but it was all in the name of Web Science!</p>\n<h3 id=\"too-long-didnt-read\">Too long; didn&#39;t read</h3>\n<p>So, yeah.  I like the idea behind <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> and I prefer its expression as <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> best—but the idea is the important thing.  Let&#39;s get over the expression part fast and spend more time exploring the nuts and bolts and implications of the concept itself.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091011\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4e160e713acf1ab8547d1c36233389c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/\">http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221091011\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-13T14:00:04\">2009-04-13T14:00:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Forget rel=\"short\" or rel=\"shorter\".

The problem I have is this:</p>\n<p>rel=canonical was introduced so when people went to various urls that a search engine would know that the url specified in rel=canonical was the real one.  Let's do this to make life easier:</p>\n<p>http://foo.com/A\nand \nhttp://foo.com/B</p>\n<p>both go to the exact same page, and the publisher can't for some reason redirect to the canonicalized page (maybe it's amazon and they have stupid large urls with affiliate codes).</p>\n<p>so if the former is canonical then this is present:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>whether you go to /A or /B.</p>\n<p>if they use rev=\"canonical\":</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Should only be shown if they are visitng /A not /B otherwise that rev statement implies that /A or /B are the canonical forms of \"http://f.us/A\".</p>\n<p>I think that's why the rev attribute isn't a very good one.

That was an amazingly dumb move, luckily it is a draft still is all I can say. Here is why I believe this:\n1) 1 char diff argument: shut up you nub programmers\n2) misuse: it's night vs day, black vs white, there is no gray area except that which your confused minds have created. The confusion -I think- usually comes in to play when considering a value, which is easy if you truly understand the diff between @rel and @rev.\n3) @rev values can be represented as @rel values: sure I agree but this can not be true without adding more rel values then are necessary with a @rev which is already in the html 4 spec for a reason. If you remove something with use you cause confusion on multiple fronts: first people have to become aware of the change, then they need to understand why the change was made, then they need to make the changes to their code base, and finally when they want to express rev=canonical with a @rel value, debates over what best @rel value represents the equivalent of another @rel value if it were used in @rev occur..</p>\n<p>I submit the debate which the opposition to rev=canonical are having over rel=short* as evidence that @rev is required. A link with rev=canonical that is short is a short url of the canonical url by definition, thus rel=short* is redundant for the use case of discovering a short url for the canonical url of some document. Albeit, I think rel=shorturl (or whatever is finally decided on) could be used by the publisher to indicate a preferred short url(s), if say there were &gt;1 rev=canonical.</p>\n<p>In an algorithm to discover a short url for a document one method could be to scan all links and find the shortest rev=canonical, or if a rel=shorturl is provided then use that and stop scanning immediately. My point is that rev=canonical should be used. Also rel=shorturl adds a marginal benefit to rev=canonical.</p>\n<p>Another point, a rel=shorturl is rev=canonical by definition, thus if you were to use rel=shorturl and @rev were alive and well as it should be, you should automatically add rev=canonical (even though it is implied).</p>\n<p>Another argument the opposition make to using rev=canonical is that the number of rev=canonical's are possibly infinite, so I say only list the rev=canonical's which a user may find of interest for the use cases you can imagine.</p>\n<p>Another case for using rev=canonical is using rev=canonical with rel=mobile perhaps? so that a user can scan rev=canonical's for a rel=mobile url which is short enough to fit in the newest microblog gadget. Where a rel=mobile without rev=canonical could be the mobile site's homepage, even better for this link would be rel=\"mobile home\" without rev=canonical.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091029\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://erikvold.com/index.cfm\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8fa21a16e24905fba4413501e3afb36e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://erikvold.com/index.cfm\">Erik Vold</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221091029\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-21T05:17:14\">2009-04-21T05:17:14</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>The reasons why I like rev=canonical: http://erikvold.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/4/21/rev_canonical_good</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091030\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221091030\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-28T05:31:35\">2009-04-28T05:31:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>@Erik: Well, I \"gave in\" mainly because I wasn't really looking for a fight and had a vacation to attend to.</p>\n<p>After that, the amount of hyperbolic stop energy being slung around rel=short{foo} has exhausted my care for the subject.</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "*Update 4/14*: So, I liked `rev=\"canonical\"`, but I like the notion of pages offering sets of alternative URLs better.  [There are enough cracks in the case](http://www.mnot.net/blog/2009/04/14/rev_canonical_bad) for `rev=\"canonical\"` to stop caring about it and instead focus on the notion behind it.  However it's expressed—is it [`rel=\"shortlink\"`](http://groups.google.com/group/shortlink) now?—the final remaining things I'd like to see are:\r\n\r\n* An more generalized scope for alternate URL choices asserted by publishers, not just URL shortening.  Other criteria beyond character length include ease of entry on mobile devices (eg. short, but also simple, maybe mostly numeric), ease of verbal mention (eg. billboards, postcards, etc).\r\n\r\n* HTTP headers are great where available—hooray for HEAD—but it still needs to be in the page for publishers who can't set custom headers.\r\n\r\n* Microformats are great, but I'd rather not parse a whole page to the footer to lift out the desired URLs.\r\n\r\n* Don't panic. Have fun.\r\n\r\nAnd with that, I'm going to try coming up with other things to write about so this blog doesn't stay dormant.  The rest of this entry remains unedited below...\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strike>So, like it says up there: I like [rev=\"canonical\"](http://revcanonical.appspot.com/).</strike>\r\n\r\nBasically, it's a way of saying—instead of using that 3rd-party service *you* like for munging *my* URLs, use one of these pre-munged URLs I've provided.  Ideally, the URLs I provide will be shorter for your needs, but my URLs won't be subject to [potentially distasteful things I object to with respect to a service you might pick](http://joshua.schachter.org/2009/04/on-url-shorteners.html).\r\n\r\nI like keeping control of URL spaces in the hands of their publishers.  This also opens the field for more individual choice in URL shortening services, allowing more people to try their hand at building a better mouse trap—or allowing publishers to opt out of the mess altogether.  \r\n\r\nAnd, apropos of that, I tend to like `rev=\"canonical\"` as the means of expressing this choice.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot more background on this whole shebang, but I'll just stick to my $0.02 on the discussion so far.\r\n\r\n### [It's too alpha geeky to get adopted—also: NERDS!](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2009/04/11/revcanonicalDiggBarOutrageCausesBadIdeasToComeOutOfTheWoodWork.aspx)\r\n\r\nAlpha geeks write plugins for web publishing systems used by less-alpha geeks, who eventually install web publishing systems for those even further down the geek scale.  It's not unheard of for something incredibly nerdy to become relatively common, if it proves useful.\r\n\r\nFeed auto-discovery is in blogging software and browsers now—it was once considered a somewhat arcane usage of the `rel` attribute on `<link>` tags in HTML `<head>`.\r\n\r\n### [Everyone needs to implement their own URL shortener.](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2009/04/11/revcanonicalDiggBarOutrageCausesBadIdeasToComeOutOfTheWoodWork.aspx)\r\n\r\nNo, but everyone gets to pick a shortener for their own URLs—which could coincidentally be self-hosted or third-party.  Isn't the web great?\r\n\r\n### [The `rev` attribute is too hard to understand, people will get it wrong](http://benramsey.com/archives/a-revcanonical-rebuttal/).\r\n\r\nI hadn't paid much attention to the `rev` attribute until a week or so ago.  I [read the HTML spec on links](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#adef-rev) again.  Within 10 minutes of reading the spec, my understanding became this:\r\n\r\n* `rel=\"{X}\"` — \"this link means {X} in relation to the current page\".\r\n* `rev=\"{X}\"` — \"this current page means {X} in relation to this link\".\r\n\r\nI may have misunderstood it—if so, explain to me how and I'll admit it's harder to understand than I think.  There are harder concepts in the HTML 4 spec.\r\n\r\n### The `rev` attribute is removed in HTML5\r\n\r\nThat's too bad for HTML5.  \r\n\r\n[The rationale given for the removal](http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-July/006888.html) seems sensible enough.  But, I'd say the rationale for removal is weakened if someone finds a use for the attribute and uses it correctly.\r\n\r\n### `rel=\"shorter\"` / `rel=\"short\"` is better and more explicit.\r\n\r\nI like this idea in general, and I don't *really* care strongly enough about `rev=\"canonical\"` vs `rel=\"short\"` to make much noise beyond this blog post.  \r\n\r\nBut, I prefer the semantics of `rev=\"canonical\"`, I don't think `rel=\"short(er)\"` is better, and actually I think the less explicit assertion is a feature.  I've not yet been convinced otherwise—but realistically, if either catches on, I'll probably use the most popular.\r\n\r\n### `rev=\"canonical\"` doesn't mean \"shorter URL\"\r\n\r\nThat's okay—what if I don't *want* you to have shortened versions of my URLs?  Doesn't fit in your tweet?  Screw you.  I didn't want you to link to me that badly anyway.  Bah.  \r\n\r\nThat, of course, is self-defeating.  Conventional use of the attribute will probably yield shorter URLs out of self-interest.  Furthermore, I could even offer a half-dozen URL variations, and you could use the string length function in the language of your choice to pick one on the basis of shortness.  There's a lot of choice to go around here.\r\n\r\nAlso, feed auto-discovery links don't always lead to truly alternate versions of the current page—but instead to a useful set of items, many of which may currently appear somewhere on the page.  So, even the \"clear\" semantics have some play in them as used in the wild.\r\n\r\n### [A `rev=\"canonical\"` HTTP header is better.](http://shiflett.org/blog/2009/apr/a-rev-canonical-http-header)\r\n\r\nHmm, maybe.  It would certainly allow for possibly lighter-weight HEAD requests in determining the alternative URL for a given URL.  But, I would expect it to fall apart in collections of static HTML pages baked by an offline script where web server configuration might not make setting custom headers easy.\r\n\r\nNot everyone has the luxury / inclination to have a dynamic language capable of setting headers running in their web server.\r\n\r\n### [`rev=\"canonical\"` should appear on hyperlinks in the body of the page](http://adactio.com/journal/1568/)\r\n\r\n[I like microformats](http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/08/whats-old-scraping-is-new-again-microformats), [in general](http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/17/magic-microformat-forms).  But, I don't really want to potentially parse a whole page to find the shorter URL that might be in the footer.  With `rev=\"canonical\"` in the `<head>`, I only have to parse so far before I find it or give up.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of prior art on this with relation to feed autodiscovery—we used to mainly look for RSS feed URLs inside the page, too.  It sucked.\r\n\r\n### [Claiming to be canonical for another URL is trouble.](http://benramsey.com/archives/a-revcanonical-rebuttal/#comment-288465)\r\n\r\nOkay, how about requiring a reciprocal `rel=\"canonical\"` on the same page with `rev=\"canonical\"`.\r\n\r\nTrust but verify—and only accept `rev=\"canonical\"` where `rel=\"canonical\"` matches the current URL *and* `rev=\"canonical\"` yields a 301 redirect to the `rel=\"canonical\"`.\r\n\r\nI can't see this verification process being necessarily more burdensome than using a 3rd-party shortener API—and that's *if* you're paranoid and building an index that needs some measure of resistance to gaming.\r\n\r\n### [A single character slip from `rev=\"canonical\"` to `rel=\"canonical\"` could wreck your Googlejuice!](http://samj.net/2009/04/revcanonical-considered-harmful.html?showComment=1239617160000#c7231589643969293690)\r\n\r\nSo, don't do that.  \r\n\r\nMaybe Googlejuice should be more resilient.  Maybe it actually is—has anyone actually soured their juice yet with a mistake like this and lived to tell the tale?  \r\n\r\nEither way, characters mean things in computer languages, so make sure you use the right ones in the right order.\r\n\r\n### You guys are moving on this stuff too fast!\r\n\r\nWelcome to 2002, when lots of us had more spare time than employment and we deployed new crap like this on our blogs and sites daily.  \r\n\r\nBack in those olden days, we manipulated raw HTML with our bare hands and deployed radioactive code using our teeth—all without benefit of protective change control.  We probably all have cancer of the access logs now, but it was all in the name of Web Science!\r\n\r\n### Too long; didn't read\r\n\r\nSo, yeah.  I like the idea behind `rev=\"canonical\"` and I prefer its expression as `rev=\"canonical\"` best—but the idea is the important thing.  Let's get over the expression part fast and spend more time exploring the nuts and bolts and implications of the concept itself.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091011\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4e160e713acf1ab8547d1c36233389c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/\">http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221091011\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-13T14:00:04\">2009-04-13T14:00:04</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Forget rel=\"short\" or rel=\"shorter\".

The problem I have is this:</p>\n\n<p>rel=canonical was introduced so when people went to various urls that a search engine would know that the url specified in rel=canonical was the real one.  Let's do this to make life easier:</p>\n\n<p>http://foo.com/A\nand \nhttp://foo.com/B</p>\n\n<p>both go to the exact same page, and the publisher can't for some reason redirect to the canonicalized page (maybe it's amazon and they have stupid large urls with affiliate codes).</p>\n\n<p>so if the former is canonical then this is present:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>whether you go to /A or /B.</p>\n\n<p>if they use rev=\"canonical\":</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Should only be shown if they are visitng /A not /B otherwise that rev statement implies that /A or /B are the canonical forms of \"http://f.us/A\".</p>\n\n<p>I think that's why the rev attribute isn't a very good one.  Honestly I liked the suggestion (you made it maybe) for using rel=\"shortcut alternative\" or something.</p>\n\n<p>Am I seeing potential ambiguity when there isn't?</p>\n\n<p>-d</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091016\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221091016\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-13T15:36:42\">2009-04-13T15:36:42</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@Dave: I think you may have used some markup in your comment that got filtered out - I'm not exactly sure what you mean. :/</p>\n\n<p>If we have this URL:</p>\n\n<p>http://example.com/this/url/is/too/long</p>\n\n<p>With these links in the head:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>rel=\"canonical\" href=\"http://example.com/this/url/is/too/long\"\n  rev=\"canonical\" href=\"http://ex.pl/ab\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then, the URL http://ex.pl/ab will ideally lead to a 301 redirect.

That was an amazingly dumb move, luckily it is a draft still is all I can say. Here is why I believe this:\n1) 1 char diff argument: shut up you nub programmers\n2) misuse: it's night vs day, black vs white, there is no gray area except that which your confused minds have created. The confusion -I think- usually comes in to play when considering a value, which is easy if you truly understand the diff between @rel and @rev.\n3) @rev values can be represented as @rel values: sure I agree but this can not be true without adding more rel values then are necessary with a @rev which is already in the html 4 spec for a reason. If you remove something with use you cause confusion on multiple fronts: first people have to become aware of the change, then they need to understand why the change was made, then they need to make the changes to their code base, and finally when they want to express rev=canonical with a @rel value, debates over what best @rel value represents the equivalent of another @rel value if it were used in @rev occur..</p>\n\n<p>I submit the debate which the opposition to rev=canonical are having over rel=short* as evidence that @rev is required. A link with rev=canonical that is short is a short url of the canonical url by definition, thus rel=short* is redundant for the use case of discovering a short url for the canonical url of some document. Albeit, I think rel=shorturl (or whatever is finally decided on) could be used by the publisher to indicate a preferred short url(s), if say there were &gt;1 rev=canonical.</p>\n\n<p>In an algorithm to discover a short url for a document one method could be to scan all links and find the shortest rev=canonical, or if a rel=shorturl is provided then use that and stop scanning immediately. My point is that rev=canonical should be used. Also rel=shorturl adds a marginal benefit to rev=canonical.</p>\n\n<p>Another point, a rel=shorturl is rev=canonical by definition, thus if you were to use rel=shorturl and @rev were alive and well as it should be, you should automatically add rev=canonical (even though it is implied).</p>\n\n<p>Another argument the opposition make to using rev=canonical is that the number of rev=canonical's are possibly infinite, so I say only list the rev=canonical's which a user may find of interest for the use cases you can imagine.</p>\n\n<p>Another case for using rev=canonical is using rev=canonical with rel=mobile perhaps? so that a user can scan rev=canonical's for a rel=mobile url which is short enough to fit in the newest microblog gadget. Where a rel=mobile without rev=canonical could be the mobile site's homepage, even better for this link would be rel=\"mobile home\" without rev=canonical.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091029\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://erikvold.com/index.cfm\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8fa21a16e24905fba4413501e3afb36e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://erikvold.com/index.cfm\">Erik Vold</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221091029\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-21T05:17:14\">2009-04-21T05:17:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>The reasons why I like rev=canonical: http://erikvold.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/4/21/rev_canonical_good</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091030\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221091030\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-28T05:31:35\">2009-04-28T05:31:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@Erik: Well, I \"gave in\" mainly because I wasn't really looking for a fight and had a vacation to attend to.</p>\n\n<p>After that, the amount of hyperbolic stop energy being slung around rel=short{foo} has exhausted my care for the subject.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

I&#39;m suddenly inspired to break blog-radio-silence and get it out of my head.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/let-the-microblogs-bloom\">Let the microblogs bloom - RussellBeattie.com</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Once this is widely accepted (and I'm sure there are many that would argue with me), the thing that will separate these types of services won't be whether they stay up (ala Twitter), but how fast your subscription messages are updated. Some services might be smaller or offer more features but not update as quickly whereas others will pride themselves on being as close to real-time as possible. The key is that it's all about messaging, not publishing. (Oh, and this also facilitates federation as well, but that's another topic).</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also: <a href=\"http://randomfoo.net/blog/id/4182\">Rearchitecting Twitter: Brought to You By the 17th Letter of the Alphabet - random($foo)</a></p>\n<p>One of the problems it seems most modern web apps face is the tendency to want to do everything all at once, and all in the same code that responds directly to a user.  Because, while you&#39;re in there building a user interface, it&#39;s <em>easy</em> to implement everything else that needs to happen in that same UI module or library.</p>\n<p>Someone wants to post a bookmark?  Someone wants to post a message?  Well, of course you want the system to cross-reference and deliver that new piece of User Generated Content through every permutation of tag, recipient, keyword, and notification channel supported by your system.  </p>\n<p><strong>But</strong>, do you <em>really</em> have to do everything all at once—while the person who generated that content is tapping his or her foot, waiting for the web interface to respond with feedback?  Are all of these things immediately vital to the person watching the browser spin, <em>right now</em>?  </p>\n<p>No.  Your user wants to get on with things.  He or she wants to see the submitted content get accepted and, as feedback and confirmation, see it reflected in a personal view immediately.  Does it matter—to <em>this person</em>, at <em>this moment</em>—whether it shows up <em>simultaneously</em> in a friend&#39;s inbox, the public timeline, a global tag page, or even an RSS or Atom feed?</p>\n<p>Again, no, simultaneity doesn&#39;t really matter—because no human beings actually appreciate it.  Instead, imagine a ripple effect of concentric social and attention contexts with associated people spreading out from the original submission.  (This probably rates the creation of a diagram someday.)  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>To make the person who&#39;s submitting something happy, offer feedback visible in their own personal context in under 50-200 milliseconds.  (That is, less than half-a-second at worst, in people terms.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The next person to delight is someone following the first person&#39;s published content—and humanly speaking, delays of <em>tens of thousands of milliseconds</em> can be acceptable here.  (That is, 1-10 seconds at worst, in people terms.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Finally, you can start worrying about strangers, allowing the content to propagate to tag pages, keyword tracking pages, and other public views—and I&#39;d assert that delays of <em>hundreds of thousands of milliseconds</em> are acceptable here.  (That is, 1-2 minutes at worst, in people terms.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea here is that the social structure can help you scale, while still delighting people.  Even with these delays, the system is still better at getting the word out than the original content creator would be at notifying all the others involved with an out-of-band system like IM or email.  And that&#39;s at worst—on most good days, all the delays should tend to be on the order of seconds or less.</p>\n<p>And how do you do all of this?  Use queues.  Sure, the original submission of content can and should be done all at once—just enough to get the content into the user&#39;s collection.  Then, queue a job for further processing and get out of the way.  In fact, just queue one job from the user interface—the processor of <em>that</em> queue can then queue further jobs for all the other individual processing tasks that are likely susceptible to plenty of parallel processing and horizontal scaling.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the original user creating content has been thanked for their submission and life goes on.  In fact, their life may include going on to submit many more pieces of content in rapid succession, thanks to your delightfully responsive web user interface.  </p>\n<p>And, in the end, that&#39;s really the purpose of a web-based content creation interface—accepting something as quickly as possible to make the user happy enough to continue submitting more.  The other part of the user interface, retrieval, serves simply to get the original content distributed as fast as can be reasonably expected.</p>\n<p>Now, preparing for fast retrieval is another story.  The flip side to processing queues are message inboxes—expect content duplicated everywhere and fetched simply, rather than using cleverly expressed SQL joins that bring a system to its knees.  But, that&#39;s another post altogether. :)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083313\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://fatalerror.in\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=15516fd23722eeca86b8ea91738eea4b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://fatalerror.in\">shyam</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083313\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-04T21:12:46\">2008-07-04T21:12:46</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Interesting bits of conversation happening all over the place regarding queues and the irony of it all - the much maligned Java has had workqueues since the early days.</p>\n<p>What everyone will learn, rather painfully in in cases like Twitter, is that all data is not created, consumed or processed equally.

I think it's often a matter of developers not wanting to (and/or being politically unable to) venture into what they consider the sysadmin's domain. Take the way-too-common case of apps that make the client wait while it does housekeeping. Why isn't this in a cron job? One reason is maybe this is KewlOSSBlogWikiPackage and it's simpler to say \"just untar the package under htdocs and you're done\" instead of saying \"also, unpack these scripts in a non-servable area and set them up to run hourly, but not all at the same time; stagger them a little. And run them with the same UID your web server is running as\". But we end up with a lot of apps that (badly) reimplement basic tools their OS ships with in the first place.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083327\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1d7a7610cb0f02de44be3c4186f82ac3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083327\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-28T21:23:06\">2008-07-28T21:23:06</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I wonder if you're still setting the bar too high for low-priority connections.

    "body": "This is a blog post I've had simmering in my brainmeats for well over a year or two.  I'm suddenly inspired to break blog-radio-silence and get it out of my head.\r\n\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/let-the-microblogs-bloom\">Let the microblogs bloom - RussellBeattie.com</a>:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Once this is widely accepted (and I'm sure there are many that would argue with me), the thing that will separate these types of services won't be whether they stay up (ala Twitter), but how fast your subscription messages are updated. Some services might be smaller or offer more features but not update as quickly whereas others will pride themselves on being as close to real-time as possible. The key is that it's all about messaging, not publishing. (Oh, and this also facilitates federation as well, but that's another topic).</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSee also: <a href=\"http://randomfoo.net/blog/id/4182\">Rearchitecting Twitter: Brought to You By the 17th Letter of the Alphabet - random($foo)</a>\r\n\r\nOne of the problems it seems most modern web apps face is the tendency to want to do everything all at once, and all in the same code that responds directly to a user.  Because, while you're in there building a user interface, it's *easy* to implement everything else that needs to happen in that same UI module or library.\r\n\r\nSomeone wants to post a bookmark?  Someone wants to post a message?  Well, of course you want the system to cross-reference and deliver that new piece of User Generated Content through every permutation of tag, recipient, keyword, and notification channel supported by your system.  \r\n\r\n**But**, do you *really* have to do everything all at once—while the person who generated that content is tapping his or her foot, waiting for the web interface to respond with feedback?  Are all of these things immediately vital to the person watching the browser spin, *right now*?  \r\n\r\nNo.  Your user wants to get on with things.  He or she wants to see the submitted content get accepted and, as feedback and confirmation, see it reflected in a personal view immediately.  Does it matter—to *this person*, at *this moment*—whether it shows up *simultaneously* in a friend's inbox, the public timeline, a global tag page, or even an RSS or Atom feed?\r\n\r\nAgain, no, simultaneity doesn't really matter—because no human beings actually appreciate it.  Instead, imagine a ripple effect of concentric social and attention contexts with associated people spreading out from the original submission.  (This probably rates the creation of a diagram someday.)  \r\n\r\n* To make the person who's submitting something happy, offer feedback visible in their own personal context in under 50-200 milliseconds.  (That is, less than half-a-second at worst, in people terms.)\r\n\r\n* The next person to delight is someone following the first person's published content—and humanly speaking, delays of *tens of thousands of milliseconds* can be acceptable here.  (That is, 1-10 seconds at worst, in people terms.)\r\n\r\n* Finally, you can start worrying about strangers, allowing the content to propagate to tag pages, keyword tracking pages, and other public views—and I'd assert that delays of *hundreds of thousands of milliseconds* are acceptable here.  (That is, 1-2 minutes at worst, in people terms.)\r\n\r\nThe idea here is that the social structure can help you scale, while still delighting people.  Even with these delays, the system is still better at getting the word out than the original content creator would be at notifying all the others involved with an out-of-band system like IM or email.  And that's at worst—on most good days, all the delays should tend to be on the order of seconds or less.\r\n\r\nAnd how do you do all of this?  Use queues.  Sure, the original submission of content can and should be done all at once—just enough to get the content into the user's collection.  Then, queue a job for further processing and get out of the way.  In fact, just queue one job from the user interface—the processor of *that* queue can then queue further jobs for all the other individual processing tasks that are likely susceptible to plenty of parallel processing and horizontal scaling.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the original user creating content has been thanked for their submission and life goes on.  In fact, their life may include going on to submit many more pieces of content in rapid succession, thanks to your delightfully responsive web user interface.  \r\n\r\nAnd, in the end, that's really the purpose of a web-based content creation interface—accepting something as quickly as possible to make the user happy enough to continue submitting more.  The other part of the user interface, retrieval, serves simply to get the original content distributed as fast as can be reasonably expected.\r\n\r\nNow, preparing for fast retrieval is another story.  The flip side to processing queues are message inboxes—expect content duplicated everywhere and fetched simply, rather than using cleverly expressed SQL joins that bring a system to its knees.  But, that's another post altogether. :)\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083313\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://fatalerror.in\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=15516fd23722eeca86b8ea91738eea4b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://fatalerror.in\">shyam</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083313\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-04T21:12:46\">2008-07-04T21:12:46</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Interesting bits of conversation happening all over the place regarding queues and the irony of it all - the much maligned Java has had workqueues since the early days.</p>\n\n<p>What everyone will learn, rather painfully in in cases like Twitter, is that all data is not created, consumed or processed equally.

I think it's often a matter of developers not wanting to (and/or being politically unable to) venture into what they consider the sysadmin's domain. Take the way-too-common case of apps that make the client wait while it does housekeeping. Why isn't this in a cron job? One reason is maybe this is KewlOSSBlogWikiPackage and it's simpler to say \"just untar the package under htdocs and you're done\" instead of saying \"also, unpack these scripts in a non-servable area and set them up to run hourly, but not all at the same time; stagger them a little.

Hopefully soon I&#39;ll get back around to Laconica hacking, but not today.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m leaving the original text of this post here for posterity, but this is <em>no longer current</em> and following this guide will <em>do more harm than good</em> in confusing you about Laconica installation!</p>\n<p><strong>Again, to learn about getting Laconica up and running, leave this page and read this</strong>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://laconi.ca/darcs/README\">http://laconi.ca/darcs/README</a></p>\n<p>The latest mini-sensations to arrive through my firehoses are <a href=\"http://identi.ca\">identi.ca</a>, a Twitter-clone / microblogging site, and the Open Source software <a href=\"http://laconi.ca\">Laconica</a>, which powers the aforementioned site.</p>\n<p>Having started and neglected two Twitter cloning attempts of my own, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/Cuckoo\">Cuckoo</a> and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/OpenInterocitor\">OpenInterocitor</a>, seeing someone else carry the torch with any modicum of momentum is attractive to me.  So, I spent a little bit last night getting the code running on my own servers, and managed to do it twice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/laconica\">decafbad.com/laconica</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lmorchard.com/laconica\">lmorchard.com/laconica</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>See, the interesting thing promised by <a href=\"http://laconi.ca\">Laconica</a>—and something I wanted in my own clones—is the ability to federate instances of the software.  That is, users on one <a href=\"http://laconi.ca\">Laconica</a>-based site should be able to subscribe to the updates from users on another site, by way of the <a href=\"http://openmicroblogging.org/\">OpenMicroblogging specification</a>.  Although federation isn&#39;t a silver bullet to a web-scale Twitter clone, I do think it&#39;s one of the most important bootstrap steps—but that&#39;s another blog post entirely.</p>\n<p>Thus, since I&#39;d like to see <em>you</em> run a Laconica site (or something like it) for mine to talk to, I figured I&#39;d document how I got the thing running.  My server is running Ubuntu Gutsy, so your mileage may vary.  This is a long one, so check out the how-to after the jump...</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"get-the-laconica-code\">Get the Laconica code</h2>\n<p>I got my copy of the code by using <a href=\"http://darcs.net/\"><code>darcs</code></a>, as described on <a href=\"http://laconi.ca/Main/Source\">the Laconica source page</a>, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install darcs\ndarcs get --partial http://laconi.ca/darcs/</code></pre>\n<p>But, if you can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to use <code>darcs</code> right now, you can <a href=\"http://laconi.ca/laconica-0.4.1.tar.gz\">grab a Laconica tarball</a> to get started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-modules-and-third-party-prerequisites\">Get modules and third-party prerequisites</h2>\n<p>I had already installed PHP and Apache, along with lighttpd, on my server.  But, I found I needed a few more things.  So, here&#39;s a slew of packages you may or may not already have:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 php5-cgi php5-cli php-pear php5-gd php5-mysql</code></pre>\n<p>Next, now that you&#39;ve got PHP and PEAR, you can install some of the PEAR-based prerequisites:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo pear channel-update pear.php.net\nsudo pear install channel://pear.php.net/Validate-0.8.1\nsudo pear install DB_DataObject\nsudo pear install Mail\nsudo pear install Net_SMTP</code></pre>\n<p>After this, there are a few libraries that need to be downloaded by hand.  For this, I created an <code>extlib/</code> directory to keep them in, separate from Laconica&#39;s own <code>lib/</code> which will be subject to updates to the software itself:</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir extlib xfers\ncd xfers\ncurl -O http://openidenabled.com/files/php-openid/packages/php-openid-2.1.1.zip    \ncurl -O http://michelf.com/docs/projets/php-markdown-1.0.1m.zip\ncurl -O http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/php/OAuth.php\ncurl -O http://xmpphp.googlecode.com/files/xmpphp-0.1beta-r21.tar.gz\nunzip php-markdown-1.0.1m.zip\ncp &#39;PHP Markdown 1.0.1m/markdown.php&#39; ../extlib/\nunzip php-openid-2.1.1.zip\ncp -r php-openid-2.1.1/Auth ../extlib/\ncp OAuth.php ../extlib/\ntar -zxf xmpphp-0.1beta-r21.tar.gz\ncp xmpphp/*.php ../extlib/\ncd ..\nrm -rf xfers</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"set-up-mysql-tables\">Set up MySQL tables</h2>\n<p>I&#39;ll assume you already have MySQL installed.  To set up a database for Laconica, I did the following:</p>\n<pre><code>mysql -uroot -p -e &#39;create database laconica&#39;;\nmysql -uroot -p -e &quot;grant all privileges on laconica.* to laconica@localhost identified by &#39;PASSWORD&#39;&quot;;\nmysql -uroot -p laconica &lt; db/laconica.sql</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"configure-laconica\">Configure Laconica</h2>\n<p>So far, I&#39;ve found at least two config files that need tweaking—namely <code>config.php</code> and <code>dataobject.ini</code>.</p>\n<p>The first thing I did to <code>config.php</code> was to add the following at around line 6 to account for my <code>extlib/</code> directory:</p>\n<pre><code>#If you have downloaded libraries in random little places, you\n#can add the paths here\ndefine(&#39;INSTALLDIR&#39;, dirname(__FILE__));\nset_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . INSTALLDIR . &#39;/extlib&#39;);</code></pre>\n<p>The rest of the settings in <code>config.php</code> are somewhat self-explanatory.  These are the ones I changed for my installation:</p>\n<pre><code>$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;name&#39;] = &#39;cafeonica&#39;;\n$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;server&#39;] = &#39;decafbad.com&#39;;\n$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;path&#39;] = &#39;laconica&#39;;\n$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;fancy&#39;] = true;\n$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;theme&#39;] = &#39;stoica&#39;;\n$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;email&#39;] = &#39;l.m.orchard@pobox.com&#39;;\n$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;broughtby&#39;] = &#39;0xDECAFBAD&#39;;\n$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;broughtbyurl&#39;] = &#39;http://decafbad.com/&#39;;\n$config[&#39;db&#39;][&#39;database&#39;] = &#39;mysql://laconica:PASSWORD@localhost/laconica&#39;;\n$config[&#39;db&#39;][&#39;ini_laconica&#39;] = $config[&#39;db&#39;][&#39;schema_location&#39;].&#39;/stoica.ini&#39;;</code></pre>\n<p>After this, I tweaked the first few settings of <code>dataobject.ini</code> to the following: </p>\n<pre><code>database = mysql://laconica:PASSWORD@localhost/laconica \nschema_location = /www/decafbad.com/docs/laconica/classes \nclass_location = /www/decafbad.com/docs/laconica/classes \nrequire_prefix = /www/decafbad.com/docs/laconica/classes/ </code></pre>\n<p>Be sure to substitute your own web server paths and passwords in all the above.  And finally, in order to allow the upload of avatar images, you&#39;ll need to tweak the permissions on the <code>avatar/</code> directory, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo chown -R www-data avatar\nsudo chmod -R ug+rw avatar/</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"configure-web-server\">Configure Web Server</h2>\n<p>There isn&#39;t really much to configure if you&#39;re using Apache.  There&#39;s a file <code>htaccess.sample</code> that needs to be copied to <code>.htaccess</code>—this will put in place all the <code>mod_rewrite</code> rules necessary to support &quot;fancy&quot; URLs.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you&#39;re okay with uglier URLs with query parameters and whatnot, leave <code>.htaccess</code> alone and use <code>$config[&#39;site&#39;][&#39;fancy&#39;] = false</code> in your <code>config.php</code>.  </p>\n<p>For comparison, here are examples of non-fancy and fancy profile URLs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/laconica/index.php?action=showstream&amp;nickname=lmorchard\">http://decafbad.com/laconica/index.php?action=showstream&amp;nickname=lmorchard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/laconica/lmorchard\">http://decafbad.com/laconica/lmorchard</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One catch to the non-fancy and fancy thing, though—if you start off with non-fancy URLs and later switch to fancy, all of the profiles registered before that switch will appear with non-fancy URLs in the timeline.  This is because the <code>profile</code> table stores the original URLs at registration in the <code>profileurl</code> column.  You could change these if you like, but there be dragons.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configure-lighttpd-for-fancy-urls-optional\">Configure Lighttpd for &quot;fancy&quot; URLs (optional)</h3>\n<p>If you&#39;re like me, though, you&#39;re using something other than Apache for your main web server.  Personally, I just got up and running with <a href=\"http://www.lighttpd.net/\">lighttpd</a> not too long ago.  Alas, that means the <code>.htaccess</code> rewrite rules won&#39;t work directly.  </p>\n<p>Admittedly, I am a novice to configuring <a href=\"http://www.lighttpd.net/\">lighttpd</a>, so the following rules I added to my config could probably use some help:</p>\n<pre><code>url.rewrite-final += (\n    &quot;^/laconica/index.php(.*)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;$0&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=public&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/rss$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=publicrss&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/xrds$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=publicxrds&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/about$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=about&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/contact$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=contact&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/faq$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=faq&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/help$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=help&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/im$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=im&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/openid$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=openid&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/openmublog$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=openmublog&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/privacy$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=privacy&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/doc/source$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=doc&amp;title=source&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/login$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=login&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/logout$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=logout&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/register$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=register&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/openid(?:\\?(.*)|$)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=openidlogin&amp;$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/remote(?:\\?(.*)|$)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=remotesubscribe&amp;$1&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/subscribe$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=subscribe&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/unsubscribe$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=unsubscribe&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/confirmaddress$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=confirmaddress&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/confirmaddress/(.*)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=confirmaddress&amp;code=$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/recoverpassword$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=recoverpassword&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/main/recoverpassword/(.*)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=recoverpassword&amp;code=$1&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/settings/avatar$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=avatar&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/settings/password$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=password&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/settings/profile$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=profilesettings&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/settings/openid$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=openidsettings&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/settings/im$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=imsettings&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/notice/new$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=newnotice&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/notice/(\\d+)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=shownotice&amp;notice=$1&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/user/(\\d+)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=userbyid&amp;id=$1&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)/subscriptions$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=subscriptions&amp;nickname=$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)/subscribers$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=subscribers&amp;nickname=$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)/xrds$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=xrds&amp;nickname=$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)/rss$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=userrss&amp;nickname=$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)/all$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=all&amp;nickname=$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)/all/rss$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=allrss&amp;nickname=$1&quot;,\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)/foaf$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=foaf&amp;nickname=$1&quot;,\n\n    &quot;^/laconica/(\\w+)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/laconica/index.php?action=showstream&amp;nickname=$1&quot;\n)</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"thats-it-for-now\">That&#39;s it (for now)</h2>\n<p>And that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for you for now.  At this point, it looks like my two Laconica installs are mostly working.  I&#39;ve not yet played with the XMPP bot, nor have I been able to see the <a href=\"http://openmicroblogging.org/\">OpenMicroblogging</a> stuff working with remore subscriptions.  However, I have been able to log in via OpenID, so that&#39;s something.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085627\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://pseudopost.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=761b6be3778aefa25a27dbbe3e65b641&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://pseudopost.org/\">Fabian Neumann</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085627\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-03T22:36:12\">2008-07-03T22:36:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Tried to remotely subscribe to you, but no success so far.

After re-compiling PHP on this server etc the error went away.</p>\n<p>Now the error is the inability to connect to the MySQL server?  This with the relevant connection string entries being made in config.php &amp; dataobject.ini?  These settings are definately correct as I am able to connect to the database from the command line copying and pasting the entries from these files.</p>\n<p>However it seems like access is trying to be gained on a \"strange\" port?  Is there some specific place where this has to be configured?  The error I am getting boils down to this: \"nativecode=Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket\"</p>\n<p>Any input regarding this problem would be greatly appreciated!</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085685\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1ff3d26e10560a02cade856bac212ec5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Herman</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085685\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-18T15:14:36\">2008-07-18T15:14:36</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p></p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085686\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.nedrichards.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7998e3215aae5f66f3f9503848e10a53&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.nedrichards.com/\">Nick</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085686\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-23T08:41:39\">2008-07-23T08:41:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Just to note for more recent install 0.4.4 and onwards you need XMP-PHP at least 0.1-r50 or up.

    "body": "*Update, 30 Sep 2008*: \r\n\r\n**You don't want to follow the directions on this page—instead, leave this page and read this:**  \r\n\r\n[http://laconi.ca/darcs/README](http://laconi.ca/darcs/README)\r\n\r\nAt one point, very early on in Laconica-time, this blog post offered useful information on getting Laconica up and running.  But since then, my time has taken me away from playing with Laconica and thus this guide has fallen far behind.  Hopefully soon I'll get back around to Laconica hacking, but not today.\r\n\r\nI'm leaving the original text of this post here for posterity, but this is *no longer current* and following this guide will *do more harm than good* in confusing you about Laconica installation!\r\n\r\n**Again, to learn about getting Laconica up and running, leave this page and read this**:\r\n\r\n[http://laconi.ca/darcs/README](http://laconi.ca/darcs/README)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latest mini-sensations to arrive through my firehoses are [identi.ca](http://identi.ca), a Twitter-clone / microblogging site, and the Open Source software [Laconica][], which powers the aforementioned site.\r\n\r\nHaving started and neglected two Twitter cloning attempts of my own, [Cuckoo](http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/Cuckoo) and [OpenInterocitor](http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/OpenInterocitor), seeing someone else carry the torch with any modicum of momentum is attractive to me.  So, I spent a little bit last night getting the code running on my own servers, and managed to do it twice:\r\n\r\n* [decafbad.com/laconica](http://decafbad.com/laconica)\r\n* [lmorchard.com/laconica](http://lmorchard.com/laconica)\r\n\r\nSee, the interesting thing promised by [Laconica][]—and something I wanted in my own clones—is the ability to federate instances of the software.  That is, users on one [Laconica][]-based site should be able to subscribe to the updates from users on another site, by way of the [OpenMicroblogging specification][openmu].  Although federation isn't a silver bullet to a web-scale Twitter clone, I do think it's one of the most important bootstrap steps—but that's another blog post entirely.\r\n\r\nThus, since I'd like to see *you* run a Laconica site (or something like it) for mine to talk to, I figured I'd document how I got the thing running.  My server is running Ubuntu Gutsy, so your mileage may vary.  This is a long one, so check out the how-to after the jump...\r\n\r\n[lighttpd]: http://www.lighttpd.net/\r\n[openmu]: http://openmicroblogging.org/\r\n[Twitter]: http://twitter.com\r\n[laconica]: http://laconi.ca\r\n[source]: http://laconi.ca/Main/Source\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n## Get the Laconica code\r\n\r\nI got my copy of the code by using [`darcs`](http://darcs.net/), as described on [the Laconica source page][source], like so:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install darcs\r\n    darcs get --partial http://laconi.ca/darcs/\r\n\r\nBut, if you can't or don't want to use `darcs` right now, you can [grab a Laconica tarball](http://laconi.ca/laconica-0.4.1.tar.gz) to get started.\r\n\r\n## Get modules and third-party prerequisites\r\n\r\nI had already installed PHP and Apache, along with lighttpd, on my server.  But, I found I needed a few more things.  So, here's a slew of packages you may or may not already have:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 php5-cgi php5-cli php-pear php5-gd php5-mysql\r\n\r\nNext, now that you've got PHP and PEAR, you can install some of the PEAR-based prerequisites:\r\n\r\n    sudo pear channel-update pear.php.net\r\n    sudo pear install channel://pear.php.net/Validate-0.8.1\r\n    sudo pear install DB_DataObject\r\n    sudo pear install Mail\r\n    sudo pear install Net_SMTP\r\n\r\nAfter this, there are a few libraries that need to be downloaded by hand.  For this, I created an `extlib/` directory to keep them in, separate from Laconica's own `lib/` which will be subject to updates to the software itself:\r\n\r\n    mkdir extlib xfers\r\n    cd xfers\r\n    curl -O http://openidenabled.com/files/php-openid/packages/php-openid-2.1.1.zip    \r\n    curl -O http://michelf.com/docs/projets/php-markdown-1.0.1m.zip\r\n    curl -O http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/php/OAuth.php\r\n    curl -O http://xmpphp.googlecode.com/files/xmpphp-0.1beta-r21.tar.gz\r\n    unzip php-markdown-1.0.1m.zip\r\n    cp 'PHP Markdown 1.0.1m/markdown.php' ../extlib/\r\n    unzip php-openid-2.1.1.zip\r\n    cp -r php-openid-2.1.1/Auth ../extlib/\r\n    cp OAuth.php ../extlib/\r\n    tar -zxf xmpphp-0.1beta-r21.tar.gz\r\n    cp xmpphp/*.php ../extlib/\r\n    cd ..\r\n    rm -rf xfers\r\n\r\n## Set up MySQL tables\r\n\r\nI'll assume you already have MySQL installed.  To set up a database for Laconica, I did the following:\r\n\r\n    mysql -uroot -p -e 'create database laconica';\r\n    mysql -uroot -p -e \"grant all privileges on laconica.* to laconica@localhost identified by 'PASSWORD'\";\r\n    mysql -uroot -p laconica < db/laconica.sql\r\n\r\n## Configure Laconica\r\n\r\nSo far, I've found at least two config files that need tweaking—namely `config.php` and `dataobject.ini`.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I did to `config.php` was to add the following at around line 6 to account for my `extlib/` directory:\r\n\r\n\r\n    #If you have downloaded libraries in random little places, you\r\n    #can add the paths here\r\n    define('INSTALLDIR', dirname(__FILE__));\r\n    set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . INSTALLDIR . '/extlib');\r\n\r\nThe rest of the settings in `config.php` are somewhat self-explanatory.  These are the ones I changed for my installation:\r\n\r\n    $config['site']['name'] = 'cafeonica';\r\n    $config['site']['server'] = 'decafbad.com';\r\n    $config['site']['path'] = 'laconica';\r\n    $config['site']['fancy'] = true;\r\n    $config['site']['theme'] = 'stoica';\r\n    $config['site']['email'] = 'l.m.orchard@pobox.com';\r\n    $config['site']['broughtby'] = '0xDECAFBAD';\r\n    $config['site']['broughtbyurl'] = 'http://decafbad.com/';\r\n    $config['db']['database'] = 'mysql://laconica:PASSWORD@localhost/laconica';\r\n    $config['db']['ini_laconica'] = $config['db']['schema_location'].'/stoica.ini';\r\n\r\nAfter this, I tweaked the first few settings of `dataobject.ini` to the following: \r\n\r\n    database = mysql://laconica:PASSWORD@localhost/laconica \r\n    schema_location = /www/decafbad.com/docs/laconica/classes \r\n    class_location = /www/decafbad.com/docs/laconica/classes \r\n    require_prefix = /www/decafbad.com/docs/laconica/classes/ \r\n\r\nBe sure to substitute your own web server paths and passwords in all the above.  And finally, in order to allow the upload of avatar images, you'll need to tweak the permissions on the `avatar/` directory, like so:\r\n\r\n    sudo chown -R www-data avatar\r\n    sudo chmod -R ug+rw avatar/\r\n\r\n## Configure Web Server\r\n\r\nThere isn't really much to configure if you're using Apache.  There's a file `htaccess.sample` that needs to be copied to `.htaccess`—this will put in place all the `mod_rewrite` rules necessary to support \"fancy\" URLs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you're okay with uglier URLs with query parameters and whatnot, leave `.htaccess` alone and use `$config['site']['fancy'] = false` in your `config.php`.  \r\n\r\nFor comparison, here are examples of non-fancy and fancy profile URLs:\r\n\r\n* http://decafbad.com/laconica/index.php?action=showstream&nickname=lmorchard\r\n* http://decafbad.com/laconica/lmorchard\r\n\r\nOne catch to the non-fancy and fancy thing, though—if you start off with non-fancy URLs and later switch to fancy, all of the profiles registered before that switch will appear with non-fancy URLs in the timeline.  This is because the `profile` table stores the original URLs at registration in the `profileurl` column.  You could change these if you like, but there be dragons.\r\n\r\n### Configure Lighttpd for \"fancy\" URLs (optional)\r\n\r\nIf you're like me, though, you're using something other than Apache for your main web server.  Personally, I just got up and running with [lighttpd][] not too long ago.  Alas, that means the `.htaccess` rewrite rules won't work directly.  \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, I am a novice to configuring [lighttpd][], so the following rules I added to my config could probably use some help:\r\n\r\n    url.rewrite-final += (\r\n        \"^/laconica/index.php(.*)$\" => \"$0\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=public\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/rss$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=publicrss\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/xrds$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=publicxrds\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/about$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=about\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/contact$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=contact\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/faq$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=faq\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/help$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=help\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/im$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=im\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/openid$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=openid\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/openmublog$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=openmublog\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/privacy$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=privacy\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/doc/source$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=doc&title=source\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/login$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=login\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/logout$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=logout\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/register$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=register\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/openid(?:\\?(.*)|$)$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=openidlogin&$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/remote(?:\\?(.*)|$)$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=remotesubscribe&$1\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/subscribe$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=subscribe\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/unsubscribe$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=unsubscribe\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/confirmaddress$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=confirmaddress\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/confirmaddress/(.*)$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=confirmaddress&code=$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/recoverpassword$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=recoverpassword\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/main/recoverpassword/(.*)$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=recoverpassword&code=$1\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/settings/avatar$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=avatar\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/settings/password$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=password\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/settings/profile$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=profilesettings\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/settings/openid$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=openidsettings\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/settings/im$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=imsettings\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/notice/new$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=newnotice\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/notice/(\\d+)$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=shownotice&notice=$1\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/user/(\\d+)$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=userbyid&id=$1\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)/subscriptions$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=subscriptions&nickname=$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)/subscribers$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=subscribers&nickname=$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)/xrds$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=xrds&nickname=$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)/rss$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=userrss&nickname=$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)/all$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=all&nickname=$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)/all/rss$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=allrss&nickname=$1\",\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)/foaf$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=foaf&nickname=$1\",\r\n\r\n        \"^/laconica/(\\w+)$\" => \"/laconica/index.php?action=showstream&nickname=$1\"\r\n    )\r\n\r\n## That's it (for now)\r\n\r\nAnd that's all I've got for you for now.  At this point, it looks like my two Laconica installs are mostly working.  I've not yet played with the XMPP bot, nor have I been able to see the [OpenMicroblogging][openmu] stuff working with remore subscriptions.  However, I have been able to log in via OpenID, so that's something.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085627\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://pseudopost.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=761b6be3778aefa25a27dbbe3e65b641&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://pseudopost.org/\">Fabian Neumann</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085627\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-03T22:36:12\">2008-07-03T22:36:12</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Tried to remotely subscribe to you, but no success so far.

After re-compiling PHP on this server etc the error went away.</p>\n\n<p>Now the error is the inability to connect to the MySQL server?  This with the relevant connection string entries being made in config.php &amp; dataobject.ini?  These settings are definately correct as I am able to connect to the database from the command line copying and pasting the entries from these files.</p>\n\n<p>However it seems like access is trying to be gained on a \"strange\" port?  Is there some specific place where this has to be configured?  The error I am getting boils down to this: \"nativecode=Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket\"</p>\n\n<p>Any input regarding this problem would be greatly appreciated!</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085685\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1ff3d26e10560a02cade856bac212ec5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Herman</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085685\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-18T15:14:36\">2008-07-18T15:14:36</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p></p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085686\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.nedrichards.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7998e3215aae5f66f3f9503848e10a53&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.nedrichards.com/\">Nick</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085686\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-07-23T08:41:39\">2008-07-23T08:41:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Just to note for more recent install 0.4.4 and onwards you need XMP-PHP at least 0.1-r50 or up.

    "summary": "<p><em>Update, 30 Sep 2008</em>: </p>\n<p><strong>You don&apos;t want to follow the directions on this page&#x2014;instead, leave this page and read this:</strong>  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://laconi.ca/darcs/README\">http://laconi.ca/darcs/README</a></p>\n<p>At one point, very early on in Laconica-time, this blog post offered useful information on getting Laconica up and running.  But since then, my time has taken me away from playing with Laconica and thus this guide has fallen far behind.  Hopefully soon I&apos;ll get back around to Laconica hacking, but not today.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m leaving the original text of this post here for posterity, but this is <em>no longer current</em> and following this guide will <em>do more harm than good</em> in confusing you about Laconica installation!</p>\n<p><strong>Again, to learn about getting Laconica up and running, leave this page and read this</strong>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://laconi.ca/darcs/README\">http://laconi.ca/darcs/README</a></p>\n<p>The latest mini-sensations to arrive through my firehoses are <a href=\"http://identi.ca\">identi.ca</a>, a Twitter-clone / microblogging site, and the Open Source software <a href=\"http://laconi.ca\">Laconica</a>, which powers the aforementioned site.</p>\n<p>Having started and neglected two Twitter cloning attempts of my own, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/Cuckoo\">Cuckoo</a> and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/OpenInterocitor\">OpenInterocitor</a>, seeing someone else carry the torch with any modicum of momentum is attractive to me.  So, I spent a little bit last night getting the code running on my own servers, and managed to do it twice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/laconica\">decafbad.com/laconica</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lmorchard.com/laconica\">lmorchard.com/laconica</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>See, the interesting thing promised by <a href=\"http://laconi.ca\">Laconica</a>&#x2014;and something I wanted in my own clones&#x2014;is the ability to federate instances of the software.  That is, users on one <a href=\"http://laconi.ca\">Laconica</a>-based site should be able to subscribe to the updates from users on another site, by way of the <a href=\"http://openmicroblogging.org/\">OpenMicroblogging specification</a>.  Although federation isn&apos;t a silver bullet to a web-scale Twitter clone, I do think it&apos;s one of the most important bootstrap steps&#x2014;but that&apos;s another blog post entirely.</p>\n<p>Thus, since I&apos;d like to see <em>you</em> run a Laconica site (or something like it) for mine to talk to, I figured I&apos;d document how I got the thing running.  My server is running Ubuntu Gutsy, so your mileage may vary.  This is a long one, so check out the how-to after the jump...</p>\n"

    "html": "<p>I should elaborate on what I mean by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/218773732\">tags in Twitter</a>, since I got a few head-scratching responses.</p>\n<p>No, fitting tags into the 140 characters for a message won't work.  And, no, tagging every tweet as you go is a horrible approach - no one will do it.  What I've thought might work, though, are <i>sticky tags</i>.</p>\n<p>Sticky tags would persist from update to update.  From the web UI, you could drop \"work\" or \"gnomedex\" or \"l:95051 beer concert somerandomband\" into an additional tags field and all tweets from then on will gain those tags until you empty the tag field.</p>\n<p>There could be shortcut commands to change or clear tags - ala \"d someone\" for direct messaging.  This would be especially useful while out and about and mobile.  Say you text \"t bus commute\" to Twitter when you get on the bus for home, then anything you might emit from then on, until you change the tags, gets tagged with \"bus\" and \"commute\".</p>\n<p>Then, you and others could follow this particular thread of tweets via <a href=\"http://twitter.com/yourname/commute\">http://twitter.com/yourname/commute</a> - or even with tag intersections ala delicious: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/yourname/commute+bus\">http://twitter.com/yourname/commute+bus</a>.</p>\n<p>Going to be at SxSW for awhile?  Drop \"sxsw\" into your sticky tags.  Maybe someday everyone who doesn't want to hear it can filter out tweets with that tag rather than stop following you altogether.</p>\n<p>Having some sticky tags can allow a bit of metadata and filtering hooks to follow you for awhile without requiring you to do or remember much.  Keeping them as free-form text strings allows some cow-pathing as people invent conventions.</p>\n<p>Think of these tags as kind of long-running <i>meta</i>-status.  </p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085861\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.ecademy.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ce83a8e239c0cfce3488d3fec4d5d8de&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.ecademy.com\">Julian Bond</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085861\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-08-22T07:35:44\">2007-08-22T07:35:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Dave Troy's location nanoformat does this already as you've shown above.

I don't want titles, comments, or extended entries - that's what a blog is for.  I don't want features added just for coolness sake or whatever.</p>\n<p>But, I can see a set of problems with the Twitter experience that might be helped with something that adds a bit more context - and something like tags seems like a lightweight and somewhat simple way to do it.  Making them sticky helps make them less cumbersome to use.</p>\n<p>I'd really like to be able to pick and choose the sorts of updates I receive from people I follow, across different means of receiving them.  For example, I might not want to get all of someone's random ponderings on my phone, but I'd like to get pinged when they start talking about when they're leaving for the party tonight.  If they switch to a new set of tags I'm watching for, this can happen.</p>\n<p>Or, maybe after a Hack Day London, I'd like to go back and see what the chatter was about - ie. I can <em>see</em> what went on via the hackdaylondon tag on Flickr, and I'd like something like that for Twitter.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085870\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.elroyjetson.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4a34cf8d239b6589024fc004cfdad5b8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.elroyjetson.org\">Elroy Jetson</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085870\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-08-22T17:48:55\">2007-08-22T17:48:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I have to agree that having tags would make it nice to filter the wheat from the chafe.

    "body": "<p>I should elaborate on what I mean by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/218773732\">tags in Twitter</a>, since I got a few head-scratching responses.</p>\r\n<p>No, fitting tags into the 140 characters for a message won't work.  And, no, tagging every tweet as you go is a horrible approach - no one will do it.  What I've thought might work, though, are <i>sticky tags</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Sticky tags would persist from update to update.  From the web UI, you could drop \"work\" or \"gnomedex\" or \"l:95051 beer concert somerandomband\" into an additional tags field and all tweets from then on will gain those tags until you empty the tag field.</p>\r\n<p>There could be shortcut commands to change or clear tags - ala \"d someone\" for direct messaging.  This would be especially useful while out and about and mobile.  Say you text \"t bus commute\" to Twitter when you get on the bus for home, then anything you might emit from then on, until you change the tags, gets tagged with \"bus\" and \"commute\".</p>\r\n<p>Then, you and others could follow this particular thread of tweets via <a href=\"http://twitter.com/yourname/commute\">http://twitter.com/yourname/commute</a> - or even with tag intersections ala delicious: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/yourname/commute+bus\">http://twitter.com/yourname/commute+bus</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Going to be at SxSW for awhile?  Drop \"sxsw\" into your sticky tags.  Maybe someday everyone who doesn't want to hear it can filter out tweets with that tag rather than stop following you altogether.</p>\r\n<p>Having some sticky tags can allow a bit of metadata and filtering hooks to follow you for awhile without requiring you to do or remember much.  Keeping them as free-form text strings allows some cow-pathing as people invent conventions.</p>\r\n<p>Think of these tags as kind of long-running <i>meta</i>-status.  </p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085861\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.ecademy.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ce83a8e239c0cfce3488d3fec4d5d8de&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.ecademy.com\">Julian Bond</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085861\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-08-22T07:35:44\">2007-08-22T07:35:44</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Dave Troy's location nanoformat does this already as you've shown above.

I don't want titles, comments, or extended entries - that's what a blog is for.  I don't want features added just for coolness sake or whatever.</p>\n\n<p>But, I can see a set of problems with the Twitter experience that might be helped with something that adds a bit more context - and something like tags seems like a lightweight and somewhat simple way to do it.  Making them sticky helps make them less cumbersome to use.</p>\n\n<p>I'd really like to be able to pick and choose the sorts of updates I receive from people I follow, across different means of receiving them.  For example, I might not want to get all of someone's random ponderings on my phone, but I'd like to get pinged when they start talking about when they're leaving for the party tonight.  If they switch to a new set of tags I'm watching for, this can happen.</p>\n\n<p>Or, maybe after a Hack Day London, I'd like to go back and see what the chatter was about - ie. I can <em>see</em> what went on via the hackdaylondon tag on Flickr, and I'd like something like that for Twitter.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085870\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.elroyjetson.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4a34cf8d239b6589024fc004cfdad5b8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.elroyjetson.org\">Elroy Jetson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085870\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-08-22T17:48:55\">2007-08-22T17:48:55</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I have to agree that having tags would make it nice to filter the wheat from the chafe.

I don't ever wish I could filter out my friends posts.

And that's because no one's talking to him.  Really, this should be a FAQ for all social media, to be read by all journalists and commentators:  Listening in on random strangers' conversations is more likely to be boring than not, and that's what you're doing if you just go to <a href=\"http://twitter.com\">twitter.com</a> and start clicking around.  But, to assume because <i>you're</i> bored that the service as a <i>whole</i> is boring is, again, to be one of the <a href=\"http://www.noogenesis.com/pineapple/blind_men_elephant.html\">Blind Men with an Elephant</a>.</p>\n<p>Twitter becomes immensely interesting when it turns out that you've amassed a group of contacts who tend to run in similar circles as you, because even their off-handed remarks and random burps have a decent chance of surfacing something interesting or entertaining.  When it's good, this sets up a nice ambient chatter like sitting in a coffee shop filled with just your kind of people.</p>\n<p>This same \"I'm bored, so it's boring\" mistake has popped up again and again - applied to blogging, MMORPGs, social bookmarking, MySpace, what have you.

And that's because no one's talking to him.  Really, this should be a FAQ for all social media, to be read by all journalists and commentators:  Listening in on random strangers' conversations is more likely to be boring than not, and that's what you're doing if you just go to <a href=\"http://twitter.com\">twitter.com</a> and start clicking around.  But, to assume because <i>you're</i> bored that the service as a <i>whole</i> is boring is, again, to be one of the <a href=\"http://www.noogenesis.com/pineapple/blind_men_elephant.html\">Blind Men with an Elephant</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Twitter becomes immensely interesting when it turns out that you've amassed a group of contacts who tend to run in similar circles as you, because even their off-handed remarks and random burps have a decent chance of surfacing something interesting or entertaining.  When it's good, this sets up a nice ambient chatter like sitting in a coffee shop filled with just your kind of people.</p>\r\n<p>This same \"I'm bored, so it's boring\" mistake has popped up again and again - applied to blogging, MMORPGs, social bookmarking, MySpace, what have you.  Replace \"bored/boring\" with \"confused/confusing\" or \"annoyed/annoying\" and you've got my own early reactions to MySpace.</p>\r\n<p>But, really, it's not <i>addressed to you</i> if there's a buzz and you're not groking it.  That's a clue that you're probably missing something.  Granted, people can be insane, but it really is more likely that you're missing something - even if it's just that there's a particular brand of entertaining insanity in progress to which you're not attuned.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084309\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\">CraigM</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084309\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-05-16T21:46:56\">2007-05-16T21:46:56</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>No, I'm pretty much missing out on the appeal of MySpace and Twitter, but that's because I'm an electronic hermit.
