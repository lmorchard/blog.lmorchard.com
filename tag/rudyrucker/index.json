    "html": "<blockquote cite=\"http://www.rudyrucker.com/writing/\">When you’re writing a novel you’re working at the most extreme limit of your \ncapabilities.  What you’re doing is beyond logic, so far out at the limits of what you can do \nthat there’s no hope of your having a short and manageable simulation of the process by \nwhich to figure out what you’re doing, it’s computationally irreducible.  When you get into \nthis zone, out on the very surface of your brain, you become sensitive to the tiniest chaotic \nemanations of the world outside.  At times it feels as if the world, feeling your sensitivity, \ngladly dances back.  Dosie-do.  Keep your eyes peeled.</blockquote><div class=\"quotesource\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.rudyrucker.com/writing/\">A Writer's Toolkit by Rudy Rucker</a></div>\n\n<p>Been reading some of the notes and essays <a href=\"http://www.rudyrucker.com/writing/\">here at Rudy Rucker&#39;s site</a> in the spirit of getting my brain resonating in a writing mode, and the above quote just stuck out at me.</p>\n",
