And, let me tell you, zooming around on crutches is both hazardous and exhausting in an office environment.  Also?  I want my hands back.  It&#39;s hard to carry hot coffee or oatmeal with no hands.</p>\n<p>I haven&#39;t been posting much around here, thanks to various moments in a drugged up haze or just plain wallowing in <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/06/world-of-warcraft-is-my-world-of-warcraft\">convalescent marathon WoW sessions</a>.  The only real productive work I&#39;ve gotten done was for <a href=\"http://del.icio.us\">del.icio.us</a>.  Over the past few weeks, I just haven&#39;t felt like doing much or hacking anything at all.  However, I am pretty sad that I missed Yahoo! Hack Day.</p>\n<p>On the bright side, I&#39;m planning to be propped up in a corner at least for the <a href=\"http://upcoming.org/event/109550/\">del.icio.us birthday bash</a>.  Come sign <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/missadroit/251064139/\">the cast</a>, or plaster me with a sticker while I&#39;m too immobile to do much about it.</p>\n"}
