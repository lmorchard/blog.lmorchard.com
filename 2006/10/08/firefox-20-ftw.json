Doesn&#39;t seem like a revolution in browsers or anything, other than what it already was.  But, everything seems tighter, quicker, slicker, and more like a polished product.  My CPU usage is flatter than ever before, and it actually looks like I&#39;ve got some free memory left over after running it for a few days.  And this is speaking as an infovore who regularly has a dozen or so tabs open, with a turnover of at least a hundred a day.  All the extensions I really care about still work, a few have been forced to work using <a href=\"http://users.blueprintit.co.uk/~dave/web/firefox/nightly\">Nightly Tester Tools</a>.  And, one that stopped working (SessionSaver) has now been rolled into the browser itself.  Swank all around.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084479\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ffe238ed68da35e8037df461552234&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084479\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-10-09T17:27:40\">2006-10-09T17:27:40</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>No Greasemonkey, No installey.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s pretty slick otherwise.
