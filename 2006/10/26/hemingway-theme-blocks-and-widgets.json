One problem, though:  Although the <a href=\"http://automattic.com/code/widgets/\">WordPress Widgets</a> plugin (about which <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/21/sandbox-is-nifty\">I&#39;ve raved</a>) was based on <a href=\"http://warpspire.com/hemingway/hemingway-for-wordpress\">Hemingway</a>&#39;s Blocks feature, it&#39;s not apparently compatible.  So, anyone know how to make it compatible, or where I can get more Hemingway blocks?</p>\n<p><em>Update:</em>  Actually, Hemingway blocks look pretty easy to make, and the <a href=\"http://www.iconophobia.com/wordpress/?page_id=55\">inlineRSS</a> plugin makes for easy external site integration so I can pull my output together here.  Now, if I can just get around the bugs in word-count-limited front page excerpts with Markdown.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082887\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7b3073e125f3ac8f09130950ef5d7790&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\">brian cors</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082887\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-10-27T11:35:14\">2006-10-27T11:35:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>You nailed it.  I use inlineRSS to suck in feed info from other sites, and place the php code into a new &quot;block&quot; for each section.  </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s pretty cool - once you add code into the &quot;blocks&quot; directory - then go back to your WordPress admin site, it will know that you added new code and ask you for the name of the new block.</p>\n\n<p>Be warned - name the block as you want it the first time - from what I can tell [and confirmed by the theme author] - you can&#39;t rename it once you do so.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun, and good luck!   There are a few special xslt files that I use - one in particular for my del.icio.us links - that I can pass along, if desired...</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
