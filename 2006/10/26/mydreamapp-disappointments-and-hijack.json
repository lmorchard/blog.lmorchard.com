Let the development begin!</blockquote><div class=\"quotesource\">Source: <a href=\"http://digg.com/apple/MyDreamApp_3_Winners_Announced\">digg - MyDreamApp, 3 Winners Announced!</a></div></p>\n<p>Spoiler alert - the winners are <a href=\"http://mydreamapp.com/contestants/view/michaelyuan/\">Cookbook</a>, <a href=\"http://mydreamapp.com/contestants/view/farzadsadjadi/\">Portal</a>, and <a href=\"http://mydreamapp.com/contestants/view/cameronwestland/\">Atmosphere</a>.  Pretty disappointing, since my faves were <a href=\"http://mydreamapp.com/contestants/view/kevincapizzi/\">Hijack</a>, <a href=\"http://mydreamapp.com/contestants/view/richardwhitelock/\">Whistler</a>, and <a href=\"http://mydreamapp.com/contestants/view/andrewwilson/\">Desktop Wars</a>.  Of course, I didn&#39;t do anything other than vote and occasionally forum-lurk.</p>\n<p>Which, matter of fact, is why <a href=\"http://mydreamapp.com/contestants/view/kevincapizzi/\">Hijack</a> was my top favorite of all.  I&#39;ve gotten a lot of read-only coverage of the web from my news aggregator, but I&#39;ve never ever been able to get into web-distributed forum groups.  Some have RSS feeds, but most don&#39;t and I never remember to revisit them.  I love the power of the web, and I love distributed apps - but sometimes I miss Usenet.</p>\n<p>Seems like there&#39;s a need for Atom-ized comments - that is, a data format for forum aggregators to read and an API for reply submission with spam resistance.  Hijack featured forum HTML scraping as a proposed feature - but what if you could get adoption for some simple plugins for <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">Wordpress</a>, <a href=\"http://www.phpbb.com/\">phpBB</a>, <a href=\"http://getvanilla.com/\">Vanilla</a>, etal?  <a href=\"http://co.mments.com/\">co.mments</a> seemed promising, but I&#39;ve just not gotten into it much.  I need to do some poking around to see who is already working on this.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082986\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://vjarmy.com/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/RemyDWD.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://vjarmy.com/\">Dan Dickinson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082986\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-10-26T18:20:16\">2006-10-26T18:20:16</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>It&#39;s funny; a week ago, something set me off on writing a &quot;Why do we not have forum aggregators?!&quot; post, and then a bit of googling led me to Hijack, and then the massive disappointment last night that it lost.</p>\n\n<p>And then this morning, I was just thinking that it&#39;d be easily doable in Atom.</p>\n\n<p>I need to stop thinking in other people&#39;s blog posts.</p>\n\n<p>(If you do get going on this, let me know.)</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221082988&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://plasmasturm.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://plasmasturm.org/&quot;&gt;Aristotle Pagaltzis&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221082988&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2006-10-27T09:45:34&quot;&gt;2006-10-27T09:45:34&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This should be a pretty trivial job of stringing together the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;APP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rfc.net/rfc4685.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Atom Threading (RFC 4685)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre><p><p>(Hmm, where did your AJAX preview button go?
