One of the things that struck me like a bolt from the blue recently is the notion of <a href=\"http://icant.co.uk/sandbox/eventdelegation/\">event delegation</a>.  For the most part, I&#39;ve treated event bubbling as a nuisance, except for where it came in handy in keyboard input handling.  But avoiding the need to individually track events on every list element on the page via instantiated objects and methods is <em>hot</em> and <em>forehead-slappingly obvious</em> once you&#39;ve seen it working.  Just implement one set of event handlers on the outline root element (ie. UL or OL), and do the right thing as events come in from the list child elements.</p>\n<p>Thus, while I can do outline node expand/collapse with ease, my goal is to implement an <a href=\"http://icant.co.uk/sandbox/eventdelegation/\">event delegation</a> based approach to dragging outline nodes around.  Apropos of that, I&#39;ve been poking at <a href=\"http://yuiblog.com/sandbox/yui/v0114/examples/event/delegation.php\">how event delegation it works in YUI</a>.  While there&#39;s nothing much special about it in general, I&#39;ve run into a bit of a snag when it comes to drag-and-drop.</p>\n<p>See, YUI comes with a <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dragdrop/\">rather nice drag-and-drop abstraction</a> that I&#39;d like to use.  That abstraction, however, requires the instantiation of lots of little objects - one per outline node.  Definitely not delegation-based: The problem is that I&#39;ll be adding and removing outline nodes at whim throughout the lifetime of the page, which would require lots of care to ensure that I&#39;m maintaining drag-and-drop wrapper objects.  I&#39;ve done that a bit in <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a>; it sucks.</p>\n<p>So, I was able to build part of a delegation-based drag tracker from scratch.  I&#39;m sad to lose the other niceties that the YUI DnD offers, but it works.  The problem now, though, is the <em>drop</em> part of the equation.

When I have an outline of 100's to 1000's of items, that really blows.

It's crazy, but it might work.</p>\n<p>First, style Drags so their z-Index is LOWER than the Drops.  You want your mouse to hit the droppable areas.</p>\n<p>Once a droppable is moused over by dragging a drag to it, it creates a transparent element in the exact same position as the Droppable.  It also lowers the droppable z-Index.  This gives the appearance that the draggable is over the droppable.</p>\n<p>To simulate movement, the transparent droppable's mouseovers are sent to the draggable.</p>\n<p>On mousing out of the transparent Droppable, it sets everything back to normal.</p>\n<p>I haven't tried this yet.  The biggest issue I see is that when you grab a draggable in the middle, half of it will be behind the droppable until the mouseover happens.  This isn't ideal, but maybe there is something that can be done about that.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083088\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8f18d2579d5c8f2fb2a79c09a9234e6e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Batiste</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083088\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-20T10:06:54\">2009-01-20T10:06:54</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>A jQuery solution for Drag and Drop with event delegation :</p>\n<p>http://batiste.dosimple.ch/blog/posts/2008-05-18-1/jquery-drag-and-drop-and-resize-event-delegation.html</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

If you haven't seen JavaScriptMVC, check out its trunk.  In the controller2 plugin, you'll find a really nice event delegation library.</p>\n\n<p>I've only thought of 1 way to do event delegation drops.  It's crazy, but it might work.</p>\n\n<p>First, style Drags so their z-Index is LOWER than the Drops.  You want your mouse to hit the droppable areas.</p>\n\n<p>Once a droppable is moused over by dragging a drag to it, it creates a transparent element in the exact same position as the Droppable.  It also lowers the droppable z-Index.  This gives the appearance that the draggable is over the droppable.</p>\n\n<p>To simulate movement, the transparent droppable's mouseovers are sent to the draggable.</p>\n\n<p>On mousing out of the transparent Droppable, it sets everything back to normal.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't tried this yet.  The biggest issue I see is that when you grab a draggable in the middle, half of it will be behind the droppable until the mouseover happens.  This isn't ideal, but maybe there is something that can be done about that.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083088\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8f18d2579d5c8f2fb2a79c09a9234e6e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Batiste</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083088\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-20T10:06:54\">2009-01-20T10:06:54</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>A jQuery solution for Drag and Drop with event delegation :</p>\n\n<p>http://batiste.dosimple.ch/blog/posts/2008-05-18-1/jquery-drag-and-drop-and-resize-event-delegation.html</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

    "html": "<p>One of my favorite features of the new Firefox are <a href=\"http://microsummaries.org/\">Microsummaries</a>.  They&#39;re like RSS-lite: one-liner summaries of web pages that can be used to keep bookmark titles up to date and get succinct info about a page.  For example, you could get the latest temperature from the title of a weather report bookmark, or the most recent bid price from an auction page.</p>\n<p>But, there&#39;s one thing that rubs me the wrong way, and it&#39;s this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;microsummary&quot; href=&quot;microsummary.txt&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>That&#39;s how you clue a client into finding the microsummary for a given HTML page.  Stick that in your head tag, and you&#39;re off.  It&#39;s just like <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery\">RSS autodiscovery</a>.  Well it is, except for an important detail: What&#39;s the Content-Type I should expect at that URL?</p>\n<p>You see, microsummaries can be provided as either a direct URL to a plain text summary of the page, or a URL to an XML-based generator providing the means to extract that plain text summary from the page.  But, as spec&#39;ed, you never know which you&#39;re going to get until you fetch the URL.  So, when trying to handle a <a href=\"http://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries\">microsummary</a>, I never know whether to just use the fetched content directly as plain text or whether it&#39;s time to fire up the XSL machinery.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve seen some sites toss in a type=&quot;text/plain&quot; or type=&quot;application/xml&quot; attribute - which is very helpful and what I really want to see - but it&#39;s not in <a href=\"http://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries\">the spec</a>.  From a cursory perusal of Firefox source code, it looks like the browser tries to sniff the Content-Type header returned by the web server - but that sucks, because web servers often lie or are confused about Content-Type.  I need to read more into that source code, so I can at least do as well as Firefox does.</p>\n<p>Eh, it&#39;s a small gripe, but one on which I&#39;ve spent too much time already.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082514\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7d1c8d2b1a7643236a4661e9a974dee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\">George Hotelling</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082514\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-10-29T22:26:04\">2006-10-29T22:26:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>What's the advantage of sticking it into the markup instead of just using the HTTP headers for the microsummary?</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082515\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082515\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-10-31T01:11:08\">2006-10-31T01:11:08</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Well, in the markup, I'm more confident it'll tell the intended truth.

    "body": "One of my favorite features of the new Firefox are [Microsummaries][ms].  They're like RSS-lite: one-liner summaries of web pages that can be used to keep bookmark titles up to date and get succinct info about a page.  For example, you could get the latest temperature from the title of a weather report bookmark, or the most recent bid price from an auction page.\r\n\r\nBut, there's one thing that rubs me the wrong way, and it's this:\r\n\r\n    <link rel=\"microsummary\" href=\"microsummary.txt\">\r\n\r\nThat's how you clue a client into finding the microsummary for a given HTML page.  Stick that in your head tag, and you're off.  It's just like [RSS autodiscovery][rd].  Well it is, except for an important detail: What's the Content-Type I should expect at that URL?\r\n\r\nYou see, microsummaries can be provided as either a direct URL to a plain text summary of the page, or a URL to an XML-based generator providing the means to extract that plain text summary from the page.  But, as spec'ed, you never know which you're going to get until you fetch the URL.  So, when trying to handle a [microsummary][mst], I never know whether to just use the fetched content directly as plain text or whether it's time to fire up the XSL machinery.\r\n\r\nI've seen some sites toss in a type=\"text/plain\" or type=\"application/xml\" attribute - which is very helpful and what I really want to see - but it's not in [the spec][mst].  From a cursory perusal of Firefox source code, it looks like the browser tries to sniff the Content-Type header returned by the web server - but that sucks, because web servers often lie or are confused about Content-Type.  I need to read more into that source code, so I can at least do as well as Firefox does.\r\n\r\nEh, it's a small gripe, but one on which I've spent too much time already.\r\n\r\n[rd]: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery\r\n[ms]: http://microsummaries.org/\r\n[mst]: http://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082514\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7d1c8d2b1a7643236a4661e9a974dee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\">George Hotelling</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082514\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-10-29T22:26:04\">2006-10-29T22:26:04</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>What's the advantage of sticking it into the markup instead of just using the HTTP headers for the microsummary?</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082515\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082515\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-10-31T01:11:08\">2006-10-31T01:11:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Well, in the markup, I'm more confident it'll tell the intended truth.
