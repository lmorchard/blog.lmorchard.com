It ran and appeared to work fine with a backup of all my stuff.  Beyond that, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing - yet.  But, just like when I downloaded and built the first release of Mozilla, this gives me some geeky comfort.  (Only well, unlike Mozilla, this thing didn&#39;t crash &amp; burn out of the box.)</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>Hmm, need to tweak the WordPress tool to produce HTML lists instead of tables.  There, <i>done</i>.  I just tweaked <code>wordPressSuite.getPostText</code> to produce nested HTML lists that are more friendly to styling via CSS.  If anyone happens to want my tweak, let me know.</span>\n     </li>\n     </ul></p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085165\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e377f3e2140297d32460ae9a4b38ff98&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085165\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-14T06:21:26\">2006-02-14T06:21:26</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Les, you should have just told me we were building Gopher NG, and I&#39;d have been on it in a hurry.</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
