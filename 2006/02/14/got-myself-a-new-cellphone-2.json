I try to explore the features and see how useful they can be as things I habitually reach for in the course of thought.  </p>\n <p>So, I&#39;ve been having fun lately with a new <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000BYEUUG/104-3738331-5415167?v=glance\">LG PM-225</a> cameraphone from Sprint.  It&#39;s certainly no mega-nifty smartphone, but it&#39;s a hell of a step up from my trusty old <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/03/26/a500-not-3g\">Samsung A500</a>.  A few initial thoughts:</p>\n     <ul>\n     <li>\n     <span>It&#39;s nice having a cameraphone, period, as well as having a much more capable web browser and SMS messaging built right into the phone (as opposed of accessible from web forms).</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>I&#39;ve installed <a href=\"http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/operamini/phones/?phone=lg_pm225\">Opera Mini</a>, and started playing around with a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/phone/feeds/\">mobile reading list</a> of feeds using some code from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1\">my first book</a>.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>It&#39;s been nice to skim some feeds and email myself links to items I&#39;d like to read on a larger screen - which the built-in OpenWave browser does, but not Opera Mini.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>I&#39;ve played just a bit with setting up some <a href=\"http://www.ii.com/internet/robots/procmail/\">procmail filters</a> to route email from the phone to various folders or scripts.  For instance, I&#39;ve got a notion to send myself captured thoughts and notes to be added to an <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/stories/storyReader$27\">Instant Outline</a> hosted on my server and monitored from my PowerBook running the OPML Editor.  </span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>I&#39;ve also been considering some homebrew moblogging tools for the camera side of things.</span>\n     </li>\n     </ul></p>\n"}
