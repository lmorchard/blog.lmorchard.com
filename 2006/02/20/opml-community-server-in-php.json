I started roughing out <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/OpmlServer\">a standalone OPML Community Server in PHP</a> this afternoon.  Who knows how far I&#39;ll get, but it has initial bare-bones support for registration, login, and upstreaming.  And when I say &quot;support&quot;, I don&#39;t mean anything grandiose - it&#39;s really just a bunch of XML-RPC methods at this point, but it could turn into something interesting.</p>\n <p>There <i>is</i> one thing that kind of threw me for a loop in the OPML Editor user interface, though:  The &quot;Change Community...&quot; menu item assumes a port of 5337 for any XML-RPC server that&#39;s not <code>support.opml.org</code>.  That made me have to manually tweak my <code>dotOpmlData.prefs</code> to talk to my own server on port 80.</p>\n"}
