As a follow-up to [Tuesday's post][tp], I've disabled the nightly link post as of now and turned off the links category on the main page template.  

I got a surprising amount of good and friendly feedback on the change in comments, IMs, and emails.  And, the balance to me sounds like there are people who *sorta* liked the change and a lot of people just plain turned off by it—the nays were louder than the yeas.  I was on the fence, leaning toward dislike, so down go the links.

I'd still like to reintegrate [my link posting output on del.icio.us][del] into this site in some other fashion soon, because that's where the bulk of my hasty blogging happens these days.  In the course of writing [this new book][book], I've got a panoply of other options available from sidebars to AJAX-powered geegaws.  I've also considered pulling [FeedMagick][] into the mix to offer a "build your own" remixed feed option, but I've not yet had the ambition to deliver on that.

So sorry link fans, it's back to the status quo for me, for now.
