After awhile, though, the playlist repetitions started to get to me after 4-5 hour stints, so I switched over to <a href=\"http://www.radioio.com/radioio80s.php\">radioio80s</a>.  Man, does <a href=\"http://www.radioio.com\">radioio</a> have a single bad station?  Every one I've listened to has some really great selections, B-Sides and \"deep cuts\" you'd never hear on traditional radio, even back in the day.
