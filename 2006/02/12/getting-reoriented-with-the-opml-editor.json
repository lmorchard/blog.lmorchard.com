I&#39;ve been spewing over on my <a href=\"http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/\">OPML blog</a> for awhile today, and going to try pasting some excerpts here.</em></p>\n<p>As I play more with the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org\">OPML Editor</a>, I wonder if I might not be able to mash it up with my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog\">WordPress</a> installation for more spontaneous editing of daily asides.  The wordpress.root tool isn&#39;t quite working for me, but I have a few ideas for alternatives or fixes.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s been awhile since I seriously an outliner for blogging, if I ever really did.  I can see how it biases toward quick blogging and spew.  And that&#39;s a good thing.</p>\n<p>I do wish that the OPML Editor had some modernized font handling on OS X, though, so my Georgia font looked anti-aliased in the outliner.  But alas, I don&#39;t know the first thing about getting that hacked into this tool.</p>\n<p>Next, looking for the glossary table, so I can author my own things like... &quot;;-&gt;&quot;  Oh, yeah, there it is: <code>user.html.glossary</code></p>\n<p>Also, I&#39;ve started keeping the OPML Editor open instead of Tinderbox.  And, while I don&#39;t get the richer visualization tools that Tinderbox offers, I <i>do</i> get a ton of nigh frictionless network connectivity via upstreaming and outline publishing.  So, I lose maps but I gain sharing.</p>\n<p>On the down side, there&#39;s a ton of tinkerable code under the hood that I keep having to herd myself away from to get anything done on what I&#39;m <i>supposed</i> to be accomplishing.  But, that&#39;s just a tinkerer&#39;s occupation hazard.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s see, what else?  I&#39;m wishing for <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/deusx\">my del.icio.us bookmarks</a> as an OPML outline now, so I have a palette from which to draw in composing little asides here.  I wonder if it&#39;d be nasty to pipe some del.icio.us bookmarks into a Glossary?  I tried playing with <a href=\"http://dannyayers.com/archives/2006/02/07/delicious-reading-lists/\">some XSLT found by way of Danny Ayers</a>, with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2006/02/delicious-to-full-opml.xsl\">some tweaks of my own</a>, but I think it&#39;s producing OPML that gives the editor some indigestion.  (Danny&#39;s original XSLT seems to work, though.)</p>\n"}
