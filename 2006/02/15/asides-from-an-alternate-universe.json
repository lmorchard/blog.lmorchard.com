Presentations straight from outlines, with web standards goodness.  Who says you can&#39;t have cake and eat it too? </span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>Later:  Hot damn, it&#39;s my <a href=\"http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/l.m.orchard.xml\">Instant Outline as an S5 presentation</a>.  No, it doesn&#39;t make a ton of sense, but it was quick and easy to make this nonsense.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span><a href=\"http://blogs.opml.org/dwatts/2006/02/15#When:4:55:09PM\">Donovan&#39;s also getting an odd error</a> from my newsRiver add-on, and the original NewsRiver.  I hope my crud didn&#39;t break things, though.  Not sure if this tip helps, but:  You can try running <kbd>viewNewsItems</kbd> in decafbadNewsRiverSuite directly within the OPML editor to &quot;replay&quot; the last web request and get an in-editor error dialog with a more helpful Go To button to chase the error.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>I&#39;m starting to think that the OPML Editor and NewsRiver is a good platform to try throwing together a next iteration of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/hacking_rss_and_atom/ch15_popular_links.py\">popular links script</a> and some notions I had in mind for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a>.  I still really like some of the ideas I was exploring with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a> - but apropos <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/13/reading-lists-opml-xoxo-semantic-web-and-tools\">my recent semi-rant about tools</a>, I should target efforts where more people can take advantage of them more easily.  I love Python, and definitely have a yen for things running on the OS itself - rather than the OS-within-an-OS that is the OPML Editor.  But, I haven&#39;t yet had time to bundle my stuff up as a single-icon install like the OPML Editor, and there&#39;s a lot of infrastructure already there for the hacking.  So, if you can&#39;t beat &#39;em...</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>I&#39;d also like to get back around to adding more things to <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick\">FeedMagick</a>, such as maybe some Reading List style features to blend multiple feeds from an OPML list into one output feed.  Need to build some cross-format conversion tools.  I could also see a popular links type script joining <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/\">the suite</a>.  These sorts of things seem like they could be a server-side complement to the OPML Editor, especially in cases where I can&#39;t run Frontier or the OPML Editor on a server yet PHP is available.</span>\n     </li>\n     </ul></p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084351\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e377f3e2140297d32460ae9a4b38ff98&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084351\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-16T05:35:54\">2006-02-16T05:35:54</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>ah, there&#39;s nothing like the smell of an alternative universe in the morning.</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
