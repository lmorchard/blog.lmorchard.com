And that something is this:  Why are the disclosure triangles on the left, yet the scroll bar is on the right?  I think it's left-to-right reading and the visual semantics of a bullet point colliding with the general right-handedness of most GUIs.  If you're a lefty, you may have a different take on this.  But at any rate, if you take a peek at <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog_attachments/miniagg-1.jpg\">my latest in aggregator UI design</a>, such as it is, you'll see that I've opted for sticking the triangles on <i>both</i> sides and clustered the per-item controls over by the scroll bar on the right.  You shouldn't need to bounce your mouse from side to side on the screen to interact with this stuff.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086252\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.splitbrain.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b6b4d7dbe3fb7cf61b68e36cd80f8698&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\"></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.splitbrain.org\">Andreas Gohr</a>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#comment-221086252\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-17T22:39:50\">2006-02-17T22:39:50</time></a></p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Interesting.
