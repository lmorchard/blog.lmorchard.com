He is still here, still unleashing prodigious streams of urine at the bathroom stalls whilst emitting the occasional semi-voluntary grunts and still conducting quite vocal business via a Bluetooth headset.  Flushes and the sounds of other restroom visitors abound.  How can the people with whom he does business not realize he&#39;s doing his business at the same time?  And then, how can he bring himself to shake anyone&#39;s hand when he just zips up and strides out of the lavatory with nary a handwash.  This man is easily in his 50&#39;s.  I expect he&#39;s not new to the world and the customs of our country - he speaks English without accent, which I can hear clearly while I&#39;m quietly occupying my own stall.  At any rate, this disturbs me.  And now, I hope, it has disturbed you and perhaps amused you.  And, if you are a creature such as this man...  <b>STOP IT.</b></p>\n"}
