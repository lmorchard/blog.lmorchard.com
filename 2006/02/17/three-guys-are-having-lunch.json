No offense intended to any Opie&#39;s, Randolf&#39;s, or Xavier&#39;s out there - and all apologies in case I&#39;ve misrepresented your respective lunchtime positions.  Laugh, it&#39;s funny.</i></p>\n <p><b>Opie</b> (entering): Hey, guys!  How&#39;s it going!?  Have I got some stories to tell you!</p>\n <p><b>Randolf</b>: <a href=\"http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-06-27/Wow___XML_\">Jesus, that&#39;s an ugly shirt!  And how&#39;d you learn to walk that way?</a></p>\n <p><b>Xavier</b>: Your shirt isn&#39;t much better, Randolph.  <a href=\"http://microformats.org/about/\">At least mine&#39;s made from natural fibers.</a></p>\n <p><b>Opie</b>: Eh, my shirt&#39;s fine.  It was free, it fits, and it was in the closet when I got up.</p>\n <p><b>Randolf</b>: And did you have to come in that gas-guzzling smogmobile of yours? <a href=\"http://dannyayers.com/archives/2006/02/10/feedlists-in-rdf/\">I wish you&#39;d driven an electric car.</a></p>\n <p><b>Xavier</b>: ...or maybe <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/11/27/i-wish-it-were-in-xoxo\">a bicycle cleverly constructed from coconuts!</a>  It&#39;s biodegradable and partially digestible!</p>\n <p><b>Opie</b>: Er, um, okay.  My car&#39;s pretty cool!  <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/download\">It was free, it runs, and it came with a steering wheel and automatic transmission!</a>  It could do with a wheel cover and a seat belt, though.</p>\n <p><b>Randolf</b>:  <a href=\"http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-07-06/OPML__XOXO\" title=\"I use emacs plus the command line for most of my coding, and after trying out a half dozen blog posting tool for posting to Copia, I ended up writing an e-mail-to-post gateway so that I can enter text (markdown) into a UI I'm already familiar with, Evolution's e-mail composition window.\">When I drive, I prefer a stick shift and a system of ropes and pullies to steer.</a></p>\n <p><b>Xavier</b>: <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/faqs-for-rdf\">I like a conveyance that helps make me one with the nature of the world.</a></p>\n <p><b>Opie</b>: That all sounds like a pain in the ass.  How&#39;d you guys get here?</p>\n <p><b>Randolf</b>:  I walked - <a href=\"http://www.dajobe.org/2004/01/turtle/\">I&#39;ve got comfortable shoes</a>.  I do <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/11/IsaViz/\">have a fun scooter</a> in the garage, though.</p>\n <p><b>Xavier</b>: <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">I took the bus</a>, though sometimes I walk.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo_outliner_experiment\">I&#39;m seriously working on that coconut bicycle, though.</a></p>\n <p><b>Opie</b>: Yikes!  How do you guys get much done during the day?</p>\n <p><b>Randolf</b>: Oh, I get by.  I get up really early and start writing, having woken from dreams of electric <i>flying</i> cars I&#39;ll have in the future.</p>\n <p><b>Xavier</b>: I blog and write search engines.  That keeps me plenty busy.</p>\n <p><b>Opie</b>: Ugh.  So, anyway.  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/16/just-put-on-your-xoxo-colored-glasses\">I&#39;ll shop for a hybrid or something this week</a>, but I&#39;m not giving up my car.  Now, do you guys want to hear my stories, or what?</p>\n"}
