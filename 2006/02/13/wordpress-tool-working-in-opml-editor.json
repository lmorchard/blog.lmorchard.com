I stuck in a quick line to clear that buffer (<code>$this-&gt;_currentTagContents</code>) at the start of each element parsed, which seems to have helped.  But, not having fully grasped what all is going on in there, I hope I haven&#39;t broken anything else.</p>\n<p>But, for now, it appears that this tool has worked for me finally.  Because, in fact, this very entry was posted from within the OPML Editor rather than my usual ecto window.</p>\n"}
