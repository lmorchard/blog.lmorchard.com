In fact, I'm writing this on version 10.1a6 that I compiled myself with Apple's Xcode from a SourceForge CVS check-out.  It's a serious effort to have made it this easy.

That was the big thing that Mozilla missed when it was first released as Open Source.  This is exciting stuff and a hard thing to have accomplished, me thinks.</p>\n",
