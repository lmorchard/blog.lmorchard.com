This is what I think the River of News (ie. Radio UserLand / newsRiver) is missing, and the 3-Pane Aggregator (ie. NetNewsWire / FeedDemon) can provide.  There is no priority in the River of News—while you can generally sort feeds into folders in the 3-Pane Aggregator.  </p>\n<p>So, in my use of NetNewsWire, I&#39;ve got a sort of prioritized  Swamp of News.  I have organized my feeds into a set of folders in prioritized order.  I start from the first folder, and work my way down—but if I haven&#39;t read everything by the end of the day, I hit &quot;Mark All as Read&quot; with no regrets.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these articles don&#39;t go away automatically and the place can get a little smelly &amp; stagnant.  I&#39;ve got an idea percolating to write an AppleScript to do that for me, but it&#39;s a slight pain.  Also unfortunately, I can&#39;t quite get NNW&#39;s combined outline view to work to my satisfaction—so my view&#39;s still subdivided up into headline and preview pane chunks, somewhat more like a marshy delta than a rushing river.</p>\n<p>What I really want is a River of News view that&#39;s got prioritized layers.  That is, there should be strata to this River.  Tasty foam up toward the top, attention-consuming undertow toward the bottom.</p>\n<p>Near the surface, I can sip from all my highest-value feeds—daily comics and amusements, my synthetic popular links feed, server monitor feeds, ego-surfing search feeds, high-signal news feeds.  </p>\n<p>Further down, I can slip into the top layers of the blogosphere, if I have time.  Then, should I happen to get through everything interesting from there, I can start dipping into the high-noise segment of my feeds.</p>\n<p>So, some days, I might only have time to sample a few comics and catch the day&#39;s hot memes.  Other days, I might be able to graze all the way down to my random Feedster search feeds on &quot;Ray Kurzweil&quot; and &quot;Tinderbox&quot;.  In any case, the river should flow without my urging it on.  For each of these strata, I want a River of News user interface, but I want the segmentation provided by folders in a 3-Pane Viewer.</p>\n<p>Still, though, there&#39;s something missing even from a Stratified River of News.  Sometimes, there are things I&#39;d really like to catch from the very bottom of the river that I&#39;ll never personally have time to find.  It&#39;d be nice if this River had <em>some</em> turbulence and mixing between the strata.</p>\n<p>But that&#39;s a subject for a follow-up rant involving machine learning, filtering, and adaptivity built into the aggregator...</p>\n<blockquote cite=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/SAAS/?p=80\">The problem with feed readers is that, although they help us to organize our information feeds, they don't address the root problem of reducing the amount of information we have to take in.

Around that time, I read \"The Media Lab\" by Stewart Brand, who pointed out that even a big newspaper prints no more than about 10 percent of the AP stories on their wire.</p>\n<p>Then, maybe 10 percent of what gets into the paper actually catches the reader's eye. That means that 1 percent of the potential information flow gets to the average reader, and generally, it's not the right 1 percent. </p>\n<p>When I worked for CNN.com, we tried to create a custom news product (called, strangely enough, CustomNews, launched around 1999) that let the reader twiddle a few dials to tune the news that got your attention. You could, for instance, tell the application what sports teams you followed, and set up individualized keywords (I might choose \"Apple\", \"photography\", \"Honda\", \"Atlanta\", \"Tucker, GA\"), and stories featuring those keywords would come up in your news.</p>\n<p>CNN had a big advantage -- we could rely on metadata included in the newswire. When you're pulling newsfeeds from the web, you have a much richer tapestry, but you don't know much about the threads. </p>\n<p>The River of News approach looks to concentrate on maximizing flow, but what we really need, as you suggest, is a way to find the fish in the River of News.</p>\n<p>I rely on some keyword feeds from Google News, Feedster, and Blogdigger to get a similar end result, but none of them matches up to a human editor. It's getting to the point, for instance, that I know I can skip surfing Mac news, and rely on John Gruber at Daring Fireball to catch almost anything I would be interested in.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084553\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=56ee28134dd0776825445e3551979b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\">Bob Aman</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084553\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-07T20:28:44\">2006-01-07T20:28:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Since it'll likely be quite a while before I get around to implementing it myself (and I'm going to even though I don't know how well it'll work), but I suppose I'll just drop my own idea for a next-gen aggregator.</p>\n<p>Aggregator + Bayesian Filter</p>\n<p>Each time you read a post you can mark it as interesting or not.

Around that time, I read \"The Media Lab\" by Stewart Brand, who pointed out that even a big newspaper prints no more than about 10 percent of the AP stories on their wire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, maybe 10 percent of what gets into the paper actually catches the reader's eye. That means that 1 percent of the potential information flow gets to the average reader, and generally, it's not the right 1 percent. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I worked for CNN.com, we tried to create a custom news product (called, strangely enough, CustomNews, launched around 1999) that let the reader twiddle a few dials to tune the news that got your attention. You could, for instance, tell the application what sports teams you followed, and set up individualized keywords (I might choose \"Apple\", \"photography\", \"Honda\", \"Atlanta\", \"Tucker, GA\"), and stories featuring those keywords would come up in your news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN had a big advantage -- we could rely on metadata included in the newswire. When you're pulling newsfeeds from the web, you have a much richer tapestry, but you don't know much about the threads. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The River of News approach looks to concentrate on maximizing flow, but what we really need, as you suggest, is a way to find the fish in the River of News.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I rely on some keyword feeds from Google News, Feedster, and Blogdigger to get a similar end result, but none of them matches up to a human editor. It's getting to the point, for instance, that I know I can skip surfing Mac news, and rely on John Gruber at Daring Fireball to catch almost anything I would be interested in.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084553\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=56ee28134dd0776825445e3551979b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\">Bob Aman</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084553\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-07T20:28:44\">2006-01-07T20:28:44</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Since it'll likely be quite a while before I get around to implementing it myself (and I'm going to even though I don't know how well it'll work), but I suppose I'll just drop my own idea for a next-gen aggregator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aggregator + Bayesian Filter</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each time you read a post you can mark it as interesting or not.  The filter has two buckets, appropriately, the interesting bucket and the uninteresting bucket.  Interesting posts should have certain similar features, usually in the form of buzzwords I would guess, which the filter should be reasonably good at picking out.  And the interesting vs non-interesting sorting capabilities would act as a way of making the \"foam\" float to the top.  And then one should be able to feel totally unguilty on those busy days when you hit \"Mark Uninteresting As Read.\"</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084554\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084554\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-07T20:50:40\">2006-01-07T20:50:40</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Bob: Actually, I included an aggregator with feedback buttons to train a Bayesian filter (Reverend) in Chapter 15 of Hacking RSS and Atom.
