Been quite busy since Christmas, long hours at work and long hours at home.  But, somehow, I&#39;ve still managed to plow a decent path through the pile of books left for me under the tree.  </p>\n<p>So, I figure this might be a good time to mention them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1892391279%2Fqid%3D1137683002%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3Fn%3D507846%26s%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance\">Burn</a>, by <strong>James Patrick Kelley</strong></p>\n<p>This is an excellent mix of post-human future and pastoral retreat from same.  It&#39;s just shy of novel length, but there&#39;s plenty of story here.  And there are plenty of things not completely spelled out, but explained just enough to give a sense of a larger universe into which this tale is nestled.  Also, don&#39;t miss <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/freereads\">the podcast reading by the author</a>!  That&#39;s how I found out about the book, after all.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0765347989%2Fref%3Dpd_kar%3Fn%3D283155\">First Meetings in the Enderverse</a>, by <strong>Orson Scott Card</strong></p>\n<p>I&#39;m always a sucker for an Ender story, and Orson Scott Card is one of my all-time favorite authors—even if I do think he voices <a href=\"http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/\">some ornery political opinions</a> from time to time and has a <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2000/02/03/card/\">pretty unpleasant reputation</a>.  Some great origin material here, as well as the original Ender&#39;s Game.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0812564626%2Fqid%3D1137683017%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3Fn%3D507846%26s%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance\">The Crystal City</a>, by <strong>Orson Scott Card</strong></p>\n<p>I&#39;ll be sad if this is the final volume.  I&#39;m pretty sure that the entire Alvin Maker series is a barely-concealed religious allegory, but that doesn&#39;t keep me from enjoying the heck out of this alternate history America.  Whatever your faith or lack thereof, the struggle against the Unmaker is universal.  That, and I&#39;d like to think I strive to be a bit of a Maker, albeit mostly only in software.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#39;m also starting on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0393323196%2Fqid%3D1137685942%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_b_2_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155\">A Mind So Rare</a>, by <strong>Merlin Donald</strong></p>\n<p>Just about 30 pages into this one, but so far I&#39;m enjoying it.  As opposed to a lot of the deterministic stuff about consciousness I&#39;ve read in school and on my own—&quot;You are simply a machine!&quot;—this book would appear to use the same research to present a picture of the mind which in fact supports awareness and free will.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- tags: books orsonscottcard ender cogsci makers scifi reviews -->\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084632\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://thelsdj.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=481899bbed033a99fbf3467fc709733f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://thelsdj.org/\">Adam Wendt</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084632\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-19T17:27:52\">2006-01-19T17:27:52</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>As far as I know The Crystal City will <em>not</em> be the final Alvin book.

I&#39;m not through the whole book, yet, but he&#39;s contending that the consciously-directed, reshaping of the physical structure of the brain shows the causal efficacy of the mind.  There was a hint earlier (I&#39;m about half-way through) that he will broach quantum mechanics to find the actual phsyical forces involved.   </p>\n\n<p>It would be interesting to read what you think of A Mind So Rare, once you&#39;re done.</p></div>\n\n        </li>\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084635\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084635\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-20T03:42:18\">2006-01-20T03:42:18</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Adam: You might be pleased to note that your recommendation finally pushed me over the edge of finally signing up for IGMS.
