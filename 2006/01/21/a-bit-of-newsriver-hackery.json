(Or reinstalled, if you grabbed last night&#39;s version.)  Also, I fixed a bug or two.</em></p>\n<p>So, I couldn&#39;t resist poking around with Dave Winer&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.newsriver.org/\">newsRiver</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.opml.org\">OPML editor</a>.  For whomever&#39;s interested in this sort of thing, here&#39;s the result of a couple of hours&#39; hacking this evening:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/decafbadNewsRiver/decafbadNewsRiver.root\"><code>decafbadNewsRiver.root</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this is a tool to be dropped into your OPML Editor install&#39;s Guest Databases / apps / Tools directory, right alongside <code>newsRiver.root</code> itself.  You may need to restart the OPML Editor.  Once installed, you should see a new &quot;DecafbadNewsRiver&quot; menu item under the Tools menu, allowing you to view your news in this new UI.  Expect <em>lots</em> of bugs, though.</p>\n<p>Basically, this provides an alternate DHTML outline rendering of the news items gathered by newsRiverâ€”quite similar to <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/05/feedspool-is-progressing-nicely\">what I did back in October for FeedSpool</a>.  I&#39;m not sure how far I&#39;ll take this, if I take it any farther.  I&#39;ve got a bit of a notion to tackle some REST/AJAX interaction with newsRiver for on-the-spot item deletion, and maybe on-demand item content retrieval.</p>\n<p>But, for newsRiver hackers:  You might like what I&#39;ve done with the <code>viewNewsItems</code> script under <code>decafbadNewsRiverSuite</code>.  I&#39;ve made an attempt to pull all of the HTML out of the midst of the processing code.  That&#39;s was icky, and I hated it back when I first ran into it in Radio UserLand.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve broken all of that out into smaller external templates for page, feed, and item under <code>decafbadNewsRiverData</code>.  This should allow for easier styling and customization of the code that newsRiver produces, as well as maybe swapping themes on the fly with a preference that points the rendering process at a different root table for templates.</p>\n<p>In any case, do what you like with this work.  I hope it&#39;s useful to someone out there.</p>\n<!-- tags: newsriver frontier userland radio usertalk rss syndication feeds dwiner -->\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084999\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://donovanwatts.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=188ad8b4dc99107d22c8b868e45f0508&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://donovanwatts.com/\">Donovan Watts</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084999\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-21T07:55:24\">2006-01-21T07:55:24</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>neat! i much prefer this interface. thanks much.</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
