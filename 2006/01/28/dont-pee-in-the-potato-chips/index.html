        <section class="post-content">
          <p>So, I&#39;ve <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/28/ancient-code-drifting-down-the-newsriver">expressed some renewed interest</a> in tinkering around with the code behind the <a href="http://support.opml.org/">OPML Editor</a> and <a href="http://www.newsriver.org/">NewsRiver</a>.  Well, it needs to be said that there are some strings attached to playing in this field:  That is, these are Dave Winer&#39;s potato chips I&#39;m enjoying.  </p>
<p>And, well, when you&#39;re taking chips from another another guy&#39;s lunchpail, it&#39;s customary to at least be nice to the guy and be gracious about the sharing.  Granted, when I&#39;m done, there could end up being <em>more</em> potato chips left in the bag than when I found it—that&#39;s the nature of this sort of sharing, after all.  But the bag, nonetheless, was brought to the table by Dave.  </p>
<p>Although I&#39;ve tried to bow out of it over the past few years, I have historically been found amongst the crowd who&#39;ve been known to take pokes at Dave when it affords a run of chuckles or guffaws.  Sometimes, this has been in the pursuit of making a technical point or two in dramatic fashion—but often this has just been done toward the goals of playground-level politics and tit-for-tat.    </p>
<p>Well, this crap doesn&#39;t suit me.  Or at least, I don&#39;t want to be suited for it.  You see, I really just care about being friendly, working on decent code—and besides, my <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/21/whats_your_winer_number">Winer Number</a> is right around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)">Mu</a>.</p>
<p>Although I&#39;ve been witness to many clashes of ego involving the man with others of strong ego, I&#39;ve never actually been the personal victim of any slight from Mr. Winer that I care to count or remember.  It&#39;s been fashionable to poke at him, but my goal is to keep my ego at a calm distance from most things in life and I&#39;ve not got any personal gripes with Dave Winer.</p>
<p>On the contrary, when I look at my career over the last few years, I see plain evidence that I&#39;ve benefitted well from the man&#39;s influence—even if indirectly from his work.  I&#39;ve successfully profited from implementations of XML-RPC and RSS.  I&#39;ve managed to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1">write my first book</a> thanks to things I first picked up from him.  And, I&#39;ve learned a lot in pursuing <a href="http://davenet.scripting.com/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe">fractional horsepower HTTP servers</a>.</p>
<p>Dave writes <a href="http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware">shitty software</a> and evangelizes shitty ideas.  And, since the turn of the century or so, I&#39;ve adopted and improvised upon many of them for fun and profit.  Thus, while I don&#39;t want to be on any &quot;side&quot; or in any &quot;camp&quot; or  be a mindless fan or follower of anyone or anything—I do feel a need to at least be <em>nice</em> to Dave Winer while I&#39;m sharing his potato chips.</p>
<p>So, Dave?  I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve pissed in the bag of chips a few times.  Maybe we can just call those salt and vinegar and let someone else eat &#39;em.  In the meantime, I might make a run to the party store for some dip or something.</p>
