My experience has been pretty good.</p>\n\n<p>The following is from a note I sent to the canvas-developers Yahoo group.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve implemented a first version of a draggable, zoomable map, using a\ncanvas and drawImage. The basic idea is to use a relatively\nhigh-resolution map which the canvas 2d drawImage method can zoom and\npan as needed.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a simple example, showing a button-driven interface to the zoom\npan (x-axis movement) tilt (y-axis movement) methods:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.entish.org/mapviewer/example.html\" title=\"First example\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.entish.org/mapviewer/example.html</a></p>\n\n<p>The second example is more what I want to be able to do, but I&#39;ve run\ninto a couple of problems. One is that it seems relatively difficult\nto reliably resize canvas elements. Another is that Safari seems to\nrequire a &#39;click&#39; to refresh the screen after a resize. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.entish.org/mapviewer/tube.html\" title=\"Second example\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.entish.org/mapviewer/tube.html</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve also had &#39;artifact&#39; problems from time to time under Safari when dragging text elements with borders on top of a canvas, but this isn&#39;t easy to recreate.</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
