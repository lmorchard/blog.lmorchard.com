I <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/12/back-to-newsriver-and-hacking-lists-of-reading-lists\">was using newsRiver</a> again, but the temporary lack of a spare server to run it on in the midst of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/07/25/youngmangonewest\">the move</a> had me feedless.  So, after a brief flirtation with <a href=\"http://bloglines.com/\">Bloglines</a> - which went down promptly after I started using it - I switched using <a href=\"http://gregarius.net/\">Gregarius</a>.  I have to say:  This is a pretty keen aggregator.  It doesn&#39;t support <a href=\"http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2005/10/reading_lists_f.html\">reading lists</a>, but I have an itch to implement that support.  Otherwise, the feed folders work pretty much how I&#39;d like them to work - as a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/01/new-feed-reader-ideas-for-the-new-year\">prioritized and stratified River of News</a>. I might also think about hacking <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/10/miniagg/news-20051005-152956.html\">my evolving feed reader template</a> as a drop-in theme for <a href=\"http://gregarius.net/\">Gregarius</a>.</p>\n"}
