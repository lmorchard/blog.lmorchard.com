Reminds me a bit of old software protection schemes from ye olde days, though.  Kind of like those ancient games that wanted to see &quot;first sentence of second paragraph on page 39 of Flibbers of Froznats,&quot;  a novel that came with the game materials that I had lost immediately.  Kent&#39;s prototype goes and conveniently finds the book, though!</p>\n<p>Hey - that gives me an idea.  From now on - or at least as soon as I get a chance to implement it - I&#39;ll require all people trying to comment on my site to enter a phrase from a random page from one of my books.  That&#39;ll be fun.  :)  And, of course, everyone around here already have copies of my books!</p>\n<p>(No, this is not a statement of derision against <a href=\"http://kentbrewster.com/rss-captcha-prototype\">Kent Brewster&#39;s prototype</a>.  This is me suddenly thinking of an annoying thing to do, which I&#39;ll never get around to doing.)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086336\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://beesbuzz.biz/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/plaidfluff.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://beesbuzz.biz/\">fluffy</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086336\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-25T21:36:35\">2006-08-25T21:36:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>No captcha mechanism will ever guard against human spammers.  Ever since I put some simple anti-spambot meausres on my forum, 100% of the spam has been posted by people who are actually manually registering, copy-pasting a big chunk of links over, and clicking &#39;submit&#39; (or at least they&#39;re close enough to humans that I can&#39;t tell the difference just by looking at the logs).</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221086337&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://kentbrewster.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2439fcc9b49533342befb7391ef74823&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://kentbrewster.com&quot;&gt;Kent Brewster&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221086337&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2006-08-29T04:51:48&quot;&gt;2006-08-29T04:51:48&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve made it &lt;a href=&quot;http://kentbrewster.com/rss-captcha-prototype&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a tad less annoying&lt;/a&gt;, you guys.
