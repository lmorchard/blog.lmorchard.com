But, having just read <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,71642-0.html?tw=wn_index_3\">Bruce Schneier&#39;s column</a> and having seen some of the comments, I have to post part of a reply I made:</p>\n<p>If we can&#39;t walk it off, toughen up, and laugh and live in the face of these pathetic attempts to disrupt our way of life - then we&#39;ve got no business living this life.  Each of us, each individual one of us, needs to spit in the eyes of these threats and carry on.  No terrorist would blow himself up in a market only to have us laugh and tell him &quot;better luck next time&quot; as we parody the grisly event on YouTube.</p>\n<p>This sentiment is 5 years late, but I see it starting to bubble up more and more.  I was scared shitless on 9/11, but that went away a long time ago.  I hope that this year&#39;s &quot;anniversary of the events of 9/11&quot; is met with a long belated upswelling of definance, a tide turned against the pathetic manipulations of politicians to keep us cowering and tractable - and I hope to see some eyes opening to wake up to a world that&#39;s never going to empty of threats.  There will never be an end to a War on Terror - but it&#39;s the wrong war to fight to begin with!  If we can&#39;t face the world with determination and personal strength - maintaining the integrity of our principles and freedoms, finding real and intelligent solutions to problems in our own lives and throughout the world - we deserve to be destroyed.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082385\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.emacswiki.org/alex/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e33b88db6bc04e1c93db25c702baea28&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.emacswiki.org/alex/\">Alex Schröder</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082385\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-24T18:47:54\">2006-08-24T18:47:54</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I understand the sentiment, but at the end you are exagerating: There's no death penalty for stupidity, cowardice, ignorance, or weakness.
