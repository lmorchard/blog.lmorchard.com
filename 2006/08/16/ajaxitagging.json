Until now, I haven’t been doing anything with those tags apart from exposing them in category elements in my RSS feed. Now that I’ve got a good head of steam going with my tags, I’ve decided to play around with them a bit.</blockquote><div class=\"quotesource\">Source: <a href=\"http://adactio.com/journal/1162\">Adactio: Journal - Ajaxitagging</a></div></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470037857/0xdecafbad01-20/104-2713105-4524705?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;link%5Fcode=xm2\">Book</a> pimping time:  In <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470037857/0xdecafbad01-20/104-2713105-4524705?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;link%5Fcode=xm2\">Hacking del.icio.us</a>, I&#39;ve got something not entirely unlike the above-linked hack.

And, instead of AJAX, my hack uses <a href=\"http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/\">JSONP</a>.
