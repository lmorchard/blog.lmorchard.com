As soon as you can exchange game property for real money, a whole different set of motives comes into play.  Imagine criminals using MMO enterprises to launder money, or to run 419 scams.  Then real-life law enforcement is going to take an interest in what's happening in-game.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085388\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ffe238ed68da35e8037df461552234&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085388\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-01T14:03:28\">2006-09-01T14:03:28</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>You couldn't really enforce something like that in empire space.

Highly recommended, but be aware that often this game is as much work as play.  Definitely not for everyone.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085384\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085384\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-30T21:13:59\">2006-08-30T21:13:59</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>These two things seem at odds to me:</p>\n\n<p>\"Any game that makes it possible in any way to transfer anything between avatars makes ingame enforcement by anyone other than GMs impossible.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"You can lose 6 months of work in 30 seconds with no recourse if you don’t take precautions.

As soon as you can exchange game property for real money, a whole different set of motives comes into play.  Imagine criminals using MMO enterprises to launder money, or to run 419 scams.  Then real-life law enforcement is going to take an interest in what's happening in-game.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085388\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ffe238ed68da35e8037df461552234&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085388\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-01T14:03:28\">2006-09-01T14:03:28</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>You couldn't really enforce something like that in empire space.  An act of vilonce against a player (or peaceful NPC) in a policed area to bring down the hellfires of CONCORD (the in-game actual cops.)</p>\n\n<p>Out in low-sec space you could do it just fine, as it's \"wild territory\" and there's no police force (and no repercussions to popping someone who just \"needed killin\").  But someone could always retreat to safe space, which is in large supply.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, such a coalition would be in direct competition with the player-run corporations that have laid claim to those otherwise lawless star systems.</p>\n\n<p>It could not operate in \"high-sec\" where concord is waiting to put the smackdown on anyone who \"shoots first\" at another player.  It would be really tough to do I think. </p>\n\n<p>There may be other ways to get at someone besides popping their ships all the time and podkilling them (long story.)  But with 20k+ concurrent players at all times, it'd be really tough to organize.</p>\n\n<p>Still...
