  "html": "<p><strong>Update</strong> (7/26): <em>We ended up taking a place in Santa Clara, CA, a minute or two away from Santana Row.  We may be looking again in a year, once we&#39;ve gotten a sense for the lay of the land.  Thanks for all the wonderful advice, everyone!</em></p>\n<p>So, as <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/24/go-west-young-man\">I revealed in the previous post</a>, we&#39;re moving to California so I can take a job at Yahoo! in Santa Clara.  I&#39;m excited as hell, but I&#39;m also pulling all my hair out and losing sleep.  Luckily, I have a lot of hair and I drink a lot of coffee, but we have a lot of details to work out.  I&#39;m hoping that I might get some advice from you out there, dear readers.  Also, I think I&#39;d like to get the chance to <em>meet</em> you at some point.</p>\n<p>We&#39;re getting relocation assistance, which will help greatly.  However, it looks like we&#39;ll need to do some rush apartment shopping ourselves, and in short order.  We&#39;ve never done anything like this before, and don&#39;t want to end up in a crap place that looked good on the interweb, only to move again in 6 months.</p>\n<p>We went on honeymoon to San Francisco, and briefly visited Mountain View in the course of our travels.  We liked the downtown area, had good sushi and bubble tea.  So at the moment, Mountain View is our dart-in-the-map choice for apartment search.  Office is in Santa Clara, so the maps tell me that Sunnyvale and Santa Clara might be good spots too.</p>\n<p>Any ideas out there?  Horror stories of places to avoid?  Hints as to what&#39;s good and where?</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090237\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=15cf42a96576559fee2a0f904427b8a0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Joe</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090237\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-24T21:08:52\">2006-06-24T21:08:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Everybody who relocates here seems to land in Mountain View/Sunnyvale/Santa Clara first, since that's where all the companies are located.

I'd advise against living and working in the same town -- you get mighty sick of having lunch <em>and</em> dinner in the same place!</p>\n<p>I work in MV, and I couldn't imagine looking for a place to live there compared to the others, though. Sunnyvale is nice, and has awesome events in the streets most weeks in the summer. PA has a few too many students, and is a little pretentious, but it's also very pretty. They're all on Caltrain, of course.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090240\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f47aa861fb4680c668fcf8e0a1db90a1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Eric L</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090240\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-24T23:29:07\">2006-06-24T23:29:07</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>IMHO don't get your hopes up for Santa Clara and Sunnyvale, they're bedroom communities and are dreadfully dull. If you enjoy eating out and spending time outside be prepared to spent most of your time elsewhere.</p>\n<p>After living here for a few years, there are only two towns on the Peninsula where I would even consider living. Mountain View and Palo Alto. Both towns have nice a downtown area, pleasant weather, are close enough to the city for those times when you really need a city rather than town, and the commute to work is very acceptable from either.</p>\n<p>How do the two stack up against each other? One plus for Palo alto, I slightly prefer University Ave. to Castro. One very big minus for Palo Alto, and the reason I chose Mountain View - is the housing situation. Reasonably priced housing in Palo Alto is meant for Stanford students living off campus and are genuine hell holes, the nicer housing starts at ~$2k/mo for a smallish 1BD, last I looked.</p>\n<p>My .02.

Palo Alto is terribly expensive and is a bit full of itself. Mountain View is ideally located between jobs in San Jose/Santa Clara/Sunnyvale and fun/culture in San Francisco. Rick and I lived in both Mountain View and Palo Alto. I preferred Palo Alto because it had more personality and, I'll admit it, I liked the cachet. When we lived there, Menlo Park, Saratoga, Los Altos, and Los Gatos attracted more older people... and I'm older than you so I don't know if those would be a great fit. Could have changed in the six years since I moved away though. </p>\n<p>Congratulations on your new job. How exciting!

Once I started a job in Palo Alto, though, I bit the bullet and accepted a serious increase in rent in order to move there -- the 10 hours or so a week spent on the train was just too much on top of 45-50 hours at the office.</p>\n<p>Back in '00-01, when I was apartment hunting, studios and 1BD apartments were running in the $1200-1500 range, if you weren't too picky about the part of town and color of the carpet and counters. From what I've heard, housing prices have been steady or on the decline since then.</p>\n<p>Personally, I never found much to do outside of eating and hiking/biking in Palo Alto proper, though -- there are a handful of movie theaters, bars, etc., but Stanford is insular enough as a community that there didn't seem to be much nightlife.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090246\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://meandeu.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=74685c9f342f159611317a68c2655218&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://meandeu.com\">Mike Macgirvin</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090246\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-26T16:05:35\">2006-06-26T16:05:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I used to run a music store on Castro Street, so could tell you a lot about Mountain View, but that's not the point here. Basically you're looking at a price pyramid going north with Palo Alto at the top and San Jose at the bottom (there are lots of exceptions but this is the high level overview). Palo Alto is the home of the million dollar 2-br bungalow. Mountain View is right on the edge with million dollar Eichlers. You'll get the most house for the money in Sunnyvale (where I live), and somewhat cheaper, but often smaller houses in Santa Clara. I'd live in Mountain View without hesitation, but I wouldn't buy a house there.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090247\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c19b0cb36d7f40d163e81b1be8da7622&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/\">Jeremy Zawodny</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090247\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-27T04:17:19\">2006-06-27T04:17:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Holy crap!</p>\n<p>I miseed the announcement.

Although Cupertino was a nice enough place to work, there are <em>ABSOLUTELY</em> no cultural amenities in Cupertino. No movie theaters, no bookstores, nothing but chain stores. The rental apartments and houses are fine, but you'll have to drive quite a way to get somewhere interesting. </p>\n<p>My advice - check out the northern end of the Valley. San Mateo, Palo Alto, Mountain View -- all of these have something that passes for a liveable environment outside working hours. If you can stand a longer commute and your salary permits, consider living in San Francisco and commuting down to Santa Clara via CalTrain.</p>\n<p>Congratulations on your wedding and your new job!</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090266\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://holygoat.co.uk\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b9bd2635d5d04e0bf9c81b9467996cf5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://holygoat.co.uk\">Rich</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090266\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-07-06T04:51:06\">2006-07-06T04:51:06</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Mike: I do believe I bought a guitar from you last year!

  "body": "<strong>Update</strong> (7/26): <em>We ended up taking a place in Santa Clara, CA, a minute or two away from Santana Row.  We may be looking again in a year, once we've gotten a sense for the lay of the land.  Thanks for all the wonderful advice, everyone!</em>\r\n\r\nSo, as <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/24/go-west-young-man\">I revealed in the previous post</a>, we're moving to California so I can take a job at Yahoo! in Santa Clara.  I'm excited as hell, but I'm also pulling all my hair out and losing sleep.  Luckily, I have a lot of hair and I drink a lot of coffee, but we have a lot of details to work out.  I'm hoping that I might get some advice from you out there, dear readers.  Also, I think I'd like to get the chance to <em>meet</em> you at some point.\r\n\r\nWe're getting relocation assistance, which will help greatly.  However, it looks like we'll need to do some rush apartment shopping ourselves, and in short order.  We've never done anything like this before, and don't want to end up in a crap place that looked good on the interweb, only to move again in 6 months.\r\n\r\nWe went on honeymoon to San Francisco, and briefly visited Mountain View in the course of our travels.  We liked the downtown area, had good sushi and bubble tea.  So at the moment, Mountain View is our dart-in-the-map choice for apartment search.  Office is in Santa Clara, so the maps tell me that Sunnyvale and Santa Clara might be good spots too.\r\n\r\nAny ideas out there?  Horror stories of places to avoid?  Hints as to what's good and where?\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090237\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=15cf42a96576559fee2a0f904427b8a0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Joe</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090237\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-24T21:08:52\">2006-06-24T21:08:52</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Everybody who relocates here seems to land in Mountain View/Sunnyvale/Santa Clara first, since that's where all the companies are located.

Mountain View and Palo Alto. Both towns have nice a downtown area, pleasant weather, are close enough to the city for those times when you really need a city rather than town, and the commute to work is very acceptable from either.</p>\n\n<p>How do the two stack up against each other? One plus for Palo alto, I slightly prefer University Ave. to Castro. One very big minus for Palo Alto, and the reason I chose Mountain View - is the housing situation. Reasonably priced housing in Palo Alto is meant for Stanford students living off campus and are genuine hell holes, the nicer housing starts at ~$2k/mo for a smallish 1BD, last I looked.</p>\n\n<p>My .02.

Palo Alto is terribly expensive and is a bit full of itself. Mountain View is ideally located between jobs in San Jose/Santa Clara/Sunnyvale and fun/culture in San Francisco. Rick and I lived in both Mountain View and Palo Alto. I preferred Palo Alto because it had more personality and, I'll admit it, I liked the cachet. When we lived there, Menlo Park, Saratoga, Los Altos, and Los Gatos attracted more older people... and I'm older than you so I don't know if those would be a great fit.

From what I've heard, housing prices have been steady or on the decline since then.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I never found much to do outside of eating and hiking/biking in Palo Alto proper, though -- there are a handful of movie theaters, bars, etc., but Stanford is insular enough as a community that there didn't seem to be much nightlife.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090246\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://meandeu.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=74685c9f342f159611317a68c2655218&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://meandeu.com\">Mike Macgirvin</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090246\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-26T16:05:35\">2006-06-26T16:05:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I used to run a music store on Castro Street, so could tell you a lot about Mountain View, but that's not the point here. Basically you're looking at a price pyramid going north with Palo Alto at the top and San Jose at the bottom (there are lots of exceptions but this is the high level overview). Palo Alto is the home of the million dollar 2-br bungalow. Mountain View is right on the edge with million dollar Eichlers. You'll get the most house for the money in Sunnyvale (where I live), and somewhat cheaper, but often smaller houses in Santa Clara. I'd live in Mountain View without hesitation, but I wouldn't buy a house there.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090247\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c19b0cb36d7f40d163e81b1be8da7622&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/\">Jeremy Zawodny</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090247\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-27T04:17:19\">2006-06-27T04:17:19</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Holy crap!</p>\n\n<p>I miseed the announcement.

(Unless you're used to 8 miles taking 30 minutes.)</p>\n\n<p>You might try checking out South San Jose (Campbell) - it's a pretty straight shot to the Yahoo! campus by Moffet Field or the one on Great America Pkwy. Not as close as Mountain View, but not nearly as expensive.</p>\n\n<p>I'd avoid East San Jose as the commute will be miserable, despite the proximity - most of the roads from East SJ to the Yahoo! campuses are feeders for highways 680 and 880, which are the main arteries for probably half of the folks who work in San Jose (and can't afford to live there).</p>\n\n<p>http://www.housingmaps.com/ is an EXCELLENT tool for remote apartment hunting. Someone's feeding the residential listings from Craigslist into Google Maps, so you can enter your search parameters and filtered results are overlaid on the Google Map with links to the Craigslist listing. Craigslist is far and away the best tool for apartment hunting here besides just plain driving around looking for signs.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090263\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://yushans.com/dailies\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d446844d12dd7c9ef6758b11efcb2728&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://yushans.com/dailies\">Yu Shan</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090263\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-07-01T22:28:03\">2006-07-01T22:28:03</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>As a Yahoo! formerly from SNV office I recommend downtown Sunnyvale area around Mathilda and El Camino.

Even now it's a pretty cute area with summer concerts and a Saturday morning farmer's market. Walking distance to many things such as Trader Joe's, Best Buy, Sportsmart, and Baja Fresh.

Although Cupertino was a nice enough place to work, there are <em>ABSOLUTELY</em> no cultural amenities in Cupertino. No movie theaters, no bookstores, nothing but chain stores. The rental apartments and houses are fine, but you'll have to drive quite a way to get somewhere interesting. </p>\n\n<p>My advice - check out the northern end of the Valley. San Mateo, Palo Alto, Mountain View -- all of these have something that passes for a liveable environment outside working hours. If you can stand a longer commute and your salary permits, consider living in San Francisco and commuting down to Santa Clara via CalTrain.</p>\n\n<p>Congratulations on your wedding and your new job!</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090266\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://holygoat.co.uk\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b9bd2635d5d04e0bf9c81b9467996cf5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://holygoat.co.uk\">Rich</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090266\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-07-06T04:51:06\">2006-07-06T04:51:06</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Mike: I do believe I bought a guitar from you last year!
