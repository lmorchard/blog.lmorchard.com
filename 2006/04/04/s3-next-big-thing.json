I&#39;ve started building <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/S3Ajax\">S3Ajax, an AJAX-based wrapper for Amazon&#39;s S3</a>.  Between S3, the OPML Community Server API, and what will hopefully come out of the Atom Publishing Protocol - I think web-based filesystem APIs have the potential to be a Next Big Thing.</p>\n <p>Imagine if Amazon S3 offered filtered RSS feeds of new files uploaded to a bucket.  And, imagine if that RSS feed listed those new files as BitTorrent enclosures, with a few item elements fed from metadata headers (ie. title, description, etc).  Instant podcasting.</p>\n <p>Also, imagine if Amazon connected an XSLT processor to S3 like they do with product searches.  You could turn a bucket listing into an RSS feed with an XSLT uploaded to S3 itself.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086963\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f3794e603ef53b0513ab45b6565ee457&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Jeremy Dunck</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086963\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-04T22:31:05\">2006-04-04T22:31:05</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Les,\n  Please make clear the license and known issues with S3Ajax.

I&#39;d like it if my name were mentioned somewhere in relation to it, but I won&#39;t raise a fuss if it isn&#39;t.  If you can find a use for it, you&#39;re welcome to have at it!</p>\n\n<p>At some point in the future, I may attach something like an MIT or BSD license to it.  The SHA1 implementation I&#39;m using is under MIT, which is the lynchpin of the authentication bits.</p>\n\n<p><p>As for known issues, it&#39;s had about 4 hours&#39; exploration and testing so far and seems to work fairly well.  It&#39;s had no stress testing, but I&#39;ve been able to authenticate, upload/download content, and set metadata attributes through headers.  However, it could certainly use some test cases.</p></div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
