  "html": "<p>So, I've put some more work into <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/s3wiki/wiki/StartPage\">my S3 AJAX wiki</a>, first mentioned <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/04/21/an-s3-ajax-wiki\">Friday night</a>.  After some Virtual PC sessions, editing seems to be working on Firefox and MSIE on Win.  Safari and any other browsers not amenable to PUT and DELETE in XmlHTTPRequests will not find joy in editing - but the wiki should at least still be navigable and readable since it's plain HTML on the server.</p>\n <p>This thing has certainly not reached any level of stability, but I thought it might be interesting to collect some random thoughts on what good stuff is lurking in there.  So:</p>\n     <ul>\n     <li>\n     <span>One of the mind-bending concepts behind this whole thing for me is that both the documents and the authoring application are all resident on the S3 servers, loaded and run on the fly in a browser.  The magic S3 lends is simple file I/O, taken for granted by applications in nearly every other development environment.  Otherwise, JavaScript in a browser is a very capable system.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>Of course, since my demo wiki is sitting in an S3 bucket with a public-write ACL, everything's open to vandalism and subversion (of the bad variety)- documents and application both.  S3Ajax does allow authentication through your S3 credentials, though, so a private group with restrictive S3 ACLs could use this wiki successfully.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>All content managed by the wiki code ends up as HTML on the server.  Maybe some day this will grow up to be proper XHTML.  Using plain old HTML, rather than <a href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/SmartAscii\">smart ASCII</a>, seems like an important step to me.  HTML is a neutral standard, whereas various wiki formats are far from agreed upon or standardized.  Luckily,  <a href=\"http://goessner.net/\">Stefan Gössner's</a> <a href=\"http://goessner.net/articles/wiky/\">Wiky</a> does roundtrip conversion between wiki-text and HTML.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>Sticking with HTML as the end format also allows me to eventually go beyond wiki text, and on to <a href=\"http://microformats.org/\">microformats</a> like <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/08/greasemonkey-magic\">hCalendar</a> and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/03/25/about-xoxooutliner\">XOXO</a>.  I could even see interchangably using something like <a href=\"http://dojotoolkit.org/docs/rich_text.html\">DOJO's Rich Text Editor</a> as another editing alternative alongside <a href=\"http://goessner.net/articles/wiky/\">Wiky</a>.  Basically, anything that eats and emits HTML can fit into this wiki.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>One more thought on HTML and the DOM - if you can use HTML as your document format, the browser DOM makes a pretty nice structure and API for the authoring, manipulation, and management of document content.  In this wiki, innerHTML is the main point of document munging.  But, in XoxoOutliner, I do plenty of DOM node shuffling and tweaking.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>Speaking of innerHTML:  It's not evil, but it seems useful really only when treated as a write-only property.  It's next to useless for serializing the DOM as HTML source.  MSIE and Firefox both offer wildly different results.  So, I wrote <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/S3Ajax/js/wiki.js?rev=760#L413\"><code>fromDOMtoHTML</code> in wiki.js</a> to take matters into my own hands.  I know MochiKit offers <code>emitHTML</code>, but it doesn't quite do what I want - there are a few odd corner cases I've found myself handling, and I need to filter out all the elements I inject as editing chrome.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>I like the functional DOM construction kit offered by <a href=\"http://mochikit.com\">MochiKit</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vivabit.com/bollocks/2006/04/06/introducing-dom-builder\">DOM Builder</a> so much that I felt compelled to reinvent my own.  Check out <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/S3Ajax/js/common.js?rev=760#L118\"><code>createDOM</code> in common.js</a>.  I use it in the <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/S3Ajax/js/wiki.js?rev=760#L496\"><code>injectEditingFramework</code> function in wiki.js</a> to build and inject all the wiki editing chrome into the page on the fly.

It meshes remarkbly well with what you're looking for.</p>\n<p>The new API is fully read-write, based on REST and the Atom Publishing Protocol. Other advantages over S3:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each app has 1GB of public object space and 100MB of private space. Each user can own up to 10 apps for free. Just register, clone an app (or make one from scratch) and you're off.</li>\n<li>With S3 the objects you read and store are flat data - with Ning, they're structured objects...</li>\n<li>... and since they're structured, you can issue GET requests that are more like database queries than simple object fetches (<a href=\"http://restdemos.ning.com/feeds.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">some examples</a>)...</li>\n<li>... which return properly-formed Atom feeds, which you can then run through BadgerFish. (it's how our <a href=\"http://restdemos.ning.com/embedfeed.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">demo widgets</a> work)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>That's not to say that S3 doesn't have it's own advantages: it's much better for large (GBs), expandable storage, five-nines high availability and BitTorrent. But the uses to which I'm currently seeing it put - such as your work, and the Greasemonkey ideas - fit Ning very well indeed.</p></div>\n\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086097\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=56ee28134dd0776825445e3551979b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\"></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\">Bob Aman</a>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#comment-221086097\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-24T18:37:00\">2006-04-24T18:37:00</time></a></p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Are there any alternatives out there to innerHTML that are just as easy-to-use, but that actually make use of the standard DOM methods instead?

It meshes remarkbly well with what you're looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new API is fully read-write, based on REST and the Atom Publishing Protocol. Other advantages over S3:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Each app has 1GB of public object space and 100MB of private space. Each user can own up to 10 apps for free. Just register, clone an app (or make one from scratch) and you're off.</li>\r\n<li>With S3 the objects you read and store are flat data - with Ning, they're structured objects...</li>\r\n<li>... and since they're structured, you can issue GET requests that are more like database queries than simple object fetches (<a href=\"http://restdemos.ning.com/feeds.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">some examples</a>)...</li>\r\n<li>... which return properly-formed Atom feeds, which you can then run through BadgerFish. (it's how our <a href=\"http://restdemos.ning.com/embedfeed.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">demo widgets</a> work)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>That's not to say that S3 doesn't have it's own advantages: it's much better for large (GBs), expandable storage, five-nines high availability and BitTorrent. But the uses to which I'm currently seeing it put - such as your work, and the Greasemonkey ideas - fit Ning very well indeed.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086097\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=56ee28134dd0776825445e3551979b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\">Bob Aman</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086097\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-24T18:37:00\">2006-04-24T18:37:00</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Are there any alternatives out there to innerHTML that are just as easy-to-use, but that actually make use of the standard DOM methods instead?
