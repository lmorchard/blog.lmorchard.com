Make it a config file parameter or a control panel setting or whatever.  This API will be cloned.</p>\n <p>And an issue related to that:  Say you find that the base URL to an S3 clone is <a href=\"http://example.com/foo/myS3/service.php\">http://example.com/foo/myS3/service.php</a> - this path shouldn&#39;t be included in the resource path.  That is, accessing key &quot;/bar/baz&quot; in bucket &quot;/foo&quot; should not result in a resource path of /foo/myS3/service.php/foo/bar/baz.  Instead it should simply be /foo/bar/baz.  This is important for the authentication scheme when used in a clone.</p>\n"}
