 <p>Has anyone noticed that the subsequent products at <a href="http://ajaxlaunch.com">ajaxLaunch</a> have been even less about Ajax <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/03/26/when-is-ajax-not-ajax">than ajaxWrite was</a>?  I mean, <a href="http://www.michaelrobertson.com/ajaxos/">ajaxOS</a>?  Sounds like .mac with a XUL launcher.  The shame is that that's got potential to be cool, but not by co-opting the Ajax buzz.</p>
