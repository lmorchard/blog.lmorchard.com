  "html": " <p>I'm on my third 4G iPod 20GB, as of 10 minutes ago.  The second one, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/25/ipod-go-thud-then-click-click-click\">I got back in October when I dropped the first one on a marble floor</a>.  But, last night, it died when it took a header out of my pocket and bounced off the parking lot pavement.  Last time I used a mailer and sent it back to Apple for replacement - but this time, I just drove straight to the Apple store.  The Genius Bar denizen took one look at it, held it to his ear, and said \"I'll be right back.\"  A few minutes later, he returned from the back room and handed me my third iPod.  It's syncing podcasts now and reloading music from my home server.</p>\n <p>I've got to say: I don't think I'll ever get an Apple product sans-AppleCare.  I'm probably very tunnel-visioned at this point, but I can't imagine getting this sort of service from another gadget company.  Over the past few years I've gotten a few replacement hard drives, a new keyboard and assorted keys, and now two new iPods - all covered by AppleCare.  I'd say the cost has been covered.</p>\n",
