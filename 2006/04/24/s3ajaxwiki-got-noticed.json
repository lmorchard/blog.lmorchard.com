From my referrers, I caught a mention on <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/2006/04/23/we-interupt-your-regular-thinking/\">Shelley Powers&#39; Burningbird</a>, <a href=\"http://ajaxian.com/archives/s3-javascript-bindings\">Ajaxian</a>, and <a href=\"http://tech.memeorandum.com/060424/p7#a060424p7\">Memeorandum</a>.  I&#39;ve since caught a few more pointers here and there.</p>\n <p>As I poke my head in from time to time, I keep waiting for something to go nastily awry with this wide open public demo - but so far the worst has been <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/s3wiki/wiki/Booobs\">a pair of boobs</a>.  The best has been people with knee-jerk wiki-instincts kicking in, gardening and fixing pages for me.  And so far, the hosting has yet to cost me even a dime, and I don&#39;t really expect it to.  I&#39;m still just waiting for some script kiddie to some along and 0wn3 my demo, but I&#39;m hoping it doesn&#39;t happen because really there&#39;s not challenge in it and it&#39;ll really just be a minor annoyance for me to reboot the thing.</p>\n <p>It seems like it&#39;s mostly working, at least from the activity I&#39;m seeing.  Not too bad for a weekend&#39;s solo development sprint.</p>\n <p><b>Update:</b> I&#39;ve also been <a href=\"http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2006/04/monday_medley.html\">mentioned on the AWS blog</a>, <a href=\"http://digg.com/programming/Run_a_Wiki_Completely_from_Amazon_s_S3_Storage_Service\">Diggified</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/04/24/s3ajaxwiki-an-ajaxy-wiki-hosted-on-amazon-s3/\">called an &uuml;ber-hacker on Download Squad</a>. </p>\n"}
