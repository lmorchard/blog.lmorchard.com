I took <a href=\"http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/library-camp-20060414.opml\">lots of notes in OPML</a> (also <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/library-camp-2006/\">rendered in HTML</a>), tried to <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/tags/librarycamp/\">take lots of pictures</a>, and <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/tag/librarycamp\">posted lots of bookmarks</a>.  The event went by in a flash, and the unconference format seemed to go very well.  We went from a blank schedule to <a href=\"http://wiki.library2.net/index.php/FinalSchedule\">a full dance card</a> in about an hour, and there was plenty to do and discuss.</p>\n <p>I&#39;m a techie and an admirer of librarians - so, I went hoping I could contribute some info and knowledge with regard to things like RSS and social software and anything else I might have to offer.  I&#39;ve been following the sorts of things <a href=\"http://superpatron.com/\">Edward Vielmetti</a> and <a href=\"http://www.blyberg.net\">John Blyberg</a> - so this seemed like a good venue to go meet &amp; greet &amp; catch up with things.  I hope I was able to contribute something useful.</p>\n <p>I feel like I probably mentioned my books too many times.  Although I am overjoyed about being able to self-identify as an Author of Books, I wasn&#39;t trying to brag or sell any copies.  It was more like I was intimidated by all the librarians doing and discussing cool stuff.  I had a bit of social-phobia triggered and I think I was trying to justify why I was there - especially since I hadn&#39;t really known what an OPAC or an ILS was for, until a few weeks ago.  <img src=\"http://static.userland.com/shortcuts/images/qbullets/sidesmiley.gif\">  But, I figure if anyone&#39;s really annoyed with me, they can let me know.</p>\n <p>I&#39;m trying to decide if I have the time to better edit / present my notes.  They&#39;re in pretty raw form right now, but they might be useful to someone.  I think I missed some significant things here or there in amidst my posting and editing.  I hope to get in touch with people I met there to see what they&#39;re up to - I just hope I remember names with faces!  A few new Flickr and del.icio.us contacts help with that, though.</p>\n <p>At any rate, if anyone who met me at LibraryCamp wants to get a hold of me or has any questions or needs any help - I&#39;m at your disposal!</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082484\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fa15e41d4cf102273b0e8f209c52c288&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\">Dorothea</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082484\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-18T10:31:25\">2006-04-18T10:31:25</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Librarians aren&#39;t scary.

Part of the purpose of the event was to bring together people from both sides of the table (librarians and non-librarians), and I think the fact that you brought some real world web 2.0 experience to the sessions was a wonderful and refreshing perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre><p><p>By the way, if you ever do get involved in your local library I&#39;d like to hear about your experiences.  I also wanted to say that it was fun for the rest of us to say that we hung out with an &quot;author of books&quot;.  Thanks for your contributions!</p></div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221082487&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.dystmesis.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=dd7db614e740ebe276292b0bf32fb07e&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.dystmesis.com&quot;&gt;Jonathan&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221082487&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2006-04-26T17:09:56&quot;&gt;2006-04-26T17:09:56&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never felt like you were shilling books. :) Nice meeting you, and your notes are handy, because mine turned out to be sketchier than I thought...but I&#39;ll get around to posting about Library Camp Real Soon Now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
