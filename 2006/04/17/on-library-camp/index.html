        <section class="post-content">
           <p>For anyone who didn't catch my <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2006/04/14#When:9:17:59AM">brief bits of blogging last Friday</a>, I went to <a href="http://wiki.library2.net/index.php/Main_Page">LibraryCamp</a> in Ann Arbor, MI.  I took <a href="http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/library-camp-20060414.opml">lots of notes in OPML</a> (also <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/library-camp-2006/">rendered in HTML</a>), tried to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/librarycamp/">take lots of pictures</a>, and <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/librarycamp">posted lots of bookmarks</a>.  The event went by in a flash, and the unconference format seemed to go very well.  We went from a blank schedule to <a href="http://wiki.library2.net/index.php/FinalSchedule">a full dance card</a> in about an hour, and there was plenty to do and discuss.</p>
 <p>I'm a techie and an admirer of librarians - so, I went hoping I could contribute some info and knowledge with regard to things like RSS and social software and anything else I might have to offer.  I've been following the sorts of things <a href="http://superpatron.com/">Edward Vielmetti</a> and <a href="http://www.blyberg.net">John Blyberg</a> - so this seemed like a good venue to go meet & greet & catch up with things.  I hope I was able to contribute something useful.</p>
 <p>I feel like I probably mentioned my books too many times.  Although I am overjoyed about being able to self-identify as an Author of Books, I wasn't trying to brag or sell any copies.  It was more like I was intimidated by all the librarians doing and discussing cool stuff.  I had a bit of social-phobia triggered and I think I was trying to justify why I was there - especially since I hadn't really known what an OPAC or an ILS was for, until a few weeks ago.  <img src="http://static.userland.com/shortcuts/images/qbullets/sidesmiley.gif">  But, I figure if anyone's really annoyed with me, they can let me know.</p>
 <p>I'm trying to decide if I have the time to better edit / present my notes.  They're in pretty raw form right now, but they might be useful to someone.  I think I missed some significant things here or there in amidst my posting and editing.  I hope to get in touch with people I met there to see what they're up to - I just hope I remember names with faces!  A few new Flickr and del.icio.us contacts help with that, though.</p>
 <p>At any rate, if anyone who met me at LibraryCamp wants to get a hold of me or has any questions or needs any help - I'm at your disposal!</p>

<div class="content"><p>Librarians aren't scary. People just don't know what we do all day, and are startled to find that it's more complicated than they thought. :)</p>
<p>I'm glad you went to LibraryCamp, and I hope you'll consider hanging out on #code4lib every once in a while.</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>I for one am happy you were at library camp!  Part of the purpose of the event was to bring together people from both sides of the table (librarians and non-librarians), and I think the fact that you brought some real world web 2.0 experience to the sessions was a wonderful and refreshing perspective.</p>
<p>By the way, if you ever do get involved in your local library I'd like to hear about your experiences.  I also wanted to say that it was fun for the rest of us to say that we hung out with an "author of books".  Thanks for your contributions!</p></div>
