I took <a href=\"http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/library-camp-20060414.opml\">lots of notes in OPML</a> (also <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/library-camp-2006/\">rendered in HTML</a>), tried to <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/tags/librarycamp/\">take lots of pictures</a>, and <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/tag/librarycamp\">posted lots of bookmarks</a>.  The event went by in a flash, and the unconference format seemed to go very well.  We went from a blank schedule to <a href=\"http://wiki.library2.net/index.php/FinalSchedule\">a full dance card</a> in about an hour, and there was plenty to do and discuss.</p>\n <p>I'm a techie and an admirer of librarians - so, I went hoping I could contribute some info and knowledge with regard to things like RSS and social software and anything else I might have to offer.  I've been following the sorts of things <a href=\"http://superpatron.com/\">Edward Vielmetti</a> and <a href=\"http://www.blyberg.net\">John Blyberg</a> - so this seemed like a good venue to go meet &amp; greet &amp; catch up with things.  I hope I was able to contribute something useful.</p>\n <p>I feel like I probably mentioned my books too many times.  Although I am overjoyed about being able to self-identify as an Author of Books, I wasn't trying to brag or sell any copies.  It was more like I was intimidated by all the librarians doing and discussing cool stuff.  I had a bit of social-phobia triggered and I think I was trying to justify why I was there - especially since I hadn't really known what an OPAC or an ILS was for, until a few weeks ago.  <img src=\"http://static.userland.com/shortcuts/images/qbullets/sidesmiley.gif\" width=\"\" height=\"\">  But, I figure if anyone's really annoyed with me, they can let me know.</p>\n <p>I'm trying to decide if I have the time to better edit / present my notes.  They're in pretty raw form right now, but they might be useful to someone.  I think I missed some significant things here or there in amidst my posting and editing.  I hope to get in touch with people I met there to see what they're up to - I just hope I remember names with faces!  A few new Flickr and del.icio.us contacts help with that, though.</p>\n <p>At any rate, if anyone who met me at LibraryCamp wants to get a hold of me or has any questions or needs any help - I'm at your disposal!</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082484\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fa15e41d4cf102273b0e8f209c52c288&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\"></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\">Dorothea</a>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#comment-221082484\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-18T10:31:25\">2006-04-18T10:31:25</time></a></p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Librarians aren't scary.
