    "html": "<p>Holy crap, is my favorite keyboard filthy.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that I&#39;ve finally gotten it into some good direct lighting or what, but this thing is a blatant mess.  It&#39;s <i>almost</i> embarassing.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve been using the same <a href=\"http://pfuca-store.stores.yahoo.net/haphackeylit1.html\">Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite 2, PS/2 style</a>, for about 8 years now.  I&#39;ve taken it with me to every desk at every job since 1998 or so, along with some variety or another of trackballs.  (I&#39;m using a <a href=\"http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2150,CONTENTID=5003\">Logitech Marble Mouse</a> these days, pining for my classic Centipede-style 4-button Kensington Expert Mouse - and not <a href=\"http://us.kensington.com/html/2200.html\">this monstrosity</a> with its botched scroll ring.)</p>\n<p>The keyboard has sprouted a USB adapter along the way, which barely seems to work on OS X machines after a few attempts at plugging and replugging.  I&#39;ve gotten to like this keyboard so much that I just can&#39;t work for long on anything else.  </p>\n<p>In fact, when I spend too long with a fat keyboard and standard mouse, my wrists start complaining within the hour.  I suspect it has something to do with the fact that, with the HHKB, my hands remain mostly out in front of me with occasional flicks over to the trackball - as opposed to hovering always slightly over to the left, with wandering twists <i>way over</i> to the right.</p>\n<p>So anyway...  Just how the hell do you clean a keyboard?  Do I really have to meticulously pry off every keycap, spend an evening stripping it and cleaning it on the dining room table like a pistol?  Can I run it through the dishwasher?  Should I just give up and order a new USB version?  Or, is the filth good for me - is it actually fortifying my immune system with 8-year-old bugs?</p>\n<p><b>Update (8/1):</b> For the benefit of someone who may someday land on this entry after searching, like me, for &quot;happy hacking keyboard dishwasher&quot; - know that my keyboard did indeed survive a trip through a wash and rinse cycle.</p>\n<p><b>However!</b> I didn&#39;t put the whole thing into the machine.  I first had the presence of mind to try taking it apart.  Turns out that the top half of the keyboard - to which all the grunge was confined - was entirely plastic.  All the electronics - pristine and new-smelling after all these years - resided in the bottom half of the shell.  They stayed dry.</p>\n<p>I did end up popping out all the keys after all, though.  This was because not all the grunge got removed in the dishwasher, and because the keys were incredibly quick and easy to pop out from the underside with a fingernail press - as opposed to prying out from above with a screwdriver as I&#39;d previously tried.  </p>\n<p>I scrubbed clean the keyless top half, soaked the keys themselves for a little while, then dried everything overnight - and this morning, everything&#39;s good as new after reassembly!</p>\n<p>Now, having seen this thing disassembled, I should note that this favorite keyboard of mine seems to be really well built.  The top half of the keyboard shell is a solid piece, and each key is slotted into a well that has an up-turned lip.  No crumbs, hair, grunge, or spillage of any kind had ever made its way down into the interior of the keyboard in all these years of being a desk-lunch eating slob of a human.  I&#39;m not sure how many keyboards are built this way, but this one&#39;s great!</p>\n<p>If only I could clean my PowerBook keyboard so easily.  Now, <em>that&#39;s</em> a nasty piece of work, right there.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087797\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b6292d5084c21760f6984f2df869f4e6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Andrew Heaton</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087797\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-07-31T17:42:35\">2006-07-31T17:42:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Best way I've found is to unplug the keyboard (unless you love the sound of the error ding) get some non-abrasive solvent cleaner (mr. clean works) in a small bucket with warm water.</p>\n<p>Get a cloth (not a sponge) and wring it well, you don't want the water collecting between the keys.</p>\n<p>Rub each key individually.

    "html": "<p>The day before we left Michigan, my best friend and Best Man presented me with a copy of World of Warcraft.  He and his girlfriend have been playing the game for quite some time now, and it's how they keep in touch with a few family members - and now, it looks like it'll be a way that they can keep in touch with me.  I can only hope that I don't get <em>too </em>sucked into the game.  :)</p>\n<p>All of that aside, though, I just noticed something as I was making an initial pass at registering for a WoW account:  At the moment, <a href=\"http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml\">the World of Warcraft front page</a> is broken.</p>\n<p>It'll probably be fixed by the time you see it, but since my first impulse upon seeing an error is to \"View Source\", I noticed something further:  Their front page is XML, with an XSL processing instruction at the top.  I'm not sure if this is the way it has been for some time now, but I have to admit I never expected to see this trick used on a production website.  Turns out the page is broken because the XML document is unexpectedly truncated in a run of JS code, and so Firefox throws up the old \"XML Parsing Error\" page.</p>\n<p>Now, the reason I never expected to see it on a production site is because I didn't think enough browsers supported the <code>xml-stylesheet</code> processing instruction.  And then, of course, there's the issue of serving up parsing errors from your front page when strict parsers refuse to humor your sudden tag soup.</p>\n<p>But, I do have to say that I've harbored a wish to use <code>xml-stylesheet</code> on real sites for quite some time now.  A lot of the things done with a server-side content management system could be pushed off to the client - things like headers and footers and sidebar assembly and includes.  And it just feels nice to make the client do some of the work for you, taking some weight off the poor abused servers.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I sure do wish that the WoW front page wasn't broken right now.\n</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090469\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.negatendo.net/~brett/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4c39d783a464ec45de052c62873b4ac0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.negatendo.net/~brett/\">Brett O'Connor</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090469\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-07-30T21:00:28\">2006-07-30T21:00:28</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>If you go to <a href=\"http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml</a> it works.</p>\n<p>And yea, they made that change just last month.

But if you really look closely at the source of WOW's homepage, they actually have a lot of the content served up INSIDE THE XSL.  The XSL sheets are specific to each page, and it drives me insane trying to understand the logic behind doing this.</p>\n<p>If you have any insight into it, please, drop me a line, because I'm at a loss.</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "<p>The day before we left Michigan, my best friend and Best Man presented me with a copy of World of Warcraft.  He and his girlfriend have been playing the game for quite some time now, and it's how they keep in touch with a few family members - and now, it looks like it'll be a way that they can keep in touch with me.  I can only hope that I don't get <em>too </em>sucked into the game.  :)</p>\r\n<p>All of that aside, though, I just noticed something as I was making an initial pass at registering for a WoW account:  At the moment, <a href=\"http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml\">the World of Warcraft front page</a> is broken.</p>\r\n<p>It'll probably be fixed by the time you see it, but since my first impulse upon seeing an error is to \"View Source\", I noticed something further:  Their front page is XML, with an XSL processing instruction at the top.  I'm not sure if this is the way it has been for some time now, but I have to admit I never expected to see this trick used on a production website.  Turns out the page is broken because the XML document is unexpectedly truncated in a run of JS code, and so Firefox throws up the old \"XML Parsing Error\" page.</p>\r\n<p>Now, the reason I never expected to see it on a production site is because I didn't think enough browsers supported the <code>xml-stylesheet</code> processing instruction.  And then, of course, there's the issue of serving up parsing errors from your front page when strict parsers refuse to humor your sudden tag soup.</p>\r\n<p>But, I do have to say that I've harbored a wish to use <code>xml-stylesheet</code> on real sites for quite some time now.  A lot of the things done with a server-side content management system could be pushed off to the client - things like headers and footers and sidebar assembly and includes.  And it just feels nice to make the client do some of the work for you, taking some weight off the poor abused servers.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, I sure do wish that the WoW front page wasn't broken right now.\r\n</p>\r\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090469\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.negatendo.net/~brett/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4c39d783a464ec45de052c62873b4ac0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.negatendo.net/~brett/\">Brett O'Connor</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090469\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-07-30T21:00:28\">2006-07-30T21:00:28</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>If you go to <a href=\"http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml</a> it works.</p>\n\n<p>And yea, they made that change just last month.
