It's been over a month since my last update here, and a week and one day since <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2006/07/hello_world.html">I started here at my new job in sunny California</a>.  So, I figure it's about time I make some sort of peep.

Along the way - in fact in the midst of our move - I upgraded this blog to WP 2.0 and broke a number of things.  Hopefully, things are stabilized enough now to offer you this exercise to compare recent experiences in Michigan and California:

As you can see, this is a study in sudden unfamiliarities.  Our Focus actually arrived this past Monday night, and we returned the Montana to the airport last night - so that chapter of the move has closed.  I hear that our stuff will arrive tomorrow, so hopefully we'll be on our way to finally settling in by this weekend.

After that... I don't know.   I'm hoping we can finally establish a home base of some stability, then consider venturing out to the wonderful nearby city and maybe start to meet some people in the area.  And I hope we find a good lazy default dinner choice - we miss <a href="http://www.zumbagrille.com/index.html">our local Zumba for addictive and cheap Mexican-esque food</a>.

(My new bride and I are so enamoured of Zumbas in Royal Oak, MI, that you'll find mention of them included in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470037857/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&adid=0MTPP0JW2JPAPHVJ3JW7&link_code=as1">my new book</a>, in Chapter 6, p140.)
