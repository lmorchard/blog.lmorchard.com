I&#39;ve got an impulse to just keep flapping my gums about it, but there&#39;s nothing else I&#39;ve really got to say about it.  Continuing to babble for the sake of it will only get me in trouble.</p>\n<p>So, in the interests of trying to break up these repeated lulls here, I&#39;ve been looking for some reliable writing prompts without much luck.  My <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/deusx\">del.icio.us output</a> is steady enough - I thought I might, say, pick one bookmark a day and write something more expansive about it.  That seems not to be working.  I could start picking up on the meme du jour and post survey answers, but then I might as well go back to LiveJournal.  </p>\n<p>Of course, I could just accept that I&#39;m an inconstant blogger and not <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/07/14/dork-funk\">get into a funk about it</a>.  I still seem to get some reads when I happen to manage a post, so that&#39;s cool.</p>\n<p>However, unlike writing to a contract or a deadline, my readers here are pretty undemanding.  There&#39;s no one tapping a foot, pointing to a watch, asking when the next dozen pages or so are coming.  In fact, if I were to stop blogging altogether and shut down the site, it would probably be awhile before anyone noticed.  This isn&#39;t me being emo or anything - this is just how a world full of attractions and attention sinks works.</p>\n<p>At this point right now, then, I think I need something somewhat less demanding than another book project, but somewhat more demanding than vague apprehension that people are visiting my site and walking away from stale content.  I really don&#39;t care so much about drawing attention as much as getting a regular compulsion to write.  Hell, I haven&#39;t even been watching my site stats much in the last few years.  Don&#39;t get me wrong:  Having some readers&#39; attention is nice, but it&#39;s the writing that I really like.</p>\n<p>Hmm, I wonder if that means I&#39;m not <em>actually</em> a blogger, per se?  :)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090527\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ffe238ed68da35e8037df461552234&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090527\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-21T21:08:43\">2006-12-21T21:08:43</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Heh.  You&#39;d be surprised at what would be noticed.  I&#39;d be lying if I didn&#39;t say I actually do hang on the aggregator, just in case.</p>\n\n<p>Contrived goals like that are seemingly impeccable in their inability to motivate.  The quickest way I can get out of a blog funk (assuming it&#39;s a BLOG funk and not some other kind of funk) is to just open up emacs and start typing.  It&#39;s usually not more than 3/4 sentences before I start having &quot;Ya know, that REALLY pisses me off!&quot; thoughts running through my head.</p>\n\n<p>What more do you really need for a blog post ;-)</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221090530&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=90d3a543b48a9b848ace0c809e539773&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;LostPwns&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221090530&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2006-12-22T10:50:23&quot;&gt;2006-12-22T10:50:23&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;omg you look like that irakieguy from lost! &#39;tis is too cool...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221090533&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221090533&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2010-11-07T03:11:40&quot;&gt;2010-11-07T03:11:40&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a test comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
