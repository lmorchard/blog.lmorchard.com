          <p>I guess the nicest thing, at least with respect to this blog, about <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/tagometer">yesterday&#39;s new feature release</a> and the <a href="http://technorati.com/search/www.scripting.com%2F2006%2F12%2F20.html%23godBlessTheReinventers">JSON/XML debate</a> it tangentially inspired is that it gave me something to blog about.  I&#39;ve got an impulse to just keep flapping my gums about it, but there&#39;s nothing else I&#39;ve really got to say about it.  Continuing to babble for the sake of it will only get me in trouble.</p>
<p>So, in the interests of trying to break up these repeated lulls here, I&#39;ve been looking for some reliable writing prompts without much luck.  My <a href="http://del.icio.us/deusx">del.icio.us output</a> is steady enough - I thought I might, say, pick one bookmark a day and write something more expansive about it.  That seems not to be working.  I could start picking up on the meme du jour and post survey answers, but then I might as well go back to LiveJournal.  </p>
<p>Of course, I could just accept that I&#39;m an inconstant blogger and not <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/07/14/dork-funk">get into a funk about it</a>.  I still seem to get some reads when I happen to manage a post, so that&#39;s cool.</p>
<p>However, unlike writing to a contract or a deadline, my readers here are pretty undemanding.  There&#39;s no one tapping a foot, pointing to a watch, asking when the next dozen pages or so are coming.  In fact, if I were to stop blogging altogether and shut down the site, it would probably be awhile before anyone noticed.  This isn&#39;t me being emo or anything - this is just how a world full of attractions and attention sinks works.</p>
<p>At this point right now, then, I think I need something somewhat less demanding than another book project, but somewhat more demanding than vague apprehension that people are visiting my site and walking away from stale content.  I really don&#39;t care so much about drawing attention as much as getting a regular compulsion to write.  Hell, I haven&#39;t even been watching my site stats much in the last few years.  Don&#39;t get me wrong:  Having some readers&#39; attention is nice, but it&#39;s the writing that I really like.</p>
<p>Hmm, I wonder if that means I&#39;m not <em>actually</em> a blogger, per se?  :)</p>

<div class="content"><p>Heh.  You'd be surprised at what would be noticed.  I'd be lying if I didn't say I actually do hang on the aggregator, just in case.</p>
<p>Contrived goals like that are seemingly impeccable in their inability to motivate.  The quickest way I can get out of a blog funk (assuming it's a BLOG funk and not some other kind of funk) is to just open up emacs and start typing.  It's usually not more than 3/4 sentences before I start having "Ya know, that REALLY pisses me off!" thoughts running through my head.</p>
<p>What more do you really need for a blog post ;-)</p></div>
