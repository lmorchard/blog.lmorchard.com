Now move the mouse back inside the rectangle, and it still thinks your dragging, even though you’ve mouse-up’d.<br /><br />I guess this is because it’s not catching the onmouseup when you’re outside it’s “domain”. Perhaps make it automatically trigger the mouseup when the pointer leaves the area?</blockquote><div class=\"quotesource\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/design/create-cross-browser-vector-graphics#comment-34453\">Vitamin Features » Create cross browser vector graphics - Comment by Steve</a></div></p>\n<p>So, that <code>dojo.gfx</code> thing is cool - but what caught my eye in the above-linked article is the above-quoted comment.  Drag and drop and missed mouseups seem to be an issue everywhere.  I can&#39;t seem to get around them in my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a> drag code, <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/dragdrop/drag.html?mode=dist\">YUI DnD examples</a> seem to suffer from it, and hell - even Firefox itself doesn&#39;t seem immune:  Try drag-selecting some text, wander off-window with the mouse, release the mouse button.  For me at least, on my Mac, the drag-selection keeps doing its thing when I wander back on-window.   No me gusta.</p>\n"}
