So, that <code>dojo.gfx</code> thing is cool - but what caught my eye in the above-linked article is the above-quoted comment.  Drag and drop and missed mouseups seem to be an issue everywhere.  I can't seem to get around them in my [XoxoOutliner](http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner) drag code, [YUI DnD examples](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/dragdrop/drag.html?mode=dist) seem to suffer from it, and hell - even Firefox itself doesn't seem immune:  Try drag-selecting some text, wander off-window with the mouse, release the mouse button.  For me at least, on my Mac, the drag-selection keeps doing its thing when I wander back on-window.   No me gusta.
