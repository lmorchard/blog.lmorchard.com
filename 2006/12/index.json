This used a JSON decode written in ActionScript grabbed from JSON.org, plus a JSON encoder written in C# (it did not take long to write because I  did not attempt to serialize arbitrary objects).  Some gratuitous URL-encoding was also involved. Compared with passing the same data structure via URL-encoded XML to be picked apart by ActionScript's DOM support, it was easy and much more like fun.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

    "html": "<p>You know you&#39;ve truly arrived in Silicon Valley when <a href=\"http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2006/12/the_new_and_tag.html\">the darling new feature you just helped launch</a> on <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">a Web 2.0 site</a> gets shredded in <a href=\"http://www.scripting.com/2006/12/20.html#godBlessTheReinventers\">a rant by Dave Winer</a>.  :)  </p>\n<p>My day, having started with me in a foul mood, has been made.  Pre-launch, the tooth marks in my tongue have gotten deep as I watch the <a href=\"http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/12/20/scripting-news-for-12202006/\">comments</a> pile up.  It&#39;s exciting to have so many people debating something you&#39;ve made.  (Update:  Seriously.  I&#39;m in a better mood now.  It&#39;s made me laugh.)</p>\n<p>Actually, it wasn&#39;t the <a href=\"http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2006/12/the_new_and_tag.html\">feature itself</a> that got shredded, so much as the <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/help/json/url\">new JSON data feed</a> revealed before the <a href=\"http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2006/12/the_new_and_tag.html\">intended star of the show</a> made it on-stage, by way of <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2006/12/preview_of_the.html\">a screencast preview on Y!DN by Matt McAlister</a> and <a href=\"http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/12/delicious-url-api.html\">an amplification by Niall Kennedy</a>.  </p>\n<p>The feed itself is mainly intended to power our new <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/help/tagometer\">Tagometer</a> page widget include thingy.  Beyond that, leaving the feed decoupled from the include itself made sense to me, both for our own flexibility&#39;s sake and as a nod toward our mashup friends in the blogosphere and lazyweb.</p>\n<p>You see, I like JSON.  It was convenient in this use case of creating a remote blog widget fed by cross-domain sourced data.  I, personally, didn&#39;t even have to <a href=\"http://www.scripting.com/2006/12/20.html#godBlessTheReinventers\">reinvent anything</a> that wasn&#39;t already implemented in <a href=\"http://json.org/\">assorted off-the-web tools</a>.  JSON worked for this purpose - it might not work for your purpose.  <strike>If it doesn&#39;t, please accept my insincere apology, but yours wasn&#39;t my primary goal.  Attempts to string me up for this travesty will be met with giggles and pointing.</strike>  (Update:  I realize I&#39;m not the to-be-strung-up party responsible for the JSON travesty - I just couldn&#39;t resist being a smart ass for its own sake.  I really do giggle and point a lot.  My <em>actual</em> apologies for that.)</p>\n<p>It&#39;s funny, laugh.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://del.icio.us/help/json/url\">JSON URL feed</a> is not really an API.  <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/help/json/url\">JSON URL feed</a> is not a bold declaration of side-taking in the grand war of web service specifications.

The smiley was neither ironic nor sarcastic.  Something big I helped launch has been stirring an interesting discussion, however tangential my blame in the making.  </p>\n<p>Vanity and Carly Simon aside, I know I'm not the main perpetrator of JSON.  I just couldn't resist an opportunity to be a smart ass.  For that I have a <em>sincere</em> apology.  I should probably strike it or delete it now that the giddiness of a major launch and a lot of attention has subsided.</p>\n<p>But seriously, what I meant above is not that this is <em>your</em> issue, per se.  This post is really more directed at some comments on your blog post, in bulk.  </p>\n<p>Our particular intentions behind using JSON here do not necessarily map to anyone else's expectation from a web service or standards-driven perspective.  It seems like a lot of people are looking at this JSON data since its early release, divorced from it's main consumer:  The Tagometer JS include.

    "body": "You know you've truly arrived in Silicon Valley when [the darling new feature you just helped launch][ta] on [a Web 2.0 site][del] gets shredded in [a rant by Dave Winer][dw].  :)  \r\n\r\nMy day, having started with me in a foul mood, has been made.  Pre-launch, the tooth marks in my tongue have gotten deep as I watch the [comments][com] pile up.  It's exciting to have so many people debating something you've made.  (Update:  Seriously.  I'm in a better mood now.  It's made me laugh.)\r\n\r\nActually, it wasn't the [feature itself][ta] that got shredded, so much as the [new JSON data feed][jf] revealed before the [intended star of the show][ta] made it on-stage, by way of [a screencast preview on Y!DN by Matt McAlister][mm] and [an amplification by Niall Kennedy][nk].  \r\n\r\nThe feed itself is mainly intended to power our new [Tagometer][ta2] page widget include thingy.  Beyond that, leaving the feed decoupled from the include itself made sense to me, both for our own flexibility's sake and as a nod toward our mashup friends in the blogosphere and lazyweb.\r\n\r\nYou see, I like JSON.  It was convenient in this use case of creating a remote blog widget fed by cross-domain sourced data.  I, personally, didn't even have to [reinvent anything][dw] that wasn't already implemented in [assorted off-the-web tools][json].  JSON worked for this purpose - it might not work for your purpose.  <strike>If it doesn't, please accept my insincere apology, but yours wasn't my primary goal.  Attempts to string me up for this travesty will be met with giggles and pointing.</strike>  (Update:  I realize I'm not the to-be-strung-up party responsible for the JSON travesty - I just couldn't resist being a smart ass for its own sake.  I really do giggle and point a lot.  My *actual* apologies for that.)\r\n\r\nIt's funny, laugh.\r\n\r\n[JSON URL feed][jf] is not really an API.  [JSON URL feed][jf] is not a bold declaration of side-taking in the grand war of web service specifications.  Do not base business models on [JSON URL feed][jf].  Caution: [JSON URL feed][jf] may suddenly accelerate to dangerous speeds or stop altogether.  [JSON URL feed][jf] contains a liquid core, which, if exposed due to rupture, should not be touched, inhaled, or looked at.  Ingredients of [JSON URL feed][jf] include an unknown glowing substance which fell to Earth, presumably from outer space.  If [JSON URL feed][jf] begins to smoke, get away immediately. Seek shelter and cover head.  \r\n\r\nDo not taunt [JSON URL feed][jf].\r\n\r\n[com]: http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/12/20/scripting-news-for-12202006/\r\n[json]: http://json.org/\r\n[mm]: http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2006/12/preview_of_the.html\r\n[nk]: http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/12/delicious-url-api.html\r\n[ta2]: http://del.icio.us/help/tagometer\r\n[jf]: http://del.icio.us/help/json/url\r\n[del]: http://del.icio.us/\r\n[ta]: http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2006/12/the_new_and_tag.html\r\n[dw]: http://www.scripting.com/2006/12/20.html#godBlessTheReinventers\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090833\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.scripting.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2378b474e8eadf5da80e86c2bbc75a74&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.scripting.com/\">Dave Winer</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090833\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-21T02:00:51\">2006-12-21T02:00:51</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Not sure if I helped your mood or made it worse, but the rant wasn't about you. </p>\n\n<p>http://www.json.org/xml.html</p>\n\n<p>Tell me what you think of that bit of hyperbole.

This relatively new AJAX pagination technique is pretty sweet, but better applied to data sets ordered by relevance and / or expected to be traversed in one direction.\r\n\r\nAlso, a note in general to other redesign teams:  Watch your entry points and don't break bookmarks unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n[tv]: http://yodel.yahoo.com/2006/11/28/anything-good-on-tonight/\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086909\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c19b0cb36d7f40d163e81b1be8da7622&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/\">Jeremy Zawodny</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086909\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-03T04:09:32\">2006-12-03T04:09:32</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Your \"like many others\" link is 404ing.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086910\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086910\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-03T05:48:00\">2006-12-03T05:48:00</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Doh't.
