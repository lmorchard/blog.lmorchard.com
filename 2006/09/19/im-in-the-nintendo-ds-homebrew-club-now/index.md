I've just received a [Passcard 3][pc3] in the mail.  Nintendo DS homebrew, here I come!  I'm particularly excited about [NitroTracker][nt] and [ScummVM][svm].  Though I've only got a [GBA Movie Player][gbamp] and a 128MB CF flash card from a camera, that seems enough to run most of this stuff so far.  Unfortunately, it just sticks out from the Nintendo DS Lite by an inch or so - almost half the depth of the handheld itself!  I think one of my next purchases may be a more compact and capable [SuperCard MicroSD][sc], which fits flush in the Nintendo DS Lite and accepts MicroSD expansion cards.

            <div class="content"><p>Congratulations on the Passcard ;) I got one myself a couple of months ago, including a M3 CF, and playing Monkey Island on the DS rocks ;) I have to warn you though concerning SD based units, there were a couple of issues not so long ago with several homebrew apps (including Scumm), and write-support for SD is afaik still rather new in the standard fat-lib used by homebrew devs. So you might want to make sure that your most beloved or interesting apps will actually work like expected prior to spending loads of money.</p></div>

<p>I'm getting ready to break down and buy some homebrew stuff for mine.</p></div>
