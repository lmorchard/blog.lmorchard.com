Nintendo DS homebrew, here I come!  I&#39;m particularly excited about <a href=\"http://nitrotracker.tobw.net/index.php\">NitroTracker</a> and <a href=\"http://scummvm.drunkencoders.com/\">ScummVM</a>.  Though I&#39;ve only got a <a href=\"http://movieadvance.com/\">GBA Movie Player</a> and a 128MB CF flash card from a camera, that seems enough to run most of this stuff so far.  Unfortunately, it just sticks out from the Nintendo DS Lite by an inch or so - almost half the depth of the handheld itself!  I think one of my next purchases may be a more compact and capable <a href=\"http://www.divineo.com/cgi-bin/div-us/dd-ds-suplite.html\">SuperCard MicroSD</a>, which fits flush in the Nintendo DS Lite and accepts MicroSD expansion cards.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082362\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://foosel.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bc9bc547d634817fe7ca6348119b0eaf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://foosel.net\">foosel</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082362\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-24T22:43:08\">2006-09-24T22:43:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Congratulations on the Passcard ;) I got one myself a couple of months ago, including a M3 CF, and playing Monkey Island on the DS rocks ;) I have to warn you though concerning SD based units, there were a couple of issues not so long ago with several homebrew apps (including Scumm), and write-support for SD is afaik still rather new in the standard fat-lib used by homebrew devs. So you might want to make sure that your most beloved or interesting apps will actually work like expected prior to spending loads of money.</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221082363&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://twitter.com/adammokan&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/amokan.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://twitter.com/adammokan&quot;&gt;Adam Mokan&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221082363&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2006-09-28T04:21:30&quot;&gt;2006-09-28T04:21:30&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does the Passcard 3 fit in the DS?
