I'm registering my vote with you.</p>\n<p>AJAX or AJAXY or AJAX-like has become one of those weird, undefinably vague web 2.0 type terms that means one thing: 'cool'.  I have had clients ask for cool AJAXY type web interfaces, and they don't even know what they are talking about. They just want it to be 'web 2.0 cool'. I can't wait to see a job description that asks for 5 years of AJAX experience. \"Yeah, sure, I can do AJAX..., been doing it since 1984!\"</p>\n<p>I think the term has been over-used and over-hyped in this mini-bubble of excitement just to get a VC's attention. To me it means a server side remote-procedure call, that updates some part of a page without updating the whole page in a round-trip to the server, accomplished with some form of javascript and server side code via httpRequestObject.</p>\n<p>I could charge extra dollars to develop an AJAXIAN Website. Wouldn't that be 'cool'. Almost nobody would know the difference, except you...</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

And XAML squicks me out because it's a Microsoft app that happens to be web-transferred.  Neither makes me happy when I'm trying to make broadly usable web applications across many platforms.  Neither XUL nor XAML will become the standards that HTML, CSS, and JS have become - even with their fuzzy semi-proprietary sidecars like XMLHttpRequest.</p>\n\n<p>My association with AJAX comes from having written apps using it, and that's from where my grousing arises.  I don't care about the general public's definition of AJAX, just the developers who care about terms like \"asynchronous\" and \"XML\".  But it looks like \"ajaxWrite\" is a somewhat cynical attempt to cash in on public perceptions of AJAXian buzz.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082593\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blogs.opml.org/thewilk/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=6f010da6af916f57143ff4d04f6dfb83&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blogs.opml.org/thewilk/\">David Wilkinson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082593\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-28T07:08:32\">2006-03-28T07:08:32</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Thanks for voicing this l.m. I'm registering my vote with you.</p>\n\n<p>AJAX or AJAXY or AJAX-like has become one of those weird, undefinably vague web 2.0 type terms that means one thing: 'cool'.  I have had clients ask for cool AJAXY type web interfaces, and they don't even know what they are talking about. They just want it to be 'web 2.0 cool'. I can't wait to see a job description that asks for 5 years of AJAX experience. \"Yeah, sure, I can do AJAX..., been doing it since 1984!\"</p>\n\n<p>I think the term has been over-used and over-hyped in this mini-bubble of excitement just to get a VC's attention. To me it means a server side remote-procedure call, that updates some part of a page without updating the whole page in a round-trip to the server, accomplished with some form of javascript and server side code via httpRequestObject.</p>\n\n<p>I could charge extra dollars to develop an AJAXIAN Website. Wouldn't that be 'cool'. Almost nobody would know the difference, except you...</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",
