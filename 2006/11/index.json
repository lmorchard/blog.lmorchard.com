    "body": "Something very cool I just noticed on my MacBook Pro:  There's separate volume settings for headphones versus built-in speakers.  I had the sound muted for external speakers last night.  But, when I plugged my headphones in at work this morning, the volume jumped back to exactly where I'd left it yesterday.  When I realized it happened, I tried alternately plugging and unplugging the headphones, marvelling at the volume icon going back and forth.\r\n\r\nHas it always done this?  Is this something new?  Do other laptops do this?  Am I on crack?\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088340\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://soapbox.co.nz/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=be73b6ce436e594cb6bd080a136cf6e5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://soapbox.co.nz/\">Patrick</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088340\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-17T18:42:24\">2006-11-17T18:42:24</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I noticed this by first thinking it was some kind of bug - whenever I'd use my laptop after having it plugged into the TV/stereo the sound was muted.

This change breaks things I've invested hours into across several jobs, and into which I've been investing hours again.

I really don't have standards all memorized or even well studied.</p>\n<p>But, in the new defacto standard, I get to stuff 512 random bytes into a feed to get the old behavior back.  That certainly doesn't \"smell\" like a clean standard to me, even if IE 7 does it and Firefox 2 now follows.  It still doesn't work in Safari.  It seems a defacto standard to me in the same way that exploiting CSS parser errors to filter by browser is a defacto standard.  Yet another weird edge case to memorize.</p>\n<p>From my perspective, the defacto standard has been what FeedBurner and others have been doing with client-side XSL for feeds.  And there've been some exciting things starting there - so there's some personal disappointment invoked.  And now, all those feeds are broken in that respect.  Retroactive wind-blown urine, at this point, I guess.</p>\n<p>Maybe all this was really just a neat geeky trick best now forgotten, and the decision really will be the right one in the end.  Nonetheless, I don't like it.  So, perhaps not \"IT IS OBJECTIVELY WRONG\".  But, from my perspective, it was an unexpected and unwanted surprise.</p>\n<p>As for being productive, the decision seems made and others have already registered the same or better objections than I would just rehash.  And I can't see with what collective character flaw I've painted the team - I'm perturbed, but I certainly don't think everyone involved is a villain.  My apologies if my frustration vents that way.  It's just that taking over feed styling from content providers strikes me as \"we can do user experience better\", and the explanations I've read don't seem to disagree with that notion.</p>\n<p>But, I disagree and I don't like it.  So, fine, from here on out I use the 512-byte-hack if I want custom XSL styling for feeds.  Another trick in the bag.  That's pretty much my last word on the subject, unless the capability disappears entirely.</p>\n<p>All I have left to say is that I hope the <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/07/30/xml-stylesheet-and-the-world-of-warcraft-home-page\" rel=\"nofollow\">client-side XSL-styled World of Warcraft home page</a> never switches to an Atom or RSS format - whether or not using a non-HTML format for a front page was a good idea in the first place.  I thought it was, but that could be my whole problem.  :)</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087108\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.net\">CraigM</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087108\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T02:42:06\">2006-11-08T02:42:06</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>My \"frustrated with technology\" catch-phrase has always been to become a Buddhist Monk.

That's not how the decision was made. And to be honest, it bothers me somewhat to read a rant on the subject that only focuses on Firefox. To me, it seems like taking advantage of an open product development process because you know we will listen, while other vendors won't. A rant that claims \"Firefox and IE and Safari suck\" would be different, because then it is an opinion on a behavior. Criticism of browser behavior is welcome, criticism of people based on tech religion is not so welcome.</p>\n<p>I understand that FeedBurner and others have a business interest here, but you have to understand that at least some of the things they do directly conflict with capabilities that are beneficial to browser users (that we can't deliver if it only works with half of the feeds out there). We want our users to have a coherent feed experience, with browser-specific preferences and minimal click-through screens. To that end, the screen that supplants the XSL was termed the \"feed preview\". It should show what's in the feed, and default to user-specified feed preferences. If the feed doesn't contain ads for aggregators and feed services (and wrong instructions), a preview that shows that stuff deceives our users. Not in an evil way, but in a \"bad usability\" way. When combined with authors who <em>want</em> a browser feed screen with a stylesheet for older browsers, and Safari/IE7 behavior, the scales tilted away from  using the XSL.</p>\n<p>I understand that people disagree here. But the fact that all browser vendors have done something that doesn't align with the way they used to do it should tell you that the issue is more complicated than \"author's intent\", for better or worse.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087111\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087111\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T04:38:57\">2006-11-08T04:38:57</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Robert:  You have a great point there - I do in fact think that Firefox, IE, and Safari all suck with this current change in feed handling.  And yeah, the only reason I ranted about Firefox is because I think it's the only one of the three there's much chance in affecting.  It's also the only browser I use, so it's the first one where the feed handling change really sunk in for me.  I really haven't cared about it until just now.</p>\n<p>Of course, I've been nowhere near participating in the newsgroups or code checkins or anything whatsoever related to actually contributing to Firefox - so this is all blog-chair quarterbacking from a syndication feeds enthusiast.</p>\n<p>As for the \"they think they know better than us\" issue, I think it can be found in <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_thread/thread/146f70eaf0e1686f/1daec246d79c7dbd#ccd0a66d6a204f49\" rel=\"nofollow\">a newsgroup response like Mike Shaver's</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... one significant motivation was that very many uses of XSLT-on-RSS was to create a page that said \"this is not <em>for</em> you browsers, go to the main site instead\", which is not what we wanted the user's experience to be.  Distinguishing those cases from the \"righteous use of XSLT for dual presentation\" ones is a publishable result, I submit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To this, the most vocal respondents say, \"But I <em>really want</em> my users to experience my righteous XSLT!\"  Even if it has flaming GIFs, dancing hamsters, and cat pictures.  It's <em>righteous</em>, damn it.  (Yeah, the quoted \"righteous\" is a little off-putting when you actually think the XSLT thing is kind of keen.)</p>\n<p>Why not apply the new-and-improved styling by default and bow out when there's a processing instruction?  Then, spread the word - \"Get rid of your cruddy not-for-you XSLT!\"  I'm sure you'd get lots of converts grateful to stop screwing with their feeds, which would leave the outlier nutters like me and FeedBurner to keep happily shooting themselves in the feet.  Instead, I see, \"style 'em all and let hacks sort 'em out,\" which totally rubs me the wrong way.</p>\n<p>At this point, I'm really just mildly disappointed, and feel like I've gotten a downgrade in an otherwise all-around great new browser.  I'm not <em>actually</em> looking to farm sheep over this.  There is a hack-around available for IE7 and FF2, so at least there's that.</p>\n<p>I guess what would make me feel like I'd gotten a decent consolation prize would be if that Feed Preview screen were significantly richer and easier on the eyes than the other browsers' offerings.  I'm assuming that's projected for the future.  Maybe what I need is to do a checkout and dig around.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087112\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ffe238ed68da35e8037df461552234&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087112\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T04:41:06\">2006-11-08T04:41:06</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>CraigM: You may want to reconsider.

Because Mozilla has chosen to ignore an Author's preferences when displaying a feed.  Period.  You can explain it all you want, your reasoning may even be right- but the bottom line is, Mozilla made a conscious decision to ignore styling instructions included by the feed's author.  The only reasons I can think of to do this is to be perverse (which I doubt), or because you think you know better (and from here on out, I use the collective you for Mozilla, because I'm tired of typing Mozilla).</p>\n<p>You claim it's better for users.  I say you think you know better what is good for your users than the feed author does.  This is the same feed author that created the feed's content, and the stylesheet, and decided to present the feed to users with the stylesheet.  I'm sorry, I just don't buy it.</p>\n<p>Another non-starter is the IE7/Safari argument.  I don't care what those browsers do; I chose Firefox because it decided to lead, not follow, when it comes to standards.  Whether you believe that displaying RSS feeds with stylesheets is a standards issue or not, you can't deny it was a de-facto standard until recently.</p>\n<p>And what about those authors who only want their stylesheets applied in older browsers that aren't as enlightened as IE7?  Not that I've seen a public outcry from these authors in any of the forums discussing this \"feature\", but let's assume they must exist.  They were smart enought to add the stylesheet to their feed, why not allow them to also add to their feed an indication that a browser's built in styling may trump the linked stylesheet (perhaps a PI)?  Wouldn't that allow both types of authors to get what they want without wasting bandwidth in 1/2 kb increments of sheer hack?  </p>\n<p>I've read the arguments, here, on the buglist, and in the newsgroups.  To me, and I suspect, to many others, Mozilla (or those who made this decision within Mozilla) has acted as though they think they know better than web site authors.  Explanations such as yours appear to me as an explanation of why you think that, not a refutation that you don't.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087115\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0a9ab4b71ce193e98b7284ca257e327&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\">Jason Clark</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087115\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T13:21:50\">2006-11-08T13:21:50</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Regarding the above:  Sorry about the extra \"conscious\" at the beginning....

Yet another weird edge case to memorize.</p>\n\n<p>From my perspective, the defacto standard has been what FeedBurner and others have been doing with client-side XSL for feeds.  And there've been some exciting things starting there - so there's some personal disappointment invoked.  And now, all those feeds are broken in that respect.  Retroactive wind-blown urine, at this point, I guess.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe all this was really just a neat geeky trick best now forgotten, and the decision really will be the right one in the end.  Nonetheless, I don't like it.  So, perhaps not \"IT IS OBJECTIVELY WRONG\".  But, from my perspective, it was an unexpected and unwanted surprise.</p>\n\n<p>As for being productive, the decision seems made and others have already registered the same or better objections than I would just rehash.  And I can't see with what collective character flaw I've painted the team - I'm perturbed, but I certainly don't think everyone involved is a villain.  My apologies if my frustration vents that way.  It's just that taking over feed styling from content providers strikes me as \"we can do user experience better\", and the explanations I've read don't seem to disagree with that notion.</p>\n\n<p>But, I disagree and I don't like it.  So, fine, from here on out I use the 512-byte-hack if I want custom XSL styling for feeds.  Another trick in the bag.  That's pretty much my last word on the subject, unless the capability disappears entirely.</p>\n\n<p>All I have left to say is that I hope the <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/07/30/xml-stylesheet-and-the-world-of-warcraft-home-page\" rel=\"nofollow\">client-side XSL-styled World of Warcraft home page</a> never switches to an Atom or RSS format - whether or not using a non-HTML format for a front page was a good idea in the first place.  I thought it was, but that could be my whole problem.  :)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087108\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\">CraigM</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087108\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T02:42:06\">2006-11-08T02:42:06</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>My \"frustrated with technology\" catch-phrase has always been to become a Buddhist Monk.

That's not how the decision was made. And to be honest, it bothers me somewhat to read a rant on the subject that only focuses on Firefox. To me, it seems like taking advantage of an open product development process because you know we will listen, while other vendors won't. A rant that claims \"Firefox and IE and Safari suck\" would be different, because then it is an opinion on a behavior. Criticism of browser behavior is welcome, criticism of people based on tech religion is not so welcome.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that FeedBurner and others have a business interest here, but you have to understand that at least some of the things they do directly conflict with capabilities that are beneficial to browser users (that we can't deliver if it only works with half of the feeds out there). We want our users to have a coherent feed experience, with browser-specific preferences and minimal click-through screens. To that end, the screen that supplants the XSL was termed the \"feed preview\". It should show what's in the feed, and default to user-specified feed preferences. If the feed doesn't contain ads for aggregators and feed services (and wrong instructions), a preview that shows that stuff deceives our users. Not in an evil way, but in a \"bad usability\" way. When combined with authors who <em>want</em> a browser feed screen with a stylesheet for older browsers, and Safari/IE7 behavior, the scales tilted away from  using the XSL.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that people disagree here. But the fact that all browser vendors have done something that doesn't align with the way they used to do it should tell you that the issue is more complicated than \"author's intent\", for better or worse.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087111\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087111\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T04:38:57\">2006-11-08T04:38:57</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Robert:  You have a great point there - I do in fact think that Firefox, IE, and Safari all suck with this current change in feed handling.  And yeah, the only reason I ranted about Firefox is because I think it's the only one of the three there's much chance in affecting.  It's also the only browser I use, so it's the first one where the feed handling change really sunk in for me.  I really haven't cared about it until just now.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I've been nowhere near participating in the newsgroups or code checkins or anything whatsoever related to actually contributing to Firefox - so this is all blog-chair quarterbacking from a syndication feeds enthusiast.</p>\n\n<p>As for the \"they think they know better than us\" issue, I think it can be found in <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_thread/thread/146f70eaf0e1686f/1daec246d79c7dbd#ccd0a66d6a204f49\" rel=\"nofollow\">a newsgroup response like Mike Shaver's</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... one significant motivation was that very many uses of XSLT-on-RSS was to create a page that said \"this is not <em>for</em> you browsers, go to the main site instead\", which is not what we wanted the user's experience to be.  Distinguishing those cases from the \"righteous use of XSLT for dual presentation\" ones is a publishable result, I submit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To this, the most vocal respondents say, \"But I <em>really want</em> my users to experience my righteous XSLT!\"  Even if it has flaming GIFs, dancing hamsters, and cat pictures.  It's <em>righteous</em>, damn it.  (Yeah, the quoted \"righteous\" is a little off-putting when you actually think the XSLT thing is kind of keen.)</p>\n\n<p>Why not apply the new-and-improved styling by default and bow out when there's a processing instruction?  Then, spread the word - \"Get rid of your cruddy not-for-you XSLT!\"  I'm sure you'd get lots of converts grateful to stop screwing with their feeds, which would leave the outlier nutters like me and FeedBurner to keep happily shooting themselves in the feet.  Instead, I see, \"style 'em all and let hacks sort 'em out,\" which totally rubs me the wrong way.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I'm really just mildly disappointed, and feel like I've gotten a downgrade in an otherwise all-around great new browser.  I'm not <em>actually</em> looking to farm sheep over this.  There is a hack-around available for IE7 and FF2, so at least there's that.</p>\n\n<p>I guess what would make me feel like I'd gotten a decent consolation prize would be if that Feed Preview screen were significantly richer and easier on the eyes than the other browsers' offerings.  I'm assuming that's projected for the future.  Maybe what I need is to do a checkout and dig around.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087112\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ffe238ed68da35e8037df461552234&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087112\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T04:41:06\">2006-11-08T04:41:06</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>CraigM: You may want to reconsider.

Because Mozilla has chosen to ignore an Author's preferences when displaying a feed.  Period.  You can explain it all you want, your reasoning may even be right- but the bottom line is, Mozilla made a conscious decision to ignore styling instructions included by the feed's author.  The only reasons I can think of to do this is to be perverse (which I doubt), or because you think you know better (and from here on out, I use the collective you for Mozilla, because I'm tired of typing Mozilla).</p>\n\n<p>You claim it's better for users.  I say you think you know better what is good for your users than the feed author does.  This is the same feed author that created the feed's content, and the stylesheet, and decided to present the feed to users with the stylesheet.  I'm sorry, I just don't buy it.</p>\n\n<p>Another non-starter is the IE7/Safari argument.  I don't care what those browsers do; I chose Firefox because it decided to lead, not follow, when it comes to standards.  Whether you believe that displaying RSS feeds with stylesheets is a standards issue or not, you can't deny it was a de-facto standard until recently.</p>\n\n<p>And what about those authors who only want their stylesheets applied in older browsers that aren't as enlightened as IE7?  Not that I've seen a public outcry from these authors in any of the forums discussing this \"feature\", but let's assume they must exist.  They were smart enought to add the stylesheet to their feed, why not allow them to also add to their feed an indication that a browser's built in styling may trump the linked stylesheet (perhaps a PI)?  Wouldn't that allow both types of authors to get what they want without wasting bandwidth in 1/2 kb increments of sheer hack?  </p>\n\n<p>I've read the arguments, here, on the buglist, and in the newsgroups.  To me, and I suspect, to many others, Mozilla (or those who made this decision within Mozilla) has acted as though they think they know better than web site authors.  Explanations such as yours appear to me as an explanation of why you think that, not a refutation that you don't.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087115\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0a9ab4b71ce193e98b7284ca257e327&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\">Jason Clark</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087115\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T13:21:50\">2006-11-08T13:21:50</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Regarding the above:  Sorry about the extra \"conscious\" at the beginning....

It seems to work quite well on my machine, which is quite a bit beefier than my old machine.  I should try it out on there soon.  But, I&#39;ll hopefully be releasing it soon in the form of a mostly-rewritten <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a> that will feature drag and drop outline items as well as keyboard navigation/control and in-place editing.  And, it should actually start to become useful, since I plan to also whip up a PHP-based server side bit that will handle loading and saving outlines, as well as possibly a client-side bit that can save outlines using local browser storage.  I have the technology - we&#39;ll see how far my ambitious plans take me during this hobbling sprint of development.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087316\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://db79.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db8059b0ce0b3cf393f4de0ad7af758f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://db79.com\">Shawn Medero</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087316\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-07T11:01:11\">2006-11-07T11:01:11</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Great news Les!

    "body": "For what it's worth: I've answered my own [question about event delegation based drag and drop][ednd].  It seems to work quite well on my machine, which is quite a bit beefier than my old machine.  I should try it out on there soon.  But, I'll hopefully be releasing it soon in the form of a mostly-rewritten [XoxoOutliner][xo] that will feature drag and drop outline items as well as keyboard navigation/control and in-place editing.  And, it should actually start to become useful, since I plan to also whip up a PHP-based server side bit that will handle loading and saving outlines, as well as possibly a client-side bit that can save outlines using local browser storage.  I have the technology - we'll see how far my ambitious plans take me during this hobbling sprint of development.\r\n\r\n[xo]: http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\r\n[ednd]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/10/31/event-delegation-based-dhtml-drag-and-drop\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087316\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://db79.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db8059b0ce0b3cf393f4de0ad7af758f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://db79.com\">Shawn Medero</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087316\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-07T11:01:11\">2006-11-07T11:01:11</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Great news Les!

    "html": "<p>This seems like a small thing, but it bothers me:  For RSS and Atom feeds, Firefox ignores client-side XSL transformations in favor of its own new enhanced rendering.  The only way to work around this issue is to stuff 512 bytes or more of XML comment text before the initial feed tag.  <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=338621\">It&#39;s been marked as a bug</a> for some months now - but after reading the discussion therein, I don&#39;t have much hope of this being fixed.  The gist of the discussion appears to boil down to this: &quot;Firefox knows best, consistency is good, and anyone using client-side XSL on feeds is really after what we&#39;re doing anyway.  Thus, WONTFIX.&quot;</p>\n<p>This strikes me as a bit condescending, presumptuous, and quite broken.  I don&#39;t care if <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/articles/PublishersGuide.aspx\">it&#39;s what IE 7 does</a> - they&#39;re broken too.  This breaks <a href=\"http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/home\">FeedBurner</a>&#39;s XSL presentation, which I like though admittedly don&#39;t use for my own stuff.  This breaks the feed-styling XSL I&#39;ve done at jobs past, which rolled in customer-demanded metrics tracking and branding.  And I don&#39;t care whether or not the Firefox team considers these or other use cases valid - that&#39;s up to me to decide.</p>\n<p>This &quot;feature&quot; makes a special case breaking client-side XSL for XML documents that happen to have an &quot;&lt;rss&quot; or &quot;&lt;atom&quot; in the first 512 bytes.  That sucks.  I&#39;d rather the browser left it up to me as a site author whether to follow Firefox&#39;s idea of consistency, or whether to happily shoot myself in the foot with my own decisions.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083664\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8f428369088902ba8149d27e1ac2423d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Len Lynch</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083664\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-02T19:26:50\">2006-11-02T19:26:50</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>They should make this a tunable and provide \"over riding\" the portable behavior with their own value-minded agenda.

(Yes, you read that right. A whole lot of the rest are served as <code>text/plain</code>.) The same is true of images and videos, btw. There is no way to avoid content sniffing.</p>\n<p>The ideal approach would have been to honour the PI <em>only</em> if the feed is served as <code>text/xml</code> or <code>application/xml</code>, eg. explicitly as generic XML rather than as a feed. In case of sniffed feeds or feeds served with the proper MIME type, the PI would be ignored (as client apps are free to do; they are under no obligation to honour the PI), but authors would still have a clean and obvious option for getting what they want.</p>\n<p>Except that RSS 2.0 does not have a MIME type and is therefore served as <code>text/xml</code> or <code>application/xml</code>.</p>\n<p>This is what happens when people who have no clue of how the web works come up with things to put on the web: you end up with no good way of implementing their crud.</p>\n<p>The only thing I can think of that could have been better than what we have now would be to specify a new PI to explicitly disable the default feed view. (Although I’d want to have maybe add a yellow strip that lets me disable the custom view or something like that; withholding from the reader the ability to be the ultimate arbiter of his own experience is Wrong.)</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083684\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://starling.us/atom/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8b09a229fac82b3a6b7b61e0db95408c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://starling.us/atom/\">Gan Uesli Starling</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083684\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-02-22T10:22:23\">2007-02-22T10:22:23</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Yes, this is MOST annoying. I had put off writing a feed waiting until the formats should settle out.

Then, working in Firefox 1.5.0.1 I blissfully labored over an XSLT to go with it. Spent quite a while at that. Only when I have it working pretty much as desired do I bother to check it at work in IE7...and ARGHHH!...all my time and effort wasted.</p>\n<p>And oh, by the way, I had also written a howto for Atom 1.0...and XSLT. So I search GOOGLE high and low until I find someone who writes of how to turn the feature off in IE7...and ammend my howto for that instruction. Now I must do so for Firefox 2.0...and Safari...it seems. Alas and alack.</p>\n<p>How about Opera? I recall from some years back that Opera was among the first and best of early adopters for XSLT. It looks as if my howto for Atom 1.0 and XSLT is going to be largely composed of workarounds for this mis-feature.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083688\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=916cc61b7337d47614cfb29b3f593e9d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jeff Wilkinson</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083688\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-14T20:29:34\">2007-03-14T20:29:34</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>what a pain.  fixing this will definitely get my vote.

    "body": "This seems like a small thing, but it bothers me:  For RSS and Atom feeds, Firefox ignores client-side XSL transformations in favor of its own new enhanced rendering.  The only way to work around this issue is to stuff 512 bytes or more of XML comment text before the initial feed tag.  [It's been marked as a bug][bug] for some months now - but after reading the discussion therein, I don't have much hope of this being fixed.  The gist of the discussion appears to boil down to this: \"Firefox knows best, consistency is good, and anyone using client-side XSL on feeds is really after what we're doing anyway.  Thus, WONTFIX.\"\r\n\r\nThis strikes me as a bit condescending, presumptuous, and quite broken.  I don't care if [it's what IE 7 does][ie7] - they're broken too.  This breaks [FeedBurner][fb]'s XSL presentation, which I like though admittedly don't use for my own stuff.  This breaks the feed-styling XSL I've done at jobs past, which rolled in customer-demanded metrics tracking and branding.  And I don't care whether or not the Firefox team considers these or other use cases valid - that's up to me to decide.\r\n\r\nThis \"feature\" makes a special case breaking client-side XSL for XML documents that happen to have an \"&lt;rss\" or \"&lt;atom\" in the first 512 bytes.  That sucks.  I'd rather the browser left it up to me as a site author whether to follow Firefox's idea of consistency, or whether to happily shoot myself in the foot with my own decisions.\r\n\r\n[bug]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=338621\r\n[fb]: http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/home\r\n[ie7]: http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/articles/PublishersGuide.aspx\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083664\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8f428369088902ba8149d27e1ac2423d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Len Lynch</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083664\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-02T19:26:50\">2006-11-02T19:26:50</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>They should make this a tunable and provide \"over riding\" the portable behavior with their own value-minded agenda.

(Although I’d want to have maybe add a yellow strip that lets me disable the custom view or something like that; withholding from the reader the ability to be the ultimate arbiter of his own experience is Wrong.)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083684\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://starling.us/atom/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8b09a229fac82b3a6b7b61e0db95408c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://starling.us/atom/\">Gan Uesli Starling</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083684\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-02-22T10:22:23\">2007-02-22T10:22:23</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Yes, this is MOST annoying. I had put off writing a feed waiting until the formats should settle out. I ended up delaying first until Atom 1.0, and then longer yet until I should have some free time...until just a couple of weeks ago. Then, working in Firefox 1.5.0.1 I blissfully labored over an XSLT to go with it. Spent quite a while at that. Only when I have it working pretty much as desired do I bother to check it at work in IE7...and ARGHHH!...all my time and effort wasted.</p>\n\n<p>And oh, by the way, I had also written a howto for Atom 1.0...and XSLT. So I search GOOGLE high and low until I find someone who writes of how to turn the feature off in IE7...and ammend my howto for that instruction. Now I must do so for Firefox 2.0...and Safari...it seems. Alas and alack.</p>\n\n<p>How about Opera? I recall from some years back that Opera was among the first and best of early adopters for XSLT. It looks as if my howto for Atom 1.0 and XSLT is going to be largely composed of workarounds for this mis-feature.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083688\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=916cc61b7337d47614cfb29b3f593e9d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Jeff Wilkinson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083688\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-14T20:29:34\">2007-03-14T20:29:34</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>what a pain.  fixing this will definitely get my vote.

At least IE7 allows for their default view to be turned off.
