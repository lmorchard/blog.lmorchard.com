It seems to work quite well on my machine, which is quite a bit beefier than my old machine.  I should try it out on there soon.  But, I&#39;ll hopefully be releasing it soon in the form of a mostly-rewritten <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a> that will feature drag and drop outline items as well as keyboard navigation/control and in-place editing.  And, it should actually start to become useful, since I plan to also whip up a PHP-based server side bit that will handle loading and saving outlines, as well as possibly a client-side bit that can save outlines using local browser storage.  I have the technology - we&#39;ll see how far my ambitious plans take me during this hobbling sprint of development.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087316\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://db79.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db8059b0ce0b3cf393f4de0ad7af758f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://db79.com\">Shawn Medero</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087316\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-07T11:01:11\">2006-11-07T11:01:11</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Great news Les!
