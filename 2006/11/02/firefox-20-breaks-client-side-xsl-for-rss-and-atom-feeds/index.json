A processing instruction is probably already in place but is simply being ignored by the browsers in question. The behaviour of the browsers should IMHO be to (1) either handle processing-instructions if they exist, (2) check the content-type (mime) of the document and unless application/rss+xml handle it as xml. I think that's the only approach that matches the specifications and the real world.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083681\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083681\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-12T01:48:52\">2006-11-12T01:48:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>That’s fine in theory.</p>\n<p>In practice, aggregators tend not to care about the MIME type of feeds, so most feeds today are served as <code>text/html</code>. (Yes, you read that right. A whole lot of the rest are served as <code>text/plain</code>.) The same is true of images and videos, btw. There is no way to avoid content sniffing.</p>\n<p>The ideal approach would have been to honour the PI <em>only</em> if the feed is served as <code>text/xml</code> or <code>application/xml</code>, eg. explicitly as generic XML rather than as a feed. In case of sniffed feeds or feeds served with the proper MIME type, the PI would be ignored (as client apps are free to do; they are under no obligation to honour the PI), but authors would still have a clean and obvious option for getting what they want.</p>\n<p>Except that RSS 2.0 does not have a MIME type and is therefore served as <code>text/xml</code> or <code>application/xml</code>.</p>\n<p>This is what happens when people who have no clue of how the web works come up with things to put on the web: you end up with no good way of implementing their crud.</p>\n<p>The only thing I can think of that could have been better than what we have now would be to specify a new PI to explicitly disable the default feed view. (Although I’d want to have maybe add a yellow strip that lets me disable the custom view or something like that; withholding from the reader the ability to be the ultimate arbiter of his own experience is Wrong.)</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083684\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://starling.us/atom/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8b09a229fac82b3a6b7b61e0db95408c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://starling.us/atom/\">Gan Uesli Starling</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083684\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-02-22T10:22:23\">2007-02-22T10:22:23</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Yes, this is MOST annoying. I had put off writing a feed waiting until the formats should settle out. I ended up delaying first until Atom 1.0, and then longer yet until I should have some free time...until just a couple of weeks ago. Then, working in Firefox 1.5.0.1 I blissfully labored over an XSLT to go with it. Spent quite a while at that. Only when I have it working pretty much as desired do I bother to check it at work in IE7...and ARGHHH!...all my time and effort wasted.</p>\n<p>And oh, by the way, I had also written a howto for Atom 1.0...and XSLT. So I search GOOGLE high and low until I find someone who writes of how to turn the feature off in IE7...and ammend my howto for that instruction. Now I must do so for Firefox 2.0...and Safari...it seems. Alas and alack.</p>\n<p>How about Opera? I recall from some years back that Opera was among the first and best of early adopters for XSLT. It looks as if my howto for Atom 1.0 and XSLT is going to be largely composed of workarounds for this mis-feature.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083688\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=916cc61b7337d47614cfb29b3f593e9d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jeff Wilkinson</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083688\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-14T20:29:34\">2007-03-14T20:29:34</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>what a pain.  fixing this will definitely get my vote.

(Yes, you read that right. A whole lot of the rest are served as <code>text/plain</code>.) The same is true of images and videos, btw. There is no way to avoid content sniffing.</p>\n\n<p>The ideal approach would have been to honour the PI <em>only</em> if the feed is served as <code>text/xml</code> or <code>application/xml</code>, eg. explicitly as generic XML rather than as a feed. In case of sniffed feeds or feeds served with the proper MIME type, the PI would be ignored (as client apps are free to do; they are under no obligation to honour the PI), but authors would still have a clean and obvious option for getting what they want.</p>\n\n<p>Except that RSS 2.0 does not have a MIME type and is therefore served as <code>text/xml</code> or <code>application/xml</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This is what happens when people who have no clue of how the web works come up with things to put on the web: you end up with no good way of implementing their crud.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing I can think of that could have been better than what we have now would be to specify a new PI to explicitly disable the default feed view. (Although I’d want to have maybe add a yellow strip that lets me disable the custom view or something like that; withholding from the reader the ability to be the ultimate arbiter of his own experience is Wrong.)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083684\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://starling.us/atom/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8b09a229fac82b3a6b7b61e0db95408c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://starling.us/atom/\">Gan Uesli Starling</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083684\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-02-22T10:22:23\">2007-02-22T10:22:23</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Yes, this is MOST annoying. I had put off writing a feed waiting until the formats should settle out.

Then, working in Firefox 1.5.0.1 I blissfully labored over an XSLT to go with it. Spent quite a while at that. Only when I have it working pretty much as desired do I bother to check it at work in IE7...and ARGHHH!...all my time and effort wasted.</p>\n\n<p>And oh, by the way, I had also written a howto for Atom 1.0...and XSLT. So I search GOOGLE high and low until I find someone who writes of how to turn the feature off in IE7...and ammend my howto for that instruction. Now I must do so for Firefox 2.0...and Safari...it seems. Alas and alack.</p>\n\n<p>How about Opera? I recall from some years back that Opera was among the first and best of early adopters for XSLT. It looks as if my howto for Atom 1.0 and XSLT is going to be largely composed of workarounds for this mis-feature.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083688\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=916cc61b7337d47614cfb29b3f593e9d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Jeff Wilkinson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083688\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-14T20:29:34\">2007-03-14T20:29:34</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>what a pain.  fixing this will definitely get my vote.
