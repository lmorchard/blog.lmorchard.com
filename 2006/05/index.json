And, there's one conclusion to which I've come, which is yet half-formed but I think interesting to admit and explore.</p>\n <p>You see, the realization to which I've come is that - in the realm of recreational programming, at least - I could be best described as a <i>serial enthusiast</i>.</p>\n <p>What's that mean?  Well, just look at my history throughout the archives of this blog.  I've flitted from nano-project to nano-project, a hack here and a hack there.  But, other than in projects where someone's expecting something from me and (preferrably) paying me - I have a very fickle attention span.  If you hire me, or have me sign a contract, I'll stick to schedule and deliver as best I can - no worries about that.  When I'm in \"professional mode,\" I run on different premises and motivations.  But, left to my own devices, I will freewheel and wander between a slew of part-time obsessions.</p>\n <p>Of course, on frequent occassion, I return to the themes and constructions I've visited in the past.  This has the effect of a sort of sustained, incremental development of my nano-projects, well distributed across time.  I drive myself through development sprints, but never quite finish complete products.  I share the code, in whatever state I've left it, in the hopes that someone might find it useful - but very rarely do I wrap things up with a bow.</p>\n <p>This is <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/03/11/Recreational-Programming\"><i>recreational programming</i></a>.  I enjoy the process much more than I do the results.  This is why I have no particular worries about under what license I release my work.  Go right ahead: <b>Share and Enjoy</b> my Sudoku puzzle solutions, because I'm done with them.  After all, were I ever to finish something useful, I might get sucked into it and anchored down to supporting it when my interest has faded - and that's no fun, unless there's another source of reward available for continuing the work.</p>\n <p>And this is why I think that so far - unless I find something of particular lasting interest or work on modifying my habits - I'll never be a successful entrepreneur on my own.  I've got ideas and skills, sure - but I need a partner, or a manager, to keep me and everything else to a coherent and sustained path.  I've got energy and I've got creativity, but I need others as <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/mind/stories/s1391503.htm\">social prosthetics</a> to herd me and my mental cats.</p>\n <p>So what's my point in all of this?  Mostly just writing to think this notion through.  I'm sure this isn't a terribly original self-discovery, but it's one that I wanted to admit and elaborate so that I can at least explain myself to myself and work with it.  And, having said all that, I thought that there just might be some others freewheeling around out there with whom the phrase \"serial enthusiast\" might hold some meaning, too.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082616\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://xmlhacker.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5159227f15ff6247f88542812f866c4f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://xmlhacker.com\">M.

I joined the club about 3 years ago.  If you need any help finding your way around, let me know... I've come to know these parts quite well now, so if I can be of assistance, by all means, please let me know. :D</p>\n<p>BTW...  Isn't it a refreshing moment when you finally give into the notion of letting go of the idea that you have to push yourself a certain direction, or commit to being a certain way, just to feel like you are something the world would like you to be, yet nothing you want to be?</p>\n<p>I know it was for me, and the result, as it turns out, has been marvelous!  Over the course of the last three years I have developed friendships, and relationships with folks of which each contained a quality I didn't have, yet our personalities and overall hacking habits were for all intents and purposes, the same thing...  Not completely, but just enough of the same thing to help in understanding that youre not alone in this, yet just enough difference to garner the admiration and respect that we tend to develop for our hacking brothers and sisters who have developed a fairly specialized skill that fits nicely into filling an area in which needs filling in regards to a long term brainstorm-based project, in which the project itself has a general purpose, yet no immediatelly clear definition as to where the proper focus needs to be place.</p>\n<p>Recently, a group of folks I have been working with in various degress for the last 2+ years finally brought together some of the final pieces of a project we all have had interest in, and things are finally taking the final shape, of which consists of a base of clay we have all spent the last 2 years throwing into a general pile, various pieces here and there which somehow just kind of spontaneously began to take shape about 2 weeks ago.</p>\n<p>It seems as if this is the way it happens.  Its all about timing, and not forcing anything that doesnt need to be forced.  It just nees to be left alone until it happens.</p>\n<p>And it will.  I promise :)</p>\n<p>If ever you find you'd like to hear what our little hackers anonymous chapter is up to, my contact info is collected above.  As such, you know where to find me if you find interest in hearing more about the various projects we're working on.  But its of no major significance.  Your obviously and AMAZING talent, and it seems could use that talent to have quite a bit of fun with some of the projects we are developing.  But to truly understand the mentality of a hacker, you need to be a hacker yourself.  When you are, you understand by nature that nothing can be forced... you just have to let it happen. :)</p>\n<p>Enjoy your day!  And again...  Welcome :)  Your in REALLY GOOD COMPANY (I'm not suggesting that in regards to me directly, and instead to our overall \"meme genre\".  Us hackers are all this way... just in slightly different areas of specialyt :)</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!  And congratulations on your wedding!</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082618\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dannyayers.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7028f422ca6da0180de6c9d922a3228f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dannyayers.com\">Danny</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082618\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-27T11:29:25\">2006-05-27T11:29:25</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Thanks for posting this (from everyone with a trail of unfinished projects :-) Is there such a thing as an Angel Organiser?

When enthusiasm hits it's like a drug to the system and the barin wants more and more... eventually the rush of discovery pales and you seek new a new stimulus.</p>\n<p>You have all the ear marks of a great Hacker by Paul Graham's definition: curiosity, intelligence, a love for programming as an art...  There are millions more out there of lessor skill and output. You should be justifiably proud of your output... a good business person could lure you into making some money from your passionate desire to build new things... you could have underlings that finish the detail work.</p>\n<p>James Gosling, Bill Joy, and dozens of others all had this approach to programming... hack out something new and interesting (java, NeWS, xemacs) and NFS repsectively. Hackers change the world... and sometimes they just invent. Business people turn it to wealth.</p>\n<p>Someone should start a \"Hacker Labs\" that does Internet R&amp;D and sells off these half baked projects for commericalization and a piece of the action... they would need to emerge as \"web services\" since I don't think people buy software any longer.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082621\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082621\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-02T14:47:12\">2006-06-02T14:47:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>McD:  Yeah, from some self-observation over the years, I can definitely tell it's a chemistry thing.  For me, there's a rush attached to novelty, discovery, and a clean solution to a problem.  The rush wanes over sustained effort on the same thing.  I'm pretty sure it follows all the other familiar response curves in brain chemistry.  This can be mitigated by other factors, like a paycheck or someone's foot-tapping expectations - but when it's just me playing, I'm a freewheeling junkie.  :)</p>\n<p>But as for the rest of what you wrote - man, are you trying to inflate my head?  Your compliments embarass me.

I usually have 20-30 open tabs given the opportunity to just search the web, as its easy to find implementations of my many ideas. i have my own projects, true, and I love to spend my free time on them. i'm personally worried as a computer science about being in situations where the novelty wears off, but I guess that's what free time is for.

When I had children, I read lots of books about being a mother/childraising.  When I was a computer programmer, I read a lot about the art of programming.  When I worked for a training department, I read a of books about how to train.

I'm pretty sure it follows all the other familiar response curves in brain chemistry.

I think that's something on my TODO list as a per-feed and an overall config option...  not too hard to do - since it's just swapping one CSS class name for another in the feed's on page UL/LI element - but not an option yet.</p>\n<p>As for the open source thing...  Actually, at this point, the whole OPML Editor and NewsRiver rig is open source from end to end.  You can get the Frontier source from the OSS project, which builds as the OPML Editor with a switch in XCode on OS X - I think the Windows situation is similar.  And, the source of NewsRiver is perusable from within the OPML Editor itself.</p>\n<p>But as for mentality, no Dave hasn't really done the whole SourceForge, mailing list, OSS team thing for his projects like newsRiver.  I don't figure he relishes the annoyances and tip-toeing around egos that'd take, versus just noodling on his neat projects.  It's not too hard for me to build something like decafbadNewsRiver independently from his work, though, which is very nice and actually facilitated by how he's built things.</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

I also accidentally trigger OPML Editor's macros in item titles that have double quotes.</p>\n\n<p>Not sure what you mean about the closed widget - like, have the items under a feed rolled up and hidden by default?  I think that's something on my TODO list as a per-feed and an overall config option...  not too hard to do - since it's just swapping one CSS class name for another in the feed's on page UL/LI element - but not an option yet.</p>\n\n<p>As for the open source thing...  Actually, at this point, the whole OPML Editor and NewsRiver rig is open source from end to end.  You can get the Frontier source from the OSS project, which builds as the OPML Editor with a switch in XCode on OS X - I think the Windows situation is similar.  And, the source of NewsRiver is perusable from within the OPML Editor itself.</p>\n\n<p>But as for mentality, no Dave hasn't really done the whole SourceForge, mailing list, OSS team thing for his projects like newsRiver.  I don't figure he relishes the annoyances and tip-toeing around egos that'd take, versus just noodling on his neat projects.  It's not too hard for me to build something like decafbadNewsRiver independently from his work, though, which is very nice and actually facilitated by how he's built things.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

Before the wipe, I had firewall rules which forwarded port 80 to a web server on my home LAN behind the router.</p>\n <p>The nice part was that I could access that server both from outside and inside the LAN, using the external WAN IP.  I've got scraped RSS feeds and other HTTP accessible bits that I access from my laptop.  This laptop travels between work and coffee shop and home.  I like being able to subscribe to and point at these things by URLs that don't change.</p>\n <p>But now, after the wipe, I've got firewall rules which open the WAN port to the home LAN for access from outside - but not from inside.  I've lost the old rules, and the knowledge I had that let me build the rules has since paged out of my brain and been lost to the ether.</p>\n <p>I suppose I could try building a VPN to home again - or use some SSH port tunneling - but I'd really like to get this port forwarding working again.

In other words, it runs as a DNS cache from whatever your external DNS is, and then can inject any custom entries you want. Then configure DHCP or any internal static IP boxes to point at the router as a DNS server. Then you can setup overriding rules for any DNS entries that refer to your home external IP.</p>\n<p>You also stated you access it via your \"external IP\" - are you not using a dynamic DNS service like DynDNS to give your home an external domain? You could even then use a real DNS provider to make a nicer domain (say a subdomain of your website) be a CNAME pointing at the DynDNS entry. m0n0wall and many other routers also have <a href=\"http://img.m0n0.ch/screens/services_dyndns.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">DynDNS clients</a> built in. Who needs static IPs? You certainly don't if all you need is web and ssh access.</p>\n<p>So for example, I may have an internal web server running at 192.168.1.10, with my external IP being 1.2.3.4. So I have home.cafgood.com as a CNAME pointing at cafgood.dyndns.com which gets automatically set to resolve to my external home IP (1.2.3.4).

    "body": " <p>Nothing like firewall rules to make me feel like a moron.  I recently wiped and reinstalled <a href=\"http://openwrt.org/\">OpenWRT</a> on my WRT54G router.  Before the wipe, I had firewall rules which forwarded port 80 to a web server on my home LAN behind the router.</p>\r\n <p>The nice part was that I could access that server both from outside and inside the LAN, using the external WAN IP.  I've got scraped RSS feeds and other HTTP accessible bits that I access from my laptop.  This laptop travels between work and coffee shop and home.  I like being able to subscribe to and point at these things by URLs that don't change.</p>\r\n <p>But now, after the wipe, I've got firewall rules which open the WAN port to the home LAN for access from outside - but not from inside.  I've lost the old rules, and the knowledge I had that let me build the rules has since paged out of my brain and been lost to the ether.</p>\r\n <p>I suppose I could try building a VPN to home again - or use some SSH port tunneling - but I'd really like to get this port forwarding working again.

In other words, it runs as a DNS cache from whatever your external DNS is, and then can inject any custom entries you want. Then configure DHCP or any internal static IP boxes to point at the router as a DNS server. Then you can setup overriding rules for any DNS entries that refer to your home external IP.</p>\n\n<p>You also stated you access it via your \"external IP\" - are you not using a dynamic DNS service like DynDNS to give your home an external domain? You could even then use a real DNS provider to make a nicer domain (say a subdomain of your website) be a CNAME pointing at the DynDNS entry. m0n0wall and many other routers also have <a href=\"http://img.m0n0.ch/screens/services_dyndns.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">DynDNS clients</a> built in. Who needs static IPs? You certainly don't if all you need is web and ssh access.</p>\n\n<p>So for example, I may have an internal web server running at 192.168.1.10, with my external IP being 1.2.3.4. So I have home.cafgood.com as a CNAME pointing at cafgood.dyndns.com which gets automatically set to resolve to my external home IP (1.2.3.4). On my router, I then say home.cafgood.com equals the internal IP (192.168.1.10). From the outside, I would hit real DNS servers, get CNAME-pointed to DynDNS servers, which would point me at my external IP, and NAT points at the web server. From the inside, the overridden DNS forwarder would just point any internal request right at the web server.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086489\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086489\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-10T15:58:22\">2006-05-10T15:58:22</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Okay, addendum summary:  I'm already using DynDNS to point at my home address, my external IP.

    "html": " <p>I've just read blog posts from <a href=\"http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2006/05/on_wanting_to_stop_wanting_world_of_warcraft.shtml\">Tom Coates</a> and <a href=\"http://rc3.org/2006/05/the_grim_time_s.php\">Rafe Colburn</a> talking about time spent playing World of Warcraft that might have been better spent on more worthwhile pursuits - such as writing, hacking, reading, getting outside, etc.</p>\n <p>Well, the first thing I have to say is that there's nothing inherently wrong with WoW.  One of my best friends spends most nights in the world, along with his sweetie and the occasional get together with nephews and friends.  It seems to me that he doesn't feel the compulsion to do anything in particular after work, beyond enjoying his time - and this is something he enjoys and provides something quite a bit more like a social life than television.</p>\n <p>Imagine not being a workaholic - I find it difficult, how about you?</p>\n <p>I tend to tell people that I'm lucky not to have a machine decent enough to run WoW.  I've got plenty of hardware capable of doing all manner of web development and tinkering tasks, but none with the muscle to run a modern 3-D game.  I have played WoW, however, on a friend's computer and a borrowed account.  It's certainly fun, and I'd play it again, but I didn't really feel an irresistible gravity of addiction.  No, what was starting to draw my interest is that <a href=\"http://www.wowwiki.com/World_of_Warcraft_API\">the game client has an API</a> and is <a href=\"http://www.wowwiki.com/Lua\">scriptable in Lua</a>.</p>\n <p>That's when I return to a notion that occurred to me a few years ago:  That is, hacking is my EverQuest.  I swear I blogged about it, but I can't find the post.  So, to refresh the idea - <em>Hacking is my WoW</em>.

    "body": " <p>I've just read blog posts from <a href=\"http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2006/05/on_wanting_to_stop_wanting_world_of_warcraft.shtml\">Tom Coates</a> and <a href=\"http://rc3.org/2006/05/the_grim_time_s.php\">Rafe Colburn</a> talking about time spent playing World of Warcraft that might have been better spent on more worthwhile pursuits - such as writing, hacking, reading, getting outside, etc.</p>\r\n <p>Well, the first thing I have to say is that there's nothing inherently wrong with WoW.  One of my best friends spends most nights in the world, along with his sweetie and the occasional get together with nephews and friends.  It seems to me that he doesn't feel the compulsion to do anything in particular after work, beyond enjoying his time - and this is something he enjoys and provides something quite a bit more like a social life than television.</p>\r\n <p>Imagine not being a workaholic - I find it difficult, how about you?</p>\r\n <p>I tend to tell people that I'm lucky not to have a machine decent enough to run WoW.  I've got plenty of hardware capable of doing all manner of web development and tinkering tasks, but none with the muscle to run a modern 3-D game.  I have played WoW, however, on a friend's computer and a borrowed account.  It's certainly fun, and I'd play it again, but I didn't really feel an irresistible gravity of addiction.  No, what was starting to draw my interest is that <a href=\"http://www.wowwiki.com/World_of_Warcraft_API\">the game client has an API</a> and is <a href=\"http://www.wowwiki.com/Lua\">scriptable in Lua</a>.</p>\r\n <p>That's when I return to a notion that occurred to me a few years ago:  That is, hacking is my EverQuest.  I swear I blogged about it, but I can't find the post.  So, to refresh the idea - <em>Hacking is my WoW</em>.  My friend's got a gnome with a monocle; I've got <a href=\"http://mailman.us.netrek.org/pipermail/netrek-dev/2006-March/002859.html\">a Linksys WRT54G router that runs Netrek</a>.

    "html": " <p>If you've yet to check out <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">the new Inform 7</a>, \"A Design System for Interactive Fiction Based on Natural Language,\" you really need to do so.</p>\n <p>Back when I was a wee lad with access to an assortment of Commodore 64, Apple ][, and Atari 800 computers, text adventures pretty much had me in their thrall.  I loved to play them, getting lost for hours in all that Infocom and others had to offer.  I also loved to write them - if only for myself, with rooms plotted out on green-lined gridpaper and engines implemented in clumsy BASIC and LOGO.</p>\n <p>Since then, I've returned now and then to see what's going on in that world.  In the intervening years, the whole field has reinvented itself as \"interactive fiction,\" and hobbyists have reverse engineered a number of classic game engines.  They've picked up where defunct companies left off and pursued even further development.</p>\n <p>I've not gone back to write any further adventures of my own, though I've peeked in at the authoring tools from time to time.  For the most part, things seemed just obscure and weird-edged enough to leave me thinking I might better spend my time learning more about Python or even Lisp.  I've played some of these modern games over the years, though, and there's quite a bit of great writing talent at work out there.</p>\n <p>But now, this: <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">Inform 7</a>.  This is a world-building environment built by and for writers.  The truth of this is embedded in every facet of it - from the mind-bogglingly cool natural language in which worlds can be described, to the painstakingly elaborated documentation, to the <b>fully narrated and apologized-for error messages</b>.</p>\n <p>In sharp contrast to my past toe-dippings into interactive fiction authoring - and even MOO / MUD citizenship - this system <i>compells</i> me to use it.  It makes me want to write stories and describe worlds.</p>\n <p>And, most amazing of all:  This is <del>Open Source software</del> <ins>not commercially developed software</ins>.  (Update: Turns out it's not totally Open Source, but it's beer-free at least.)</p>\n <p>Of course, I've found great annoyance in the past with languages like AppleScript and Lingo - both of which <i>attempt</i> to follow some sort of natural language patterns, yet only result mockeries of all language.  I haven't dug deep enough into <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">Inform 7</a> to tell if I'll reach this same point of frustration.  So far, though, it seems promising from the little I've thrown together in a morning's coffee and in the examples I've browsed at lunch.</p>\n <p>Maybe one of these stories in my head will find it's way out this way.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089025\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a0b347907bfaf05694805210ec595d6c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Martin Atkins</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089025\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-01T19:11:03\">2006-05-01T19:11:03</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>One interesting side-effect of it being based on English is that it presumably makes it harder to use for someone who is attempting to write a story in another language.

Yes. You drop down into I6 by surrounding your I6 code with \"(-\" and \"-)\".</p>\n<p><code>To end the game in death: (- deadflag=1; -).</code></p>  \n<p>You can use small snippets of I6 code, as above, or include entire routines. This can be useful for programming tasks that are much more easily handled in a procedural language such as I6.</p>\n<p>The drawback to doing so is a loss of readability: much as when you embed assembly directives in C, you now need to understand two very different languages. You can encapsulate I6 code and give it a natural-language form; in fact, parts of the I7 standard library do just that.</p>\n</blockquote></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089036\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=85232f8499fd6ee91623408fc23835d1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\">Matt Brubeck</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089036\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-02T19:33:46\">2006-05-02T19:33:46</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Strictly speaking, this isn't (all) Open Source software:  While the source code to the GUI is under the GPL, the source code to the compiler will be available only under a \"look but don't touch\" license (same as Inform 6).

    "body": " <p>If you've yet to check out <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">the new Inform 7</a>, \"A Design System for Interactive Fiction Based on Natural Language,\" you really need to do so.</p>\r\n <p>Back when I was a wee lad with access to an assortment of Commodore 64, Apple ][, and Atari 800 computers, text adventures pretty much had me in their thrall.  I loved to play them, getting lost for hours in all that Infocom and others had to offer.  I also loved to write them - if only for myself, with rooms plotted out on green-lined gridpaper and engines implemented in clumsy BASIC and LOGO.</p>\r\n <p>Since then, I've returned now and then to see what's going on in that world.  In the intervening years, the whole field has reinvented itself as \"interactive fiction,\" and hobbyists have reverse engineered a number of classic game engines.  They've picked up where defunct companies left off and pursued even further development.</p>\r\n <p>I've not gone back to write any further adventures of my own, though I've peeked in at the authoring tools from time to time.  For the most part, things seemed just obscure and weird-edged enough to leave me thinking I might better spend my time learning more about Python or even Lisp.  I've played some of these modern games over the years, though, and there's quite a bit of great writing talent at work out there.</p>\r\n <p>But now, this: <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">Inform 7</a>.  This is a world-building environment built by and for writers.  The truth of this is embedded in every facet of it - from the mind-bogglingly cool natural language in which worlds can be described, to the painstakingly elaborated documentation, to the <b>fully narrated and apologized-for error messages</b>.</p>\r\n <p>In sharp contrast to my past toe-dippings into interactive fiction authoring - and even MOO / MUD citizenship - this system <i>compells</i> me to use it.  It makes me want to write stories and describe worlds.</p>\r\n <p>And, most amazing of all:  This is <del>Open Source software</del> <ins>not commercially developed software</ins>.  (Update: Turns out it's not totally Open Source, but it's beer-free at least.)</p>\r\n <p>Of course, I've found great annoyance in the past with languages like AppleScript and Lingo - both of which <i>attempt</i> to follow some sort of natural language patterns, yet only result mockeries of all language.  I haven't dug deep enough into <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">Inform 7</a> to tell if I'll reach this same point of frustration.  So far, though, it seems promising from the little I've thrown together in a morning's coffee and in the examples I've browsed at lunch.</p>\r\n <p>Maybe one of these stories in my head will find it's way out this way.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089025\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a0b347907bfaf05694805210ec595d6c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Martin Atkins</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089025\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-01T19:11:03\">2006-05-01T19:11:03</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>One interesting side-effect of it being based on English is that it presumably makes it harder to use for someone who is attempting to write a story in another language.

Yes. You drop down into I6 by surrounding your I6 code with \"(-\" and \"-)\".</p>\r\n    <p><code>To end the game in death: (- deadflag=1; -).</code></p>  \r\n  <p>You can use small snippets of I6 code, as above, or include entire routines. This can be useful for programming tasks that are much more easily handled in a procedural language such as I6.</p>\r\n  <p>The drawback to doing so is a loss of readability: much as when you embed assembly directives in C, you now need to understand two very different languages. You can encapsulate I6 code and give it a natural-language form; in fact, parts of the I7 standard library do just that.</p>\r\n  </blockquote></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089036\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=85232f8499fd6ee91623408fc23835d1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\">Matt Brubeck</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089036\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-02T19:33:46\">2006-05-02T19:33:46</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Strictly speaking, this isn't (all) Open Source software:  While the source code to the GUI is under the GPL, the source code to the compiler will be available only under a \"look but don't touch\" license (same as Inform 6).
