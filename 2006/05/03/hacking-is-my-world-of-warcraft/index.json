I have played WoW, however, on a friend's computer and a borrowed account.  It's certainly fun, and I'd play it again, but I didn't really feel an irresistible gravity of addiction.  No, what was starting to draw my interest is that <a href=\"http://www.wowwiki.com/World_of_Warcraft_API\">the game client has an API</a> and is <a href=\"http://www.wowwiki.com/Lua\">scriptable in Lua</a>.</p>\n <p>That's when I return to a notion that occurred to me a few years ago:  That is, hacking is my EverQuest.

My friend's got a gnome with a monocle; I've got <a href=\"http://mailman.us.netrek.org/pipermail/netrek-dev/2006-March/002859.html\">a Linksys WRT54G router that runs Netrek</a>.  The gnome's nicer to look at, though.</p>\n <p>On one hand, my compulsion to hack and learn has rewarded me professionally and around the internets.
