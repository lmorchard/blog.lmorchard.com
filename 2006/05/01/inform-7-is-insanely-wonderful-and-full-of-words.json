I loved to play them, getting lost for hours in all that Infocom and others had to offer.  I also loved to write them - if only for myself, with rooms plotted out on green-lined gridpaper and engines implemented in clumsy BASIC and LOGO.</p>\n <p>Since then, I&#39;ve returned now and then to see what&#39;s going on in that world.  In the intervening years, the whole field has reinvented itself as &quot;interactive fiction,&quot; and hobbyists have reverse engineered a number of classic game engines.  They&#39;ve picked up where defunct companies left off and pursued even further development.</p>\n <p>I&#39;ve not gone back to write any further adventures of my own, though I&#39;ve peeked in at the authoring tools from time to time.  For the most part, things seemed just obscure and weird-edged enough to leave me thinking I might better spend my time learning more about Python or even Lisp.  I&#39;ve played some of these modern games over the years, though, and there&#39;s quite a bit of great writing talent at work out there.</p>\n <p>But now, this: <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">Inform 7</a>.  This is a world-building environment built by and for writers.  The truth of this is embedded in every facet of it - from the mind-bogglingly cool natural language in which worlds can be described, to the painstakingly elaborated documentation, to the <b>fully narrated and apologized-for error messages</b>.</p>\n <p>In sharp contrast to my past toe-dippings into interactive fiction authoring - and even MOO / MUD citizenship - this system <i>compells</i> me to use it.  It makes me want to write stories and describe worlds.</p>\n <p>And, most amazing of all:  This is <del>Open Source software</del> <ins>not commercially developed software</ins>.  (Update: Turns out it&#39;s not totally Open Source, but it&#39;s beer-free at least.)</p>\n <p>Of course, I&#39;ve found great annoyance in the past with languages like AppleScript and Lingo - both of which <i>attempt</i> to follow some sort of natural language patterns, yet only result mockeries of all language.  I haven&#39;t dug deep enough into <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">Inform 7</a> to tell if I&#39;ll reach this same point of frustration.  So far, though, it seems promising from the little I&#39;ve thrown together in a morning&#39;s coffee and in the examples I&#39;ve browsed at lunch.</p>\n <p>Maybe one of these stories in my head will find it&#39;s way out this way.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089025\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a0b347907bfaf05694805210ec595d6c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Martin Atkins</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089025\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-01T19:11:03\">2006-05-01T19:11:03</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>One interesting side-effect of it being based on English is that it presumably makes it harder to use for someone who is attempting to write a story in another language.

Yes. You drop down into I6 by surrounding your I6 code with &quot;(-&quot; and &quot;-)&quot;.</p>\n    <p><code>To end the game in death: (- deadflag=1; -).</code></p><br>  <p>You can use small snippets of I6 code, as above, or include entire routines. This can be useful for programming tasks that are much more easily handled in a procedural language such as I6.</p>\n  <p>The drawback to doing so is a loss of readability: much as when you embed assembly directives in C, you now need to understand two very different languages. You can encapsulate I6 code and give it a natural-language form; in fact, parts of the I7 standard library do just that.</p>\n  </blockquote></div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221089036&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=85232f8499fd6ee91623408fc23835d1&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/&quot;&gt;Matt Brubeck&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221089036&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2006-05-02T19:33:46&quot;&gt;2006-05-02T19:33:46&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, this isn&#39;t (all) Open Source software:  While the source code to the GUI is under the GPL, the source code to the compiler will be available only under a &quot;look but don&#39;t touch&quot; license (same as Inform 6).
