  "html": " <p>If you've yet to check out <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">the new Inform 7</a>, \"A Design System for Interactive Fiction Based on Natural Language,\" you really need to do so.</p>\n <p>Back when I was a wee lad with access to an assortment of Commodore 64, Apple ][, and Atari 800 computers, text adventures pretty much had me in their thrall.  I loved to play them, getting lost for hours in all that Infocom and others had to offer.  I also loved to write them - if only for myself, with rooms plotted out on green-lined gridpaper and engines implemented in clumsy BASIC and LOGO.</p>\n <p>Since then, I've returned now and then to see what's going on in that world.  In the intervening years, the whole field has reinvented itself as \"interactive fiction,\" and hobbyists have reverse engineered a number of classic game engines.  They've picked up where defunct companies left off and pursued even further development.</p>\n <p>I've not gone back to write any further adventures of my own, though I've peeked in at the authoring tools from time to time.  For the most part, things seemed just obscure and weird-edged enough to leave me thinking I might better spend my time learning more about Python or even Lisp.  I've played some of these modern games over the years, though, and there's quite a bit of great writing talent at work out there.</p>\n <p>But now, this: <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">Inform 7</a>.  This is a world-building environment built by and for writers.  The truth of this is embedded in every facet of it - from the mind-bogglingly cool natural language in which worlds can be described, to the painstakingly elaborated documentation, to the <b>fully narrated and apologized-for error messages</b>.</p>\n <p>In sharp contrast to my past toe-dippings into interactive fiction authoring - and even MOO / MUD citizenship - this system <i>compells</i> me to use it.  It makes me want to write stories and describe worlds.</p>\n <p>And, most amazing of all:  This is <del>Open Source software</del> <ins>not commercially developed software</ins>.  (Update: Turns out it's not totally Open Source, but it's beer-free at least.)</p>\n <p>Of course, I've found great annoyance in the past with languages like AppleScript and Lingo - both of which <i>attempt</i> to follow some sort of natural language patterns, yet only result mockeries of all language.  I haven't dug deep enough into <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">Inform 7</a> to tell if I'll reach this same point of frustration.  So far, though, it seems promising from the little I've thrown together in a morning's coffee and in the examples I've browsed at lunch.</p>\n <p>Maybe one of these stories in my head will find it's way out this way.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089025\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a0b347907bfaf05694805210ec595d6c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Martin Atkins</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089025\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-01T19:11:03\">2006-05-01T19:11:03</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>One interesting side-effect of it being based on English is that it presumably makes it harder to use for someone who is attempting to write a story in another language.

Yes. You drop down into I6 by surrounding your I6 code with \"(-\" and \"-)\".</p>\n<p><code>To end the game in death: (- deadflag=1; -).</code></p>  \n<p>You can use small snippets of I6 code, as above, or include entire routines. This can be useful for programming tasks that are much more easily handled in a procedural language such as I6.</p>\n<p>The drawback to doing so is a loss of readability: much as when you embed assembly directives in C, you now need to understand two very different languages. You can encapsulate I6 code and give it a natural-language form; in fact, parts of the I7 standard library do just that.</p>\n</blockquote></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089036\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=85232f8499fd6ee91623408fc23835d1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\">Matt Brubeck</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089036\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-02T19:33:46\">2006-05-02T19:33:46</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Strictly speaking, this isn't (all) Open Source software:  While the source code to the GUI is under the GPL, the source code to the compiler will be available only under a \"look but don't touch\" license (same as Inform 6).

I'm a programmer. And I don't mean a mouse-oriented, Eclipse IDE-loving programmer.

I very much want to try it. I hope at some point non-IDE programmers can have access to the tools to compile this new language.</p>\n<p></p><p>I'm really blown away by what these guys, Mr. Nelson, Emily Short and everyone else, have done here.

Yes. You drop down into I6 by surrounding your I6 code with \"(-\" and \"-)\".</p>\r\n    <p><code>To end the game in death: (- deadflag=1; -).</code></p>  \r\n  <p>You can use small snippets of I6 code, as above, or include entire routines. This can be useful for programming tasks that are much more easily handled in a procedural language such as I6.</p>\r\n  <p>The drawback to doing so is a loss of readability: much as when you embed assembly directives in C, you now need to understand two very different languages. You can encapsulate I6 code and give it a natural-language form; in fact, parts of the I7 standard library do just that.</p>\r\n  </blockquote></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089036\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=85232f8499fd6ee91623408fc23835d1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\">Matt Brubeck</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089036\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-02T19:33:46\">2006-05-02T19:33:46</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Strictly speaking, this isn't (all) Open Source software:  While the source code to the GUI is under the GPL, the source code to the compiler will be available only under a \"look but don't touch\" license (same as Inform 6).

I'm a programmer. And I don't mean a mouse-oriented, Eclipse IDE-loving programmer. I mean a vi, makefile, command-shell programmer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p><p>So, if I can't use my text editor and can't build binaries from source with the command line (as you would with make), then I can't use it.
