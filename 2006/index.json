This used a JSON decode written in ActionScript grabbed from JSON.org, plus a JSON encoder written in C# (it did not take long to write because I  did not attempt to serialize arbitrary objects).  Some gratuitous URL-encoding was also involved. Compared with passing the same data structure via URL-encoded XML to be picked apart by ActionScript's DOM support, it was easy and much more like fun.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

    "html": "<p>You know you&#39;ve truly arrived in Silicon Valley when <a href=\"http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2006/12/the_new_and_tag.html\">the darling new feature you just helped launch</a> on <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">a Web 2.0 site</a> gets shredded in <a href=\"http://www.scripting.com/2006/12/20.html#godBlessTheReinventers\">a rant by Dave Winer</a>.  :)  </p>\n<p>My day, having started with me in a foul mood, has been made.  Pre-launch, the tooth marks in my tongue have gotten deep as I watch the <a href=\"http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/12/20/scripting-news-for-12202006/\">comments</a> pile up.  It&#39;s exciting to have so many people debating something you&#39;ve made.  (Update:  Seriously.  I&#39;m in a better mood now.  It&#39;s made me laugh.)</p>\n<p>Actually, it wasn&#39;t the <a href=\"http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2006/12/the_new_and_tag.html\">feature itself</a> that got shredded, so much as the <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/help/json/url\">new JSON data feed</a> revealed before the <a href=\"http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2006/12/the_new_and_tag.html\">intended star of the show</a> made it on-stage, by way of <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2006/12/preview_of_the.html\">a screencast preview on Y!DN by Matt McAlister</a> and <a href=\"http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/12/delicious-url-api.html\">an amplification by Niall Kennedy</a>.  </p>\n<p>The feed itself is mainly intended to power our new <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/help/tagometer\">Tagometer</a> page widget include thingy.  Beyond that, leaving the feed decoupled from the include itself made sense to me, both for our own flexibility&#39;s sake and as a nod toward our mashup friends in the blogosphere and lazyweb.</p>\n<p>You see, I like JSON.  It was convenient in this use case of creating a remote blog widget fed by cross-domain sourced data.  I, personally, didn&#39;t even have to <a href=\"http://www.scripting.com/2006/12/20.html#godBlessTheReinventers\">reinvent anything</a> that wasn&#39;t already implemented in <a href=\"http://json.org/\">assorted off-the-web tools</a>.  JSON worked for this purpose - it might not work for your purpose.  <strike>If it doesn&#39;t, please accept my insincere apology, but yours wasn&#39;t my primary goal.  Attempts to string me up for this travesty will be met with giggles and pointing.</strike>  (Update:  I realize I&#39;m not the to-be-strung-up party responsible for the JSON travesty - I just couldn&#39;t resist being a smart ass for its own sake.  I really do giggle and point a lot.  My <em>actual</em> apologies for that.)</p>\n<p>It&#39;s funny, laugh.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://del.icio.us/help/json/url\">JSON URL feed</a> is not really an API.  <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/help/json/url\">JSON URL feed</a> is not a bold declaration of side-taking in the grand war of web service specifications.

The smiley was neither ironic nor sarcastic.  Something big I helped launch has been stirring an interesting discussion, however tangential my blame in the making.  </p>\n<p>Vanity and Carly Simon aside, I know I'm not the main perpetrator of JSON.  I just couldn't resist an opportunity to be a smart ass.  For that I have a <em>sincere</em> apology.  I should probably strike it or delete it now that the giddiness of a major launch and a lot of attention has subsided.</p>\n<p>But seriously, what I meant above is not that this is <em>your</em> issue, per se.  This post is really more directed at some comments on your blog post, in bulk.  </p>\n<p>Our particular intentions behind using JSON here do not necessarily map to anyone else's expectation from a web service or standards-driven perspective.  It seems like a lot of people are looking at this JSON data since its early release, divorced from it's main consumer:  The Tagometer JS include.

    "body": "You know you've truly arrived in Silicon Valley when [the darling new feature you just helped launch][ta] on [a Web 2.0 site][del] gets shredded in [a rant by Dave Winer][dw].  :)  \r\n\r\nMy day, having started with me in a foul mood, has been made.  Pre-launch, the tooth marks in my tongue have gotten deep as I watch the [comments][com] pile up.  It's exciting to have so many people debating something you've made.  (Update:  Seriously.  I'm in a better mood now.  It's made me laugh.)\r\n\r\nActually, it wasn't the [feature itself][ta] that got shredded, so much as the [new JSON data feed][jf] revealed before the [intended star of the show][ta] made it on-stage, by way of [a screencast preview on Y!DN by Matt McAlister][mm] and [an amplification by Niall Kennedy][nk].  \r\n\r\nThe feed itself is mainly intended to power our new [Tagometer][ta2] page widget include thingy.  Beyond that, leaving the feed decoupled from the include itself made sense to me, both for our own flexibility's sake and as a nod toward our mashup friends in the blogosphere and lazyweb.\r\n\r\nYou see, I like JSON.  It was convenient in this use case of creating a remote blog widget fed by cross-domain sourced data.  I, personally, didn't even have to [reinvent anything][dw] that wasn't already implemented in [assorted off-the-web tools][json].  JSON worked for this purpose - it might not work for your purpose.  <strike>If it doesn't, please accept my insincere apology, but yours wasn't my primary goal.  Attempts to string me up for this travesty will be met with giggles and pointing.</strike>  (Update:  I realize I'm not the to-be-strung-up party responsible for the JSON travesty - I just couldn't resist being a smart ass for its own sake.  I really do giggle and point a lot.  My *actual* apologies for that.)\r\n\r\nIt's funny, laugh.\r\n\r\n[JSON URL feed][jf] is not really an API.  [JSON URL feed][jf] is not a bold declaration of side-taking in the grand war of web service specifications.  Do not base business models on [JSON URL feed][jf].  Caution: [JSON URL feed][jf] may suddenly accelerate to dangerous speeds or stop altogether.  [JSON URL feed][jf] contains a liquid core, which, if exposed due to rupture, should not be touched, inhaled, or looked at.  Ingredients of [JSON URL feed][jf] include an unknown glowing substance which fell to Earth, presumably from outer space.  If [JSON URL feed][jf] begins to smoke, get away immediately. Seek shelter and cover head.  \r\n\r\nDo not taunt [JSON URL feed][jf].\r\n\r\n[com]: http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/12/20/scripting-news-for-12202006/\r\n[json]: http://json.org/\r\n[mm]: http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2006/12/preview_of_the.html\r\n[nk]: http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/12/delicious-url-api.html\r\n[ta2]: http://del.icio.us/help/tagometer\r\n[jf]: http://del.icio.us/help/json/url\r\n[del]: http://del.icio.us/\r\n[ta]: http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2006/12/the_new_and_tag.html\r\n[dw]: http://www.scripting.com/2006/12/20.html#godBlessTheReinventers\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090833\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.scripting.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2378b474e8eadf5da80e86c2bbc75a74&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.scripting.com/\">Dave Winer</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090833\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-21T02:00:51\">2006-12-21T02:00:51</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Not sure if I helped your mood or made it worse, but the rant wasn't about you. </p>\n\n<p>http://www.json.org/xml.html</p>\n\n<p>Tell me what you think of that bit of hyperbole.

This relatively new AJAX pagination technique is pretty sweet, but better applied to data sets ordered by relevance and / or expected to be traversed in one direction.\r\n\r\nAlso, a note in general to other redesign teams:  Watch your entry points and don't break bookmarks unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n[tv]: http://yodel.yahoo.com/2006/11/28/anything-good-on-tonight/\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086909\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c19b0cb36d7f40d163e81b1be8da7622&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/\">Jeremy Zawodny</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086909\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-03T04:09:32\">2006-12-03T04:09:32</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Your \"like many others\" link is 404ing.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086910\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086910\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-03T05:48:00\">2006-12-03T05:48:00</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Doh't.

    "body": "Something very cool I just noticed on my MacBook Pro:  There's separate volume settings for headphones versus built-in speakers.  I had the sound muted for external speakers last night.  But, when I plugged my headphones in at work this morning, the volume jumped back to exactly where I'd left it yesterday.  When I realized it happened, I tried alternately plugging and unplugging the headphones, marvelling at the volume icon going back and forth.\r\n\r\nHas it always done this?  Is this something new?

That's Apple for you.</p>\n\n<p>I mentioned it to a long-time (15+ years) Mac user who is also a usability consultant, and even he was impressed. We agreed that, on Windows, the likely consequence of plugging in a set of headphones would be a notification balloon saying \"You have inserted an alternative Audio Signal Output Device. Click here to open Control Panel and configure your new settings.\" :-)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088372\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=185074bcdbbc0edba064209ecc12cf0a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Ken Mills</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088372\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2008-02-10T01:25:31\">2008-02-10T01:25:31</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I hit my Apple (Command?) key with my cursor over the battery status icon on the system tray at the top of my new Macbook pro and it went \"poof\" complete with cloud and sound effects.

It would be something different to memorize - not necessarily easier.  But, hmm, I never thought about anthrax.  I suppose that would be a job hazard to consider, beyond simple wasted time.</p>\n<p>Robert:  Admittedly, I'm frustrated.  This change breaks things I've invested hours into across several jobs, and into which I've been investing hours again.  At least I've been paid for those hours, and I'm glad I don't have to go back and explain / fix the stuff now broken at previous jobs.</p>\n<p>From my perspective, I'm seeing all the latest generation browsers now breaking something I thought was standard - but about that I guess was mistaken.  At least, it \"smelled\" like a fairly clean quasi-standard approach to me.  I really don't have standards all memorized or even well studied.</p>\n<p>But, in the new defacto standard, I get to stuff 512 random bytes into a feed to get the old behavior back.  That certainly doesn't \"smell\" like a clean standard to me, even if IE 7 does it and Firefox 2 now follows.  It still doesn't work in Safari.  It seems a defacto standard to me in the same way that exploiting CSS parser errors to filter by browser is a defacto standard.  Yet another weird edge case to memorize.</p>\n<p>From my perspective, the defacto standard has been what FeedBurner and others have been doing with client-side XSL for feeds.  And there've been some exciting things starting there - so there's some personal disappointment invoked.  And now, all those feeds are broken in that respect.  Retroactive wind-blown urine, at this point, I guess.</p>\n<p>Maybe all this was really just a neat geeky trick best now forgotten, and the decision really will be the right one in the end.  Nonetheless, I don't like it.  So, perhaps not \"IT IS OBJECTIVELY WRONG\".  But, from my perspective, it was an unexpected and unwanted surprise.</p>\n<p>As for being productive, the decision seems made and others have already registered the same or better objections than I would just rehash.  And I can't see with what collective character flaw I've painted the team - I'm perturbed, but I certainly don't think everyone involved is a villain.  My apologies if my frustration vents that way.  It's just that taking over feed styling from content providers strikes me as \"we can do user experience better\", and the explanations I've read don't seem to disagree with that notion.</p>\n<p>But, I disagree and I don't like it.  So, fine, from here on out I use the 512-byte-hack if I want custom XSL styling for feeds.  Another trick in the bag.  That's pretty much my last word on the subject, unless the capability disappears entirely.</p>\n<p>All I have left to say is that I hope the <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/07/30/xml-stylesheet-and-the-world-of-warcraft-home-page\" rel=\"nofollow\">client-side XSL-styled World of Warcraft home page</a> never switches to an Atom or RSS format - whether or not using a non-HTML format for a front page was a good idea in the first place.  I thought it was, but that could be my whole problem.  :)</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087108\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.net\">CraigM</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087108\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T02:42:06\">2006-11-08T02:42:06</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>My \"frustrated with technology\" catch-phrase has always been to become a Buddhist Monk.

That's not how the decision was made. And to be honest, it bothers me somewhat to read a rant on the subject that only focuses on Firefox. To me, it seems like taking advantage of an open product development process because you know we will listen, while other vendors won't. A rant that claims \"Firefox and IE and Safari suck\" would be different, because then it is an opinion on a behavior. Criticism of browser behavior is welcome, criticism of people based on tech religion is not so welcome.</p>\n<p>I understand that FeedBurner and others have a business interest here, but you have to understand that at least some of the things they do directly conflict with capabilities that are beneficial to browser users (that we can't deliver if it only works with half of the feeds out there). We want our users to have a coherent feed experience, with browser-specific preferences and minimal click-through screens. To that end, the screen that supplants the XSL was termed the \"feed preview\". It should show what's in the feed, and default to user-specified feed preferences. If the feed doesn't contain ads for aggregators and feed services (and wrong instructions), a preview that shows that stuff deceives our users. Not in an evil way, but in a \"bad usability\" way. When combined with authors who <em>want</em> a browser feed screen with a stylesheet for older browsers, and Safari/IE7 behavior, the scales tilted away from  using the XSL.</p>\n<p>I understand that people disagree here. But the fact that all browser vendors have done something that doesn't align with the way they used to do it should tell you that the issue is more complicated than \"author's intent\", for better or worse.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087111\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087111\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T04:38:57\">2006-11-08T04:38:57</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Robert:  You have a great point there - I do in fact think that Firefox, IE, and Safari all suck with this current change in feed handling.  And yeah, the only reason I ranted about Firefox is because I think it's the only one of the three there's much chance in affecting.  It's also the only browser I use, so it's the first one where the feed handling change really sunk in for me.  I really haven't cared about it until just now.</p>\n<p>Of course, I've been nowhere near participating in the newsgroups or code checkins or anything whatsoever related to actually contributing to Firefox - so this is all blog-chair quarterbacking from a syndication feeds enthusiast.</p>\n<p>As for the \"they think they know better than us\" issue, I think it can be found in <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_thread/thread/146f70eaf0e1686f/1daec246d79c7dbd#ccd0a66d6a204f49\" rel=\"nofollow\">a newsgroup response like Mike Shaver's</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... one significant motivation was that very many uses of XSLT-on-RSS was to create a page that said \"this is not <em>for</em> you browsers, go to the main site instead\", which is not what we wanted the user's experience to be.  Distinguishing those cases from the \"righteous use of XSLT for dual presentation\" ones is a publishable result, I submit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To this, the most vocal respondents say, \"But I <em>really want</em> my users to experience my righteous XSLT!\"  Even if it has flaming GIFs, dancing hamsters, and cat pictures.  It's <em>righteous</em>, damn it.  (Yeah, the quoted \"righteous\" is a little off-putting when you actually think the XSLT thing is kind of keen.)</p>\n<p>Why not apply the new-and-improved styling by default and bow out when there's a processing instruction?  Then, spread the word - \"Get rid of your cruddy not-for-you XSLT!\"  I'm sure you'd get lots of converts grateful to stop screwing with their feeds, which would leave the outlier nutters like me and FeedBurner to keep happily shooting themselves in the feet.  Instead, I see, \"style 'em all and let hacks sort 'em out,\" which totally rubs me the wrong way.</p>\n<p>At this point, I'm really just mildly disappointed, and feel like I've gotten a downgrade in an otherwise all-around great new browser.  I'm not <em>actually</em> looking to farm sheep over this.  There is a hack-around available for IE7 and FF2, so at least there's that.</p>\n<p>I guess what would make me feel like I'd gotten a decent consolation prize would be if that Feed Preview screen were significantly richer and easier on the eyes than the other browsers' offerings.  I'm assuming that's projected for the future.  Maybe what I need is to do a checkout and dig around.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087112\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ffe238ed68da35e8037df461552234&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087112\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T04:41:06\">2006-11-08T04:41:06</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>CraigM: You may want to reconsider.

Because Mozilla has chosen to ignore an Author's preferences when displaying a feed.  Period.  You can explain it all you want, your reasoning may even be right- but the bottom line is, Mozilla made a conscious decision to ignore styling instructions included by the feed's author.  The only reasons I can think of to do this is to be perverse (which I doubt), or because you think you know better (and from here on out, I use the collective you for Mozilla, because I'm tired of typing Mozilla).</p>\n<p>You claim it's better for users.  I say you think you know better what is good for your users than the feed author does.  This is the same feed author that created the feed's content, and the stylesheet, and decided to present the feed to users with the stylesheet.  I'm sorry, I just don't buy it.</p>\n<p>Another non-starter is the IE7/Safari argument.  I don't care what those browsers do; I chose Firefox because it decided to lead, not follow, when it comes to standards.  Whether you believe that displaying RSS feeds with stylesheets is a standards issue or not, you can't deny it was a de-facto standard until recently.</p>\n<p>And what about those authors who only want their stylesheets applied in older browsers that aren't as enlightened as IE7?  Not that I've seen a public outcry from these authors in any of the forums discussing this \"feature\", but let's assume they must exist.  They were smart enought to add the stylesheet to their feed, why not allow them to also add to their feed an indication that a browser's built in styling may trump the linked stylesheet (perhaps a PI)?  Wouldn't that allow both types of authors to get what they want without wasting bandwidth in 1/2 kb increments of sheer hack?  </p>\n<p>I've read the arguments, here, on the buglist, and in the newsgroups.  To me, and I suspect, to many others, Mozilla (or those who made this decision within Mozilla) has acted as though they think they know better than web site authors.  Explanations such as yours appear to me as an explanation of why you think that, not a refutation that you don't.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087115\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0a9ab4b71ce193e98b7284ca257e327&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jclark.org/weblog/\">Jason Clark</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087115\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T13:21:50\">2006-11-08T13:21:50</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Regarding the above:  Sorry about the extra \"conscious\" at the beginning....

It would be something different to memorize - not necessarily easier.  But, hmm, I never thought about anthrax.  I suppose that would be a job hazard to consider, beyond simple wasted time.</p>\n\n<p>Robert:  Admittedly, I'm frustrated.  This change breaks things I've invested hours into across several jobs, and into which I've been investing hours again.  At least I've been paid for those hours, and I'm glad I don't have to go back and explain / fix the stuff now broken at previous jobs.</p>\n\n<p>From my perspective, I'm seeing all the latest generation browsers now breaking something I thought was standard - but about that I guess was mistaken.  At least, it \"smelled\" like a fairly clean quasi-standard approach to me.  I really don't have standards all memorized or even well studied.</p>\n\n<p>But, in the new defacto standard, I get to stuff 512 random bytes into a feed to get the old behavior back.  That certainly doesn't \"smell\" like a clean standard to me, even if IE 7 does it and Firefox 2 now follows.  It still doesn't work in Safari.  It seems a defacto standard to me in the same way that exploiting CSS parser errors to filter by browser is a defacto standard.  Yet another weird edge case to memorize.</p>\n\n<p>From my perspective, the defacto standard has been what FeedBurner and others have been doing with client-side XSL for feeds.  And there've been some exciting things starting there - so there's some personal disappointment invoked.  And now, all those feeds are broken in that respect.  Retroactive wind-blown urine, at this point, I guess.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe all this was really just a neat geeky trick best now forgotten, and the decision really will be the right one in the end.  Nonetheless, I don't like it.  So, perhaps not \"IT IS OBJECTIVELY WRONG\".  But, from my perspective, it was an unexpected and unwanted surprise.</p>\n\n<p>As for being productive, the decision seems made and others have already registered the same or better objections than I would just rehash.  And I can't see with what collective character flaw I've painted the team - I'm perturbed, but I certainly don't think everyone involved is a villain.  My apologies if my frustration vents that way.  It's just that taking over feed styling from content providers strikes me as \"we can do user experience better\", and the explanations I've read don't seem to disagree with that notion.</p>\n\n<p>But, I disagree and I don't like it.  So, fine, from here on out I use the 512-byte-hack if I want custom XSL styling for feeds.  Another trick in the bag.  That's pretty much my last word on the subject, unless the capability disappears entirely.</p>\n\n<p>All I have left to say is that I hope the <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/07/30/xml-stylesheet-and-the-world-of-warcraft-home-page\" rel=\"nofollow\">client-side XSL-styled World of Warcraft home page</a> never switches to an Atom or RSS format - whether or not using a non-HTML format for a front page was a good idea in the first place.  I thought it was, but that could be my whole problem.  :)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087108\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\">CraigM</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087108\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T02:42:06\">2006-11-08T02:42:06</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>My \"frustrated with technology\" catch-phrase has always been to become a Buddhist Monk.

That's not how the decision was made. And to be honest, it bothers me somewhat to read a rant on the subject that only focuses on Firefox. To me, it seems like taking advantage of an open product development process because you know we will listen, while other vendors won't. A rant that claims \"Firefox and IE and Safari suck\" would be different, because then it is an opinion on a behavior. Criticism of browser behavior is welcome, criticism of people based on tech religion is not so welcome.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that FeedBurner and others have a business interest here, but you have to understand that at least some of the things they do directly conflict with capabilities that are beneficial to browser users (that we can't deliver if it only works with half of the feeds out there). We want our users to have a coherent feed experience, with browser-specific preferences and minimal click-through screens. To that end, the screen that supplants the XSL was termed the \"feed preview\". It should show what's in the feed, and default to user-specified feed preferences. If the feed doesn't contain ads for aggregators and feed services (and wrong instructions), a preview that shows that stuff deceives our users. Not in an evil way, but in a \"bad usability\" way. When combined with authors who <em>want</em> a browser feed screen with a stylesheet for older browsers, and Safari/IE7 behavior, the scales tilted away from  using the XSL.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that people disagree here. But the fact that all browser vendors have done something that doesn't align with the way they used to do it should tell you that the issue is more complicated than \"author's intent\", for better or worse.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087111\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087111\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T04:38:57\">2006-11-08T04:38:57</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Robert:  You have a great point there - I do in fact think that Firefox, IE, and Safari all suck with this current change in feed handling.  And yeah, the only reason I ranted about Firefox is because I think it's the only one of the three there's much chance in affecting.  It's also the only browser I use, so it's the first one where the feed handling change really sunk in for me.  I really haven't cared about it until just now.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I've been nowhere near participating in the newsgroups or code checkins or anything whatsoever related to actually contributing to Firefox - so this is all blog-chair quarterbacking from a syndication feeds enthusiast.</p>\n\n<p>As for the \"they think they know better than us\" issue, I think it can be found in <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_thread/thread/146f70eaf0e1686f/1daec246d79c7dbd#ccd0a66d6a204f49\" rel=\"nofollow\">a newsgroup response like Mike Shaver's</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... one significant motivation was that very many uses of XSLT-on-RSS was to create a page that said \"this is not <em>for</em> you browsers, go to the main site instead\", which is not what we wanted the user's experience to be.  Distinguishing those cases from the \"righteous use of XSLT for dual presentation\" ones is a publishable result, I submit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To this, the most vocal respondents say, \"But I <em>really want</em> my users to experience my righteous XSLT!\"  Even if it has flaming GIFs, dancing hamsters, and cat pictures.  It's <em>righteous</em>, damn it.  (Yeah, the quoted \"righteous\" is a little off-putting when you actually think the XSLT thing is kind of keen.)</p>\n\n<p>Why not apply the new-and-improved styling by default and bow out when there's a processing instruction?  Then, spread the word - \"Get rid of your cruddy not-for-you XSLT!\"  I'm sure you'd get lots of converts grateful to stop screwing with their feeds, which would leave the outlier nutters like me and FeedBurner to keep happily shooting themselves in the feet.  Instead, I see, \"style 'em all and let hacks sort 'em out,\" which totally rubs me the wrong way.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I'm really just mildly disappointed, and feel like I've gotten a downgrade in an otherwise all-around great new browser.  I'm not <em>actually</em> looking to farm sheep over this.  There is a hack-around available for IE7 and FF2, so at least there's that.</p>\n\n<p>I guess what would make me feel like I'd gotten a decent consolation prize would be if that Feed Preview screen were significantly richer and easier on the eyes than the other browsers' offerings.  I'm assuming that's projected for the future.  Maybe what I need is to do a checkout and dig around.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087112\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ffe238ed68da35e8037df461552234&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087112\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-08T04:41:06\">2006-11-08T04:41:06</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>CraigM: You may want to reconsider.

Because Mozilla has chosen to ignore an Author's preferences when displaying a feed.  Period.  You can explain it all you want, your reasoning may even be right- but the bottom line is, Mozilla made a conscious decision to ignore styling instructions included by the feed's author.  The only reasons I can think of to do this is to be perverse (which I doubt), or because you think you know better (and from here on out, I use the collective you for Mozilla, because I'm tired of typing Mozilla).</p>\n\n<p>You claim it's better for users.  I say you think you know better what is good for your users than the feed author does.  This is the same feed author that created the feed's content, and the stylesheet, and decided to present the feed to users with the stylesheet.  I'm sorry, I just don't buy it.</p>\n\n<p>Another non-starter is the IE7/Safari argument.  I don't care what those browsers do; I chose Firefox because it decided to lead, not follow, when it comes to standards.  Whether you believe that displaying RSS feeds with stylesheets is a standards issue or not, you can't deny it was a de-facto standard until recently.</p>\n\n<p>And what about those authors who only want their stylesheets applied in older browsers that aren't as enlightened as IE7?  Not that I've seen a public outcry from these authors in any of the forums discussing this \"feature\", but let's assume they must exist.  They were smart enought to add the stylesheet to their feed, why not allow them to also add to their feed an indication that a browser's built in styling may trump the linked stylesheet (perhaps a PI)?

    "html": "<p>This seems like a small thing, but it bothers me:  For RSS and Atom feeds, Firefox ignores client-side XSL transformations in favor of its own new enhanced rendering.  The only way to work around this issue is to stuff 512 bytes or more of XML comment text before the initial feed tag.  <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=338621\">It&#39;s been marked as a bug</a> for some months now - but after reading the discussion therein, I don&#39;t have much hope of this being fixed.  The gist of the discussion appears to boil down to this: &quot;Firefox knows best, consistency is good, and anyone using client-side XSL on feeds is really after what we&#39;re doing anyway.  Thus, WONTFIX.&quot;</p>\n<p>This strikes me as a bit condescending, presumptuous, and quite broken.  I don&#39;t care if <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/articles/PublishersGuide.aspx\">it&#39;s what IE 7 does</a> - they&#39;re broken too.  This breaks <a href=\"http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/home\">FeedBurner</a>&#39;s XSL presentation, which I like though admittedly don&#39;t use for my own stuff.  This breaks the feed-styling XSL I&#39;ve done at jobs past, which rolled in customer-demanded metrics tracking and branding.  And I don&#39;t care whether or not the Firefox team considers these or other use cases valid - that&#39;s up to me to decide.</p>\n<p>This &quot;feature&quot; makes a special case breaking client-side XSL for XML documents that happen to have an &quot;&lt;rss&quot; or &quot;&lt;atom&quot; in the first 512 bytes.  That sucks.  I&#39;d rather the browser left it up to me as a site author whether to follow Firefox&#39;s idea of consistency, or whether to happily shoot myself in the foot with my own decisions.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083664\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8f428369088902ba8149d27e1ac2423d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Len Lynch</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083664\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-02T19:26:50\">2006-11-02T19:26:50</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>They should make this a tunable and provide \"over riding\" the portable behavior with their own value-minded agenda.

(Yes, you read that right. A whole lot of the rest are served as <code>text/plain</code>.) The same is true of images and videos, btw. There is no way to avoid content sniffing.</p>\n<p>The ideal approach would have been to honour the PI <em>only</em> if the feed is served as <code>text/xml</code> or <code>application/xml</code>, eg. explicitly as generic XML rather than as a feed. In case of sniffed feeds or feeds served with the proper MIME type, the PI would be ignored (as client apps are free to do; they are under no obligation to honour the PI), but authors would still have a clean and obvious option for getting what they want.</p>\n<p>Except that RSS 2.0 does not have a MIME type and is therefore served as <code>text/xml</code> or <code>application/xml</code>.</p>\n<p>This is what happens when people who have no clue of how the web works come up with things to put on the web: you end up with no good way of implementing their crud.</p>\n<p>The only thing I can think of that could have been better than what we have now would be to specify a new PI to explicitly disable the default feed view. (Although I’d want to have maybe add a yellow strip that lets me disable the custom view or something like that; withholding from the reader the ability to be the ultimate arbiter of his own experience is Wrong.)</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083684\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://starling.us/atom/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8b09a229fac82b3a6b7b61e0db95408c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://starling.us/atom/\">Gan Uesli Starling</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083684\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-02-22T10:22:23\">2007-02-22T10:22:23</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Yes, this is MOST annoying. I had put off writing a feed waiting until the formats should settle out. I ended up delaying first until Atom 1.0, and then longer yet until I should have some free time...until just a couple of weeks ago. Then, working in Firefox 1.5.0.1 I blissfully labored over an XSLT to go with it. Spent quite a while at that. Only when I have it working pretty much as desired do I bother to check it at work in IE7...and ARGHHH!...all my time and effort wasted.</p>\n<p>And oh, by the way, I had also written a howto for Atom 1.0...and XSLT. So I search GOOGLE high and low until I find someone who writes of how to turn the feature off in IE7...and ammend my howto for that instruction. Now I must do so for Firefox 2.0...and Safari...it seems. Alas and alack.</p>\n<p>How about Opera? I recall from some years back that Opera was among the first and best of early adopters for XSLT. It looks as if my howto for Atom 1.0 and XSLT is going to be largely composed of workarounds for this mis-feature.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083688\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=916cc61b7337d47614cfb29b3f593e9d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jeff Wilkinson</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083688\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-14T20:29:34\">2007-03-14T20:29:34</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>what a pain.  fixing this will definitely get my vote.

    "body": "This seems like a small thing, but it bothers me:  For RSS and Atom feeds, Firefox ignores client-side XSL transformations in favor of its own new enhanced rendering.  The only way to work around this issue is to stuff 512 bytes or more of XML comment text before the initial feed tag.  [It's been marked as a bug][bug] for some months now - but after reading the discussion therein, I don't have much hope of this being fixed.  The gist of the discussion appears to boil down to this: \"Firefox knows best, consistency is good, and anyone using client-side XSL on feeds is really after what we're doing anyway.  Thus, WONTFIX.\"\r\n\r\nThis strikes me as a bit condescending, presumptuous, and quite broken.  I don't care if [it's what IE 7 does][ie7] - they're broken too.  This breaks [FeedBurner][fb]'s XSL presentation, which I like though admittedly don't use for my own stuff.  This breaks the feed-styling XSL I've done at jobs past, which rolled in customer-demanded metrics tracking and branding.  And I don't care whether or not the Firefox team considers these or other use cases valid - that's up to me to decide.\r\n\r\nThis \"feature\" makes a special case breaking client-side XSL for XML documents that happen to have an \"&lt;rss\" or \"&lt;atom\" in the first 512 bytes.  That sucks.  I'd rather the browser left it up to me as a site author whether to follow Firefox's idea of consistency, or whether to happily shoot myself in the foot with my own decisions.\r\n\r\n[bug]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=338621\r\n[fb]: http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/home\r\n[ie7]: http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/articles/PublishersGuide.aspx\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083664\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8f428369088902ba8149d27e1ac2423d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Len Lynch</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083664\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-11-02T19:26:50\">2006-11-02T19:26:50</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>They should make this a tunable and provide \"over riding\" the portable behavior with their own value-minded agenda.

(Yes, you read that right. A whole lot of the rest are served as <code>text/plain</code>.) The same is true of images and videos, btw. There is no way to avoid content sniffing.</p>\n\n<p>The ideal approach would have been to honour the PI <em>only</em> if the feed is served as <code>text/xml</code> or <code>application/xml</code>, eg. explicitly as generic XML rather than as a feed. In case of sniffed feeds or feeds served with the proper MIME type, the PI would be ignored (as client apps are free to do; they are under no obligation to honour the PI), but authors would still have a clean and obvious option for getting what they want.</p>\n\n<p>Except that RSS 2.0 does not have a MIME type and is therefore served as <code>text/xml</code> or <code>application/xml</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This is what happens when people who have no clue of how the web works come up with things to put on the web: you end up with no good way of implementing their crud.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing I can think of that could have been better than what we have now would be to specify a new PI to explicitly disable the default feed view. (Although I’d want to have maybe add a yellow strip that lets me disable the custom view or something like that; withholding from the reader the ability to be the ultimate arbiter of his own experience is Wrong.)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083684\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://starling.us/atom/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8b09a229fac82b3a6b7b61e0db95408c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://starling.us/atom/\">Gan Uesli Starling</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083684\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-02-22T10:22:23\">2007-02-22T10:22:23</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Yes, this is MOST annoying.

Then, working in Firefox 1.5.0.1 I blissfully labored over an XSLT to go with it. Spent quite a while at that. Only when I have it working pretty much as desired do I bother to check it at work in IE7...and ARGHHH!...all my time and effort wasted.</p>\n\n<p>And oh, by the way, I had also written a howto for Atom 1.0...and XSLT. So I search GOOGLE high and low until I find someone who writes of how to turn the feature off in IE7...and ammend my howto for that instruction. Now I must do so for Firefox 2.0...and Safari...it seems. Alas and alack.</p>\n\n<p>How about Opera? I recall from some years back that Opera was among the first and best of early adopters for XSLT. It looks as if my howto for Atom 1.0 and XSLT is going to be largely composed of workarounds for this mis-feature.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083688\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=916cc61b7337d47614cfb29b3f593e9d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Jeff Wilkinson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083688\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-14T20:29:34\">2007-03-14T20:29:34</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>what a pain.  fixing this will definitely get my vote.

It's crazy, but it might work.</p>\n<p>First, style Drags so their z-Index is LOWER than the Drops.  You want your mouse to hit the droppable areas.</p>\n<p>Once a droppable is moused over by dragging a drag to it, it creates a transparent element in the exact same position as the Droppable.  It also lowers the droppable z-Index.  This gives the appearance that the draggable is over the droppable.</p>\n<p>To simulate movement, the transparent droppable's mouseovers are sent to the draggable.</p>\n<p>On mousing out of the transparent Droppable, it sets everything back to normal.</p>\n<p>I haven't tried this yet.  The biggest issue I see is that when you grab a draggable in the middle, half of it will be behind the droppable until the mouseover happens.

The first is that I don't like Prototype, unless they've stopped messing with Object.prototype since I last checked.  The second is that DnD in Scriptaculous involves juggling lots of little objects ilke most other DnD implementations I've found.  When I have an outline of 100's to 1000's of items, that really blows.

If you haven't seen JavaScriptMVC, check out its trunk.  In the controller2 plugin, you'll find a really nice event delegation library.</p>\n\n<p>I've only thought of 1 way to do event delegation drops.  It's crazy, but it might work.</p>\n\n<p>First, style Drags so their z-Index is LOWER than the Drops.  You want your mouse to hit the droppable areas.</p>\n\n<p>Once a droppable is moused over by dragging a drag to it, it creates a transparent element in the exact same position as the Droppable.  It also lowers the droppable z-Index.  This gives the appearance that the draggable is over the droppable.</p>\n\n<p>To simulate movement, the transparent droppable's mouseovers are sent to the draggable.</p>\n\n<p>On mousing out of the transparent Droppable, it sets everything back to normal.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't tried this yet.  The biggest issue I see is that when you grab a draggable in the middle, half of it will be behind the droppable until the mouseover happens.  This isn't ideal, but maybe there is something that can be done about that.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083088\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8f18d2579d5c8f2fb2a79c09a9234e6e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Batiste</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083088\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-20T10:06:54\">2009-01-20T10:06:54</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>A jQuery solution for Drag and Drop with event delegation :</p>\n\n<p>http://batiste.dosimple.ch/blog/posts/2008-05-18-1/jquery-drag-and-drop-and-resize-event-delegation.html</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

    "html": "<p>One of my favorite features of the new Firefox are <a href=\"http://microsummaries.org/\">Microsummaries</a>.  They&#39;re like RSS-lite: one-liner summaries of web pages that can be used to keep bookmark titles up to date and get succinct info about a page.  For example, you could get the latest temperature from the title of a weather report bookmark, or the most recent bid price from an auction page.</p>\n<p>But, there&#39;s one thing that rubs me the wrong way, and it&#39;s this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;microsummary&quot; href=&quot;microsummary.txt&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>That&#39;s how you clue a client into finding the microsummary for a given HTML page.  Stick that in your head tag, and you&#39;re off.  It&#39;s just like <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery\">RSS autodiscovery</a>.  Well it is, except for an important detail: What&#39;s the Content-Type I should expect at that URL?</p>\n<p>You see, microsummaries can be provided as either a direct URL to a plain text summary of the page, or a URL to an XML-based generator providing the means to extract that plain text summary from the page.  But, as spec&#39;ed, you never know which you&#39;re going to get until you fetch the URL.  So, when trying to handle a <a href=\"http://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries\">microsummary</a>, I never know whether to just use the fetched content directly as plain text or whether it&#39;s time to fire up the XSL machinery.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve seen some sites toss in a type=&quot;text/plain&quot; or type=&quot;application/xml&quot; attribute - which is very helpful and what I really want to see - but it&#39;s not in <a href=\"http://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries\">the spec</a>.  From a cursory perusal of Firefox source code, it looks like the browser tries to sniff the Content-Type header returned by the web server - but that sucks, because web servers often lie or are confused about Content-Type.  I need to read more into that source code, so I can at least do as well as Firefox does.</p>\n<p>Eh, it&#39;s a small gripe, but one on which I&#39;ve spent too much time already.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082514\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7d1c8d2b1a7643236a4661e9a974dee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\">George Hotelling</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082514\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-10-29T22:26:04\">2006-10-29T22:26:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>What's the advantage of sticking it into the markup instead of just using the HTTP headers for the microsummary?</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082515\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082515\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-10-31T01:11:08\">2006-10-31T01:11:08</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Well, in the markup, I'm more confident it'll tell the intended truth.

    "body": "One of my favorite features of the new Firefox are [Microsummaries][ms].  They're like RSS-lite: one-liner summaries of web pages that can be used to keep bookmark titles up to date and get succinct info about a page.  For example, you could get the latest temperature from the title of a weather report bookmark, or the most recent bid price from an auction page.\r\n\r\nBut, there's one thing that rubs me the wrong way, and it's this:\r\n\r\n    <link rel=\"microsummary\" href=\"microsummary.txt\">\r\n\r\nThat's how you clue a client into finding the microsummary for a given HTML page.  Stick that in your head tag, and you're off.  It's just like [RSS autodiscovery][rd].  Well it is, except for an important detail: What's the Content-Type I should expect at that URL?\r\n\r\nYou see, microsummaries can be provided as either a direct URL to a plain text summary of the page, or a URL to an XML-based generator providing the means to extract that plain text summary from the page.  But, as spec'ed, you never know which you're going to get until you fetch the URL.  So, when trying to handle a [microsummary][mst], I never know whether to just use the fetched content directly as plain text or whether it's time to fire up the XSL machinery.\r\n\r\nI've seen some sites toss in a type=\"text/plain\" or type=\"application/xml\" attribute - which is very helpful and what I really want to see - but it's not in [the spec][mst].  From a cursory perusal of Firefox source code, it looks like the browser tries to sniff the Content-Type header returned by the web server - but that sucks, because web servers often lie or are confused about Content-Type.  I need to read more into that source code, so I can at least do as well as Firefox does.\r\n\r\nEh, it's a small gripe, but one on which I've spent too much time already.\r\n\r\n[rd]: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery\r\n[ms]: http://microsummaries.org/\r\n[mst]: http://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082514\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7d1c8d2b1a7643236a4661e9a974dee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\">George Hotelling</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082514\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-10-29T22:26:04\">2006-10-29T22:26:04</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>What's the advantage of sticking it into the markup instead of just using the HTTP headers for the microsummary?</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082515\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082515\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-10-31T01:11:08\">2006-10-31T01:11:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Well, in the markup, I'm more confident it'll tell the intended truth.

Relaxing has been relaxing.\r\n\r\n[dg]: http://digg.com/users/deusx/dugg\r\n[db]: http://del.icio.us/deusx\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088389\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7b3073e125f3ac8f09130950ef5d7790&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\">brian cors</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088389\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-10-26T18:24:08\">2006-10-26T18:24:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I tend to not \"blog\" so much either lately - that's why my \"blog\" page is moreso an aggregator of all things Brian - that I severely need to try to organize in a better manner.

Come sign [the cast](http://flickr.com/photos/missadroit/251064139/), or plaster me with a sticker while I'm too immobile to do much about it.\n",

Since it's a live stream, the performer can also do shout outs to the audience: \"Thanks for coming out tonight green lizard guy in a Ween T-shirt!\". </p>\n<p>Live music is also ridiculously easy to find by searching for events in-world or by checking out the page on the SecondLife website - http://secondlife.com/events/index.php?category=20</p>\n<p>Also did you know that people have created tools for posting to del.icio.us from within SL as well as blogging (http://www.bloghud.com). </p>\n<p>Thanks, feel free to IM me in-world: Hal9k Andalso.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090462\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://brian.cors.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7b3073e125f3ac8f09130950ef5d7790&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://brian.cors.org\">brian cors</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090462\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-26T16:02:07\">2006-09-26T16:02:07</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Woo.

Since it's a live stream, the performer can also do shout outs to the audience: \"Thanks for coming out tonight green lizard guy in a Ween T-shirt!\". </p>\n\n<p>Live music is also ridiculously easy to find by searching for events in-world or by checking out the page on the SecondLife website - http://secondlife.com/events/index.php?category=20</p>\n\n<p>Also did you know that people have created tools for posting to del.icio.us from within SL as well as blogging (http://www.bloghud.com). </p>\n\n<p>Thanks, feel free to IM me in-world: Hal9k Andalso.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090462\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7b3073e125f3ac8f09130950ef5d7790&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\">brian cors</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090462\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-26T16:02:07\">2006-09-26T16:02:07</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Woo.

I hopped off a bus on the way home last Monday and through a bungled confluence of toes, curb, heel, and street, I managed to rupture my left Achilles tendon.  That&#39;s pretty much made my left leg useless, and I&#39;ve been growing roots on the couch with occasional crutch-based expeditions to other rooms.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve spent the last 7 days in a bit of a drug haze with doctor visits; attempts at getting work done with mixed success; and some marathon World of Warcraft sessions to distract myself from this predicament.

Midweek, I got a nicer cast and an MRI, and I stepped down from the strong stuff.  So, things are stabilized as I wait to hear if I need surgery this week.  At least I can think better now, for whatever that&#39;s worth.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m pretty despondent about the whole thing:  We just moved here, just got settled, ready to start exploring the Valley and the City and get free of the hermitage - and here I am stuck on the couch while the kids all play outside.  I&#39;m told that this will heal, given time and some rehabilitation.  I&#39;ve also heard that <a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=336497\">I&#39;m in good company with this injury</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s just so frustrating to have been rendered so immobile.  Alexandra has been amazing, taking care of everything for me, and I&#39;ll owe her some big time pampering once I&#39;m back on my feet.  But, in the meantime, maybe I&#39;ll have to invite some people by to visit me on my microfiber throne.  We have plenty of attractions:  Gaming consoles from many generations, witty banter, and a mini-zoo of cats and bunnies.  Suggestions on couchbound entertainments and socializing options welcome.  :)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090700\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://gfmorris.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=505e3b39dcea29b3ded74a5494c493eb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://gfmorris.net/\">Geof F.

I've had a partial rupture before. Although it healed without needing a surgery, it's never the same. I had to quit basketball and pickup cycling. I no longer run across the street when I can walk across it. As you probably know, one of the reasons it's a tough area for surgery is because there isn't whole lot of blodd circulating down there to speed the recovery process. If you do go ahead with the surgey, be as sure as you can about its condition before trying to get back to normal activities. That's a sure way to re-rupturing the tendon.

(I'm [a Gnome mage named Fizlfry on Eitrigg](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/06/world-of-warcraft-is-my-world-of-warcraft) who's [just joined the We Know guild](http://weknow.to/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=52&page=2#Item_17), say hi!)  Midweek, I got a nicer cast and an MRI, and I stepped down from the strong stuff.  So, things are stabilized as I wait to hear if I need surgery this week.  At least I can think better now, for whatever that's worth.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty despondent about the whole thing:  We just moved here, just got settled, ready to start exploring the Valley and the City and get free of the hermitage - and here I am stuck on the couch while the kids all play outside.  I'm told that this will heal, given time and some rehabilitation.  I've also heard that [I'm in good company with this injury](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=336497).\r\n\r\nIt's just so frustrating to have been rendered so immobile.  Alexandra has been amazing, taking care of everything for me, and I'll owe her some big time pampering once I'm back on my feet.  But, in the meantime, maybe I'll have to invite some people by to visit me on my microfiber throne.  We have plenty of attractions:  Gaming consoles from many generations, witty banter, and a mini-zoo of cats and bunnies.  Suggestions on couchbound entertainments and socializing options welcome.  :)\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090700\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://gfmorris.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=505e3b39dcea29b3ded74a5494c493eb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://gfmorris.net/\">Geof F.

I've had a partial rupture before. Although it healed without needing a surgery, it's never the same. I had to quit basketball and pickup cycling. I no longer run across the street when I can walk across it. As you probably know, one of the reasons it's a tough area for surgery is because there isn't whole lot of blodd circulating down there to speed the recovery process. If you do go ahead with the surgey, be as sure as you can about its condition before trying to get back to normal activities. That's a sure way to re-rupturing the tendon.

Does anyone really want to return to a command-line interface to manipulate documents? It’s designing for a past that never happened, one where we all became computer scientists and enjoyed manipulating documents via arcane commands.<br />...<br />A better, more productive, use of time would have been to say, what inspiration can still be gained from Engelbart’s ideas? There’s still a lot to be gleaned from his 1962 (!) paper [Augmenting Human Intellect](http://www.bootstrap.org/augdocs/friedewald030402/augmentinghumanintellect/ahi62index.html). How might some of his thoughts on collaborative intelligence be implemented in our world now, in 2006, within the technology we have now? That’s the question waiting to be solved.</blockquote><div class=\"quotesource\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.adaptivepath.com/blog/2006/09/05/the-futility-of-designing-for-an-alternate-past/\">adaptive path » blog » blog archive » The Futility of Designing for an Alternate Past</a></div>\n\n<p>Allow me to engage in some Devil&#39;s Advocacy here - although I really am an Engelbart sympathizer:  </p>\n<p>Consider a program like Microsoft Word, with all its ribbons and toolbars and menus and animated assistance.  When you first started working with it, you probably spent time navigating these visual and guided parts of the user interface to get your job done.  But, after awhile, you probably discovered keyboard shortcuts and accellerators - CTRL-s to save, for instance.  These have likely been invaluable in speeding up your work and helping the application get out of your way.  So, having reached this point, do you ever really have a use for the &quot;user friendly&quot; bits anymore?  Or, have you graduated to &quot;manipulating documents via arcane commands&quot;?</p>\n<p>What if this application had never sugar-coated things and had instead optimized for efficiency and ergonomics in daily expert operation, trading an &quot;intuitive interface&quot; for an offer to incrementally train on its necessarily complex functionality?  After awhile, you&#39;ll have it all down, and be ready to shed the training wheels.</p>\n<p>What if - instead of a maze of menus and toolbar icons - your mouse just had dozens of easily-accessible buttons?  You&#39;re used to only having a left and a right click from which to choose.  If you&#39;ve splurged, you might have the more expansive choices offered by a fancier pointing device.  But, what if you had a chording keyboard under your off-mouse hand, offering an order of magnitude more mouse pointer actions?  </p>\n<p>For example, how about a &quot;delete word&quot; mouse button?  Or a &quot;copy sentence&quot; button?  Or maybe even a &quot;jump to the selected link with a custom view filter&quot; button?  The important part is that these commands act <strong>immediately</strong>, <em>just like a mouse button</em>, upon whatever&#39;s under the pointer.  There&#39;s no left-click then CTRL-x to Cut - no, you just point at a word, and say &quot;cut that&quot;.  There&#39;s a lot of power and efficiency here.</p>\n<p>These &quot;what if&quot; scenarios are not just wishful thinking, though.  They&#39;re what Doug Engelbart and crew implemented.  These are things I picked up after being invited to try a hands-on self-guided tour of <a href=\"http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2006/03/new-screencast-of-douglas-engelbarts.html\">Augment</a>.  I only wish I&#39;d had a chording keyboard to get the full experience.  The interface was like a mouse-heavy <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/\">VIM</a>, with verb-object command patterns and structured document interactions.  (Or, rather, <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/\">VIM</a> is like a mouse- and outline-deficient derivation of Augment.)  </p>\n<p>The basic core of this facet of <a href=\"http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2006/03/new-screencast-of-douglas-engelbarts.html\">Augment</a> is this:  Computers are powerful tools with great potential to augment human intellect.  As such, they offer a lot of complex functionality.  But, human beings are trainable, and can assimilate this functionality.  Once assimilated, it&#39;s best to squeeze out all the performance you can.  You don&#39;t see today&#39;s degree of computer &quot;user friendliness&quot; in chainsaws, tanks, jack-hammers, semi-trucks, or fighter jets.  These things are necessarily complex and require training.  Why should the most powerful of intelligence enhancement tools offered by computers be any different?  Of course, you generally won&#39;t lose a limb to a computer, but you might be mentally impaired or lose valuable work in the process.</p>\n<p>This is, I think, one of the still-relevant central facets of Doug Engelbart&#39;s ideas that could use some re-examination today.  It could just be because I&#39;m an übernerd who thinks it&#39;s fun to self-train on things like <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/\">VIM</a> and <a href=\"http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2006/03/new-screencast-of-douglas-engelbarts.html\">Augment</a>, but I also think that there&#39;s a lot of potential to be unlocked once you clear away expectations of &quot;intuitive interfaces&quot; that are <a href=\"http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/2002/08/nipple.html\">decidedly not nipples</a>.  </p>\n<p>And, since I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/06/world-of-warcraft-is-my-world-of-warcraft\">admitted my recently acquired semi-addiction</a>, consider World of Warcraft as an expert application.  Advanced players could never succeed by navigating a complex yet &quot;friendly&quot; UI to invoke various spells and skills and in-game actions.  Just take a look at some of the customizations and UI revisions being offered at <a href=\"http://ui.worldofwar.net/\">this site</a>.  Some configurations of this game smack me as eerily similar to the principles of Augment.  In fact, just this weekend, I was considering blowing the dust off <a href=\"http://www.avault.com/hardware/getreview.asp?review=msstratcom\">this keyset controller</a> I used to use with Everquest, years ago.</p>\n<p>Then again, maybe it&#39;s a matter of intensity.  Coordinating with a 40-player guild to slay something from the molten bowels of the earth is a slightly different activity than composing a memo or even a few-dozen-page report.  On the other hand, I really would&#39;ve liked to strip away most of the Word interface while writing my <a href=\"#text-2\">two books</a>.  And someday, who&#39;s to say that online interpersonal collaboration in the general case won&#39;t more closely resemble a World of Warcraft raid?  Having <a href=\"http://decafbad.vox.com/library/post/reading-vernor-vinges-new-novel.html\">just read</a> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312856849/0xdecafbad01-20\">Vernor Vinge&#39;s latest book Rainbows End</a>, he makes a lot of intelligence augmentation and collaboration tasks look just like WoW.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085202\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8157a5907b244071cda98ba5aa7a9635&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085202\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-06T21:58:26\">2006-09-06T21:58:26</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>The fighter-jet metaphor is interesting. Obviously a fighter has a narrower scope/focus than the general computer.

Does anyone really want to return to a command-line interface to manipulate documents? It’s designing for a past that never happened, one where we all became computer scientists and enjoyed manipulating documents via arcane commands.<br />...<br />A better, more productive, use of time would have been to say, what inspiration can still be gained from Engelbart’s ideas? There’s still a lot to be gleaned from his 1962 (!) paper [Augmenting Human Intellect](http://www.bootstrap.org/augdocs/friedewald030402/augmentinghumanintellect/ahi62index.html). How might some of his thoughts on collaborative intelligence be implemented in our world now, in 2006, within the technology we have now? That’s the question waiting to be solved.</blockquote><div class=\"quotesource\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.adaptivepath.com/blog/2006/09/05/the-futility-of-designing-for-an-alternate-past/\">adaptive path » blog » blog archive » The Futility of Designing for an Alternate Past</a></div>\r\n\r\nAllow me to engage in some Devil's Advocacy here - although I really am an Engelbart sympathizer:  \r\n\r\nConsider a program like Microsoft Word, with all its ribbons and toolbars and menus and animated assistance.  When you first started working with it, you probably spent time navigating these visual and guided parts of the user interface to get your job done.  But, after awhile, you probably discovered keyboard shortcuts and accellerators - CTRL-s to save, for instance.  These have likely been invaluable in speeding up your work and helping the application get out of your way.  So, having reached this point, do you ever really have a use for the \"user friendly\" bits anymore?  Or, have you graduated to \"manipulating documents via arcane commands\"?\r\n\r\nWhat if this application had never sugar-coated things and had instead optimized for efficiency and ergonomics in daily expert operation, trading an \"intuitive interface\" for an offer to incrementally train on its necessarily complex functionality?  After awhile, you'll have it all down, and be ready to shed the training wheels.\r\n\r\nWhat if - instead of a maze of menus and toolbar icons - your mouse just had dozens of easily-accessible buttons?  You're used to only having a left and a right click from which to choose.  If you've splurged, you might have the more expansive choices offered by a fancier pointing device.  But, what if you had a chording keyboard under your off-mouse hand, offering an order of magnitude more mouse pointer actions?  \r\n\r\nFor example, how about a \"delete word\" mouse button?  Or a \"copy sentence\" button?  Or maybe even a \"jump to the selected link with a custom view filter\" button?  The important part is that these commands act **immediately**, *just like a mouse button*, upon whatever's under the pointer.  There's no left-click then CTRL-x to Cut - no, you just point at a word, and say \"cut that\".  There's a lot of power and efficiency here.\r\n\r\nThese \"what if\" scenarios are not just wishful thinking, though.  They're what Doug Engelbart and crew implemented.  These are things I picked up after being invited to try a hands-on self-guided tour of [Augment][].  I only wish I'd had a chording keyboard to get the full experience.  The interface was like a mouse-heavy [VIM][], with verb-object command patterns and structured document interactions.  (Or, rather, [VIM][] is like a mouse- and outline-deficient derivation of Augment.)  \r\n\r\nThe basic core of this facet of [Augment][] is this:  Computers are powerful tools with great potential to augment human intellect.  As such, they offer a lot of complex functionality.  But, human beings are trainable, and can assimilate this functionality.  Once assimilated, it's best to squeeze out all the performance you can.  You don't see today's degree of computer \"user friendliness\" in chainsaws, tanks, jack-hammers, semi-trucks, or fighter jets.  These things are necessarily complex and require training.  Why should the most powerful of intelligence enhancement tools offered by computers be any different?  Of course, you generally won't lose a limb to a computer, but you might be mentally impaired or lose valuable work in the process.\r\n\r\nThis is, I think, one of the still-relevant central facets of Doug Engelbart's ideas that could use some re-examination today.  It could just be because I'm an übernerd who thinks it's fun to self-train on things like [VIM][] and [Augment][], but I also think that there's a lot of potential to be unlocked once you clear away expectations of \"intuitive interfaces\" that are [decidedly not nipples][nip].  \r\n\r\nAnd, since I've [admitted my recently acquired semi-addiction][wow], consider World of Warcraft as an expert application.  Advanced players could never succeed by navigating a complex yet \"friendly\" UI to invoke various spells and skills and in-game actions.  Just take a look at some of the customizations and UI revisions being offered at [this site][wowui].  Some configurations of this game smack me as eerily similar to the principles of Augment.  In fact, just this weekend, I was considering blowing the dust off [this keyset controller](http://www.avault.com/hardware/getreview.asp?review=msstratcom) I used to use with Everquest, years ago.\r\n\r\nThen again, maybe it's a matter of intensity.  Coordinating with a 40-player guild to slay something from the molten bowels of the earth is a slightly different activity than composing a memo or even a few-dozen-page report.  On the other hand, I really would've liked to strip away most of the Word interface while writing my [two books](#text-2).  And someday, who's to say that online interpersonal collaboration in the general case won't more closely resemble a World of Warcraft raid?  Having [just read][read] [Vernor Vinge's latest book Rainbows End][re], he makes a lot of intelligence augmentation and collaboration tasks look just like WoW.\r\n\r\n[re]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312856849/0xdecafbad01-20\r\n[read]: http://decafbad.vox.com/library/post/reading-vernor-vinges-new-novel.html\r\n[wowui]: http://ui.worldofwar.net/\r\n[wow]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/06/world-of-warcraft-is-my-world-of-warcraft\r\n[nip]: http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/2002/08/nipple.html\r\n[vim]: http://www.vim.org/\r\n[augment]: http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2006/03/new-screencast-of-douglas-engelbarts.html\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085202\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8157a5907b244071cda98ba5aa7a9635&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085202\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-06T21:58:26\">2006-09-06T21:58:26</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>The fighter-jet metaphor is interesting.

Tradition is sometimes/often arbitrary; life's like that and we should sometimes just suck it up.)</p>\n\n<p>Harold's point about expert users is, I think, key. It's merely foolish to impose a system that makes good use of habituation onto a newly arrived visitor. I'm quite sure that attentive study shows a clustering or quantum of user intention and expertise ... until and unless we contrive some seamless continuum (a terrible distraction inspired by naive perfectionism) we should focus on differentiating expters from n00bs (no diss) and serve both well. \"Intermediate level\" sounds quite appropriate ... so long as this isn't just a maelstrum of fish/foul goat/sheep confounds.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively we can always fall back on the old TRW concept of making people think more like machines. There might be funding for that.\n;-P</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085208\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mozdawg.blogspot.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2c2c2c8f9e42a145f54f257111c6e84d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mozdawg.blogspot.com\">Ben Tremblay</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085208\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-12T20:39:47\">2006-09-12T20:39:47</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Muscle memory just jumped up and reminded me of this: in a situation where I was doing Print Preview a gazillion times a day Shift-F7 6 was as effortless as breathing. <em>snap</em></p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085209\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e377f3e2140297d32460ae9a4b38ff98&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085209\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-10-18T06:00:17\">2006-10-18T06:00:17</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I can speak as a former Emacs user and coder that the only reason I gave it up for vi was that it hurt my hands too much to make all of those funky keyboard chords, and it started to hurt my head to remember all of the time-saving things I had built.</p>\n\n<p>Classically there's a tradeoff between the ease of typing something and the amount of think time you have to put into remembering what to type.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I am annoyed by on too many blogs is the inability to tab from the comment field to the \"submit\" button, which forces a mouse event and a scroll event.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

It's easily the toughest MMORPG ever made.  You can lose 6 months of work in 30 seconds with no recourse if you don't take precautions.  Conversely, you can ruin 10 people's day in about an hour or so if you're really good.  Many roles in EVE require actual understanding of economics.  And EVE's current fanbase is pretty solid in terms of legitimate community.  The game actually red-shifts and blue-shifts stuff when you're travelling fast enough -- the level of detail on some things is mind-blowing.  Highly recommended, but be aware that often this game is as much work as play.

As soon as you can exchange game property for real money, a whole different set of motives comes into play.  Imagine criminals using MMO enterprises to launder money, or to run 419 scams.

It's easily the toughest MMORPG ever made.  You can lose 6 months of work in 30 seconds with no recourse if you don't take precautions.  Conversely, you can ruin 10 people's day in about an hour or so if you're really good.  Many roles in EVE require actual understanding of economics.  And EVE's current fanbase is pretty solid in terms of legitimate community.  The game actually red-shifts and blue-shifts stuff when you're travelling fast enough -- the level of detail on some things is mind-blowing.  Highly recommended, but be aware that often this game is as much work as play.  Definitely not for everyone.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085384\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085384\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-30T21:13:59\">2006-08-30T21:13:59</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>These two things seem at odds to me:</p>\n\n<p>\"Any game that makes it possible in any way to transfer anything between avatars makes ingame enforcement by anyone other than GMs impossible.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"You can lose 6 months of work in 30 seconds with no recourse if you don’t take precautions.

As soon as you can exchange game property for real money, a whole different set of motives comes into play.  Imagine criminals using MMO enterprises to launder money, or to run 419 scams.  Then real-life law enforcement is going to take an interest in what's happening in-game.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085388\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ffe238ed68da35e8037df461552234&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085388\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-01T14:03:28\">2006-09-01T14:03:28</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>You couldn't really enforce something like that in empire space.

It'll be intereting to watch what people are going to come up with. Given that the instances are not \"persistent\", i.e. data is gone when you stop them (unless you move things int S3 or elsewhere), I am assuming that they <em>will</em> be used differently from regular dedicated machines. </p>\n<p>It reminds a little bit of DSL (Damnsmalllinux) which boots/runs of a CD, but allows you to save all your data and customization to an external storage (usb/ftp/etc.) and does auto-restore when you boot into it again. This is nice for people afraid of viruses or getting hacked etc.. I wonder whether this will turn out to be a plus for amazons offer as well.

It'll be intereting to watch what people are going to come up with. Given that the instances are not \"persistent\", i.e. data is gone when you stop them (unless you move things int S3 or elsewhere), I am assuming that they <em>will</em> be used differently from regular dedicated machines. </p>\n\n<p>It reminds a little bit of DSL (Damnsmalllinux) which boots/runs of a CD, but allows you to save all your data and customization to an external storage (usb/ftp/etc.) and does auto-restore when you boot into it again. This is nice for people afraid of viruses or getting hacked etc.. I wonder whether this will turn out to be a plus for amazons offer as well. At first it does make things a bit more complicated wrt to usual linux way. But I guess tose things can be solved...</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088888\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088888\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-24T16:29:44\">2006-08-24T16:29:44</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Sencer: Actually, I think your reading is the right one.

This annoys me, but I only half care to fix them.\r\n\r\n[sandbox]: http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/\r\n[wordpress widgets]: http://automattic.com/code/widgets/\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089256\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.slackorama.com/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=15b474c86cd73c2d12c1d77af11c1d8a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.slackorama.com/blog\">Seth</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089256\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-21T18:17:39\">2006-08-21T18:17:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hey,\nLooks like your markup isn't getting processed in your feed.

ClaimID is a model - just as blogs enabled millions of people to share their voice online, claimID lets people have a way to approach their identity.  Simple? Yes - but that's the point.  There are tons of people out there who have stuff about them online (mailing list archives, blog comments) who don't have the time, desire or expertiese to create a myname.com site, or even a html list of links about themselves.  ClaimID is designed so that these people can have a dead simple solution for a fundamental need.  </p>\n<p>Of course, on top of that you do get value adds...the personal SEO stuff is nice, having your links tied together for search engines are nice, the microformats stuff, link status checking, having an OpenID, and so on - but the main experience is the simplicity.  For as important as identity is, most people really still aren't going out of their way to protect/defend their names.  Maybe this will change in the future, maybe it won't - but we are betting that the way to get people in the door, to start them thinking about the process is through simplicity.</p>\n<p>Honestly, though, we're still figuring all of this out.  Identity is huge, complicated, loaded with meaning and interpretation - and we aren't going to say that we've got all the answers.  But reading posts, responding, listening - we really feel like we're learning a lot.  Our goal down the road is for ClaimID to be a place where you can simply an easily have your identity needs met.  That said, we're still working on it, and thanks for being part of the process! </p>\n<p>Best,\nFred</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

So far [claimID][] seems to be good for just people finding out about me.\r\n\r\nBy the way, this is not criticism or a put-down of [claimID][] - this is me thinking out loud and puzzling it out.\r\n\r\n*Update:*  Although, I certainly understand the utility of [microID][] in replacing [blog posts like this one](http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron/2006/08/for_technorati.html).\r\n\r\n[bb]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/18/see-also\r\n[microid]: http://microid.org/\r\n[claimid]: http://claimid.org/\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083474\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://chimprawk.blogspot.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=77afe52123d8667fe867cf1a707e397b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://chimprawk.blogspot.com\">Fred</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083474\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-20T18:01:06\">2006-08-20T18:01:06</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>These are really quite valid questions, and stuff as important as identity does deserve our puzzling.  ClaimID is a model - just as blogs enabled millions of people to share their voice online, claimID lets people have a way to approach their identity.  Simple? Yes - but that's the point.  There are tons of people out there who have stuff about them online (mailing list archives, blog comments) who don't have the time, desire or expertiese to create a myname.com site, or even a html list of links about themselves.  ClaimID is designed so that these people can have a dead simple solution for a fundamental need.  </p>\n\n<p>Of course, on top of that you do get value adds...the personal SEO stuff is nice, having your links tied together for search engines are nice, the microformats stuff, link status checking, having an OpenID, and so on - but the main experience is the simplicity.  For as important as identity is, most people really still aren't going out of their way to protect/defend their names.  Maybe this will change in the future, maybe it won't - but we are betting that the way to get people in the door, to start them thinking about the process is through simplicity.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, though, we're still figuring all of this out.  Identity is huge, complicated, loaded with meaning and interpretation - and we aren't going to say that we've got all the answers.  But reading posts, responding, listening - we really feel like we're learning a lot.  Our goal down the road is for ClaimID to be a place where you can simply an easily have your identity needs met.  That said, we're still working on it, and thanks for being part of the process! </p>\n\n<p>Best,\nFred</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

Indeed, they also help considerably with the problem of expressing this kind of machine-readable data in HTML. But \"FOAF would be a lot more useful if it didn’t rely on RDF.\" - the power, the expressivity of FOAF comes from RDF. </p>\n<p>I suspect Bob (like Mad William) may be assuming RDF (including FOAF) has to mean RDF/XML. But RDF is a model, it doesn't have to serialize to XML, there are other formats - including HTML (via <a href=\"http://research.talis.com/2005/erdf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">eRDF</a>).

I would contend that FOAF's expressivity actually relies far, far more, simply on XML's ability to namespace things, and thus allow for extensions.  Something that a simple XML dialect would also have, but with the added bonus of an infinitely simpler parser, fewer confused programmers, and quite a bit less bandwidth consumed.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085270\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://tantek.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02cd45622e90350cc061aaaa02229195&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://tantek.com/\">Tantek Çelik</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085270\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-20T07:22:55\">2006-08-20T07:22:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Indeed Les, this is exactly what <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard\" rel=\"nofollow\">hCard</a> solves on the Web with the minimum of duplication of data into hidden places and mimetype hackery/configuration (problems of the other approaches mentioned).</p>\n<p>You can either use a 3rd party service like claimID as mentioned to claim your various profiles on the Web, or you can simply continue to publish your profile information on your about or author page, simply add just a bit of hCard markup, and use <a href=\"http://www.gmpg.org/xfn/and/#idconsolidation\" rel=\"nofollow\">XFN Identity Consolidation</a> (rel=\"me\") to turn your about page into your consolidated identity hub.</p>\n<p>While services will undoubtedly continue to ask you a hundred profile questions, the better ones will do something as simple as use the simple open source <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/hkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">hKit Microformats Toolkit</a> by <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drew McLellan</a> to let you simply enter your hCard URL and fill out all the questions automatically from that.</p>\n<p>And the best services will help you, the user, keep your profile as portable as you would like it, by marking it up with hCard as well.  Already, profiles on numerous services, in addition to the abovementioned claimID, like <a href=\"http://flickr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flickr</a> and <a href=\"http://technorati.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Technorati</a> are marked up with hCard and thus ready for reuse with services that use hKit.</p>\n<p>Finally, some have brought up \"extensibility\" as something that is desirable yet recent lessons have taught us that in terms of standards and interoperability, the opposite is true.  The more well-defined not-infinitely-extensible a standard is, the sooner implementers know they are \"done\" implementing it (interoperably even!), and the less chance there is of a zillion non-interoperable extensions randomly emerging (i.e. Tower of Babel problem) which then cause headaches not only for all implementers, but users as well as the users then have to contend with their data not quite working interoperably across all the different services that all support slightly different sets of incompatible/non-interoperable extensions.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085272\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://macgirvin.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=74685c9f342f159611317a68c2655218&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://macgirvin.com\">Mike Macgirvin</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085272\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-22T20:38:14\">2006-08-22T20:38:14</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with Steve. Who am I? It depends. Who are you, and based on that - what do I wish you to know about me? Who are my friends? Same thing. Even if I wanted to divulge them, I then need to  respect their privacy wishes and decide if they want you to know that they are a friend of mine (or not) and how they came to be tagged as friends. A web service which tries to consolidate all of this info is presented with too many privacy conflicts to ever get it right (IMAO). I can recall this concept being tried by a hundred different companies (not to mention open source projects) going back to the early 90's. It was never an issue of technology. The hurdles are primarily social and revolve around trust and privacy - and delegation of these rights to third parties in language even my mother would understand.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085274\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dekoration.cc\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f67e69a66a666638b4e3ba3b9fa68eda&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dekoration.cc\">Wohnaccessoires</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085274\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-16T22:04:59\">2007-03-16T22:04:59</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>But you’re forgetting that a lot of people, myself included, like to represent themselves in different ways on different sites.

    "body": "I'm tired of filling out profiles, and I'm tired of building up networks of others' profiles online.  Everyone needs to adopt something like <strike>[FOAF](http://www.foaf-project.org/)</strike> [hCard][] and [XFN][] (updated per suggestion from [Kevin Marks][]), and be done with it.

Indeed, they also help considerably with the problem of expressing this kind of machine-readable data in HTML. But \"FOAF would be a lot more useful if it didn’t rely on RDF.\" - the power, the expressivity of FOAF comes from RDF. </p>\n\n<p>I suspect Bob (like Mad William) may be assuming RDF (including FOAF) has to mean RDF/XML. But RDF is a model, it doesn't have to serialize to XML, there are other formats - including HTML (via <a href=\"http://research.talis.com/2005/erdf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">eRDF</a>). Note too that microformats like XFN and hCard can be interpreted as RDF (including FOAF terms as appropriate) with <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/spec\" rel=\"nofollow\">GRDDL</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(Incidentally I got to this post before even looking in my personal agg via Marc Canter's on <a href=\"http://planetweb20.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planet Web 2.0</a>)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085268\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e664d95e68ab4e364b35fabb89c8fdee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Steve</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085268\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-19T17:37:36\">2006-08-19T17:37:36</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>But you're forgetting that a lot of people, myself included, like to represent themselves in different ways on different sites.

I would contend that FOAF's expressivity actually relies far, far more, simply on XML's ability to namespace things, and thus allow for extensions.  Something that a simple XML dialect would also have, but with the added bonus of an infinitely simpler parser, fewer confused programmers, and quite a bit less bandwidth consumed.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085270\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://tantek.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02cd45622e90350cc061aaaa02229195&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://tantek.com/\">Tantek Çelik</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085270\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-20T07:22:55\">2006-08-20T07:22:55</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Indeed Les, this is exactly what <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard\" rel=\"nofollow\">hCard</a> solves on the Web with the minimum of duplication of data into hidden places and mimetype hackery/configuration (problems of the other approaches mentioned).</p>\n\n<p>You can either use a 3rd party service like claimID as mentioned to claim your various profiles on the Web, or you can simply continue to publish your profile information on your about or author page, simply add just a bit of hCard markup, and use <a href=\"http://www.gmpg.org/xfn/and/#idconsolidation\" rel=\"nofollow\">XFN Identity Consolidation</a> (rel=\"me\") to turn your about page into your consolidated identity hub.</p>\n\n<p>While services will undoubtedly continue to ask you a hundred profile questions, the better ones will do something as simple as use the simple open source <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/hkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">hKit Microformats Toolkit</a> by <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drew McLellan</a> to let you simply enter your hCard URL and fill out all the questions automatically from that.</p>\n\n<p>And the best services will help you, the user, keep your profile as portable as you would like it, by marking it up with hCard as well.  Already, profiles on numerous services, in addition to the abovementioned claimID, like <a href=\"http://flickr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flickr</a> and <a href=\"http://technorati.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Technorati</a> are marked up with hCard and thus ready for reuse with services that use hKit.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, some have brought up \"extensibility\" as something that is desirable yet recent lessons have taught us that in terms of standards and interoperability, the opposite is true.  The more well-defined not-infinitely-extensible a standard is, the sooner implementers know they are \"done\" implementing it (interoperably even!), and the less chance there is of a zillion non-interoperable extensions randomly emerging (i.e. Tower of Babel problem) which then cause headaches not only for all implementers, but users as well as the users then have to contend with their data not quite working interoperably across all the different services that all support slightly different sets of incompatible/non-interoperable extensions.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085272\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://macgirvin.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=74685c9f342f159611317a68c2655218&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://macgirvin.com\">Mike Macgirvin</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085272\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-22T20:38:14\">2006-08-22T20:38:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with Steve. Who am I? It depends. Who are you, and based on that - what do I wish you to know about me? Who are my friends? Same thing. Even if I wanted to divulge them, I then need to  respect their privacy wishes and decide if they want you to know that they are a friend of mine (or not) and how they came to be tagged as friends. A web service which tries to consolidate all of this info is presented with too many privacy conflicts to ever get it right (IMAO). I can recall this concept being tried by a hundred different companies (not to mention open source projects) going back to the early 90's. It was never an issue of technology. The hurdles are primarily social and revolve around trust and privacy - and delegation of these rights to third parties in language even my mother would understand.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085274\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://dekoration.cc\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f67e69a66a666638b4e3ba3b9fa68eda&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://dekoration.cc\">Wohnaccessoires</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085274\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-16T22:04:59\">2007-03-16T22:04:59</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>But you’re forgetting that a lot of people, myself included, like to represent themselves in different ways on different sites.

I admit to missing that.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083626\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.zimbio.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=42126bafe51bf3025dc2ce7033db5499&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.zimbio.com\">Danny</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083626\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-08-04T20:59:50\">2006-08-04T20:59:50</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I wouldn't worry about it.

    "html": "<p>Holy crap, is my favorite keyboard filthy.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that I&#39;ve finally gotten it into some good direct lighting or what, but this thing is a blatant mess.  It&#39;s <i>almost</i> embarassing.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve been using the same <a href=\"http://pfuca-store.stores.yahoo.net/haphackeylit1.html\">Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite 2, PS/2 style</a>, for about 8 years now.  I&#39;ve taken it with me to every desk at every job since 1998 or so, along with some variety or another of trackballs.  (I&#39;m using a <a href=\"http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2150,CONTENTID=5003\">Logitech Marble Mouse</a> these days, pining for my classic Centipede-style 4-button Kensington Expert Mouse - and not <a href=\"http://us.kensington.com/html/2200.html\">this monstrosity</a> with its botched scroll ring.)</p>\n<p>The keyboard has sprouted a USB adapter along the way, which barely seems to work on OS X machines after a few attempts at plugging and replugging.  I&#39;ve gotten to like this keyboard so much that I just can&#39;t work for long on anything else.  </p>\n<p>In fact, when I spend too long with a fat keyboard and standard mouse, my wrists start complaining within the hour.  I suspect it has something to do with the fact that, with the HHKB, my hands remain mostly out in front of me with occasional flicks over to the trackball - as opposed to hovering always slightly over to the left, with wandering twists <i>way over</i> to the right.</p>\n<p>So anyway...  Just how the hell do you clean a keyboard?  Do I really have to meticulously pry off every keycap, spend an evening stripping it and cleaning it on the dining room table like a pistol?  Can I run it through the dishwasher?  Should I just give up and order a new USB version?  Or, is the filth good for me - is it actually fortifying my immune system with 8-year-old bugs?</p>\n<p><b>Update (8/1):</b> For the benefit of someone who may someday land on this entry after searching, like me, for &quot;happy hacking keyboard dishwasher&quot; - know that my keyboard did indeed survive a trip through a wash and rinse cycle.</p>\n<p><b>However!</b> I didn&#39;t put the whole thing into the machine.  I first had the presence of mind to try taking it apart.  Turns out that the top half of the keyboard - to which all the grunge was confined - was entirely plastic.  All the electronics - pristine and new-smelling after all these years - resided in the bottom half of the shell.  They stayed dry.</p>\n<p>I did end up popping out all the keys after all, though.  This was because not all the grunge got removed in the dishwasher, and because the keys were incredibly quick and easy to pop out from the underside with a fingernail press - as opposed to prying out from above with a screwdriver as I&#39;d previously tried.  </p>\n<p>I scrubbed clean the keyless top half, soaked the keys themselves for a little while, then dried everything overnight - and this morning, everything&#39;s good as new after reassembly!</p>\n<p>Now, having seen this thing disassembled, I should note that this favorite keyboard of mine seems to be really well built.  The top half of the keyboard shell is a solid piece, and each key is slotted into a well that has an up-turned lip.  No crumbs, hair, grunge, or spillage of any kind had ever made its way down into the interior of the keyboard in all these years of being a desk-lunch eating slob of a human.  I&#39;m not sure how many keyboards are built this way, but this one&#39;s great!</p>\n<p>If only I could clean my PowerBook keyboard so easily.  Now, <em>that&#39;s</em> a nasty piece of work, right there.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087797\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b6292d5084c21760f6984f2df869f4e6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Andrew Heaton</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087797\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-07-31T17:42:35\">2006-07-31T17:42:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Best way I've found is to unplug the keyboard (unless you love the sound of the error ding) get some non-abrasive solvent cleaner (mr. clean works) in a small bucket with warm water.</p>\n<p>Get a cloth (not a sponge) and wring it well, you don't want the water collecting between the keys.</p>\n<p>Rub each key individually.

    "body": "Holy crap, is my favorite keyboard filthy.  I don't know if it's that I've finally gotten it into some good direct lighting or what, but this thing is a blatant mess.  It's <i>almost</i> embarassing.\r\n\r\nI've been using the same <a href=\"http://pfuca-store.stores.yahoo.net/haphackeylit1.html\">Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite 2, PS/2 style</a>, for about 8 years now.  I've taken it with me to every desk at every job since 1998 or so, along with some variety or another of trackballs.  (I'm using a <a href=\"http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2150,CONTENTID=5003\">Logitech Marble Mouse</a> these days, pining for my classic Centipede-style 4-button Kensington Expert Mouse - and not <a href=\"http://us.kensington.com/html/2200.html\">this monstrosity</a> with its botched scroll ring.)\r\n\r\nThe keyboard has sprouted a USB adapter along the way, which barely seems to work on OS X machines after a few attempts at plugging and replugging.  I've gotten to like this keyboard so much that I just can't work for long on anything else.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, when I spend too long with a fat keyboard and standard mouse, my wrists start complaining within the hour.  I suspect it has something to do with the fact that, with the HHKB, my hands remain mostly out in front of me with occasional flicks over to the trackball - as opposed to hovering always slightly over to the left, with wandering twists <i>way over</i> to the right.\r\n\r\nSo anyway...  Just how the hell do you clean a keyboard?  Do I really have to meticulously pry off every keycap, spend an evening stripping it and cleaning it on the dining room table like a pistol?  Can I run it through the dishwasher?  Should I just give up and order a new USB version?  Or, is the filth good for me - is it actually fortifying my immune system with 8-year-old bugs?\r\n\r\n<b>Update (8/1):</b> For the benefit of someone who may someday land on this entry after searching, like me, for \"happy hacking keyboard dishwasher\" - know that my keyboard did indeed survive a trip through a wash and rinse cycle.\r\n\r\n<b>However!</b> I didn't put the whole thing into the machine.  I first had the presence of mind to try taking it apart.  Turns out that the top half of the keyboard - to which all the grunge was confined - was entirely plastic.  All the electronics - pristine and new-smelling after all these years - resided in the bottom half of the shell.  They stayed dry.\r\n\r\nI did end up popping out all the keys after all, though.  This was because not all the grunge got removed in the dishwasher, and because the keys were incredibly quick and easy to pop out from the underside with a fingernail press - as opposed to prying out from above with a screwdriver as I'd previously tried.  \r\n\r\nI scrubbed clean the keyless top half, soaked the keys themselves for a little while, then dried everything overnight - and this morning, everything's good as new after reassembly!\r\n\r\nNow, having seen this thing disassembled, I should note that this favorite keyboard of mine seems to be really well built.  The top half of the keyboard shell is a solid piece, and each key is slotted into a well that has an up-turned lip.  No crumbs, hair, grunge, or spillage of any kind had ever made its way down into the interior of the keyboard in all these years of being a desk-lunch eating slob of a human.  I'm not sure how many keyboards are built this way, but this one's great!\r\n\r\nIf only I could clean my PowerBook keyboard so easily.  Now, *that's* a nasty piece of work, right there.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087797\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b6292d5084c21760f6984f2df869f4e6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Andrew Heaton</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087797\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-07-31T17:42:35\">2006-07-31T17:42:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Best way I've found is to unplug the keyboard (unless you love the sound of the error ding) get some non-abrasive solvent cleaner (mr. clean works) in a small bucket with warm water.</p>\n\n<p>Get a cloth (not a sponge) and wring it well, you don't want the water collecting between the keys.</p>\n\n<p>Rub each key individually.

Opera was the last of the major browser vendors to add XSLT support  -- while there are still a few broken areas[2, 3], things are getting better.  In short, IE 5.x+, Mozilla, and Safari <em>ALL</em> support XSLT 1.0, with Opera only a few functions short of full support.</p>\n<p>Theres a lot that can be done in this area, and dependent on a few factors that may boost its arrival, expect to see a TON more in this area from my direction in regards to OSS software projects released that build and extend from this in a BIG way.</p>\n<p>[1] http://www.xsltblog.com/archives/2005/12/finally<em>someone</em>1.html\n[2] http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2006/06/opera<em>90</em>final<em>released.html\n[3] http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2006/07/no</em>sign<em>of</em>document<em>function</em>b.html</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090477\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ryaneby.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a39511a191d7d36ac030ae25f0fb3121&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ryaneby.com\">Eby</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090477\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-07-31T16:20:06\">2006-07-31T16:20:06</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>The change was recent.

So, I figure it&#39;s about time I make some sort of peep.</p>\n<p>Along the way - in fact in the midst of our move - I upgraded this blog to WP 2.0 and broke a number of things.  Hopefully, things are stabilized enough now to offer you this exercise to compare recent experiences in Michigan and California:</p>\n<style type=\"text/css\">   .comparecontrast { width: 98%; font-size: 0.85em;  } .comparecontrast tr th, .comparecontrast tr td { width: 50%; padding: 0.7em; border: 1px dotted #888; vertical-align: top }  </style>\n<table class=\"comparecontrast\">\n<tr>\n<th>Michigan</th>\n<th>California</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GMT-5</td>\n<td>GMT-8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Partly cloudy, warm summer sun</td>\n<td>Not a cloud in the sky, daystar bakery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moist air, scents of green dew and cut suburban grass</td>\n<td>Warm, dry air carrying scents of magnolia? (I guess that's what it is, anyway - correct me if I'm wrong!)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Two-story 1100 sqft townhouse in Royal Oak, MI, with a spacious basement, full of our stuff</td>\n<td>Second-floor 950 sqft apartment in Santa Clara, CA, with a small balcony, devoid of our stuff</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Two spotted ocicats and two dwarf bunnies</td>\n<td>Two spotted ocicats and two dwarf bunnies - thank goodness!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 minute commute, driving down Woodward in a Ford Focus ZX3, listening to podcasts</td>\n<td>30 minute commute, with a walk of 3 blocks and a surprisingly non-scary bus ride, listening to podcasts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Free Starbucks coffee at work</td>\n<td>Free Bean Trees barista-crafted latte at work</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Zipping around a familiar town in a nimble Ford Focus ZX3</td>\n<td>Lumbering around an unfamiliar town in a clumsy Pontiac Montana rental</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sleeping in a canopy bed, with cushy pillow top mattress</td>\n<td>Sleeping on leaky air mattresses - the girl's in particular has failed spectacularly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Friends and family close by, though we hermits rarely venture out to visit</td>\n<td>Friends and family far away, we hermits wishing we'd gotten out more</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Familiar default choices for lazy take-out dinner</td>\n<td>Every night's dinner is an adventure into the unknown</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>White Castle is a purveyor of evil gut bombs</td>\n<td>Weinerschnitzel is a purveyor of evil gut bombs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dairy Deluxe in Birmingham, MI is good frozen yogurt</td>\n<td>Yumi Yogurt in Santa Clara, CA is good frozen yogurt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Steady internet access</td>\n<td>Frustratingly intermittent cable modem connection</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\nAs you can see, this is a study in sudden unfamiliarities.  Our Focus actually arrived this past Monday night, and we returned the Montana to the airport last night - so that chapter of the move has closed.  I hear that our stuff will arrive tomorrow, so hopefully we'll be on our way to finally settling in by this weekend.\n\n<p>After that... I don&#39;t know.

    "body": "It's been over a month since my last update here, and a week and one day since <a href=\"http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2006/07/hello_world.html\">I started here at my new job in sunny California</a>.  So, I figure it's about time I make some sort of peep.\r\n\r\nAlong the way - in fact in the midst of our move - I upgraded this blog to WP 2.0 and broke a number of things.  Hopefully, things are stabilized enough now to offer you this exercise to compare recent experiences in Michigan and California:\r\n\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">   .comparecontrast { width: 98%; font-size: 0.85em;  } .comparecontrast tr th, .comparecontrast tr td { width: 50%; padding: 0.7em; border: 1px dotted #888; vertical-align: top }  </style>\r\n<table class=\"comparecontrast\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Michigan</th>\r\n<th>California</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>GMT-5</td>\r\n<td>GMT-8</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Partly cloudy, warm summer sun</td>\r\n<td>Not a cloud in the sky, daystar bakery</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Moist air, scents of green dew and cut suburban grass</td>\r\n<td>Warm, dry air carrying scents of magnolia?

Our Focus actually arrived this past Monday night, and we returned the Montana to the airport last night - so that chapter of the move has closed.  I hear that our stuff will arrive tomorrow, so hopefully we'll be on our way to finally settling in by this weekend.\r\n\r\nAfter that... I don't know.   I'm hoping we can finally establish a home base of some stability, then consider venturing out to the wonderful nearby city and maybe start to meet some people in the area.

We may be looking again in a year, once we&#39;ve gotten a sense for the lay of the land.  Thanks for all the wonderful advice, everyone!</em></p>\n<p>So, as <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/24/go-west-young-man\">I revealed in the previous post</a>, we&#39;re moving to California so I can take a job at Yahoo! in Santa Clara.  I&#39;m excited as hell, but I&#39;m also pulling all my hair out and losing sleep.  Luckily, I have a lot of hair and I drink a lot of coffee, but we have a lot of details to work out.  I&#39;m hoping that I might get some advice from you out there, dear readers.  Also, I think I&#39;d like to get the chance to <em>meet</em> you at some point.</p>\n<p>We&#39;re getting relocation assistance, which will help greatly.  However, it looks like we&#39;ll need to do some rush apartment shopping ourselves, and in short order.  We&#39;ve never done anything like this before, and don&#39;t want to end up in a crap place that looked good on the interweb, only to move again in 6 months.</p>\n<p>We went on honeymoon to San Francisco, and briefly visited Mountain View in the course of our travels.  We liked the downtown area, had good sushi and bubble tea.  So at the moment, Mountain View is our dart-in-the-map choice for apartment search.  Office is in Santa Clara, so the maps tell me that Sunnyvale and Santa Clara might be good spots too.</p>\n<p>Any ideas out there?  Horror stories of places to avoid?  Hints as to what&#39;s good and where?</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090237\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=15cf42a96576559fee2a0f904427b8a0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Joe</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090237\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-24T21:08:52\">2006-06-24T21:08:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Everybody who relocates here seems to land in Mountain View/Sunnyvale/Santa Clara first, since that's where all the companies are located.

If you enjoy eating out and spending time outside be prepared to spent most of your time elsewhere.</p>\n<p>After living here for a few years, there are only two towns on the Peninsula where I would even consider living. Mountain View and Palo Alto. Both towns have nice a downtown area, pleasant weather, are close enough to the city for those times when you really need a city rather than town, and the commute to work is very acceptable from either.</p>\n<p>How do the two stack up against each other? One plus for Palo alto, I slightly prefer University Ave. to Castro. One very big minus for Palo Alto, and the reason I chose Mountain View - is the housing situation. Reasonably priced housing in Palo Alto is meant for Stanford students living off campus and are genuine hell holes, the nicer housing starts at ~$2k/mo for a smallish 1BD, last I looked.</p>\n<p>My .02.

Palo Alto is terribly expensive and is a bit full of itself. Mountain View is ideally located between jobs in San Jose/Santa Clara/Sunnyvale and fun/culture in San Francisco. Rick and I lived in both Mountain View and Palo Alto. I preferred Palo Alto because it had more personality and, I'll admit it, I liked the cachet. When we lived there, Menlo Park, Saratoga, Los Altos, and Los Gatos attracted more older people... and I'm older than you so I don't know if those would be a great fit. Could have changed in the six years since I moved away though. </p>\n<p>Congratulations on your new job. How exciting!

From what I've heard, housing prices have been steady or on the decline since then.</p>\n<p>Personally, I never found much to do outside of eating and hiking/biking in Palo Alto proper, though -- there are a handful of movie theaters, bars, etc., but Stanford is insular enough as a community that there didn't seem to be much nightlife.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090246\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://meandeu.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=74685c9f342f159611317a68c2655218&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://meandeu.com\">Mike Macgirvin</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090246\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-26T16:05:35\">2006-06-26T16:05:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I used to run a music store on Castro Street, so could tell you a lot about Mountain View, but that's not the point here. Basically you're looking at a price pyramid going north with Palo Alto at the top and San Jose at the bottom (there are lots of exceptions but this is the high level overview). Palo Alto is the home of the million dollar 2-br bungalow. Mountain View is right on the edge with million dollar Eichlers. You'll get the most house for the money in Sunnyvale (where I live), and somewhat cheaper, but often smaller houses in Santa Clara. I'd live in Mountain View without hesitation, but I wouldn't buy a house there.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090247\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c19b0cb36d7f40d163e81b1be8da7622&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/\">Jeremy Zawodny</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090247\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-27T04:17:19\">2006-06-27T04:17:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Holy crap!</p>\n<p>I miseed the announcement.

The rental apartments and houses are fine, but you'll have to drive quite a way to get somewhere interesting. </p>\n<p>My advice - check out the northern end of the Valley. San Mateo, Palo Alto, Mountain View -- all of these have something that passes for a liveable environment outside working hours.

    "body": "<strong>Update</strong> (7/26): <em>We ended up taking a place in Santa Clara, CA, a minute or two away from Santana Row.  We may be looking again in a year, once we've gotten a sense for the lay of the land.  Thanks for all the wonderful advice, everyone!</em>\r\n\r\nSo, as <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/24/go-west-young-man\">I revealed in the previous post</a>, we're moving to California so I can take a job at Yahoo! in Santa Clara.  I'm excited as hell, but I'm also pulling all my hair out and losing sleep.  Luckily, I have a lot of hair and I drink a lot of coffee, but we have a lot of details to work out.  I'm hoping that I might get some advice from you out there, dear readers.  Also, I think I'd like to get the chance to <em>meet</em> you at some point.\r\n\r\nWe're getting relocation assistance, which will help greatly.  However, it looks like we'll need to do some rush apartment shopping ourselves, and in short order.  We've never done anything like this before, and don't want to end up in a crap place that looked good on the interweb, only to move again in 6 months.\r\n\r\nWe went on honeymoon to San Francisco, and briefly visited Mountain View in the course of our travels.  We liked the downtown area, had good sushi and bubble tea.  So at the moment, Mountain View is our dart-in-the-map choice for apartment search.  Office is in Santa Clara, so the maps tell me that Sunnyvale and Santa Clara might be good spots too.\r\n\r\nAny ideas out there?  Horror stories of places to avoid?  Hints as to what's good and where?\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090237\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=15cf42a96576559fee2a0f904427b8a0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Joe</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090237\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-24T21:08:52\">2006-06-24T21:08:52</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Everybody who relocates here seems to land in Mountain View/Sunnyvale/Santa Clara first, since that's where all the companies are located.

They're all on Caltrain, of course.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090240\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f47aa861fb4680c668fcf8e0a1db90a1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Eric L</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090240\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-24T23:29:07\">2006-06-24T23:29:07</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>IMHO don't get your hopes up for Santa Clara and Sunnyvale, they're bedroom communities and are dreadfully dull. If you enjoy eating out and spending time outside be prepared to spent most of your time elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>After living here for a few years, there are only two towns on the Peninsula where I would even consider living. Mountain View and Palo Alto. Both towns have nice a downtown area, pleasant weather, are close enough to the city for those times when you really need a city rather than town, and the commute to work is very acceptable from either.</p>\n\n<p>How do the two stack up against each other? One plus for Palo alto, I slightly prefer University Ave. to Castro. One very big minus for Palo Alto, and the reason I chose Mountain View - is the housing situation. Reasonably priced housing in Palo Alto is meant for Stanford students living off campus and are genuine hell holes, the nicer housing starts at ~$2k/mo for a smallish 1BD, last I looked.</p>\n\n<p>My .02.

Palo Alto is terribly expensive and is a bit full of itself. Mountain View is ideally located between jobs in San Jose/Santa Clara/Sunnyvale and fun/culture in San Francisco. Rick and I lived in both Mountain View and Palo Alto. I preferred Palo Alto because it had more personality and, I'll admit it, I liked the cachet. When we lived there, Menlo Park, Saratoga, Los Altos, and Los Gatos attracted more older people... and I'm older than you so I don't know if those would be a great fit.

Not as close as Mountain View, but not nearly as expensive.</p>\n\n<p>I'd avoid East San Jose as the commute will be miserable, despite the proximity - most of the roads from East SJ to the Yahoo! campuses are feeders for highways 680 and 880, which are the main arteries for probably half of the folks who work in San Jose (and can't afford to live there).</p>\n\n<p>http://www.housingmaps.com/ is an EXCELLENT tool for remote apartment hunting. Someone's feeding the residential listings from Craigslist into Google Maps, so you can enter your search parameters and filtered results are overlaid on the Google Map with links to the Craigslist listing. Craigslist is far and away the best tool for apartment hunting here besides just plain driving around looking for signs.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090263\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://yushans.com/dailies\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d446844d12dd7c9ef6758b11efcb2728&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://yushans.com/dailies\">Yu Shan</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090263\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-07-01T22:28:03\">2006-07-01T22:28:03</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>As a Yahoo! formerly from SNV office I recommend downtown Sunnyvale area around Mathilda and El Camino. It's close to the MC office, and this is the big plus. The downtown area is being revamped by summer of '07 where there will be a new mall with open air walking areas. Even now it's a pretty cute area with summer concerts and a Saturday morning farmer's market. Walking distance to many things such as Trader Joe's, Best Buy, Sportsmart, and Baja Fresh. Find me on backyard if you want to hear more.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090265\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1b5f10704d389b082c8293d870451ba9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Will Parker</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090265\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-07-02T04:30:45\">2006-07-02T04:30:45</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I recently had a contract job at Apple, and I picked an apartment in Cupertino near Apple campus near DeAnza College along Stevens Creek Boulevard. Although Cupertino was a nice enough place to work, there are <em>ABSOLUTELY</em> no cultural amenities in Cupertino. No movie theaters, no bookstores, nothing but chain stores. The rental apartments and houses are fine, but you'll have to drive quite a way to get somewhere interesting. </p>\n\n<p>My advice - check out the northern end of the Valley. San Mateo, Palo Alto, Mountain View -- all of these have something that passes for a liveable environment outside working hours. If you can stand a longer commute and your salary permits, consider living in San Francisco and commuting down to Santa Clara via CalTrain.</p>\n\n<p>Congratulations on your wedding and your new job!</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090266\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://holygoat.co.uk\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b9bd2635d5d04e0bf9c81b9467996cf5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://holygoat.co.uk\">Rich</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090266\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-07-06T04:51:06\">2006-07-06T04:51:06</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Mike: I do believe I bought a guitar from you last year!

    "html": " <p>In the first half of this year, I've been really busy.  My fits of posts and stretches of silence around here can attest to that.  In fact, I've been so busy that I managed to finish a book, get married, and go on a honeymoon - all whilst being fully engaged in a dayjob.</p>\n <p>My new wife had it easy this year - instead of her usual full load of university classes and all the jobs she does for both of us, all she had to do was plan a wedding and arrange a honeymoon!  (And in case you've never planned a wedding, you should know that I'm being sarcastic here.  My lovely bride has been busier than you could imagine.  I helped, but not nearly enough.)</p>\n <p>The one thing that we haven't done this year - which I've somehow managed to do almost every year for the past decade - is packup and move.  We even moved last year while I was in the middle of writing my first book, albeit only about a quarter-mile down the road.</p><p>The obvious conclusion, then, is that neither my wife nor I have been busy enough this year.  It's time to move again.</p>\n <p>But, there'll be no cakewalk quarter-mile jaunts for us this time.  No, this year - in fact, in the next month - we'll somehow be moving almost 2500 miles away.  Yes, that's right:  We're moving from the Detroit, MI area to the Bay Area in California, and I'm not quite sure how it's all going to work out.  But, I do know that we need to be there before July 17th.</p>\n <p>And, why is the 17th of July a significant date, you ask?  Well, that's when I start work at Yahoo! in Santa Clara, of course.</p>\n <p>I've tried to be a bit cagey about my job and employers over the past few years, just to avoid difficulties and unnecessary disclosures - but this change in career is a big one that I just can't keep under wraps.  Of course, I'm not planning to blog every little detail and become another \"fired for blogging\" statistic on the superhighway, but I'm admitting this much.  And, damn, am I excited.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084828\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ejohn.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b3e04a46e85ad3e165d66f5d927eb609&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ejohn.org/\">John Resig</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084828\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-24T17:28:52\">2006-06-24T17:28:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>This is great news!

    "body": " <p>In the first half of this year, I've been really busy.  My fits of posts and stretches of silence around here can attest to that.  In fact, I've been so busy that I managed to finish a book, get married, and go on a honeymoon - all whilst being fully engaged in a dayjob.</p>\r\n <p>My new wife had it easy this year - instead of her usual full load of university classes and all the jobs she does for both of us, all she had to do was plan a wedding and arrange a honeymoon!  (And in case you've never planned a wedding, you should know that I'm being sarcastic here.  My lovely bride has been busier than you could imagine.  I helped, but not nearly enough.)</p>\r\n <p>The one thing that we haven't done this year - which I've somehow managed to do almost every year for the past decade - is packup and move.  We even moved last year while I was in the middle of writing my first book, albeit only about a quarter-mile down the road.</p><p>The obvious conclusion, then, is that neither my wife nor I have been busy enough this year.  It's time to move again.</p>\r\n <p>But, there'll be no cakewalk quarter-mile jaunts for us this time.  No, this year - in fact, in the next month - we'll somehow be moving almost 2500 miles away.  Yes, that's right:  We're moving from the Detroit, MI area to the Bay Area in California, and I'm not quite sure how it's all going to work out.  But, I do know that we need to be there before July 17th.</p>\r\n <p>And, why is the 17th of July a significant date, you ask?  Well, that's when I start work at Yahoo! in Santa Clara, of course.</p>\r\n <p>I've tried to be a bit cagey about my job and employers over the past few years, just to avoid difficulties and unnecessary disclosures - but this change in career is a big one that I just can't keep under wraps.  Of course, I'm not planning to blog every little detail and become another \"fired for blogging\" statistic on the superhighway, but I'm admitting this much.  And, damn, am I excited.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084828\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ejohn.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b3e04a46e85ad3e165d66f5d927eb609&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ejohn.org/\">John Resig</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084828\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-24T17:28:52\">2006-06-24T17:28:52</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>This is great news!

    "html": " <p>Lately, in between wedding preparations and other goings on of late, I've been doing some navel gazing and thinking about my enthusiasms and what's next.  And, there's one conclusion to which I've come, which is yet half-formed but I think interesting to admit and explore.</p>\n <p>You see, the realization to which I've come is that - in the realm of recreational programming, at least - I could be best described as a <i>serial enthusiast</i>.</p>\n <p>What's that mean?  Well, just look at my history throughout the archives of this blog.  I've flitted from nano-project to nano-project, a hack here and a hack there.  But, other than in projects where someone's expecting something from me and (preferrably) paying me - I have a very fickle attention span.  If you hire me, or have me sign a contract, I'll stick to schedule and deliver as best I can - no worries about that.  When I'm in \"professional mode,\" I run on different premises and motivations.  But, left to my own devices, I will freewheel and wander between a slew of part-time obsessions.</p>\n <p>Of course, on frequent occassion, I return to the themes and constructions I've visited in the past.  This has the effect of a sort of sustained, incremental development of my nano-projects, well distributed across time.  I drive myself through development sprints, but never quite finish complete products.  I share the code, in whatever state I've left it, in the hopes that someone might find it useful - but very rarely do I wrap things up with a bow.</p>\n <p>This is <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/03/11/Recreational-Programming\"><i>recreational programming</i></a>.  I enjoy the process much more than I do the results.  This is why I have no particular worries about under what license I release my work.  Go right ahead: <b>Share and Enjoy</b> my Sudoku puzzle solutions, because I'm done with them.  After all, were I ever to finish something useful, I might get sucked into it and anchored down to supporting it when my interest has faded - and that's no fun, unless there's another source of reward available for continuing the work.</p>\n <p>And this is why I think that so far - unless I find something of particular lasting interest or work on modifying my habits - I'll never be a successful entrepreneur on my own.  I've got ideas and skills, sure - but I need a partner, or a manager, to keep me and everything else to a coherent and sustained path.  I've got energy and I've got creativity, but I need others as <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/mind/stories/s1391503.htm\">social prosthetics</a> to herd me and my mental cats.</p>\n <p>So what's my point in all of this?  Mostly just writing to think this notion through.  I'm sure this isn't a terribly original self-discovery, but it's one that I wanted to admit and elaborate so that I can at least explain myself to myself and work with it.  And, having said all that, I thought that there just might be some others freewheeling around out there with whom the phrase \"serial enthusiast\" might hold some meaning, too.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082616\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://xmlhacker.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5159227f15ff6247f88542812f866c4f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://xmlhacker.com\">M.

I joined the club about 3 years ago.  If you need any help finding your way around, let me know... I've come to know these parts quite well now, so if I can be of assistance, by all means, please let me know. :D</p>\n<p>BTW...  Isn't it a refreshing moment when you finally give into the notion of letting go of the idea that you have to push yourself a certain direction, or commit to being a certain way, just to feel like you are something the world would like you to be, yet nothing you want to be?</p>\n<p>I know it was for me, and the result, as it turns out, has been marvelous!  Over the course of the last three years I have developed friendships, and relationships with folks of which each contained a quality I didn't have, yet our personalities and overall hacking habits were for all intents and purposes, the same thing...  Not completely, but just enough of the same thing to help in understanding that youre not alone in this, yet just enough difference to garner the admiration and respect that we tend to develop for our hacking brothers and sisters who have developed a fairly specialized skill that fits nicely into filling an area in which needs filling in regards to a long term brainstorm-based project, in which the project itself has a general purpose, yet no immediatelly clear definition as to where the proper focus needs to be place.</p>\n<p>Recently, a group of folks I have been working with in various degress for the last 2+ years finally brought together some of the final pieces of a project we all have had interest in, and things are finally taking the final shape, of which consists of a base of clay we have all spent the last 2 years throwing into a general pile, various pieces here and there which somehow just kind of spontaneously began to take shape about 2 weeks ago.</p>\n<p>It seems as if this is the way it happens.  Its all about timing, and not forcing anything that doesnt need to be forced.  It just nees to be left alone until it happens.</p>\n<p>And it will.  I promise :)</p>\n<p>If ever you find you'd like to hear what our little hackers anonymous chapter is up to, my contact info is collected above.  As such, you know where to find me if you find interest in hearing more about the various projects we're working on.  But its of no major significance.  Your obviously and AMAZING talent, and it seems could use that talent to have quite a bit of fun with some of the projects we are developing.  But to truly understand the mentality of a hacker, you need to be a hacker yourself.  When you are, you understand by nature that nothing can be forced... you just have to let it happen. :)</p>\n<p>Enjoy your day!  And again...  Welcome :)  Your in REALLY GOOD COMPANY (I'm not suggesting that in regards to me directly, and instead to our overall \"meme genre\".  Us hackers are all this way... just in slightly different areas of specialyt :)</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!  And congratulations on your wedding!</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082618\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dannyayers.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7028f422ca6da0180de6c9d922a3228f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dannyayers.com\">Danny</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082618\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-27T11:29:25\">2006-05-27T11:29:25</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Thanks for posting this (from everyone with a trail of unfinished projects :-) Is there such a thing as an Angel Organiser?

For me, there's a rush attached to novelty, discovery, and a clean solution to a problem.  The rush wanes over sustained effort on the same thing.  I'm pretty sure it follows all the other familiar response curves in brain chemistry.  This can be mitigated by other factors, like a paycheck or someone's foot-tapping expectations - but when it's just me playing, I'm a freewheeling junkie.  :)</p>\n<p>But as for the rest of what you wrote - man, are you trying to inflate my head?

And now you've provided the perfect term! I constantly wrestle with myself as to whether this is a good trait or a bad one. Since I don't just jump around with regard to coding, but all types of hobbies that extend into the 'ole meatspace. As I enjoy joking about...I even knit from time to time.</p>\n<p>As well, it appears the latest such source of enthusiasm for the both of us is the Palm Pre! I just wandered in from PreCentral's forums... I'll have to keep an eye out for what snippets of serial gold you leave for the rest of us in that world! ;)</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": " <p>Lately, in between wedding preparations and other goings on of late, I've been doing some navel gazing and thinking about my enthusiasms and what's next.  And, there's one conclusion to which I've come, which is yet half-formed but I think interesting to admit and explore.</p>\r\n <p>You see, the realization to which I've come is that - in the realm of recreational programming, at least - I could be best described as a <i>serial enthusiast</i>.</p>\r\n <p>What's that mean?  Well, just look at my history throughout the archives of this blog.  I've flitted from nano-project to nano-project, a hack here and a hack there.  But, other than in projects where someone's expecting something from me and (preferrably) paying me - I have a very fickle attention span.  If you hire me, or have me sign a contract, I'll stick to schedule and deliver as best I can - no worries about that.  When I'm in \"professional mode,\" I run on different premises and motivations.  But, left to my own devices, I will freewheel and wander between a slew of part-time obsessions.</p>\r\n <p>Of course, on frequent occassion, I return to the themes and constructions I've visited in the past.  This has the effect of a sort of sustained, incremental development of my nano-projects, well distributed across time.  I drive myself through development sprints, but never quite finish complete products.  I share the code, in whatever state I've left it, in the hopes that someone might find it useful - but very rarely do I wrap things up with a bow.</p>\r\n <p>This is <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/03/11/Recreational-Programming\"><i>recreational programming</i></a>.  I enjoy the process much more than I do the results.  This is why I have no particular worries about under what license I release my work.  Go right ahead: <b>Share and Enjoy</b> my Sudoku puzzle solutions, because I'm done with them.  After all, were I ever to finish something useful, I might get sucked into it and anchored down to supporting it when my interest has faded - and that's no fun, unless there's another source of reward available for continuing the work.</p>\r\n <p>And this is why I think that so far - unless I find something of particular lasting interest or work on modifying my habits - I'll never be a successful entrepreneur on my own.  I've got ideas and skills, sure - but I need a partner, or a manager, to keep me and everything else to a coherent and sustained path.  I've got energy and I've got creativity, but I need others as <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/mind/stories/s1391503.htm\">social prosthetics</a> to herd me and my mental cats.</p>\r\n <p>So what's my point in all of this?  Mostly just writing to think this notion through.  I'm sure this isn't a terribly original self-discovery, but it's one that I wanted to admit and elaborate so that I can at least explain myself to myself and work with it.  And, having said all that, I thought that there just might be some others freewheeling around out there with whom the phrase \"serial enthusiast\" might hold some meaning, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082616\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://xmlhacker.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5159227f15ff6247f88542812f866c4f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://xmlhacker.com\">M.

For me, there's a rush attached to novelty, discovery, and a clean solution to a problem.  The rush wanes over sustained effort on the same thing.  I'm pretty sure it follows all the other familiar response curves in brain chemistry.

    "html": " <p>Nothing like firewall rules to make me feel like a moron.  I recently wiped and reinstalled <a href=\"http://openwrt.org/\">OpenWRT</a> on my WRT54G router.  Before the wipe, I had firewall rules which forwarded port 80 to a web server on my home LAN behind the router.</p>\n <p>The nice part was that I could access that server both from outside and inside the LAN, using the external WAN IP.  I've got scraped RSS feeds and other HTTP accessible bits that I access from my laptop.  This laptop travels between work and coffee shop and home.  I like being able to subscribe to and point at these things by URLs that don't change.</p>\n <p>But now, after the wipe, I've got firewall rules which open the WAN port to the home LAN for access from outside - but not from inside.  I've lost the old rules, and the knowledge I had that let me build the rules has since paged out of my brain and been lost to the ether.</p>\n <p>I suppose I could try building a VPN to home again - or use some SSH port tunneling - but I'd really like to get this port forwarding working again.  Anyone know how this crud works?</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086482\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://beesbuzz.biz/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/plaidfluff.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://beesbuzz.biz/\">fluffy</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086482\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-10T03:59:14\">2006-05-10T03:59:14</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>What does OpenWRT get you that the stock factory firmware doesn't?

In other words, it runs as a DNS cache from whatever your external DNS is, and then can inject any custom entries you want. Then configure DHCP or any internal static IP boxes to point at the router as a DNS server. Then you can setup overriding rules for any DNS entries that refer to your home external IP.</p>\n<p>You also stated you access it via your \"external IP\" - are you not using a dynamic DNS service like DynDNS to give your home an external domain? You could even then use a real DNS provider to make a nicer domain (say a subdomain of your website) be a CNAME pointing at the DynDNS entry. m0n0wall and many other routers also have <a href=\"http://img.m0n0.ch/screens/services_dyndns.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">DynDNS clients</a> built in. Who needs static IPs? You certainly don't if all you need is web and ssh access.</p>\n<p>So for example, I may have an internal web server running at 192.168.1.10, with my external IP being 1.2.3.4. So I have home.cafgood.com as a CNAME pointing at cafgood.dyndns.com which gets automatically set to resolve to my external home IP (1.2.3.4). On my router, I then say home.cafgood.com equals the internal IP (192.168.1.10). From the outside, I would hit real DNS servers, get CNAME-pointed to DynDNS servers, which would point me at my external IP, and NAT points at the web server. From the inside, the overridden DNS forwarder would just point any internal request right at the web server.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086489\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086489\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-10T15:58:22\">2006-05-10T15:58:22</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Okay, addendum summary:  I'm already using DynDNS to point at my home address, my external IP.

    "body": " <p>Nothing like firewall rules to make me feel like a moron.  I recently wiped and reinstalled <a href=\"http://openwrt.org/\">OpenWRT</a> on my WRT54G router.  Before the wipe, I had firewall rules which forwarded port 80 to a web server on my home LAN behind the router.</p>\r\n <p>The nice part was that I could access that server both from outside and inside the LAN, using the external WAN IP.  I've got scraped RSS feeds and other HTTP accessible bits that I access from my laptop.  This laptop travels between work and coffee shop and home.  I like being able to subscribe to and point at these things by URLs that don't change.</p>\r\n <p>But now, after the wipe, I've got firewall rules which open the WAN port to the home LAN for access from outside - but not from inside.  I've lost the old rules, and the knowledge I had that let me build the rules has since paged out of my brain and been lost to the ether.</p>\r\n <p>I suppose I could try building a VPN to home again - or use some SSH port tunneling - but I'd really like to get this port forwarding working again.  Anyone know how this crud works?</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086482\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://beesbuzz.biz/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/plaidfluff.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://beesbuzz.biz/\">fluffy</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086482\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-10T03:59:14\">2006-05-10T03:59:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>What does OpenWRT get you that the stock factory firmware doesn't?

In other words, it runs as a DNS cache from whatever your external DNS is, and then can inject any custom entries you want. Then configure DHCP or any internal static IP boxes to point at the router as a DNS server. Then you can setup overriding rules for any DNS entries that refer to your home external IP.</p>\n\n<p>You also stated you access it via your \"external IP\" - are you not using a dynamic DNS service like DynDNS to give your home an external domain? You could even then use a real DNS provider to make a nicer domain (say a subdomain of your website) be a CNAME pointing at the DynDNS entry. m0n0wall and many other routers also have <a href=\"http://img.m0n0.ch/screens/services_dyndns.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">DynDNS clients</a> built in. Who needs static IPs? You certainly don't if all you need is web and ssh access.</p>\n\n<p>So for example, I may have an internal web server running at 192.168.1.10, with my external IP being 1.2.3.4. So I have home.cafgood.com as a CNAME pointing at cafgood.dyndns.com which gets automatically set to resolve to my external home IP (1.2.3.4). On my router, I then say home.cafgood.com equals the internal IP (192.168.1.10). From the outside, I would hit real DNS servers, get CNAME-pointed to DynDNS servers, which would point me at my external IP, and NAT points at the web server. From the inside, the overridden DNS forwarder would just point any internal request right at the web server.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086489\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086489\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-10T15:58:22\">2006-05-10T15:58:22</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Okay, addendum summary:  I'm already using DynDNS to point at my home address, my external IP.

    "html": " <p>I've just read blog posts from <a href=\"http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2006/05/on_wanting_to_stop_wanting_world_of_warcraft.shtml\">Tom Coates</a> and <a href=\"http://rc3.org/2006/05/the_grim_time_s.php\">Rafe Colburn</a> talking about time spent playing World of Warcraft that might have been better spent on more worthwhile pursuits - such as writing, hacking, reading, getting outside, etc.</p>\n <p>Well, the first thing I have to say is that there's nothing inherently wrong with WoW.  One of my best friends spends most nights in the world, along with his sweetie and the occasional get together with nephews and friends.  It seems to me that he doesn't feel the compulsion to do anything in particular after work, beyond enjoying his time - and this is something he enjoys and provides something quite a bit more like a social life than television.</p>\n <p>Imagine not being a workaholic - I find it difficult, how about you?</p>\n <p>I tend to tell people that I'm lucky not to have a machine decent enough to run WoW.  I've got plenty of hardware capable of doing all manner of web development and tinkering tasks, but none with the muscle to run a modern 3-D game.  I have played WoW, however, on a friend's computer and a borrowed account.  It's certainly fun, and I'd play it again, but I didn't really feel an irresistible gravity of addiction.  No, what was starting to draw my interest is that <a href=\"http://www.wowwiki.com/World_of_Warcraft_API\">the game client has an API</a> and is <a href=\"http://www.wowwiki.com/Lua\">scriptable in Lua</a>.</p>\n <p>That's when I return to a notion that occurred to me a few years ago:  That is, hacking is my EverQuest.  I swear I blogged about it, but I can't find the post.  So, to refresh the idea - <em>Hacking is my WoW</em>.

    "body": " <p>I've just read blog posts from <a href=\"http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2006/05/on_wanting_to_stop_wanting_world_of_warcraft.shtml\">Tom Coates</a> and <a href=\"http://rc3.org/2006/05/the_grim_time_s.php\">Rafe Colburn</a> talking about time spent playing World of Warcraft that might have been better spent on more worthwhile pursuits - such as writing, hacking, reading, getting outside, etc.</p>\r\n <p>Well, the first thing I have to say is that there's nothing inherently wrong with WoW.  One of my best friends spends most nights in the world, along with his sweetie and the occasional get together with nephews and friends.  It seems to me that he doesn't feel the compulsion to do anything in particular after work, beyond enjoying his time - and this is something he enjoys and provides something quite a bit more like a social life than television.</p>\r\n <p>Imagine not being a workaholic - I find it difficult, how about you?</p>\r\n <p>I tend to tell people that I'm lucky not to have a machine decent enough to run WoW.  I've got plenty of hardware capable of doing all manner of web development and tinkering tasks, but none with the muscle to run a modern 3-D game.  I have played WoW, however, on a friend's computer and a borrowed account.  It's certainly fun, and I'd play it again, but I didn't really feel an irresistible gravity of addiction.  No, what was starting to draw my interest is that <a href=\"http://www.wowwiki.com/World_of_Warcraft_API\">the game client has an API</a> and is <a href=\"http://www.wowwiki.com/Lua\">scriptable in Lua</a>.</p>\r\n <p>That's when I return to a notion that occurred to me a few years ago:  That is, hacking is my EverQuest.  I swear I blogged about it, but I can't find the post.  So, to refresh the idea - <em>Hacking is my WoW</em>.  My friend's got a gnome with a monocle; I've got <a href=\"http://mailman.us.netrek.org/pipermail/netrek-dev/2006-March/002859.html\">a Linksys WRT54G router that runs Netrek</a>.

    "html": " <p>If you've yet to check out <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">the new Inform 7</a>, \"A Design System for Interactive Fiction Based on Natural Language,\" you really need to do so.</p>\n <p>Back when I was a wee lad with access to an assortment of Commodore 64, Apple ][, and Atari 800 computers, text adventures pretty much had me in their thrall.  I loved to play them, getting lost for hours in all that Infocom and others had to offer.  I also loved to write them - if only for myself, with rooms plotted out on green-lined gridpaper and engines implemented in clumsy BASIC and LOGO.</p>\n <p>Since then, I've returned now and then to see what's going on in that world.  In the intervening years, the whole field has reinvented itself as \"interactive fiction,\" and hobbyists have reverse engineered a number of classic game engines.  They've picked up where defunct companies left off and pursued even further development.</p>\n <p>I've not gone back to write any further adventures of my own, though I've peeked in at the authoring tools from time to time.  For the most part, things seemed just obscure and weird-edged enough to leave me thinking I might better spend my time learning more about Python or even Lisp.  I've played some of these modern games over the years, though, and there's quite a bit of great writing talent at work out there.</p>\n <p>But now, this: <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">Inform 7</a>.  This is a world-building environment built by and for writers.  The truth of this is embedded in every facet of it - from the mind-bogglingly cool natural language in which worlds can be described, to the painstakingly elaborated documentation, to the <b>fully narrated and apologized-for error messages</b>.</p>\n <p>In sharp contrast to my past toe-dippings into interactive fiction authoring - and even MOO / MUD citizenship - this system <i>compells</i> me to use it.  It makes me want to write stories and describe worlds.</p>\n <p>And, most amazing of all:  This is <del>Open Source software</del> <ins>not commercially developed software</ins>.  (Update: Turns out it's not totally Open Source, but it's beer-free at least.)</p>\n <p>Of course, I've found great annoyance in the past with languages like AppleScript and Lingo - both of which <i>attempt</i> to follow some sort of natural language patterns, yet only result mockeries of all language.  I haven't dug deep enough into <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">Inform 7</a> to tell if I'll reach this same point of frustration.  So far, though, it seems promising from the little I've thrown together in a morning's coffee and in the examples I've browsed at lunch.</p>\n <p>Maybe one of these stories in my head will find it's way out this way.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089025\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a0b347907bfaf05694805210ec595d6c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Martin Atkins</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089025\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-01T19:11:03\">2006-05-01T19:11:03</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>One interesting side-effect of it being based on English is that it presumably makes it harder to use for someone who is attempting to write a story in another language.

Yes. You drop down into I6 by surrounding your I6 code with \"(-\" and \"-)\".</p>\n<p><code>To end the game in death: (- deadflag=1; -).</code></p>  \n<p>You can use small snippets of I6 code, as above, or include entire routines. This can be useful for programming tasks that are much more easily handled in a procedural language such as I6.</p>\n<p>The drawback to doing so is a loss of readability: much as when you embed assembly directives in C, you now need to understand two very different languages. You can encapsulate I6 code and give it a natural-language form; in fact, parts of the I7 standard library do just that.</p>\n</blockquote></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089036\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=85232f8499fd6ee91623408fc23835d1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\">Matt Brubeck</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089036\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-02T19:33:46\">2006-05-02T19:33:46</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Strictly speaking, this isn't (all) Open Source software:  While the source code to the GUI is under the GPL, the source code to the compiler will be available only under a \"look but don't touch\" license (same as Inform 6).

    "body": " <p>If you've yet to check out <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">the new Inform 7</a>, \"A Design System for Interactive Fiction Based on Natural Language,\" you really need to do so.</p>\r\n <p>Back when I was a wee lad with access to an assortment of Commodore 64, Apple ][, and Atari 800 computers, text adventures pretty much had me in their thrall.  I loved to play them, getting lost for hours in all that Infocom and others had to offer.  I also loved to write them - if only for myself, with rooms plotted out on green-lined gridpaper and engines implemented in clumsy BASIC and LOGO.</p>\r\n <p>Since then, I've returned now and then to see what's going on in that world.  In the intervening years, the whole field has reinvented itself as \"interactive fiction,\" and hobbyists have reverse engineered a number of classic game engines.  They've picked up where defunct companies left off and pursued even further development.</p>\r\n <p>I've not gone back to write any further adventures of my own, though I've peeked in at the authoring tools from time to time.  For the most part, things seemed just obscure and weird-edged enough to leave me thinking I might better spend my time learning more about Python or even Lisp.  I've played some of these modern games over the years, though, and there's quite a bit of great writing talent at work out there.</p>\r\n <p>But now, this: <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">Inform 7</a>.  This is a world-building environment built by and for writers.  The truth of this is embedded in every facet of it - from the mind-bogglingly cool natural language in which worlds can be described, to the painstakingly elaborated documentation, to the <b>fully narrated and apologized-for error messages</b>.</p>\r\n <p>In sharp contrast to my past toe-dippings into interactive fiction authoring - and even MOO / MUD citizenship - this system <i>compells</i> me to use it.  It makes me want to write stories and describe worlds.</p>\r\n <p>And, most amazing of all:  This is <del>Open Source software</del> <ins>not commercially developed software</ins>.  (Update: Turns out it's not totally Open Source, but it's beer-free at least.)</p>\r\n <p>Of course, I've found great annoyance in the past with languages like AppleScript and Lingo - both of which <i>attempt</i> to follow some sort of natural language patterns, yet only result mockeries of all language.  I haven't dug deep enough into <a href=\"http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html\">Inform 7</a> to tell if I'll reach this same point of frustration.  So far, though, it seems promising from the little I've thrown together in a morning's coffee and in the examples I've browsed at lunch.</p>\r\n <p>Maybe one of these stories in my head will find it's way out this way.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089025\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a0b347907bfaf05694805210ec595d6c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Martin Atkins</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089025\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-01T19:11:03\">2006-05-01T19:11:03</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>One interesting side-effect of it being based on English is that it presumably makes it harder to use for someone who is attempting to write a story in another language.

Yes. You drop down into I6 by surrounding your I6 code with \"(-\" and \"-)\".</p>\r\n    <p><code>To end the game in death: (- deadflag=1; -).</code></p>  \r\n  <p>You can use small snippets of I6 code, as above, or include entire routines. This can be useful for programming tasks that are much more easily handled in a procedural language such as I6.</p>\r\n  <p>The drawback to doing so is a loss of readability: much as when you embed assembly directives in C, you now need to understand two very different languages. You can encapsulate I6 code and give it a natural-language form; in fact, parts of the I7 standard library do just that.</p>\r\n  </blockquote></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089036\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=85232f8499fd6ee91623408fc23835d1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\">Matt Brubeck</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089036\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-05-02T19:33:46\">2006-05-02T19:33:46</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Strictly speaking, this isn't (all) Open Source software:  While the source code to the GUI is under the GPL, the source code to the compiler will be available only under a \"look but don't touch\" license (same as Inform 6).

Getting around can be a bit tough unless you bike or cab everywhere -- parking is impossible in the most enjoyable parts of town, and the buses are horribly unrelaible -- but there are plenty of neighborhoods where you could easily spend the whole day.</p>\n<p>+1 for the Marin headlands and Japanese Gardens; I also had a <em>great</em> time biking over the Golden Gate brigde and into Marin and Mendecino counties, though it's a pretty athletic ride. Doing at least one quick trip through Upper Haight is more or less de rigour, but there are some good, cheap eats (the Citrus Club) and the deservedly-famous Amoeba Records nearer Golden Gate Park that make the trip worthwhile. Of course, the park itself is gorgeous, and has enough museums, gardens, and other sights to keep you occupied for at least an afternoon.</p>\n<p>The Mission district can also be very nice, if you're interested in checking out a more \"funky\" side of S.F. There is a string of bars, restaurants, and offbeat shops stretching north-to-south along Valencia from Duboce down to 20th or so, and if you stop at one of the little neighborhood grocers along the way, you can head just a couple of blocks west to Dolores Park for a picnic. (This is the area I used to live in, and I basically never used my kitchen, since there was so much good food in the area: at one point, my roommate and I counted over 100 restaurant listings within a 1 mile radius.)</p>\n<p>Also, if you're willing to hop on the BART and cross the bay, Telegraph Ave. just off UC Berkeley campus is a lot of fun. Again, less glitzy and more indie, but some great shopping, food, and people-watching to be had. The Claremont Canyon Preserve, a 200+ acre park just east of Telegraph, has some awesome hikes and views, too.</p>\n<p>Generally, I'd recommend staying away from the Pier 47/Fisherman's Wharf area and the Golden Gate Bridge during the weekend -- the traffic (both vehicular and pedestrian) makes the whole scene far too claustrophobic for my tastes. Union Square is somewhat impressive, in a generically-urban sort of way, but I never had the budget to shop there, (think Prada/Diesel/cotoure) so it's not a place I visit any more.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085781\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085781\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-26T17:59:04\">2006-04-26T17:59:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Oh man--the restaurants alone could keep you pretty busy!  <a href=\"http://www.delfinasf.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Delfina</a> in the Mission is one of my personal favorites--it's very hip yet unpretentious, and has fantastic high-end Italian food.  The staff is great.  Just get reservations <em>early</em> (that's actually a good rule of thumb for most good SF restaurants).</p>\n<p>I haven't been there yet, but I have friends who absolutely rave about <a href=\"http://www.rangesf.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Range</a>, which is also in the Mission.  My friends also say good things about <a href=\"http://www.mythsf.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Myth</a>.</p>\n<p>I really love <a href=\"http://www.zaziesf.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zazie</a> for brunch.  It's a cute neighborhood French restaurant in Cole Valley that has some incredible breakfast stuff (gingerbread pancakes, Tahitian French toast).  They've got a patio that's lovely on a sunny morning.</p>\n<p>No trip to SF would be complete without a Mission burrito.  People are very, very partisan about taquerias, but my personal favorite is Taqueria Pancho Villa at 16th and Mission.  They roll the tightest burritos in town--they're like cigars :-).</p>\n<p>For sushi, my personal favorite off-the-beaten path place is <a href=\"http://www.amasiahidesushi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amasia Hide's</a> in the Castro.  The only thing about them is they have this bizarro alternate staff that works early in the week, so make sure to Thursday through Saturday. </p>\n<p>I also recommend checking out the Ferry Building on the Embarcadero, which has been turned into a sort of gourmet food mall.  It has tons of good restaurants, and an awesome weekend farmer's market where you can sample a lot of local food.</p>\n<p>I'm sure I'll think of more--I love playing tour guide for SF :-)...</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085785\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e22b7837b81de1449b53144b10fa27ca&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">jm</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085785\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-26T18:03:53\">2006-04-26T18:03:53</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>The bike tour on the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito, \nwith the return with the ferry is really nice.</p>\n<p>There are more than one company providing the same service (rent a bike and a map); Blazing Saddles is one of them: http://www.blazingsaddles.com/rides.html</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085786\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0874020a907fa0200463edb504d0243c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">CA Expatriot</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085786\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-26T19:35:22\">2006-04-26T19:35:22</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Being a Bay Area native myself, I heartily second the comments made about the restaurants alone keeping you busy the entire time. Due to population density, and fierce competition with other restaurants, the odds are that within a 3 block radius, there will be an average of 6 highly recommended eateries.  </p>\n<p>Some highlights include: \n<b>Oxygen</b> (Oxygen and Sushi bar) for some of the best deviant CA-style sushi available.</p>\n<p><b>Mifune</b>: Freshly made Japanese noodles (Soba, udon, etc) 2 people can get a very filling tasty lunch for under $14.</p>\n<p><b>Haight St. Thai place</b>: (Don't remember the name) Upstairs, overlooking Haight street, for some of the best Thai food you'll find in CA.</p>\n<p>On the subject of things to do:\n<b>Exploratorium in the Palace of Fine Arts</b>: The <em>original</em> please touch museum. Great fun for all-ages. The PoFA is a beautiful setting to begin with, so this is definitely worth the trip.</p>\n<p><b>Japantown</b>: Generally well-marked, but not as much of a tourist destination as Chinatown. Mifune is located in the Kinokuniya mall there, and worth the trip in and of itself. I also highly recommend the Kinokuniya bookstore, the TV/Electronics/Media shop, and the little coffeeshop that sells Taiyaki around the side. (Fish-shaped pastries filled with chocolate or sweetened red beans. Best fresh off the griddle, but good nonetheless)\nAcross the street from the main plaza of Jtown, (look for the Denny's) there's Post Hardware. Don't let the name fool you; it contains a veritable wealth of housewares, Japanese cookware, Japanese electronic cookware, Japanese knives, and gorgeous Japanese laquerware and ceramic serving platters. VERY worth stopping in.\nAt the end of this open-air mall on the left, (Facing away from the main Jtown plaza) there's a nifty little Japanese pastry shop specializing in \"Manju\". If you like that sort of thing, theirs is the best, and it's made that day.</p>\n<p><b>Haight St.</b>: Always an enjoyable destination if your tastes are off-of-center. Regardless of your political leanings, the record stores generally have an excellent selection.</p>\n<p><b>The Sony Metreon</b>: Not quite up to the hype it exudes, but fun all the same. Lots of nifty non-Sony stuff to be found in this Mall. If you're at all fond of Sony products, this is a good chance to see them in their \"Natural\" habitat.</p>\n<p><b>Alcatraz</b>: Definitely mentioned in tourbooks, but well worth the trip.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085787\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.MichaelMaggard.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c634bec042bf155dbedbe93334add733&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.MichaelMaggard.com\">Michael Maggard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085787\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-27T03:01:28\">2006-04-27T03:01:28</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Get out of town for a day.</p>\n<p>Seriously, pick a nice day, rent a convertable, drive across the Golden Gate to Sausalito, pick up a lunch to go, then up to the top of Mt. Tam. There's a parking lot near the top, from there hike about a quarter mile further up to the top, and enjoy the view.</p>\n<p>You're on a grassy mountaintop, with the world at your feet.

Now that many research libraries are economizing on space and converting print collections to microfilm and digital formats, it's becoming harder to wander and let the shelves themselves suggest new directions and ideas. Key academic and research libraries are often closed to unaffiliated users, and many keep the bulk of their collections in closed stacks, inhibiting the rewarding pleasures of browsing. Despite its virtues, query-based online cataloging often prevents unanticipated yet productive results from turning up on the user's screen. And finally, much of the material in our collection is difficult to find in most libraries readily accessible to the general public.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085795\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085795\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-27T05:52:19\">2006-04-27T05:52:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>The Haight Street Thai place is called Ploy 2.

It's a great choice. We took a harbor tour around Alcatraz that was fun, tons of good photo ops. The Exploratorium is great (I spent the whole time explaining the science behind most of the exhibits because they were short on people and signs to do it). Being a comic book geek I had to visit the Isotope comic shop (now in a new location in the middle of the city). SF is a great place just to go walk around. There's also some great bus tours of the city you can take.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085805\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.whump.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=152a649080e99c313ecae9a34c60d11d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.whump.com/\">Bill Humphries</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085805\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-28T06:44:43\">2006-04-28T06:44:43</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Cynthia and I would be happy to play native guides if you want to explore Silicon Valley, you know, Fry, Stanford, and the Mothership.</p>\n<p>In the City I second Ed's recommendations of the Exploratorium, the Haight, and Japantown. </p>\n<p>Also:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cocktails at the bar on the top floor of the Sir Francis Drake.</li>\n<li>I wish you were getting into town on the 10th, then you could see Charlie Anders' monthly literary salon, <a href=\"http://writerswithdrinks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://writerswithdrinks.com/</a>, which is great fun.</li>\n<li>The Mission, the Castro, and the Haight (sorta) are co-joined so you can spend a day on foot exploring.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.jdvhospitality.com/hotels/findByCombined.php?choice=Region:San%20Francisco\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joy de Vrie</a> runs a chain of boutique hotels throughout the City, so consider an upgrade for a night or two (most of them also provide free wifi.)</li>\n<li>Ritual Roasters on Valencia (around 22nd) makes really good coffee.</li>\n</ol></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085806\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.dealuniversity.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f106c5a0443c436fd82b216c42f75252&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.dealuniversity.com\">Richard Wu</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085806\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-28T19:08:56\">2006-04-28T19:08:56</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I second <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/04/25/a-honeymoon-in-san-francisco#comment-10293\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael's</a> suggestion to go to Sausalito...but you can also rent some bikes and cross the bridge that way.

The Haight location is better than the one on Valencia, but expect a wait.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.</p>\n<p>In the middle, I'm fond of Il Borgo, Walzwerk, Osha Thai, and City View (for dim sum), Henry's Hunan, and Powell's Soul Food.  OK, so that's a pretty wide middle.</p>\n<p>Late at night, options include Sparky's and Grubstake.  The daily specials at Grubstake are especially good.</p>\n<p>If you make it to the East Bay, look into Kirala, The New Zealander, and Le Cheval.  Oh, and don't forget the famous Chez Panisse.  Don't bother with the more expensive prix fixe downstairs.  Go for the upstairs.  It is less expensive, every bit as good (a point corroborated by one of their former chefs), and easier to get into.</p>\n<p>There is an abundance of great restaurants in and around San Francisco, so check the reviews and don't settle for average.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085817\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e19dc50f3ff10a4ea1955623b856ad39&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Eliza</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085817\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-29T19:50:40\">2006-06-29T19:50:40</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>My fiance and I are also honeymooning in San Francisco (coming up - July 15th is the big day!).

Getting around can be a bit tough unless you bike or cab everywhere -- parking is impossible in the most enjoyable parts of town, and the buses are horribly unrelaible -- but there are plenty of neighborhoods where you could easily spend the whole day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>+1 for the Marin headlands and Japanese Gardens; I also had a <em>great</em> time biking over the Golden Gate brigde and into Marin and Mendecino counties, though it's a pretty athletic ride. Doing at least one quick trip through Upper Haight is more or less de rigour, but there are some good, cheap eats (the Citrus Club) and the deservedly-famous Amoeba Records nearer Golden Gate Park that make the trip worthwhile. Of course, the park itself is gorgeous, and has enough museums, gardens, and other sights to keep you occupied for at least an afternoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mission district can also be very nice, if you're interested in checking out a more \"funky\" side of S.F. There is a string of bars, restaurants, and offbeat shops stretching north-to-south along Valencia from Duboce down to 20th or so, and if you stop at one of the little neighborhood grocers along the way, you can head just a couple of blocks west to Dolores Park for a picnic. (This is the area I used to live in, and I basically never used my kitchen, since there was so much good food in the area: at one point, my roommate and I counted over 100 restaurant listings within a 1 mile radius.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, if you're willing to hop on the BART and cross the bay, Telegraph Ave. just off UC Berkeley campus is a lot of fun. Again, less glitzy and more indie, but some great shopping, food, and people-watching to be had. The Claremont Canyon Preserve, a 200+ acre park just east of Telegraph, has some awesome hikes and views, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, I'd recommend staying away from the Pier 47/Fisherman's Wharf area and the Golden Gate Bridge during the weekend -- the traffic (both vehicular and pedestrian) makes the whole scene far too claustrophobic for my tastes. Union Square is somewhat impressive, in a generically-urban sort of way, but I never had the budget to shop there, (think Prada/Diesel/cotoure) so it's not a place I visit any more.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085781\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085781\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-26T17:59:04\">2006-04-26T17:59:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Oh man--the restaurants alone could keep you pretty busy!  <a href=\"http://www.delfinasf.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Delfina</a> in the Mission is one of my personal favorites--it's very hip yet unpretentious, and has fantastic high-end Italian food.  The staff is great.  Just get reservations <em>early</em> (that's actually a good rule of thumb for most good SF restaurants).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I haven't been there yet, but I have friends who absolutely rave about <a href=\"http://www.rangesf.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Range</a>, which is also in the Mission.  My friends also say good things about <a href=\"http://www.mythsf.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Myth</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really love <a href=\"http://www.zaziesf.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zazie</a> for brunch.  It's a cute neighborhood French restaurant in Cole Valley that has some incredible breakfast stuff (gingerbread pancakes, Tahitian French toast).  They've got a patio that's lovely on a sunny morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No trip to SF would be complete without a Mission burrito.  People are very, very partisan about taquerias, but my personal favorite is Taqueria Pancho Villa at 16th and Mission.  They roll the tightest burritos in town--they're like cigars :-).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For sushi, my personal favorite off-the-beaten path place is <a href=\"http://www.amasiahidesushi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amasia Hide's</a> in the Castro.  The only thing about them is they have this bizarro alternate staff that works early in the week, so make sure to Thursday through Saturday. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also recommend checking out the Ferry Building on the Embarcadero, which has been turned into a sort of gourmet food mall.  It has tons of good restaurants, and an awesome weekend farmer's market where you can sample a lot of local food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm sure I'll think of more--I love playing tour guide for SF :-)...</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085785\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e22b7837b81de1449b53144b10fa27ca&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">jm</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085785\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-26T18:03:53\">2006-04-26T18:03:53</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>The bike tour on the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito, \r\nwith the return with the ferry is really nice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are more than one company providing the same service (rent a bike and a map); Blazing Saddles is one of them: http://www.blazingsaddles.com/rides.html</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085786\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0874020a907fa0200463edb504d0243c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">CA Expatriot</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085786\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-26T19:35:22\">2006-04-26T19:35:22</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Being a Bay Area native myself, I heartily second the comments made about the restaurants alone keeping you busy the entire time. Due to population density, and fierce competition with other restaurants, the odds are that within a 3 block radius, there will be an average of 6 highly recommended eateries.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some highlights include: \r\n<b>Oxygen</b> (Oxygen and Sushi bar) for some of the best deviant CA-style sushi available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Mifune</b>: Freshly made Japanese noodles (Soba, udon, etc) 2 people can get a very filling tasty lunch for under $14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Haight St. Thai place</b>: (Don't remember the name) Upstairs, overlooking Haight street, for some of the best Thai food you'll find in CA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the subject of things to do:\r\n<b>Exploratorium in the Palace of Fine Arts</b>: The <em>original</em> please touch museum. Great fun for all-ages. The PoFA is a beautiful setting to begin with, so this is definitely worth the trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Japantown</b>: Generally well-marked, but not as much of a tourist destination as Chinatown. Mifune is located in the Kinokuniya mall there, and worth the trip in and of itself. I also highly recommend the Kinokuniya bookstore, the TV/Electronics/Media shop, and the little coffeeshop that sells Taiyaki around the side. (Fish-shaped pastries filled with chocolate or sweetened red beans. Best fresh off the griddle, but good nonetheless)\r\nAcross the street from the main plaza of Jtown, (look for the Denny's) there's Post Hardware. Don't let the name fool you; it contains a veritable wealth of housewares, Japanese cookware, Japanese electronic cookware, Japanese knives, and gorgeous Japanese laquerware and ceramic serving platters. VERY worth stopping in.\r\nAt the end of this open-air mall on the left, (Facing away from the main Jtown plaza) there's a nifty little Japanese pastry shop specializing in \"Manju\". If you like that sort of thing, theirs is the best, and it's made that day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Haight St.</b>: Always an enjoyable destination if your tastes are off-of-center. Regardless of your political leanings, the record stores generally have an excellent selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>The Sony Metreon</b>: Not quite up to the hype it exudes, but fun all the same. Lots of nifty non-Sony stuff to be found in this Mall. If you're at all fond of Sony products, this is a good chance to see them in their \"Natural\" habitat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Alcatraz</b>: Definitely mentioned in tourbooks, but well worth the trip.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085787\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.MichaelMaggard.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c634bec042bf155dbedbe93334add733&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.MichaelMaggard.com\">Michael Maggard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085787\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-27T03:01:28\">2006-04-27T03:01:28</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Get out of town for a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seriously, pick a nice day, rent a convertable, drive across the Golden Gate to Sausalito, pick up a lunch to go, then up to the top of Mt.

The contrast is profound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the way back go via the Marin Headlands, assuming one of you isn't too discomfitted by driving a windy narrow road with no rail and a coupla hundred foot drop to the boiling surf...

Now that many research libraries are economizing on space and converting print collections to microfilm and digital formats, it's becoming harder to wander and let the shelves themselves suggest new directions and ideas. Key academic and research libraries are often closed to unaffiliated users, and many keep the bulk of their collections in closed stacks, inhibiting the rewarding pleasures of browsing. Despite its virtues, query-based online cataloging often prevents unanticipated yet productive results from turning up on the user's screen. And finally, much of the material in our collection is difficult to find in most libraries readily accessible to the general public.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085795\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085795\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-27T05:52:19\">2006-04-27T05:52:19</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>The Haight Street Thai place is called Ploy 2.

The Exploratorium is great (I spent the whole time explaining the science behind most of the exhibits because they were short on people and signs to do it). Being a comic book geek I had to visit the Isotope comic shop (now in a new location in the middle of the city). SF is a great place just to go walk around. There's also some great bus tours of the city you can take.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085805\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.whump.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=152a649080e99c313ecae9a34c60d11d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.whump.com/\">Bill Humphries</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085805\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-28T06:44:43\">2006-04-28T06:44:43</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Cynthia and I would be happy to play native guides if you want to explore Silicon Valley, you know, Fry, Stanford, and the Mothership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the City I second Ed's recommendations of the Exploratorium, the Haight, and Japantown. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Cocktails at the bar on the top floor of the Sir Francis Drake.</li>\r\n<li>I wish you were getting into town on the 10th, then you could see Charlie Anders' monthly literary salon, <a href=\"http://writerswithdrinks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://writerswithdrinks.com/</a>, which is great fun.</li>\r\n<li>The Mission, the Castro, and the Haight (sorta) are co-joined so you can spend a day on foot exploring.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.jdvhospitality.com/hotels/findByCombined.php?choice=Region:San%20Francisco\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joy de Vrie</a> runs a chain of boutique hotels throughout the City, so consider an upgrade for a night or two (most of them also provide free wifi.)</li>\r\n<li>Ritual Roasters on Valencia (around 22nd) makes really good coffee.</li>\r\n</ol></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085806\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.dealuniversity.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f106c5a0443c436fd82b216c42f75252&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.dealuniversity.com\">Richard Wu</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085806\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-28T19:08:56\">2006-04-28T19:08:56</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I second <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/04/25/a-honeymoon-in-san-francisco#comment-10293\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael's</a> suggestion to go to Sausalito...but you can also rent some bikes and cross the bridge that way.

The Haight location is better than the one on Valencia, but expect a wait.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the middle, I'm fond of Il Borgo, Walzwerk, Osha Thai, and City View (for dim sum), Henry's Hunan, and Powell's Soul Food.  OK, so that's a pretty wide middle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Late at night, options include Sparky's and Grubstake.  The daily specials at Grubstake are especially good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you make it to the East Bay, look into Kirala, The New Zealander, and Le Cheval.  Oh, and don't forget the famous Chez Panisse.  Don't bother with the more expensive prix fixe downstairs.  Go for the upstairs.  It is less expensive, every bit as good (a point corroborated by one of their former chefs), and easier to get into.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an abundance of great restaurants in and around San Francisco, so check the reviews and don't settle for average.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085817\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e19dc50f3ff10a4ea1955623b856ad39&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Eliza</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085817\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-06-29T19:50:40\">2006-06-29T19:50:40</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>My fiance and I are also honeymooning in San Francisco (coming up - July 15th is the big day!).

    "html": " <p>So, I've put some more work into <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/s3wiki/wiki/StartPage\">my S3 AJAX wiki</a>, first mentioned <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/04/21/an-s3-ajax-wiki\">Friday night</a>.  After some Virtual PC sessions, editing seems to be working on Firefox and MSIE on Win.  Safari and any other browsers not amenable to PUT and DELETE in XmlHTTPRequests will not find joy in editing - but the wiki should at least still be navigable and readable since it's plain HTML on the server.</p>\n <p>This thing has certainly not reached any level of stability, but I thought it might be interesting to collect some random thoughts on what good stuff is lurking in there.  So:</p>\n     <ul>\n     <li>\n     <span>One of the mind-bending concepts behind this whole thing for me is that both the documents and the authoring application are all resident on the S3 servers, loaded and run on the fly in a browser.  The magic S3 lends is simple file I/O, taken for granted by applications in nearly every other development environment.  Otherwise, JavaScript in a browser is a very capable system.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>Of course, since my demo wiki is sitting in an S3 bucket with a public-write ACL, everything's open to vandalism and subversion (of the bad variety)- documents and application both.  S3Ajax does allow authentication through your S3 credentials, though, so a private group with restrictive S3 ACLs could use this wiki successfully.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>All content managed by the wiki code ends up as HTML on the server.  Maybe some day this will grow up to be proper XHTML.  Using plain old HTML, rather than <a href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/SmartAscii\">smart ASCII</a>, seems like an important step to me.  HTML is a neutral standard, whereas various wiki formats are far from agreed upon or standardized.  Luckily,  <a href=\"http://goessner.net/\">Stefan G&ouml;ssner's</a> <a href=\"http://goessner.net/articles/wiky/\">Wiky</a> does roundtrip conversion between wiki-text and HTML.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>Sticking with HTML as the end format also allows me to eventually go beyond wiki text, and on to <a href=\"http://microformats.org/\">microformats</a> like <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/08/greasemonkey-magic\">hCalendar</a> and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/03/25/about-xoxooutliner\">XOXO</a>.  I could even see interchangably using something like <a href=\"http://dojotoolkit.org/docs/rich_text.html\">DOJO's Rich Text Editor</a> as another editing alternative alongside <a href=\"http://goessner.net/articles/wiky/\">Wiky</a>.  Basically, anything that eats and emits HTML can fit into this wiki.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>One more thought on HTML and the DOM - if you can use HTML as your document format, the browser DOM makes a pretty nice structure and API for the authoring, manipulation, and management of document content.  In this wiki, innerHTML is the main point of document munging.  But, in XoxoOutliner, I do plenty of DOM node shuffling and tweaking.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>Speaking of innerHTML:  It's not evil, but it seems useful really only when treated as a write-only property.  It's next to useless for serializing the DOM as HTML source.  MSIE and Firefox both offer wildly different results.  So, I wrote <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/S3Ajax/js/wiki.js?rev=760#L413\"><code>fromDOMtoHTML</code> in wiki.js</a> to take matters into my own hands.  I know MochiKit offers <code>emitHTML</code>, but it doesn't quite do what I want - there are a few odd corner cases I've found myself handling, and I need to filter out all the elements I inject as editing chrome.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>I like the functional DOM construction kit offered by <a href=\"http://mochikit.com\">MochiKit</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vivabit.com/bollocks/2006/04/06/introducing-dom-builder\">DOM Builder</a> so much that I felt compelled to reinvent my own.  Check out <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/S3Ajax/js/common.js?rev=760#L118\"><code>createDOM</code> in common.js</a>.

I re-wrote this code so as to not import the bulk of MochiKit, but before I'd heard of DOM Builder.  I'm keeping it around for now.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>Speaking of reinventing things, check out <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/S3Ajax/js/S3Ajax.js?rev=760#L283\"><code>xmlToObj</code> in S3Ajax.js</a>.  I hadn't seen <a href=\"http://badgerfish.ning.com/\">BadgerFish</a> until about an hour ago, but <code>xmlToObj</code> is my own simplied version: That is, code to turn XML into basic native JS structures.

It works better than I thought it would.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>Speaking of <code>xmlToObj</code>, I use an S3 bucket listing with a key prefix to <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/S3Ajax/js/wiki.js?rev=760#L259\">populate a \"recent changes\" drop down selector</a>, sorted in reverse chronological order of the LastModified timestamp. </span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>And speaking of bucket listings:  I don't use them in finding existing wiki words - but I may do so in a future version.  But, instead, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/S3Ajax/js/wiki.js?rev=760#L118\">I got fancy and perform a number of HEAD requests to determine which WikiWords on the page do and don't exist</a>.

It meshes remarkbly well with what you're looking for.</p>\n<p>The new API is fully read-write, based on REST and the Atom Publishing Protocol. Other advantages over S3:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each app has 1GB of public object space and 100MB of private space. Each user can own up to 10 apps for free. Just register, clone an app (or make one from scratch) and you're off.</li>\n<li>With S3 the objects you read and store are flat data - with Ning, they're structured objects...</li>\n<li>... and since they're structured, you can issue GET requests that are more like database queries than simple object fetches (<a href=\"http://restdemos.ning.com/feeds.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">some examples</a>)...</li>\n<li>... which return properly-formed Atom feeds, which you can then run through BadgerFish. (it's how our <a href=\"http://restdemos.ning.com/embedfeed.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">demo widgets</a> work)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's not to say that S3 doesn't have it's own advantages: it's much better for large (GBs), expandable storage, five-nines high availability and BitTorrent. But the uses to which I'm currently seeing it put - such as your work, and the Greasemonkey ideas - fit Ning very well indeed.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086097\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=56ee28134dd0776825445e3551979b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\">Bob Aman</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086097\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-24T18:37:00\">2006-04-24T18:37:00</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Are there any alternatives out there to innerHTML that are just as easy-to-use, but that actually make use of the standard DOM methods instead?

It meshes remarkbly well with what you're looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new API is fully read-write, based on REST and the Atom Publishing Protocol. Other advantages over S3:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Each app has 1GB of public object space and 100MB of private space. Each user can own up to 10 apps for free. Just register, clone an app (or make one from scratch) and you're off.</li>\r\n<li>With S3 the objects you read and store are flat data - with Ning, they're structured objects...</li>\r\n<li>... and since they're structured, you can issue GET requests that are more like database queries than simple object fetches (<a href=\"http://restdemos.ning.com/feeds.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">some examples</a>)...</li>\r\n<li>... which return properly-formed Atom feeds, which you can then run through BadgerFish. (it's how our <a href=\"http://restdemos.ning.com/embedfeed.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">demo widgets</a> work)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>That's not to say that S3 doesn't have it's own advantages: it's much better for large (GBs), expandable storage, five-nines high availability and BitTorrent. But the uses to which I'm currently seeing it put - such as your work, and the Greasemonkey ideas - fit Ning very well indeed.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086097\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=56ee28134dd0776825445e3551979b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\">Bob Aman</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086097\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-24T18:37:00\">2006-04-24T18:37:00</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Are there any alternatives out there to innerHTML that are just as easy-to-use, but that actually make use of the standard DOM methods instead?

The main issue I see with constantly reentering the credentials is that they're these big honking strings that I'll never be able to remember like a username and password.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082724\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://crazybob.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2f44965b6a70761c7242eb9ca04bd5e7&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://crazybob.org/\">Bob Lee</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082724\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-06T19:07:54\">2006-04-06T19:07:54</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Use Flash's client side storage.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082727\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082727\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-06T19:29:30\">2006-04-06T19:29:30</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>That's pretty much what I assumed AMASS did, but it doesn't work on Mac.

By \"purely with AJAX,\" I take it you mean to exclude even an HTML file input, which needs a submit, and which limits you to one file per input anyway. I coincidentally just ran across <a href=\"http://www.aflax.org/examples/fileupload/fileupload.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> example of javascript-driven asynchronous file pick/upload, but it requires flash8 on the client.

So that's a non-starter, as they say.

I'm speaking from the vantage point of filicio.us (http://filicio.us), which is basically a file storage system based on ajax, tags and s3 in a pretty mashup. We use Flash 8 with an auto-install thingy to get the job done, and when it's been interfaced with JS and limited only to uploading, it actually gives us the best of all worlds: Multiple file selection and cross-browser support.\n(For us, the main problem is the mile from our server to Amazon's -- we'd like to have a Flash app do the upload directly, but currently we're forced to have the app upload to filicio.us and then we upload the files onwards.

This is an example: http://www.captain.at/ajax-file-upload.php</p>\n<p>I haven't tried this, and obviously it's lacking scalability. But it may address very specific needs in environment where Moz is always on hand. And did I dream that VBScript includes some extra function for browsing, reading and writing local file, even in IE?

By \"purely with AJAX,\" I take it you mean to exclude even an HTML file input, which needs a submit, and which limits you to one file per input anyway. I coincidentally just ran across <a href=\"http://www.aflax.org/examples/fileupload/fileupload.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> example of javascript-driven asynchronous file pick/upload, but it requires flash8 on the client.

So that's a non-starter, as they say. Which is kind of a relief because I was uncomfortable with the fact that it involved flash in any manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general though the idea of making a web-based s3 interface is plagued by the problem of that last mile - from the browser to the filesystem.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084674\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://filicio.us\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4cd1d6b6ff6cdcb75a27eb998608df30&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://filicio.us\">Steffen Christensen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084674\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-25T21:09:06\">2006-04-25T21:09:06</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Chris: You're right, Flash 8 is a hassle, but frankly it's a worthy one. I'm speaking from the vantage point of filicio.us (http://filicio.us), which is basically a file storage system based on ajax, tags and s3 in a pretty mashup. We use Flash 8 with an auto-install thingy to get the job done, and when it's been interfaced with JS and limited only to uploading, it actually gives us the best of all worlds: Multiple file selection and cross-browser support.\r\n(For us, the main problem is the mile from our server to Amazon's -- we'd like to have a Flash app do the upload directly, but currently we're forced to have the app upload to filicio.us and then we upload the files onwards.

Apparerently, Mozilla includes some extra modules for handling local files if given the necessary permissions manually from the user.

But it may address very specific needs in environment where Moz is always on hand. And did I dream that VBScript includes some extra function for browsing, reading and writing local file, even in IE?

He writes:</p>\n     <ul>\n     <li>\n     <span><i>This thing is appropriating the necessarily amorphous terminology of &#8220;Ajax&#8221; for an implementation that is directly at odds with why Ajax is an important technology. A XUL app being billed as &#8220;Ajax&#8221; is just as laughable as a Flex or XAML app suddenly growing the same moniker. That it&#8217;s Mozilla&#8217;s walled-garden language doesn&#8217;t really excuse the gaffe.</i></span>\n     </li>\n     </ul>\n <p>I thought <a href=\"http://www.linspire.com/ajaxwrite.php\">ajaxWrite</a> was pretty keen when I first tried it - I presumed there must've been a bit of nice trickery to get what is generally called an AJAX app to work like that.  Imagine my disappointed surprise when I realize that they used XUL.  XUL ain't AJAX, no matter how you try to deform and stretch the term.</p>\n <p>AJAX may be a coined term with an acronym of Asynchronous Javascript and XML, but it&#8217;s descriptive of a new wave of web programming practices.</p>\n <p>It&#8217;s not a spec, so you can&#8217;t get away with a literal reading of &#8220;There&#8217;s no HTML in AJAX, so neener!&#8221; It&#8217;s a community concensus term. And, XUL ain&#8217;t a part of it. Hell, read the list from <a href=\"http://adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php\">the original article coining the term</a>:</p>\n     <ul>\n     <li>\n     <span>standards-based presentation using XHTML and CSS;</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>dynamic display and interaction using the Document Object Model;</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>data interchange and manipulation using XML and XSLT;</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>asynchronous data retrieval using XMLHttpRequest;</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>and JavaScript binding everything together.</span>\n     </li>\n     </ul>\n <p>That&#8217;s what AJAX means to <del>us</del> <ins>me</ins>. If you want it to mean something else and get away with it, you&#8217;re going to have to convince everyone who read that article and ran with that definition.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082587\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082587\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-26T18:40:45\">2006-03-26T18:40:45</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>The original Ajax definition doesn't make much sense either.  For example, XHTML isn't important -- work is typically done with the DOM or innerHTML, neither of which care one bit about XHTML.  They care intensely about HTML, though.  XML is not important either -- heck, just replace the X in Ajax with XMLHttpRequest, because that's what people often use.

    "body": " <p>I started this as a comment over at <a href=\"http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=551\">Alex Russell's entry, \"ajaxWrong\"</a>, copied here because I felt like it.  He writes:</p>\r\n     <ul>\r\n     <li>\r\n     <span><i>This thing is appropriating the necessarily amorphous terminology of &#8220;Ajax&#8221; for an implementation that is directly at odds with why Ajax is an important technology. A XUL app being billed as &#8220;Ajax&#8221; is just as laughable as a Flex or XAML app suddenly growing the same moniker. That it&#8217;s Mozilla&#8217;s walled-garden language doesn&#8217;t really excuse the gaffe.</i></span>\r\n     </li>\r\n     </ul>\r\n <p>I thought <a href=\"http://www.linspire.com/ajaxwrite.php\">ajaxWrite</a> was pretty keen when I first tried it - I presumed there must've been a bit of nice trickery to get what is generally called an AJAX app to work like that.  Imagine my disappointed surprise when I realize that they used XUL.  XUL ain't AJAX, no matter how you try to deform and stretch the term.</p>\r\n <p>AJAX may be a coined term with an acronym of Asynchronous Javascript and XML, but it&#8217;s descriptive of a new wave of web programming practices.</p>\r\n <p>It&#8217;s not a spec, so you can&#8217;t get away with a literal reading of &#8220;There&#8217;s no HTML in AJAX, so neener!&#8221; It&#8217;s a community concensus term. And, XUL ain&#8217;t a part of it. Hell, read the list from <a href=\"http://adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php\">the original article coining the term</a>:</p>\r\n     <ul>\r\n     <li>\r\n     <span>standards-based presentation using XHTML and CSS;</span>\r\n     </li>\r\n     <li>\r\n     <span>dynamic display and interaction using the Document Object Model;</span>\r\n     </li>\r\n     <li>\r\n     <span>data interchange and manipulation using XML and XSLT;</span>\r\n     </li>\r\n     <li>\r\n     <span>asynchronous data retrieval using XMLHttpRequest;</span>\r\n     </li>\r\n     <li>\r\n     <span>and JavaScript binding everything together.</span>\r\n     </li>\r\n     </ul>\r\n <p>That&#8217;s what AJAX means to <del>us</del> <ins>me</ins>. If you want it to mean something else and get away with it, you&#8217;re going to have to convince everyone who read that article and ran with that definition.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082587\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082587\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-26T18:40:45\">2006-03-26T18:40:45</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>The original Ajax definition doesn't make much sense either.

Well, rather than staying cagey and in some lame sort of stealth mode - here's an early release, because I want to get some of it out of my head and onto the web.</p>\n <p>Last summer, in a fit of manic love for XOXO, I started writing <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo-outliner-experiment\">a browser-based outliner</a>.  I got busy and had to leave it for awhile, but kept meaning to get back to it.  A few months ago, I <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/XoxoOutliner/js/XoxoOutlinerKit.js\" title=\"XoxoOutlinerKit.js\">totally rewrote that code</a> to correct some memory leaks, streamline some things, and generally employ a few more of the tricks I've learned since last July.  It's still got some work to go.</p>\n <p>The idea I think is most cool about this outliner is that it uses the browser's own data structures in the DOM to both represent and display the outline data.  But, this code doesn't offer any way to get edited outlines into or out of the browser's DOM.  Pointless editing of statically-served XOXO outlines as a demo was all I had.  </p>\n <p>In fact, back in July, <a href=\"http://microformats.org/blog/2005/07/13/xoxo-outline-editor-in-javascript/\">Tantek &Ccedil;elik mentioned my XOXO outline experiment</a> on microformats.org and mused: '<i>Imagine what you could do with some AJAX to \"autosave\" this XOXO outline to the server, and allow multiple users to edit different subpoints simultaneously.</i>'  Hold that thought, because I think I'm about to get a bit closer to that goal.</p>\n <p>The OPML Community Server has a very simple, yet useful API for managing and transferring files via XML-RPC.  In a lot of ways, I think it's competition for the Atom Publishing Protocol.  But, say - did you know that you can do <a href=\"http://www.vcdn.org/Public/XMLRPC/\">XML-RPC from a browser via AJAX</a>?  Well, that particular implementation is a bit old and seems buggy, so <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/XoxoOutliner/js/myXMLRPC.js\" title=\"myXMLRPC.js\">I've started gutting it and rewriting it myself</a>.  So, I can call the OPML Community Server API from a browser - now I need a way to turn in-browser outlines into data I can ship around with the API.</p>\n <p>Well, that's where this next piece of the puzzle comes in: <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/XoxoOutliner/js/XoxoOutliner/Conversions.js\" title=\"XoxoOutliner/Conversions.js\">JavaScript functions to convert between XOXO and OPML data and browser DOM structures</a>.</p>\n <p>So, I've got the pieces in code to go round trip from XOXO and OPML data on a server; to a browser's DOM where it can be edited by way of a JavaScript-driven UI; and back to the server again.  These parts aren't welded together in any form remotely close to finished, but hopefully that's what I'll get around to doing under the project I've named <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a>.  In my own carefully controlled conditions, I've been able to load up, edit, and save outlines on my own <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/OpmlServer\">barely-functional OpmlServer</a> - as well as on <code>blogs.opml.org</code> itself.</p>\n <p>What's all this mean?  Well, if I never get a chance to actually finish this, maybe someone can make use of the parts I've linked to here.  Otherwise, it could soon mean direct in-browser editing of OPML outlines and blogs with OPML Community Server integration.  Combine that with the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/2005/07/18\">OPML Editor's ability to synch up with changed files</a>, and you can edit while you're away and later bring that content back into the more fully-capable desktop application.  (Thanks to <a href=\"http://blogs.opml.org/amyloo/\">Amyloo</a> for pointing me toward that particular trick!)</p>\n <p>Don't hold your breath on my account, though:  I'm in pretty much over my head with work at the moment, so this post is more or less an escape pod for my ideas in case I don't quite make it out of this hole.  <img src=\"http://static.userland.com/shortcuts/images/qbullets/sidesmiley.gif\">  Feel free to steal the pieces.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088015\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://donovanwatts.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=188ad8b4dc99107d22c8b868e45f0508&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://donovanwatts.com/\">Donovan Watts</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088015\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-27T06:46:09\">2006-03-27T06:46:09</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>go les... sounds very cool.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088017\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dannyayers.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7028f422ca6da0180de6c9d922a3228f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dannyayers.com\">Danny</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088017\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-01T12:13:52\">2006-04-01T12:13:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Does sound cool.\nA kind-of feature request.

All the parts are there in rough form, I think.

So, I can call the OPML Community Server API from a browser - now I need a way to turn in-browser outlines into data I can ship around with the API.</p>\r\n <p>Well, that's where this next piece of the puzzle comes in: <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/XoxoOutliner/js/XoxoOutliner/Conversions.js\" title=\"XoxoOutliner/Conversions.js\">JavaScript functions to convert between XOXO and OPML data and browser DOM structures</a>.</p>\r\n <p>So, I've got the pieces in code to go round trip from XOXO and OPML data on a server; to a browser's DOM where it can be edited by way of a JavaScript-driven UI; and back to the server again.  These parts aren't welded together in any form remotely close to finished, but hopefully that's what I'll get around to doing under the project I've named <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a>.  In my own carefully controlled conditions, I've been able to load up, edit, and save outlines on my own <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/OpmlServer\">barely-functional OpmlServer</a> - as well as on <code>blogs.opml.org</code> itself.</p>\r\n <p>What's all this mean?  Well, if I never get a chance to actually finish this, maybe someone can make use of the parts I've linked to here.  Otherwise, it could soon mean direct in-browser editing of OPML outlines and blogs with OPML Community Server integration.  Combine that with the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/2005/07/18\">OPML Editor's ability to synch up with changed files</a>, and you can edit while you're away and later bring that content back into the more fully-capable desktop application.  (Thanks to <a href=\"http://blogs.opml.org/amyloo/\">Amyloo</a> for pointing me toward that particular trick!)</p>\r\n <p>Don't hold your breath on my account, though:  I'm in pretty much over my head with work at the moment, so this post is more or less an escape pod for my ideas in case I don't quite make it out of this hole.  <img src=\"http://static.userland.com/shortcuts/images/qbullets/sidesmiley.gif\">  Feel free to steal the pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088015\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://donovanwatts.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=188ad8b4dc99107d22c8b868e45f0508&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://donovanwatts.com/\">Donovan Watts</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088015\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-27T06:46:09\">2006-03-27T06:46:09</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>go les... sounds very cool.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088017\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dannyayers.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7028f422ca6da0180de6c9d922a3228f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dannyayers.com\">Danny</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088017\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-01T12:13:52\">2006-04-01T12:13:52</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Does sound cool.\r\nA kind-of feature request.

All the parts are there in rough form, I think.  There's a method <code>XoxoOutliner.Conversions.fromDOMtoXOXO(ele)</code> that takes a UL or OL node from the DOM and attempts to serialize it as XOXO, stripping out all the crud injected to manage the UI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, maybe <code>data = XoxoOutliner.Conversions.fromDOMtoXOXO($('outline1'))</code> will get you an XOXO string for the first outline on the page, depending on what ID it has.  ('outline1' is auto-assigned if none already given)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should be able to then make a POST request with XMLHttpRequest using that data as the body, or whatever your API requires.  HAving not yet had a chance to try it, of course, it probably needs some work yet</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088021\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dannyayers.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7028f422ca6da0180de6c9d922a3228f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dannyayers.com\">Danny</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088021\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-04-01T21:03:48\">2006-04-01T21:03:48</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Excellent, thanks Les.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

Presentations straight from outlines, with web standards goodness.  Who says you can't have cake and eat it too? </span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>Later:  Hot damn, it's my <a href=\"http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/l.m.orchard.xml\">Instant Outline as an S5 presentation</a>.  No, it doesn't make a ton of sense, but it was quick and easy to make this nonsense.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span><a href=\"http://blogs.opml.org/dwatts/2006/02/15#When:4:55:09PM\">Donovan's also getting an odd error</a> from my newsRiver add-on, and the original NewsRiver.  I hope my crud didn't break things, though.  Not sure if this tip helps, but:  You can try running <kbd>viewNewsItems</kbd> in decafbadNewsRiverSuite directly within the OPML editor to \"replay\" the last web request and get an in-editor error dialog with a more helpful Go To button to chase the error.</span>\n     </li>\n     <li>\n     <span>I'm starting to think that the OPML Editor and NewsRiver is a good platform to try throwing together a next iteration of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/hacking_rss_and_atom/ch15_popular_links.py\">popular links script</a> and some notions I had in mind for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a>.  I still really like some of the ideas I was exploring with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a> - but apropos <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/13/reading-lists-opml-xoxo-semantic-web-and-tools\">my recent semi-rant about tools</a>, I should target efforts where more people can take advantage of them more easily.  I love Python, and definitely have a yen for things running on the OS itself - rather than the OS-within-an-OS that is the OPML Editor.  But, I haven't yet had time to bundle my stuff up as a single-icon install like the OPML Editor, and there's a lot of infrastructure already there for the hacking.

Presentations straight from outlines, with web standards goodness.  Who says you can't have cake and eat it too? </span>\r\n     </li>\r\n     <li>\r\n     <span>Later:  Hot damn, it's my <a href=\"http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/l.m.orchard.xml\">Instant Outline as an S5 presentation</a>.  No, it doesn't make a ton of sense, but it was quick and easy to make this nonsense.</span>\r\n     </li>\r\n     <li>\r\n     <span><a href=\"http://blogs.opml.org/dwatts/2006/02/15#When:4:55:09PM\">Donovan's also getting an odd error</a> from my newsRiver add-on, and the original NewsRiver.  I hope my crud didn't break things, though.  Not sure if this tip helps, but:  You can try running <kbd>viewNewsItems</kbd> in decafbadNewsRiverSuite directly within the OPML editor to \"replay\" the last web request and get an in-editor error dialog with a more helpful Go To button to chase the error.</span>\r\n     </li>\r\n     <li>\r\n     <span>I'm starting to think that the OPML Editor and NewsRiver is a good platform to try throwing together a next iteration of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/hacking_rss_and_atom/ch15_popular_links.py\">popular links script</a> and some notions I had in mind for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a>.  I still really like some of the ideas I was exploring with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a> - but apropos <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/13/reading-lists-opml-xoxo-semantic-web-and-tools\">my recent semi-rant about tools</a>, I should target efforts where more people can take advantage of them more easily.  I love Python, and definitely have a yen for things running on the OS itself - rather than the OS-within-an-OS that is the OPML Editor.  But, I haven't yet had time to bundle my stuff up as a single-icon install like the OPML Editor, and there's a lot of infrastructure already there for the hacking.

You&#39;re matching tuples by way of Technorati, Feedster, FeedBurner, and coComment RSS feeds.  We can all be <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/07/29/kibo-kibo-kibo\">Kibo</a> now.</p>\n<p>The more we can extend executable representations of our mental <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Abaleen\">baleen</a> out into the web, the more relevancy comes to us.

It&#39;s also the first time I&#39;ve heard Danny Ayers&#39; voice, so that was pretty cool after having been a textual blog acquaintance for a few years now.  As for the rest of the guys on the call, I&#39;m not quite as familiar with all of them yet, but I&#39;ll be adding them to my Reading Lists shortly.</p>\n<p>Apropos of this podcast, I&#39;ve lately gotten a bit of a fresh take on the RSS/OPML versus XHTML versus Semantic Web tech merry-go-round.  Here&#39;s the basic gist:  Invest time into tools that solve problems first and formats that enable possibilities second, if you want to get any attention and subsequent help.</p>\n<p>And then I say &quot;tools&quot;, I don&#39;t mean a GraphViz construct that makes really cool charts for people willing to chase down and install the dependencies.  No, I mean something like the OPML Editor.  The OPML Editor comes in a single package, and you launch it from a single icon.  The OPML Editor is <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty piece of software</a> that&#39;s nonetheless helping me achieve some practical goals that I&#39;ve heretofore been vaguely stymied in reaching.  The OPML Editor is making me think more favorably about OPML, <i>despite</i> OPML being <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">a shitty format</a>.</p>\n<p>The utility of the OPML Editor is giving me the motivation to build filters and workarounds to transmute OPML into XOXO and RDF formats, but only when the need arises.  I could also see putting an OPML-to-triples bridge in front of a semweb crawler or tool.  And, there&#39;s no reason why outlines in the OPML Editor couldn&#39;t be rendered in XOXO and RDF formats by the tool itself, if there&#39;s something useful around to consume it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I&#39;ve done enough with RDF and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo_outliner_experiment\">XOXO</a> to see the clear potential in both.  With enough RDF data around, you can turn the whole wide web into a single massively networked database ripe for the querying thanks to a uniform data model and clear specs for representation of that model.  With XOXO and microformats, you get a <a href=\"http://www.sudoku.com/\">Sudoku-esque</a> solution to providing both human and machine readable data in the same format and file, while sterring close to the inherent design principles of the web.</p>\n<p>The problem with these formats, though, is that they open potential avenues but don&#39;t provide value until there&#39;s some foot traffic on the avenues.  This is just establishing a world in which there can exist both chickens and eggs, but not doing much with respect to concrete instantiations of poultry.\nNow, to be fair, there have been efforts to make practical usage of RDF (see: <a href=\"http://musicbrainz.org/\">MusicBrainz</a>) and these are early days for microformats.  But, I think a lot more effort needs to be given toward making useful, personally rewarding tools - and less effort given toward expressing awe toward the potentials given by formats and models.  You can have both, but you&#39;ve got to pick one to start with.</p>\n<p>And, the reason you need to make tools first that use formats second is attention.  (That&#39;s been a buzzword lately, hasn&#39;t it?)  You need attention if you want adoption and help.  And, you can get attention - and subsequent help - by scratching someone&#39;s itch.</p>\n<p>Now, some people&#39;s itches are scratched by the fun of abstract symbol manipulation and the perception of elegance.  Others&#39; itches are scratched by getting work done, like writing or organizing thoughts or expanding awareness of more information sources.  Personally, I&#39;ve got itches of both of these varieties.  The problem is that there are many fewer people with itches in that first category.  And, no offense to anyone, that seems to be the bulk of the RDF and XOXO fanbase at the moment.  For the second category, even if things are shitty, smoke a bit and catch on fire - as long as some work gets done at the end of the day, there&#39;s a lot of tolerance to go around and a lot of motivation to pitch in to improve the situation.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I firmly believe that ATOM, RDF, and XHTML-based microformats trounce OPML, RSS, and the like in terms of clear definition, affordance in manipulation, and technical elegance.  But, OPML and RSS are still winning in the world because the tools using these formats are scratching some damn annoying itches.  And, though towers built atop shitty tools and formats seem Jenga-shaky, somehow they never quite come crashing down.  Maybe they will come crashing down someday, but we seem to be getting work done in the meantime.</p>\n<p>So, to wrap up:  My take on this whole mess is that your format will gain adoption to the degree that the tools producing it help people get work done.  I can&#39;t find tools today for RDF and XOXO that are as rewardingly useful as the OPML Editor has become.  When that happens, the story may change.</p>\n<!-- tags: metablogging rdf semweb webdev opml rss syndication microformats xoxo podcasting -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086877\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e377f3e2140297d32460ae9a4b38ff98&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086877\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-14T02:32:49\">2006-02-14T02:32:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>There's a lot to be said for rough consensus and running code, and there's a lot more running code that speaks OPML than there is that speaks XOXO or RDF.

With enough RDF data around, you can turn the whole wide web into a single massively networked database ripe for the querying thanks to a uniform data model and clear specs for representation of that model.  With XOXO and microformats, you get a <a href=\"http://www.sudoku.com/\">Sudoku-esque</a> solution to providing both human and machine readable data in the same format and file, while sterring close to the inherent design principles of the web.\r\n\r\nThe problem with these formats, though, is that they open potential avenues but don't provide value until there's some foot traffic on the avenues.  This is just establishing a world in which there can exist both chickens and eggs, but not doing much with respect to concrete instantiations of poultry.\r\nNow, to be fair, there have been efforts to make practical usage of RDF (see: <a href=\"http://musicbrainz.org/\">MusicBrainz</a>) and these are early days for microformats.  But, I think a lot more effort needs to be given toward making useful, personally rewarding tools - and less effort given toward expressing awe toward the potentials given by formats and models.  You can have both, but you've got to pick one to start with.\r\n\r\nAnd, the reason you need to make tools first that use formats second is attention.  (That's been a buzzword lately, hasn't it?)  You need attention if you want adoption and help.  And, you can get attention - and subsequent help - by scratching someone's itch.\r\n\r\nNow, some people's itches are scratched by the fun of abstract symbol manipulation and the perception of elegance.  Others' itches are scratched by getting work done, like writing or organizing thoughts or expanding awareness of more information sources.  Personally, I've got itches of both of these varieties.  The problem is that there are many fewer people with itches in that first category.  And, no offense to anyone, that seems to be the bulk of the RDF and XOXO fanbase at the moment.  For the second category, even if things are shitty, smoke a bit and catch on fire - as long as some work gets done at the end of the day, there's a lot of tolerance to go around and a lot of motivation to pitch in to improve the situation.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I firmly believe that ATOM, RDF, and XHTML-based microformats trounce OPML, RSS, and the like in terms of clear definition, affordance in manipulation, and technical elegance.  But, OPML and RSS are still winning in the world because the tools using these formats are scratching some damn annoying itches.  And, though towers built atop shitty tools and formats seem Jenga-shaky, somehow they never quite come crashing down.  Maybe they will come crashing down someday, but we seem to be getting work done in the meantime.\r\n\r\nSo, to wrap up:  My take on this whole mess is that your format will gain adoption to the degree that the tools producing it help people get work done.  I can't find tools today for RDF and XOXO that are as rewardingly useful as the OPML Editor has become.  When that happens, the story may change.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: metablogging rdf semweb webdev opml rss syndication microformats xoxo podcasting -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086877\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e377f3e2140297d32460ae9a4b38ff98&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086877\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-14T02:32:49\">2006-02-14T02:32:49</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>There's a lot to be said for rough consensus and running code, and there's a lot more running code that speaks OPML than there is that speaks XOXO or RDF.

    "html": "<p>(<em>Note: This is a long one.</em>)</p>\n<p>Reading <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060207-6133.html\">&quot;The slow decline of the blockbuster&quot; on Ars Technica</a> reminds me that <a href=\"http://www.thelongtail.com/about.html\">this Long Tail stuff</a> is something on which I&#39;ve been wanting to write something intelligent for a long time now.  This might all just be techno-hippy <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/2000/08/27/michegas\">michegas</a> in the end, but I&#39;m really excited about the possibility of living in a Long-Tailed age.</p>\n<p>You see, if I were to pick a lifelong war cry and embroider it on my own personal flag, that cry would be &quot;<a href=\"http://www.jcf.org/bliss.php\">Follow Your Bliss</a>!&quot;  And my bliss is found in the course of learning, in the act of creative work and making things, and in the continual effort of self-refinement as creativity recursively applied.</p>\n<p>Now, the thing about bliss is that it&#39;s not just some hedonistic easy road paved with whipped cream.  Bliss is a hard thing to follow—you&#39;ve got to keep your eyes on it, and there&#39;s quite often a lot of pain involved.  But, I believe that following bliss is the only way to get real, honest, unbounded joy out of life that builds in unfailing increment.</p>\n<p>What does my bliss have to do with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tail\">the Long Tail</a>?  Well, you see, it&#39;s easier to be creative and live creatively in the midst of a culture that is itself steeped in creativity—and I think that a Long-Tailed culture is the best bet for it.  I see a Long Tail as the hallmark of a living artisan culture, as opposed to the slow death of a consumer culture that&#39;ll just leave us all fat and useless.</p>\n<p>Why do we even have a culture that enshrines such a poisonous unidirectional flow of product to consumer?  Scarcity.  Mass production makes it cheap to make lots of the same thing—yet, the means of that production has historically been very expensive to acquire.  </p>\n<p>Thus, assembly lines are scarce.  The same has goes for transmission towers, radio frequencies, movie theaters, and recording studios.  As a perverse consequence, we&#39;ve all just gotten used to the idea that almost no one is cut out to make much at all and common creativity is relegated to head-patted cottage niches who make their own soap.</p>\n<p>What I think the growing Long Tail will tell us, though, is that for many areas of creative concern, scarcity in the means of production is evaporating.  Many products of creativity—i.e. sound, video, and text—can be composed on a cheap computer and duplicated with negligible cost on the web.  In fact, as things like <a href=\"http://www.bittorrent.com/\">BitTorrent</a> take off, distribution costs actually <em>fall</em> with popularity and scale.  (Just think, what if distribution costs can fall below zero?  I&#39;m not just talking money here.)</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve got a lot of hope in what I see happening with blogging, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/podcasting\">podcasting</a>, and other such network-driven channels for creativity.  I also have a lot of hope for the generations of kids not only growing up with computers, but also with <a href=\"http://netflix.com\">Netflix</a>, <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/\">GarageBand</a>, <a href=\"http://myspace.com\">MySpace</a>, <a href=\"http://livejournal.com\">LiveJournal</a>, <a href=\"http://youtube.com\">YouTube</a>, and even <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/podcasting\">YTMND</a>.  You can scoff at them all you like, but some of that stuff&#39;s got a little bit of genius in it.</p>\n<p>We&#39;ve got this entertainment industry with an ultra-rich royalty caste of supposedly super-creative celebrities, but it&#39;s all driven by the scarcity that technology is eroding away.  Sure, you can find some really, truly brilliant people up there—but I&#39;m willing to bet there are armies of people down here who just haven&#39;t gotten in the right place at the right time or who&#39;ve abandoned creativity because they had no viable outlet.  </p>\n<p>So, imagine a more distributed entertainment universe populated by more creative people—with fewer big productions and even fewer gazillionaires.  Creativity, attention, and time become the only significant scarcities.</p>\n<p>Imagine more people just entertaining each other and goading each other on.  Imagine making a <em>decent</em> living doing creative stuff you love, based on the moral and monetary contributions of intimate audiences filled with co-creators—who, while perhaps <a href=\"http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/28/what-is-friendship/\">not quite friends</a> are at least <em>befriendable*.  No one gets so rich bankwise—they get by just fine, mind you—but *everyone</em> lives in a lot more bliss.</p>\n<p>This is not unlike Orson Scott Card&#39;s description of <a href=\"http://www.hatrack.com/osc/books/crystalcity.shtml\">The Crystal City in his Alvin Maker series</a>.</p>\n<p>I want to see a culture where restrictions on remix are given the same odd looks as powdered wigs.  I want to see, as an entrenched tradition, future creative adults route around the network damage of old proprietary industries steeped in scarcity and control.

    "body": "(*Note: This is a long one.*)\r\n\r\nReading [\"The slow decline of the blockbuster\" on Ars Technica][bb] reminds me that [this Long Tail stuff][lt] is something on which I've been wanting to write something intelligent for a long time now.  This might all just be techno-hippy [michegas][mg] in the end, but I'm really excited about the possibility of living in a Long-Tailed age.\r\n  \r\nYou see, if I were to pick a lifelong war cry and embroider it on my own personal flag, that cry would be \"[Follow Your Bliss][fb]!\"  And my bliss is found in the course of learning, in the act of creative work and making things, and in the continual effort of self-refinement as creativity recursively applied.\r\n\r\n[fb]: http://www.jcf.org/bliss.php\r\n\r\nNow, the thing about bliss is that it's not just some hedonistic easy road paved with whipped cream.  Bliss is a hard thing to follow—you've got to keep your eyes on it, and there's quite often a lot of pain involved.  But, I believe that following bliss is the only way to get real, honest, unbounded joy out of life that builds in unfailing increment.\r\n\r\nWhat does my bliss have to do with [the Long Tail][lt2]?  Well, you see, it's easier to be creative and live creatively in the midst of a culture that is itself steeped in creativity—and I think that a Long-Tailed culture is the best bet for it.  I see a Long Tail as the hallmark of a living artisan culture, as opposed to the slow death of a consumer culture that'll just leave us all fat and useless.\r\n\r\n[lt2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tail\r\n\r\nWhy do we even have a culture that enshrines such a poisonous unidirectional flow of product to consumer?  Scarcity.  Mass production makes it cheap to make lots of the same thing—yet, the means of that production has historically been very expensive to acquire.  \r\n\r\nThus, assembly lines are scarce.  The same has goes for transmission towers, radio frequencies, movie theaters, and recording studios.  As a perverse consequence, we've all just gotten used to the idea that almost no one is cut out to make much at all and common creativity is relegated to head-patted cottage niches who make their own soap.\r\n\r\nWhat I think the growing Long Tail will tell us, though, is that for many areas of creative concern, scarcity in the means of production is evaporating.  Many products of creativity—i.e. sound, video, and text—can be composed on a cheap computer and duplicated with negligible cost on the web.  In fact, as things like [BitTorrent][bt] take off, distribution costs actually *fall* with popularity and scale.  (Just think, what if distribution costs can fall below zero?  I'm not just talking money here.)\r\n\r\nI've got a lot of hope in what I see happening with blogging, [podcasting][pod], and other such network-driven channels for creativity.  I also have a lot of hope for the generations of kids not only growing up with computers, but also with [Netflix][nf], [GarageBand][gb], [MySpace][ms], [LiveJournal][lj], [YouTube][yt], and even [YTMND][].  You can scoff at them all you like, but some of that stuff's got a little bit of genius in it.\r\n\r\n[lj]: http://livejournal.com\r\n[yt]: http://youtube.com\r\n[ms]: http://myspace.com\r\n[nf]: http://netflix.com\r\n[gb]: http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/\r\n\r\nWe've got this entertainment industry with an ultra-rich royalty caste of supposedly super-creative celebrities, but it's all driven by the scarcity that technology is eroding away.  Sure, you can find some really, truly brilliant people up there—but I'm willing to bet there are armies of people down here who just haven't gotten in the right place at the right time or who've abandoned creativity because they had no viable outlet.  \r\n\r\nSo, imagine a more distributed entertainment universe populated by more creative people—with fewer big productions and even fewer gazillionaires.  Creativity, attention, and time become the only significant scarcities.\r\n\r\nImagine more people just entertaining each other and goading each other on.  Imagine making a *decent* living doing creative stuff you love, based on the moral and monetary contributions of intimate audiences filled with co-creators—who, while perhaps [not quite friends][friends] are at least *befriendable*.  No one gets so rich bankwise—they get by just fine, mind you—but *everyone* lives in a lot more bliss.\r\n\r\n[friends]: http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/28/what-is-friendship/\r\n\r\nThis is not unlike Orson Scott Card's description of [The Crystal City in his Alvin Maker series][cc].\r\n\r\n[cc]: http://www.hatrack.com/osc/books/crystalcity.shtml\r\n\r\nI want to see a culture where restrictions on remix are given the same odd looks as powdered wigs.  I want to see, as an entrenched tradition, future creative adults route around the network damage of old proprietary industries steeped in scarcity and control.  After all, \"[the only long-term effect of copy protection is to ensure that those who defeat it are immortalized.][imm]\"\r\n\r\n[imm]: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2001/07/29/my_crush_on_spyro_what_flash_animations_remind_me_of_and_what_the_past_will_look_like_someday\r\n\r\nWe'll still need professional editors and crews for the *really* good stuff—*but that's creative work too*.  The same goes for everyone else who plays an honest role in getting visions realized—this isn't all just about the entertainment industry.  Honestly, I see the entrenchment of universal creativity as one of the few ways the United States can cope with increasingly global markets—we've got a bit of a head start in some areas, if we take it.  Digging in heels and protecting aging ways of business that have long since ridden out their respective initial creative Big Bangs just won't cut it.\r\n\r\nI want to see the 10% left over from 90% of everyone's crud inevitably exceed the total output of today's entertainment industry and spill into other industries.  I want to see a new industry spring up whose sole purpose is to sift through chaff and cultivate the naturally emergent creative best.

And, in excitement, I'm handwaving away a lot of stuff.

    "html": "<p>So, I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/28/ancient-code-drifting-down-the-newsriver\">expressed some renewed interest</a> in tinkering around with the code behind the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/\">OPML Editor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.newsriver.org/\">NewsRiver</a>.  Well, it needs to be said that there are some strings attached to playing in this field:  That is, these are Dave Winer&#39;s potato chips I&#39;m enjoying.  </p>\n<p>And, well, when you&#39;re taking chips from another another guy&#39;s lunchpail, it&#39;s customary to at least be nice to the guy and be gracious about the sharing.  Granted, when I&#39;m done, there could end up being <em>more</em> potato chips left in the bag than when I found it—that&#39;s the nature of this sort of sharing, after all.  But the bag, nonetheless, was brought to the table by Dave.  </p>\n<p>Although I&#39;ve tried to bow out of it over the past few years, I have historically been found amongst the crowd who&#39;ve been known to take pokes at Dave when it affords a run of chuckles or guffaws.  Sometimes, this has been in the pursuit of making a technical point or two in dramatic fashion—but often this has just been done toward the goals of playground-level politics and tit-for-tat.    </p>\n<p>Well, this crap doesn&#39;t suit me.  Or at least, I don&#39;t want to be suited for it.  You see, I really just care about being friendly, working on decent code—and besides, my <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/21/whats_your_winer_number\">Winer Number</a> is right around <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)\">Mu</a>.</p>\n<p>Although I&#39;ve been witness to many clashes of ego involving the man with others of strong ego, I&#39;ve never actually been the personal victim of any slight from Mr. Winer that I care to count or remember.  It&#39;s been fashionable to poke at him, but my goal is to keep my ego at a calm distance from most things in life and I&#39;ve not got any personal gripes with Dave Winer.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, when I look at my career over the last few years, I see plain evidence that I&#39;ve benefitted well from the man&#39;s influence—even if indirectly from his work.  I&#39;ve successfully profited from implementations of XML-RPC and RSS.  I&#39;ve managed to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1\">write my first book</a> thanks to things I first picked up from him.  And, I&#39;ve learned a lot in pursuing <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe\">fractional horsepower HTTP servers</a>.</p>\n<p>Dave writes <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">shitty software</a> and evangelizes shitty ideas.

    "body": "So, I've [expressed some renewed interest][interest] in tinkering around with the code behind the [OPML Editor][opml] and [NewsRiver][news].  Well, it needs to be said that there are some strings attached to playing in this field:  That is, these are Dave Winer's potato chips I'm enjoying.  \r\n\r\nAnd, well, when you're taking chips from another another guy's lunchpail, it's customary to at least be nice to the guy and be gracious about the sharing.  Granted, when I'm done, there could end up being *more* potato chips left in the bag than when I found it—that's the nature of this sort of sharing, after all.  But the bag, nonetheless, was brought to the table by Dave.  \r\n\r\nAlthough I've tried to bow out of it over the past few years, I have historically been found amongst the crowd who've been known to take pokes at Dave when it affords a run of chuckles or guffaws.  Sometimes, this has been in the pursuit of making a technical point or two in dramatic fashion—but often this has just been done toward the goals of playground-level politics and tit-for-tat.    \r\n\r\nWell, this crap doesn't suit me.  Or at least, I don't want to be suited for it.  You see, I really just care about being friendly, working on decent code—and besides, my [Winer Number][wn] is right around [Mu][].\r\n\r\nAlthough I've been witness to many clashes of ego involving the man with others of strong ego, I've never actually been the personal victim of any slight from Mr. Winer that I care to count or remember.  It's been fashionable to poke at him, but my goal is to keep my ego at a calm distance from most things in life and I've not got any personal gripes with Dave Winer.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, when I look at my career over the last few years, I see plain evidence that I've benefitted well from the man's influence—even if indirectly from his work.  I've successfully profited from implementations of XML-RPC and RSS.  I've managed to [write my first book][book] thanks to things I first picked up from him.  And, I've learned a lot in pursuing [fractional horsepower HTTP servers][fh].\r\n\r\nDave writes [shitty software][shitty] and evangelizes shitty ideas.  And, since the turn of the century or so, I've adopted and improvised upon many of them for fun and profit.  Thus, while I don't want to be on any \"side\" or in any \"camp\" or  be a mindless fan or follower of anyone or anything—I do feel a need to at least be *nice* to Dave Winer while I'm sharing his potato chips.\r\n\r\nSo, Dave?  I'm sorry I've pissed in the bag of chips a few times.  Maybe we can just call those salt and vinegar and let someone else eat 'em.  In the meantime, I might make a run to the party store for some dip or something.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: winer opml newsriver  -->\r\n\r\n[shitty]: http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\r\n[fh]: http://davenet.scripting.com/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe\r\n[book]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1\r\n[mu]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)\r\n[wn]: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/21/whats_your_winer_number\r\n[interest]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/28/ancient-code-drifting-down-the-newsriver\r\n[opml]: http://support.opml.org/\r\n[news]: http://www.newsriver.org/\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083364\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.flirtinserat.de\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=66afe238f8f6f1f8028362dab437a8fb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.flirtinserat.de\">Brad Neuberg</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083364\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-30T10:54:25\">2006-01-30T10:54:25</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Do you have a online demo for the OPML Editor you mentioned ?</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

    "html": "<p>So, while working through some writing blockages last weekend, I started doing <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/21/a-bit-of-newsriver-hackery\">some hacking</a> on <a href=\"http://scripting.wordpress.com/2005/12/29/why-im-working-on-an-aggregator/\">Dave Winer&#39;s newsRiver</a> running on the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/\">OPML Editor</a> platform.  (Oh, and it <em>is</em> a platform, maybe more so than even emacs—don&#39;t let the moniker &#39;editor&#39; fool you.)</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s the thing:  It was a lot of addictive fun, and it takes me back to the <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/11/ooooho\">love/hate thing I had with Radio</a>, back toward the first days of this blog.  This Frontier / Radio / OPML Editor environment is undeniably satisfying for me to work in.  It&#39;s like potato chips:  Jump to an outline here, tweak some code there, mangle an outline node up there, reload a browser page, watch things go—lots of moments of instant gratification all building incrementally atop one another.</p>\n<p>In one package—which reminds me a lot of <a href=\"http://www.squeak.org/\">Squeak</a>—the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/\">OPML Editor</a> bundles a crazy amount of integrated machinery for both Windows and Mac OS X:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UserTalk, a very capable scripting language</li>\n<li>An IDE based on outlining, somewhat like Python&#39;s syntactic indentation</li>\n<li>Persistent on-disk hierarchical hashtables (aka the Object Database)</li>\n<li>Code and data all live in the same object database</li>\n<li>A web server and a host of other networking code—including Jabber messaging, although I can&#39;t attest to its freshness.</li>\n<li>Blog editing and no-effort external web hosting file synch</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/26/oooabf\">Hot patching</a> and easy upgrades that most other software packages dream of</li>\n<li>Years and years and years of (mostly) working code with datestamped change notes and living history.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the thing is?  This was the state of the art for Radio back in 2002—and earlier than that even for Frontier.  Fast forward from then till today, and you&#39;ll find that <a href=\"http://frontierkernel.sourceforge.net/\">Frontier is now Open Source</a>—with many of the same sorts of warts Mozilla&#39;s open source release helpfully revealed back in 1997.  (Some hero needs to come along and port this beast to Linux!  Good luck!)  And now, much of the guts of Radio are released as the <a href=\"http://support.opml.org/\">OPML Editor</a>.  </p>\n<p>In a lot of ways, this whole family of apps built on this common ancestry of code is <a href=\"http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\">really shitty software</a>.  Kind of like <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/02/24/ancient-software-and-programmer-archaeologists\">all that code on the <em>Qeng Ho</em> from Vernor Vinge&#39;s <em>A Deepness in the Sky</em></a>.  This stuff crashes and sets itself on fire a lot, but then again it&#39;s amazing to see just how many wheels have been reinvented and re-reinvented since 2002 (and before) when I fire up this code today.</p>\n<p>And now, it looks like the embers are stirring for this thing again.  There&#39;s been a lot of time for a lot of angst to fade from a lot of places, and it looks like there&#39;s a new crop of fresh people rediscovering this stuff.  </p>\n<p>So, anyway, I like these potato chips.  I think I want to start munching on them again, as time permits.

Ok, very IMHO but : swap US-ASCII for utf-8, XML-RPC for doc/literal XML, RSS 2.0 for Atom, Object Database for triplestore,  Python for UserTalk, outliner for modern IDE (although actually the outliner UI is probably one bit that might be worth preserving as-is) etc. </p>\n<p>Well, ok, maybe it is a bit much to expect.

(Well, more like 'strong distaste' than 'hate' anyway).</p>\n<p>And I've realized that, since drifting away from Radio/Frontier, I've been recapturing it in various forms using tech like Python, triple-stores, mini-HTTP servers, and the like.

And many times, there are very good reasons for thing being hard and lots of things need minding.

Of course, years from now, the XML-RPC stuff might smell a bit while the REST stuff will have stayed solid and revealed further unexpected benefits... but bah.

Oh, and while I'm talking about potato chips—I have to say, [don't pee in the potato chips][pee] and be nice to the guy holding the bag.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: winer rss syndication radio usertalk frontier vinge opml -->\r\n\r\n[pee]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/28/dont-pee-in-the-potato-chips\r\n[squeak]: http://www.squeak.org/\r\n[code]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/02/24/ancient-software-and-programmer-archaeologists\r\n[shitty]: http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware\r\n[hp]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/26/oooabf\r\n[fso]: http://frontierkernel.sourceforge.net/\r\n[lh]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/11/ooooho\r\n[opml]: http://support.opml.org/\r\n[new]: http://scripting.wordpress.com/2005/12/29/why-im-working-on-an-aggregator/\r\n[hack]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/21/a-bit-of-newsriver-hackery\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084407\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=760b4002b07650d4ef654f9fc17e8154&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Robert Brook</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084407\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-28T15:03:50\">2006-01-28T15:03:50</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Serious question: why not use Squeak?</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084408\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084408\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-28T16:01:26\">2006-01-28T16:01:26</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Robert: Short answer is that I saw Radio first for the RSS aggregator and blogging support, started hacking on that, and got sucked into other aspects of it along the way.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Squeak, I saw some fun colorful things and kind of got the gist of the environment, but never got hooked on any daily uses of it after a weekend or two of playing.

Ok, very IMHO but : swap US-ASCII for utf-8, XML-RPC for doc/literal XML, RSS 2.0 for Atom, Object Database for triplestore,  Python for UserTalk, outliner for modern IDE (although actually the outliner UI is probably one bit that might be worth preserving as-is) etc. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, ok, maybe it is a bit much to expect. Maybe a maximally interoperable version of the Frontier approach could be recreated (without reinvention) by plugging together various existing open source libs..?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now I guess I'll have to make do with Web as Platform (and/or Squeak)  ;-)</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084410\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084410\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-28T16:28:59\">2006-01-28T16:28:59</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Danny: Yeah, I agree with a lot of those points, and they fall into the 'hate' side of the 'love/hate' thing for me.  (Well, more like 'strong distaste' than 'hate' anyway).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I've realized that, since drifting away from Radio/Frontier, I've been recapturing it in various forms using tech like Python, triple-stores, mini-HTTP servers, and the like.  And although these things have felt 'healtier' in a non-NIH, bigger community, more loosely coupled way... it's still a satisfying experience (like potato chips) to find it all buttoned up in one integrated package that works on most of the platforms I care about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's still kind of a writing-with-my-wrong-hand kind of pain in the butt to get all the loose coupled stuff working sometimes.  And many times, there are very good reasons for thing being hard and lots of things need minding.  Like, XML-RPC style web services versus REST: </p>\r\n\r\n<p>REST is a cleaner, more web-natural approach—but sometimes it takes a lot of thoughtful meta-tinkering where that XML-RPC stuff would've had you on the road hours ago.  Of course, years from now, the XML-RPC stuff might smell a bit while the REST stuff will have stayed solid and revealed further unexpected benefits... but bah.  They both have their place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's a lot like baked versus fried.

By getting back to the root of our creation, biotech firm Genada hopes to create an animal with human internal organs.

    "body": "While being crazy busy, I've been thoroughly enjoying these podcasts:\r\n\r\n* [Ancestor][anc] by Scott Sigler.\r\n\r\n  \"*On a remote island in Lake Superior, scientists struggle to solve the problem of xenotransplantation -- using animal tissue to replace failing human organs. By getting back to the root of our creation, biotech firm Genada hopes to create an animal with human internal organs. Genada's collective genius gives birth to a fast-growing evil that nature eradicated 250 million years ago -- an evil now on the loose, and very, very hungry...*\"\r\n\r\n  I've [written about Ancestor][wa] before, and I can't believe it's already over.  It's been a great ride, and if you haven't been listening, subscribe and catch up.  Scott's really continued to raise the bar on himself from EarthCore through to the end of Ancestor, and he's got a third tale coming in March.\r\n\r\n* [I Should Be Writing][isbw] by Mur Lafferty.\r\n\r\n  \"*A podcast by a wanna-be writer for wanna-be writers. Let my stack of rejection letters and battle scars benefit you.*\"\r\n  \r\n  Oh yeah, I should be writing.\r\n  \r\n* [Voices of Tomorrow][vot]\r\n\r\n  \"*The Official Podcast of www.365tomorrows.com*\"\r\n  \r\n  These are the sorts of stories I want to write soon.  [The Bitter Kiss of the Ronin's Cup][tb] is this blog's patron story.  Well, if there can be such a thing.\r\n\r\n[tb]: http://voicesoftomorrow.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=46567&comments=on\r\n[vot]: http://voicesoftomorrow.libsyn.com/\r\n\r\n* [Brave Men Run][bmr] by Matthew Wayne Selznick.\r\n\r\n  \"*What If John Hughes Wrote Comic Books? 'Brave Men Run' is the story of Nate Charters. Born different, unsure of his origins, he's an outcast at Abbeque Valley High School, a self-proclaimed \"boy freak\" with few friends and low self-esteem.*\"\r\n\r\n  This really is like X-Men crossed with Pretty in Pink—and it works for me.  I got the e-book, but I just can't bring myself to read it and spoil the rest of the reading.\r\n\r\n* [The Radio Adventures of Doctor Floyd][drf] by Grant Baciocco & Doug Price.  \r\n\r\n  \"*If Jay Ward, creator of Rocky & Bullwinkle, had created Mystery Science Theater 3000 mixed in a little Time Bandits and gave it an educational spin, the result would have been...*\"\r\n  \r\n  Short, tight, fast paced, and incredible punny radio adventures of time travelling absentminded scientists.  They're back from an end-of-year hiatus and going super strong.  In particular, check out the fight scene (*to the end!*) in the middle of [Episode #402][e402]—and wear headphones.\r\n  \r\n  \"*Combo attack! Body blow! Body blow! Boot to the head!

    "html": "<p>Although I have <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/18/not-so-deep-php-thoughts\">my grousing about PHP in general</a>, I have to say that it makes much better template language as-is before pulling something like <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> into the mix.  </p>\n<p>At this point, I consider <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> to be evil—though I&#39;m willing to admit that I haven&#39;t grokked it fully yet.  And this is coming from <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/25/templates-good-or-evil\">a templating addict</a> who has been at times in love with <a href=\"http://www.template-toolkit.org/\">Template Toolkit</a> in Perl,  <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/\">Velocity</a> in Java, and <a href=\"http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/\">Cheetah</a> and <a href=\"http://twisted.sourceforge.net/TwistedDocs-1.2.0rc3/howto/woven.html\">Woven</a> and <a href=\"http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/\">ZPT/TAL</a> in Python.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> seems to have put native-PHP-as-templating to good use, so I&#39;ve already got a favorite for comparison.  But the use of <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> in <a href=\"http://www.reblog.org/\">reBlog</a> rubs me the wrong way.  Of course, <a href=\"http://www.reblog.org/\">reBlog</a> has a lot of highly-abstracted MVC architecture going on.  And this, itself, is something I haven&#39;t much in my PHP explorations thus far.  (In fact, I almost hate to see PHP chopped up in this J2EE-esque fashion, but that&#39;s another story.  Oh, and <a href=\"http://www.reblog.org/\">reBlog</a> rocks, by the way.)</p>\n<p>But either way, <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> makes this right-handed hacker feel like he&#39;s writing with his left.  It seems to have a lot of weird conventions and terminology for which neither knowledge of PHP nor knowledge of other templating systems in general seem much help.  It could just be a learning curve, but to me it seems like an odd <em>sideways</em> curve at the moment.  </p>\n<p>In fact, you know what?  <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> reminds me a lot of <a href=\"http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Guides/DTML-HTML/DTML.html\">DTML in Zope</a>.  I hate <a href=\"http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Guides/DTML-HTML/DTML.html\">DTML</a>—it, also, is most firmly on my evil list.</p>\n<p>Yuck.  Again, it could be just that I haven&#39;t known <a href=\"http://smarty.php.net\">Smarty</a> long enough to like it... but yuck.</p>\n<!-- tags: templating php smarty dtml python perl cheetah webdev programming syndication reblog wordpress evil -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082526\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://luka.kladaric.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=78b0e32da6ce10e17db345a9aa8cde78&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://luka.kladaric.net/\">Luka Kladaric</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082526\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-08T11:55:40\">2006-01-08T11:55:40</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with you...

The main issue is that template authors may not be trustworthy. Once you include or eval() a PHP template the app is no longer in control and I don't see any way of structuring a PHP app such that it cannot be subverted from within. </p>\n<p>The only defense seems to be using the tokenizer functions to build a PHP parser that validates templates against a \"whitelist\" of allowed operations. Savant's Restricted Compiler is about the only implementation out there, but it's not quite complete and seems to be more of a proof-of-concept than battle-tested code.</p>\n<p>Whatever Smarty's faults, it solves the untrusted templates problem nicely.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082534\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082534\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-12T14:27:42\">2006-01-12T14:27:42</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Bryce: Oh, I totally understand the implications of offering too much capability to template authors.

Of course, I used others but it was getting sick coming to a new phase in a project and finding out the template system had become RIP....abandoned before their time.</p>\n<p>Smarty has done two great things for me, and I'll speak about them until the day that PHP is abolished:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Smarty has reduced my code to a reasonably sized, scan-able, masterpiece.  Having the logic and presentation seperate is so nice.  I recently rewrote one of my old projects using smarty and all of a sudden it made sense!  No more php in the html and no more html in the php.  And that's something you can't solve without templates for you juniors out there.</p></li>\n<li><p>Smarty's caching has turned monster db queries into non issues.  Consider this.  A top 10 list from all-time sales.  I'm talking about searching a db with sales spanning 6 years for all items purchased and creating a top sales page.  Easy!  Smarty does it once and caches the results until I decide they need to be refreshed.  Took a 4 second execution time down to less than 0.4 seconds.  And all without having to implement a CMS or otherwise.  Even if you have limitless resources to buy new hardware, caching like this still makes sense.  And the intermediate php/html cache is brilliant.  Everything is so much faster with smarty.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I can't deny, I love Smarty.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082542\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082542\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-01T11:43:36\">2006-02-01T11:43:36</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Tali: I'm usually opinionated, but I try to listen &amp; learn :)</p>\n<p>The benefits you describe with Smarty would seem to come with any decent web development system.  Separating logic and presentation are the general idea behind templating, and some sort of caching is a must no matter what you're using as a presentation-side tool.

(And it’s vaguely more defensible in Perl’s case becase Perl is not a template system; though constrated with Perl the deficiencies of TT’s mini language are just all the more painfully obvious.)</p>\n<p>By all of which I mean to say that whether people use languages in stupid ways does not mean the language is the problem; not in either PHP’s or Perl’s case.</p>\n<p>I also don’t see why you need a templating system to implement caching; in fact, having caching coupled with the template engine sounds like a bad distribution of responsibilities. (Indeed, Template Toolkit has no such facilities.) But there’s the Cache::Cache family of modules on the CPAN, which you can use to cache things completely independently of <em>what</em> is being cached – whether it be the output of a template, or the query results themselves, or anything else, which might not even have anything to do without any output you generate.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082546\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bab1c370ad7b246023e23e87c8e206c4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">M.</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082546\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-16T14:13:18\">2006-02-16T14:13:18</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I've good experiences with the Expose PHP template engine (www.kwasd.nl/expose). It doesn't require you to learn a new language, because it uses plain PHP and still offers security, because it contains a tokenizer and, in fact, a small compiler. I used it for some projects and it really offered all I needed. </p>\n<p>And for people who wonder why one would need a template engine: I work with designers and I don't want them to mingle application code. By setting up a shared folder which contains the templates, they can safely work on design and never need to touch my controller or module files. Especially since this template engine has a tokenizer/compiler, they can't call unsafe PHP functions (only those that you, the programmer, register).</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082549\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://mike.teczno.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e3b46099c3fd3844c4539b27f143fd97&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://mike.teczno.com\">Michal Migurski</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082549\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-05T23:16:25\">2006-03-05T23:16:25</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Smarty appealed to us because it offered a (relatively) clean way to separate the code from the HTML output. It's definitely got its problems. A large part of the choice was based on my perception of Smarty as having much thought &amp; effort behind it, plus I like the idea of templates caching down to plain PHP. I've done a few PHP projects where I used PHP as the templating language, and frequently succumbed to the temptation to stash app logic into the templates where it didn't really belong. Smarty has a pretty extensive vocabulary, but has (so far) resisted the pull to incorporate more real-language features, like PHP did. It's worth remembering that PHP was originally supposed to be a template language for \"real\" code to be written in C. <em>shudder</em></p>\n<p>When we forked Reblog from Feed On Feeds, we were starting with raw-PHP display code mixed in with database calls, and it was a freaking disaster. One of my first design goals was to make it hacker-friendly, clarifying and documenting as many seams as possible so people could make localized changes more easily. I'd like to be using Python under the hood with Smarty on top, though there's a lot to be said for using commonly-known tools like Smarty in apps where you want to encourage modifications.</p>\n<p>And Wordpress.... oh, Wordpress. My eyes roll back in my head when I'm forced to touch its convoluted innards. I pushed hard for a Reblog plug-in API specifically so I could cheerfully deprecate the old-style Wordpress plug-in. =)</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "Although I have [my grousing about PHP in general][gphp], I have to say that it makes much better template language as-is before pulling something like [Smarty][smarty] into the mix.  \r\n\r\nAt this point, I consider [Smarty][] to be evil—though I'm willing to admit that I haven't grokked it fully yet.  And this is coming from [a templating addict][tmpl] who has been at times in love with [Template Toolkit][tt] in Perl,  [Velocity][] in Java, and [Cheetah][] and [Woven][] and [ZPT/TAL][zpt] in Python.  \r\n\r\n[WordPress][] seems to have put native-PHP-as-templating to good use, so I've already got a favorite for comparison.  But the use of [Smarty][] in [reBlog][] rubs me the wrong way.  Of course, [reBlog][] has a lot of highly-abstracted MVC architecture going on.  And this, itself, is something I haven't much in my PHP explorations thus far.  (In fact, I almost hate to see PHP chopped up in this J2EE-esque fashion, but that's another story.  Oh, and [reBlog][] rocks, by the way.)\r\n\r\nBut either way, [Smarty][] makes this right-handed hacker feel like he's writing with his left.  It seems to have a lot of weird conventions and terminology for which neither knowledge of PHP nor knowledge of other templating systems in general seem much help.  It could just be a learning curve, but to me it seems like an odd *sideways* curve at the moment.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, you know what?  [Smarty][] reminds me a lot of [DTML in Zope][dtml].  I hate [DTML][]—it, also, is most firmly on my evil list.\r\n\r\nYuck.  Again, it could be just that I haven't known [Smarty][] long enough to like it... but yuck.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: templating php smarty dtml python perl cheetah webdev programming syndication reblog wordpress evil -->\r\n\r\n[dtml]: http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Guides/DTML-HTML/DTML.html\r\n[tt]: http://www.template-toolkit.org/\r\n[velocity]: http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/\r\n[gphp]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/18/not-so-deep-php-thoughts\r\n[cheetah]: http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/\r\n[zpt]: http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/\r\n[smarty]: http://smarty.php.net\r\n[wordpress]: http://wordpress.org/\r\n[reblog]: http://www.reblog.org/\r\n[woven]: http://twisted.sourceforge.net/TwistedDocs-1.2.0rc3/howto/woven.html\r\n[tmpl]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/25/templates-good-or-evil\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082526\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://luka.kladaric.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=78b0e32da6ce10e17db345a9aa8cde78&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://luka.kladaric.net/\">Luka Kladaric</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082526\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-08T11:55:40\">2006-01-08T11:55:40</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with you...

Of course, I used others but it was getting sick coming to a new phase in a project and finding out the template system had become RIP....abandoned before their time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smarty has done two great things for me, and I'll speak about them until the day that PHP is abolished:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><p>Smarty has reduced my code to a reasonably sized, scan-able, masterpiece.  Having the logic and presentation seperate is so nice.  I recently rewrote one of my old projects using smarty and all of a sudden it made sense!  No more php in the html and no more html in the php.  And that's something you can't solve without templates for you juniors out there.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Smarty's caching has turned monster db queries into non issues.  Consider this.  A top 10 list from all-time sales.  I'm talking about searching a db with sales spanning 6 years for all items purchased and creating a top sales page.  Easy!  Smarty does it once and caches the results until I decide they need to be refreshed.  Took a 4 second execution time down to less than 0.4 seconds.  And all without having to implement a CMS or otherwise.  Even if you have limitless resources to buy new hardware, caching like this still makes sense.  And the intermediate php/html cache is brilliant.  Everything is so much faster with smarty.</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>I can't deny, I love Smarty.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082542\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082542\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-01T11:43:36\">2006-02-01T11:43:36</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Tali: I'm usually opinionated, but I try to listen &amp; learn :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The benefits you describe with Smarty would seem to come with any decent web development system.  Separating logic and presentation are the general idea behind templating, and some sort of caching is a must no matter what you're using as a presentation-side tool.

But there’s the Cache::Cache family of modules on the CPAN, which you can use to cache things completely independently of <em>what</em> is being cached – whether it be the output of a template, or the query results themselves, or anything else, which might not even have anything to do without any output you generate.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082546\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bab1c370ad7b246023e23e87c8e206c4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">M.</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082546\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-02-16T14:13:18\">2006-02-16T14:13:18</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I've good experiences with the Expose PHP template engine (www.kwasd.nl/expose). It doesn't require you to learn a new language, because it uses plain PHP and still offers security, because it contains a tokenizer and, in fact, a small compiler. I used it for some projects and it really offered all I needed. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And for people who wonder why one would need a template engine: I work with designers and I don't want them to mingle application code. By setting up a shared folder which contains the templates, they can safely work on design and never need to touch my controller or module files. Especially since this template engine has a tokenizer/compiler, they can't call unsafe PHP functions (only those that you, the programmer, register).</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082549\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e3b46099c3fd3844c4539b27f143fd97&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\">Michal Migurski</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082549\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-05T23:16:25\">2006-03-05T23:16:25</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Smarty appealed to us because it offered a (relatively) clean way to separate the code from the HTML output. It's definitely got its problems. A large part of the choice was based on my perception of Smarty as having much thought &amp; effort behind it, plus I like the idea of templates caching down to plain PHP. I've done a few PHP projects where I used PHP as the templating language, and frequently succumbed to the temptation to stash app logic into the templates where it didn't really belong. Smarty has a pretty extensive vocabulary, but has (so far) resisted the pull to incorporate more real-language features, like PHP did. It's worth remembering that PHP was originally supposed to be a template language for \"real\" code to be written in C. <em>shudder</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we forked Reblog from Feed On Feeds, we were starting with raw-PHP display code mixed in with database calls, and it was a freaking disaster. One of my first design goals was to make it hacker-friendly, clarifying and documenting as many seams as possible so people could make localized changes more easily. I'd like to be using Python under the hood with Smarty on top, though there's a lot to be said for using commonly-known tools like Smarty in apps where you want to encourage modifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Wordpress.... oh, Wordpress. My eyes roll back in my head when I'm forced to touch its convoluted innards. I pushed hard for a Reblog plug-in API specifically so I could cheerfully deprecate the old-style Wordpress plug-in. =)</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

I&#39;ve had this running for well over a year, and it&#39;s always my first stop in the feed reader.  Almost without fail, this tends to surface what&#39;s buzzworthy.</p>\n<p>Basically, this script scans all the current entries of all my subscribed feeds for unique hyperlink URLs found in descriptions and summaries.  It collates all entries by these links, then sorts by the number of entries under each link.  A threshold is applied, filtering for links pointed to by 3 or more entries.  </p>\n<p>At the end, I see a new feed entry displaying the most linked-to things of the moment.  Think of this as a kind of real-time PageRank.  How&#39;s that for network effects?</p>\n<p>I think this is <em>sort of</em> how <a href=\"http://memeorandum.com/\">Memeorandum</a> works, only this is constrained to the feeds in my subscription list.  I&#39;ve been considering making this script a full-on service:  Upload an OPML export from your aggregator, get your own Popular Links feed.  I&#39;ve got all the parts laying around but I haven&#39;t yet had time to put them together—<strong>but if it sounds like something useful, and possibly worth clicking a Paypal donation button, let me know!</strong></p>\n<p>Secondly:  <a href=\"http://tantek.com/presentations/2005/01/attentionxml.html\">Attention.xml</a> makes a lot of sense with regard to the above-quoted article.  When I first heard about <a href=\"http://tantek.com/presentations/2005/01/attentionxml.html\">Attention.xml</a>, I merely cocked my head at it and made a confused sound.  This was before I caught the microformats bug, and before I realized that I <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/01/blogrolls-grow-up-to-become-feedrolls\">started reinventing it</a> a bit in my own ramblings.</p>\n<p>Basically, <a href=\"http://tantek.com/presentations/2005/01/attentionxml.html\">Attention.xml</a> is a feedroll enriched with data about the entries you&#39;ve lately read from each feed.  It&#39;s in an XHTML-based format which—albeit ugly in my opinion and in need of more elegant microformat influence—is indeed viewable in a browser.  In a sense, this format is an auto-blog of my feed consumption.  I was looking for hacks for my NetNewsWire in AppleScript, when I found <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/01/blogrolls-grow-up-to-become-feedrolls\">this Attention.xml generator</a>.  Seeing the output of that, it all clicked.</p>\n<p>Combining <a href=\"http://tantek.com/presentations/2005/01/attentionxml.html\">Attention.xml</a> with my Popular Links algorithm could be a very powerful thing, methinks.  Rather than waiting for my friends to tip over the laziness point to blogging about something, I could digest their shared <a href=\"http://tantek.com/presentations/2005/01/attentionxml.html\">Attention.xml</a> files and collate the links they&#39;ve merely <em>read*.

    "body": "<blockquote cite=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/SAAS/?p=82\">Instead of reading their individual selections of RSS feeds privately, everyone should be encouraged to publish those aggregated feeds on the Web. ... the simple act of publishing those aggregations then makes them available to others, and thus makes them amenable to network effects in a way that they never can be if they're kept private.</blockquote>\r\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/SAAS/?p=82\">» It's time to bury RSS | Software as services | ZDNet.com</a></small>\r\n\r\nMy current two responses to the above:\r\n\r\n* I love my [popular links][pl] summary feed.\r\n* [Attention.xml][att] is starting to make sense to me.\r\n\r\nPutting these two together could be a very powerful tool for bringing network effects to feed reading.\r\n\r\nFirst off, one of the most useful feeds I have is my private Popular Links feed.  [Touting my book again][book], I showcase the [script behind this thing][pl] in Chapter 15.  I've had this running for well over a year, and it's always my first stop in the feed reader.  Almost without fail, this tends to surface what's buzzworthy.\r\n\r\nBasically, this script scans all the current entries of all my subscribed feeds for unique hyperlink URLs found in descriptions and summaries.  It collates all entries by these links, then sorts by the number of entries under each link.  A threshold is applied, filtering for links pointed to by 3 or more entries.  \r\n\r\nAt the end, I see a new feed entry displaying the most linked-to things of the moment.  Think of this as a kind of real-time PageRank.  How's that for network effects?\r\n\r\nI think this is *sort of* how [Memeorandum][meme] works, only this is constrained to the feeds in my subscription list.  I've been considering making this script a full-on service:  Upload an OPML export from your aggregator, get your own Popular Links feed.  I've got all the parts laying around but I haven't yet had time to put them together—**but if it sounds like something useful, and possibly worth clicking a Paypal donation button, let me know!**\r\n\r\nSecondly:  [Attention.xml][att] makes a lot of sense with regard to the above-quoted article.  When I first heard about [Attention.xml][att], I merely cocked my head at it and made a confused sound.  This was before I caught the microformats bug, and before I realized that I [started reinventing it][blogroll] a bit in my own ramblings.\r\n\r\nBasically, [Attention.xml][att] is a feedroll enriched with data about the entries you've lately read from each feed.  It's in an XHTML-based format which—albeit ugly in my opinion and in need of more elegant microformat influence—is indeed viewable in a browser.  In a sense, this format is an auto-blog of my feed consumption.  I was looking for hacks for my NetNewsWire in AppleScript, when I found [this Attention.xml generator][gen].  Seeing the output of that, it all clicked.\r\n\r\nCombining [Attention.xml][att] with my Popular Links algorithm could be a very powerful thing, methinks.  Rather than waiting for my friends to tip over the laziness point to blogging about something, I could digest their shared [Attention.xml][att] files and collate the links they've merely *read*.  In this way, I could build an *AttentionRank* for various things, and cause the cream to rise to the top in my feed reader.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that I'm playing catch-up here, but this all suddenly seems hot to me.  And not to mention, it seems neat that I have all the pieces laying around to build it.  The only bad thing is that I just don't have the time to spare—I've already spent too much time writing this blog post!\r\n\r\nAnyway, maybe you'll hear more from me about this soon.\r\n\r\n[gen]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/01/blogrolls-grow-up-to-become-feedrolls\r\n[blogroll]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/01/blogrolls-grow-up-to-become-feedrolls\r\n[att]: http://tantek.com/presentations/2005/01/attentionxml.html\r\n[meme]: http://memeorandum.com/\r\n[pl]: http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/hacking_rss_and_atom/ch15_popular_links.py\r\n[book]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085102\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.wakingideas.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c3a79b6f40ba93496389e42cd76ad2f1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.wakingideas.com\">Daniel Nicolas</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085102\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-03T15:39:45\">2006-01-03T15:39:45</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I think you could get away with charging $5 for a service like that.

This is what I think the River of News (ie. Radio UserLand / newsRiver) is missing, and the 3-Pane Aggregator (ie. NetNewsWire / FeedDemon) can provide.  There is no priority in the River of News—while you can generally sort feeds into folders in the 3-Pane Aggregator.  </p>\n<p>So, in my use of NetNewsWire, I&#39;ve got a sort of prioritized  Swamp of News.  I have organized my feeds into a set of folders in prioritized order.  I start from the first folder, and work my way down—but if I haven&#39;t read everything by the end of the day, I hit &quot;Mark All as Read&quot; with no regrets.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these articles don&#39;t go away automatically and the place can get a little smelly &amp; stagnant.  I&#39;ve got an idea percolating to write an AppleScript to do that for me, but it&#39;s a slight pain.  Also unfortunately, I can&#39;t quite get NNW&#39;s combined outline view to work to my satisfaction—so my view&#39;s still subdivided up into headline and preview pane chunks, somewhat more like a marshy delta than a rushing river.</p>\n<p>What I really want is a River of News view that&#39;s got prioritized layers.  That is, there should be strata to this River.  Tasty foam up toward the top, attention-consuming undertow toward the bottom.</p>\n<p>Near the surface, I can sip from all my highest-value feeds—daily comics and amusements, my synthetic popular links feed, server monitor feeds, ego-surfing search feeds, high-signal news feeds.  </p>\n<p>Further down, I can slip into the top layers of the blogosphere, if I have time.  Then, should I happen to get through everything interesting from there, I can start dipping into the high-noise segment of my feeds.</p>\n<p>So, some days, I might only have time to sample a few comics and catch the day&#39;s hot memes.  Other days, I might be able to graze all the way down to my random Feedster search feeds on &quot;Ray Kurzweil&quot; and &quot;Tinderbox&quot;.  In any case, the river should flow without my urging it on.  For each of these strata, I want a River of News user interface, but I want the segmentation provided by folders in a 3-Pane Viewer.</p>\n<p>Still, though, there&#39;s something missing even from a Stratified River of News.  Sometimes, there are things I&#39;d really like to catch from the very bottom of the river that I&#39;ll never personally have time to find.  It&#39;d be nice if this River had <em>some</em> turbulence and mixing between the strata.</p>\n<p>But that&#39;s a subject for a follow-up rant involving machine learning, filtering, and adaptivity built into the aggregator...</p>\n<blockquote cite=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/SAAS/?p=80\">The problem with feed readers is that, although they help us to organize our information feeds, they don't address the root problem of reducing the amount of information we have to take in.

Around that time, I read \"The Media Lab\" by Stewart Brand, who pointed out that even a big newspaper prints no more than about 10 percent of the AP stories on their wire.</p>\n<p>Then, maybe 10 percent of what gets into the paper actually catches the reader's eye. That means that 1 percent of the potential information flow gets to the average reader, and generally, it's not the right 1 percent. </p>\n<p>When I worked for CNN.com, we tried to create a custom news product (called, strangely enough, CustomNews, launched around 1999) that let the reader twiddle a few dials to tune the news that got your attention. You could, for instance, tell the application what sports teams you followed, and set up individualized keywords (I might choose \"Apple\", \"photography\", \"Honda\", \"Atlanta\", \"Tucker, GA\"), and stories featuring those keywords would come up in your news.</p>\n<p>CNN had a big advantage -- we could rely on metadata included in the newswire. When you're pulling newsfeeds from the web, you have a much richer tapestry, but you don't know much about the threads. </p>\n<p>The River of News approach looks to concentrate on maximizing flow, but what we really need, as you suggest, is a way to find the fish in the River of News.</p>\n<p>I rely on some keyword feeds from Google News, Feedster, and Blogdigger to get a similar end result, but none of them matches up to a human editor. It's getting to the point, for instance, that I know I can skip surfing Mac news, and rely on John Gruber at Daring Fireball to catch almost anything I would be interested in.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084553\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=56ee28134dd0776825445e3551979b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\">Bob Aman</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084553\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-07T20:28:44\">2006-01-07T20:28:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Since it'll likely be quite a while before I get around to implementing it myself (and I'm going to even though I don't know how well it'll work), but I suppose I'll just drop my own idea for a next-gen aggregator.</p>\n<p>Aggregator + Bayesian Filter</p>\n<p>Each time you read a post you can mark it as interesting or not.

Around that time, I read \"The Media Lab\" by Stewart Brand, who pointed out that even a big newspaper prints no more than about 10 percent of the AP stories on their wire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, maybe 10 percent of what gets into the paper actually catches the reader's eye. That means that 1 percent of the potential information flow gets to the average reader, and generally, it's not the right 1 percent. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I worked for CNN.com, we tried to create a custom news product (called, strangely enough, CustomNews, launched around 1999) that let the reader twiddle a few dials to tune the news that got your attention. You could, for instance, tell the application what sports teams you followed, and set up individualized keywords (I might choose \"Apple\", \"photography\", \"Honda\", \"Atlanta\", \"Tucker, GA\"), and stories featuring those keywords would come up in your news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN had a big advantage -- we could rely on metadata included in the newswire. When you're pulling newsfeeds from the web, you have a much richer tapestry, but you don't know much about the threads. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The River of News approach looks to concentrate on maximizing flow, but what we really need, as you suggest, is a way to find the fish in the River of News.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I rely on some keyword feeds from Google News, Feedster, and Blogdigger to get a similar end result, but none of them matches up to a human editor. It's getting to the point, for instance, that I know I can skip surfing Mac news, and rely on John Gruber at Daring Fireball to catch almost anything I would be interested in.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084553\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=56ee28134dd0776825445e3551979b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://sporkmonger.com/\">Bob Aman</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084553\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-07T20:28:44\">2006-01-07T20:28:44</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Since it'll likely be quite a while before I get around to implementing it myself (and I'm going to even though I don't know how well it'll work), but I suppose I'll just drop my own idea for a next-gen aggregator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aggregator + Bayesian Filter</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each time you read a post you can mark it as interesting or not.  The filter has two buckets, appropriately, the interesting bucket and the uninteresting bucket.  Interesting posts should have certain similar features, usually in the form of buzzwords I would guess, which the filter should be reasonably good at picking out.  And the interesting vs non-interesting sorting capabilities would act as a way of making the \"foam\" float to the top.  And then one should be able to feel totally unguilty on those busy days when you hit \"Mark Uninteresting As Read.\"</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084554\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084554\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-07T20:50:40\">2006-01-07T20:50:40</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Bob: Actually, I included an aggregator with feedback buttons to train a Bayesian filter (Reverend) in Chapter 15 of Hacking RSS and Atom.
