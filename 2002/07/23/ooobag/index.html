<div class="content">I can highly recommend doing a GET on any url you get as a referrer, and throwing it away if you don&#39;t find your url somewhere in the result. In fact, I thought I stole that idea from you, but I can&#39;t check, since the link to build_referer_db_pl.txt seems to be 404ed.</div>

<div class="content">Ack.  I seem to have a lot of broken links since my site move and subsequent period of half-attention toward the site.  Should be available again now.
Though, I have yet to implement any investigative features into my referrer tracking yet.. I keep giving it lipservice but haven&#39;t gotten the round tuits to implement yet.</div>

<div class="content">I just got spammed as well from these folks, as well as a porn site, both from the same IP address. I also got a bunch of referral spam with a Google search that returns a single result: one for voodoomachines.com.
When I grepped through my referral logs looking for the IP address, I found a referrer for this page&#39;s Google cache. Since the cached page has a textad from my Textad Exchange, the cache hit showed up in my logfiles.</div>
