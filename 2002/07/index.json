    "summary": "<p>So just a couple of weeks ago, I was laughing at <b><a href=\"http://www.introducingmonday.com\">Monday:</a></b> (Their colon, not mine.  They wouldn&apos;t like my colon.)  The rebranding struck me as the last spastic hyper-hypo twitch of the 90s&apos; super-high-energy-please-God-make-them-like-me theme.  The Register, bless their souls, <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/25770.html\">don&apos;t like Monday:&apos;s either</a>.</p>\n<p>It reminds me of when one of my <a href=\"http://www.wunderman.com\">old employers</a> tried rebranding themselves from a very lawyerly name (Wunderman Cato Johnson) to a suffix: &quot;.ology&quot;  It would have been great, I heard.  We would have been studies of <i>everything</i>: marketing.ology, analytics.ology, urinal-cake.ology.  </p>\n<p>Instead, at the last minute demand of an assumedly more rational high level muckety-muck, they dropped that and picked &quot;Impiric (with a funny all-encompassing bracket)&quot; at the last minute.  They also tossed out months of work and research into positioning, presentations, and common corp speak.  This new name, however, was to imply empirical knowledge of all our subjects - i.e. experience.  A fun, hip way to spin the fact that we were all working for a practically ancient company in the computer age.  I felt really bad for the team who had to jackknife their whole process, throw out their baby, and throw together a shitty last minute collection of branding consisting of a Fatboy Slim song (&quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;), and a vaguely topical epileptic flashing stream of clip art images.</p>\n<p>But then, after about two years of this crap, they <a href=\"http://company.monster.com/impiric/\">decide they (kinda) liked their original name better</a>, and wandered back to &quot;Wunderman&quot;.  Of course, it&apos;s worth noting that the &quot;they&quot; are probably the old guard who never wanted it changed in the first place and who are happy all the morons who thought &quot;Impiric (funny all-encompassing bracket)&quot; was a good name are out on the street now.</p>\n<p>And, today, The Register tells me that <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/26464.html\">IBM has put <b>Monday:</b> out of our misery</a> by purchasing them.  <b>Monday:</b> has now returned to the more respectable &quot;PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting&quot;, soon to become just &quot;IBM&quot;.

The tool I always seem to lose and need again is something to safely allow me to resize and move hard drive partitions, whether they be Linux or Windows.  Has anyone finally made a reliable Open Source tool for this yet?</p>\n<p>Generally, I reach for <a href=\"http://www.partitionmagic.com/\">Partition Magic</a> for the job.  It's never failed for me.  But, generally, I need to buy a new copy of it every time I get around to using it again.  I mean, who really needs to repartition a drive more than a few times in a year?  (Okay, you can put your hand down.  You need to get out more.)</p>\n<p>Well, this time it looks like I need it again.  I have v6.0, which apparently makes <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> choke and drown in its own vomit.  I don't really want to buy Partition Magic again.

Not only that, but we're going to switch languages, from Perl to Java.  It's got me immensely excited, though this may be naive of me.</p>\n<p>It's been years since I was last knee deep in Java, and years that I've spent up to my ears in Perl.  I'd almost forgotten how much of Java I'd reinvented to make my ideas work in Perl.  (This may not be so much an indictment of Perl as of the way I think.)  And the last time I worked seriously in Java, there were no IDEs yet, so starting to work with <a href=\"http://www.netbeans.org\">NetBeans</a> or even Project Builder under OS X for Java work is a dream.  I love using <a href=\"http://www.netbeans.org\">NetBeans</a> in particular, occasional hiccups aside.  Besides all the obvious integration of build, test, run, debug, etc, I love being able to highlight a keyword or class name and pop up the docs in an internal HTML browser.  I love that it makes suggested changes to classes when I change an interface they implement.</p>\n<p>Yeah, none of this is news to most of the world, but I've been steadfastly sticking to shells and bare emacs or pico for my editing.  Maybe a web browser handy for docs.  I haven't worked very much with IDEs these past years, since a lot of them just got in my way.  Or at least, with hubris, I <i>thought</i> that they did.  Then again, I don't see very many equivalent tools for a language as free-form and multiple choice as Perl.</p>\n<p>And, though I miss <a href=\"http://www.cpan.org\">CPAN</a>, I'm loving resources like the <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org\">Jakarta</a> project over at Apache.  Again, not news, but new to me.  I feel like a Rip Van Winkel-Java over here, since my last real work in Java was when the API was in 1.0 days, Servlets were this neat thing for the <a href=\"http://wwws.sun.com/software/jwebserver/index.html\">Java Web Server</a> (now at the end of its life), and the dot-com boom was just starting to stretch its wings.</p>\n<p>Now, I haven't been completely oblivious to Java over this time.  I've poked at it, and played with a few things from time to time to at least stay somewhat current, and I've tried to vaguely keep up with things a bit.  I have an overall sense of what does what and where to find what, but really getting it under my fingernails again now is a different experience.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooobaf\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083428\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dal.i.am\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b581950de350ed6ad83f09ec48a6be3f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dal.i.am\">Doug</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083428\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-07-18T00:45:50\">2002-07-18T00:45:50</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Suggestion:  do it in Jython first, then profile and convert the important parts to normal Java.

It was originally developer by IBM and then released as open source. While it's written in Java, it doesn't use Swing. They use an API called SWT that they developed in house. SWT uses native libraries on the platforms it's been ported, too (right now includes Windows, Linux and a number of Unix variants, but not OSX, yet -- though OSX support is planned). I've found that the latest release is significantly zippier than any of the other java IDEs I've used and the features it supports are generally comparable or better than any of the others that I've tried. \nIt should be noted that Eclipse is also the basic technology underlying a number of major player products (IBM's WebSphere Studio and Rational's newest development tool, the name of which I can't recall at the moment).

Also, you get to influence the development of the product, which is always a good thing.  :)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083436\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://lockney.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e413973485c5536801d587baa1a55905&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://lockney.net\">Thomas Lockney</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083436\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-07-20T21:11:57\">2002-07-20T21:11:57</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">You might want to check out Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org), too. It was originally developer by IBM and then released as open source. While it's written in Java, it doesn't use Swing. They use an API called SWT that they developed in house. SWT uses native libraries on the platforms it's been ported, too (right now includes Windows, Linux and a number of Unix variants, but not OSX, yet -- though OSX support is planned). I've found that the latest release is significantly zippier than any of the other java IDEs I've used and the features it supports are generally comparable or better than any of the others that I've tried. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that Eclipse is also the basic technology underlying a number of major player products (IBM's WebSphere Studio and Rational's newest development tool, the name of which I can't recall at the moment). So you know the project isn't going anywhere anytime soon.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083437\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083437\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-07-21T02:39:37\">2002-07-21T02:39:37</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Yeah, I checked out Eclipse too, getting the vibe that it was a main competitor for NetBeans in the open source arena.

    "summary": "<p>So we&apos;ve managed to get the go ahead at work on what seems like it should be a nightmare project:  We&apos;re going to re-examine, re-design, and re-implement our in-house web app platform, the Toybox.  Not only that, but we&apos;re going to switch languages, from Perl to Java.  It&apos;s got me immensely excited, though this may be naive of me.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s been years since I was last knee deep in Java, and years that I&apos;ve spent up to my ears in Perl.  I&apos;d almost forgotten how much of Java I&apos;d reinvented to make my ideas work in Perl.  (This may not be so much an indictment of Perl as of the way I think.)  And the last time I worked seriously in Java, there were no IDEs yet, so starting to work with <a href=\"http://www.netbeans.org\">NetBeans</a> or even Project Builder under OS X for Java work is a dream.  I love using <a href=\"http://www.netbeans.org\">NetBeans</a> in particular, occasional hiccups aside.  Besides all the obvious integration of build, test, run, debug, etc, I love being able to highlight a keyword or class name and pop up the docs in an internal HTML browser.  I love that it makes suggested changes to classes when I change an interface they implement.</p>\n<p>Yeah, none of this is news to most of the world, but I&apos;ve been steadfastly sticking to shells and bare emacs or pico for my editing.  Maybe a web browser handy for docs.  I haven&apos;t worked very much with IDEs these past years, since a lot of them just got in my way.  Or at least, with hubris, I <i>thought</i> that they did.  Then again, I don&apos;t see very many equivalent tools for a language as free-form and multiple choice as Perl.</p>\n<p>And, though I miss <a href=\"http://www.cpan.org\">CPAN</a>, I&apos;m loving resources like the <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org\">Jakarta</a> project over at Apache.  Again, not news, but new to me.  I feel like a Rip Van Winkel-Java over here, since my last real work in Java was when the API was in 1.0 days, Servlets were this neat thing for the <a href=\"http://wwws.sun.com/software/jwebserver/index.html\">Java Web Server</a> (now at the end of its life), and the dot-com boom was just starting to stretch its wings.</p>\n<p>Now, I haven&apos;t been completely oblivious to Java over this time.  I&apos;ve poked at it, and played with a few things from time to time to at least stay somewhat current, and I&apos;ve tried to vaguely keep up with things a bit.  I have an overall sense of what does what and where to find what, but really getting it under my fingernails again now is a different experience.</p>\n",
