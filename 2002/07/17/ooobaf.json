IMHO, it kicks Netbeans all over the map.  Things to specifically note are the Ctrl-Space context sensitive completion of almost anything (even going so far as to suggest variable names), and the built-in refactorings (extract method being one of my favourites).&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083433&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083433&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-07-18T12:34:00&quot;&gt;2002-07-18T12:34:00&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Hmm...  The latest beta of Netbeans I&#39;m using has a ton of Ctrl-Space completion now of classes, variables, etc.  But I&#39;m happy to see Idea has a Mac OS X version, so I&#39;ll have to check it out.  I don&#39;t think Netbeans has any or much refactoring support, which is something I&#39;ve been dreaming about while working in other languages.  :)\n</code></pre><p>The only barrier might be price for me, since NetBeans is open/free and Idea is almost US$400.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083435&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://bwinton.latte.ca/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=441f5529f1db69e1a18cefb090e2690a&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://bwinton.latte.ca/&quot;&gt;Blake Winton&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083435&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-07-19T16:24:37&quot;&gt;2002-07-19T16:24:37&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;The price is definately higher than Netbeans, although significantly lower than, say, JBuilder.  And they have an Early Access Program where you can test out betas for free.  I&#39;ve been on it for a couple of years, and it&#39;s very rare that the betas are less than rock-solid.  Also, you get to influence the development of the product, which is always a good thing.  :)&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083436&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://lockney.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e413973485c5536801d587baa1a55905&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://lockney.net&quot;&gt;Thomas Lockney&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083436&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-07-20T21:11:57&quot;&gt;2002-07-20T21:11:57&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;You might want to check out Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org), too. It was originally developer by IBM and then released as open source. While it&#39;s written in Java, it doesn&#39;t use Swing. They use an API called SWT that they developed in house. SWT uses native libraries on the platforms it&#39;s been ported, too (right now includes Windows, Linux and a number of Unix variants, but not OSX, yet -- though OSX support is planned). I&#39;ve found that the latest release is significantly zippier than any of the other java IDEs I&#39;ve used and the features it supports are generally comparable or better than any of the others that I&#39;ve tried. \n</code></pre><p>It should be noted that Eclipse is also the basic technology underlying a number of major player products (IBM&#39;s WebSphere Studio and Rational&#39;s newest development tool, the name of which I can&#39;t recall at the moment). So you know the project isn&#39;t going anywhere anytime soon.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083437&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083437&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-07-21T02:39:37&quot;&gt;2002-07-21T02:39:37&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Yeah, I checked out Eclipse too, getting the vibe that it was a main competitor for NetBeans in the open source arena.  But, the lack of OS X support is pretty much a show stopper for me since my primary work machine and personal laptop are both Macs.\n</code></pre><p>This is also the reason I have yet to get into .NET and C#, but that&#39;s another story altogether.. :)</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
