<p>Whew, so where have I been this month?  I didn't realize it, but here I am in the third week of July having only made 3 posts to this site.  Well, I've been busy at work and busy at life, and without much time for the free time hacking I've wanted this site to be about.  Maybe it's Summer - I'm sure once Fall and Winter hit, I'll be back here jabbering your virtual ears off.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've got a few things I can jabber on about today, so I think I'll try to compose a few posts.</p>
