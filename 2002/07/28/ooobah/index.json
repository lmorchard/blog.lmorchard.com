Has anyone finally made a reliable Open Source tool for this yet?</p>\n<p>Generally, I reach for <a href=\"http://www.partitionmagic.com/\">Partition Magic</a> for the job.  It's never failed for me.  But, generally, I need to buy a new copy of it every time I get around to using it again.  I mean, who really needs to repartition a drive more than a few times in a year?

I have v6.0, which apparently makes <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> choke and drown in its own vomit.  I don't really want to buy Partition Magic again.  Could I just rent your copy for about $10-20 or so?  I've considered wiping <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> and re-installing Win98 just because things seemed easier then.
