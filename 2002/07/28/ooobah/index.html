<div class="content">Why not get a few extra computers?  It&#39;s easier than repartitioning all the time, and heck, Linux (and the BSDs) run fine on older hardware like 486s and low end Pentiums.  It&#39;s gotten to the point where I turn stuff like that away since I&#39;ve run out of room to put them somewhere (and my girlfriend was able to make both a Linux <em>and</em> FreeBSD box with spare parts around here).

<div class="content">Hmm.. well, I do have a handful of machines cobbled together from spare parts already.  But, for the project I want to start on now I need a part of which I have only one: An ATI All-in-Wonder Radeon card with which I record cable TV shows.<br>So, I really want to repartition and dual boot the Windows box in which it now sits.  That way, I can let the Windows side record shows when I&#39;m not tinkering and then boot into Linux to tinker until I can get it recording shows instead.
I suppose I could finally just break down and get another tuner card and hope it works with Linux.  :)</div>
