It&#39;s easier than repartitioning all the time, and heck, Linux (and the BSDs) run fine on older hardware like 486s and low end Pentiums.  It&#39;s gotten to the point where I turn stuff like that away since I&#39;ve run out of room to put them somewhere (and my girlfriend was able to make both a Linux <em>and</em> FreeBSD box with spare parts around here).\n\n-spc (Okay, so the keyboard/monitor thing may get out of hand ... )</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221086566&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221086566&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-07-29T01:49:20&quot;&gt;2002-07-29T01:49:20&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Hmm.. well, I do have a handful of machines cobbled together from spare parts already.  But, for the project I want to start on now I need a part of which I have only one: An ATI All-in-Wonder Radeon card with which I record cable TV shows.  \n</code></pre><p>So, I really want to repartition and dual boot the Windows box in which it now sits.  That way, I can let the Windows side record shows when I&#39;m not tinkering and then boot into Linux to tinker until I can get it recording shows instead.</p>\n<p>I suppose I could finally just break down and get another tuner card and hope it works with Linux.  :)</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
