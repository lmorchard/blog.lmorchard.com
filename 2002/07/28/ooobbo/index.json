I'd been thinking of these things long before the new version came out, but of course these are not unique ideas.  And how well they seem to work in iTunes now (for me at least) seems to be a good thing to point at and say \"that's what I mean\".</p>\n<p>So...  I want a count of how many times I \"play\" a channel (ie. visit a link or story from the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed.)  I want to rate my channels.  I want to make \"playlists\" (ie. categories), and \"smart playlists\" (ie. active, persistent searches).  I'd also like to synch my subscriptions and things with my website and.. hmm, well, no one's made an iPod analogue for news aggregation/reading yet.  ...<a href=\"http://www.furrygoat.com/Programming/PocketFeed/index.aspx\">or have they?</a></p>\n<p>So far, I've been sticking with <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> and still using my crappy old bloated hog of an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000187.phtml#000187\">Ampheta outline template</a>.
