<p>Yes, I'm still out here.  Busy and occupied and A.W.O.L. from most of the communities in which I was squatting this Spring, but I want to wander back in.  Maybe I can consider this a Summer break of sorts, assuming that I rejoin with feeling when the weather gets colder.  Is this the experience for anyone else around here?  That your play tech projects suffer in nicer seasons and weather, and your blogging frequency drops way down?  I think this may be my cycle.</p>
