        <meta property="og:description" content="From The Shifted Librarian:I am a media company&#39;s dream. I get the whole digital cable package, I love music and own hundreds of CDs, I frequently go to movie theaters, my study is lined with books, I like DVDs because of the extras and the quality of the picture, I attend plays, I like going to concerts, I take my media with me, and I&#39;ve always wanted my MTV.

Ditto, on everything but the plays.  (I really need to start getting out to the great performances in my area.)  Here I am looking at ways to more effectively consume just the media I like, even to the point of building my own somewhat pricey entertainment-center PC to take care of DVR and radio recording functions.  I really would pay someone to help me with this, and not screw with me after.  And I really would rather pay for TV and radio, in return for zero-advertising (including product placement).
/me jumps and waves at the satellites.  Hi up there.  I&#39;m one of your best customers.  I have money.  /me waves money.  But you&#39;re not getting it unless you do what I want.  Hmm.
Between Hollywood and my lovely government...  were this back in the days of eyepatches and parrots, they&#39;d&#39;ve had the Seven Seas drained to catch the scurvy bastards and then wondered where all the spices went at dinner time." />
