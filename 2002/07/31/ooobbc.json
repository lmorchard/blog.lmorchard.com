Well, I&apos;m at it again.  I&apos;m debating whether to post what I have so far for download yet, since I&apos;m still refining some things, but I will very soon.  I&apos;ve noticed that my first attempt gathered some fans, so you all might like what I&apos;m adding now:<ul><li>Template code seems easier on memory usage</li><li>Much, much more sparing with tables, items are displayed using only DIV&apos;s and margin widths for indentation.
