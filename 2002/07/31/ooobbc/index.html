  <meta property="og:description" content="So this past weekend, I wrote (thanks for the link, Jenny!) about continuing down the road of my experiments with news aggregation and the tweaks I&amp;apos;ve been doing to AmphetaDesk&amp;apos;s interface.  Well, I&amp;apos;m at it again.  I&amp;apos;m debating whether to post what I have so far for download yet, since I&amp;apos;m still refining some things, but I will very soon.  I&amp;apos;ve noticed that my first attempt gathered some fans, so you all might like what I&amp;apos;m adding now:Template code seems easier on memory usageMuch, much more sparing with tables, items are displayed using only DIV&amp;apos;s and margin widths for indentation.  (Seems to have saved a lot of memory.)Outliner javascript now uses the browser DOM exclusively.  (Seems to be slimmer and faster.)Per-channel metadata annotation &amp; storage - a feature already planned for Ampheta, but I was impatient and hacked a quick scheme together.  (The future AmphetaDesk implementaiton will replace this.)A new interstitial redirect page via which links are visited, to count clicksIn the per-channel metadata, I track:Unique MD5 signatures for itemsDate-first-seen for itemsNumber of times an item has been shownNumber of times an item&amp;apos;s link has been clickedItems clicked for the channel as a whole Using the newly recorded metrics on channels and items, I do a few nifty things now:Item hiding thresholds can be set on # of appearences, # of clicks, and item age.  Hidden items disappear behind an expandable outline handle.Channels and items can be sorted on # of clicks, age/last update, number of items shown.Channels with no shown items can be automatically collapsed.The gist of all this:Channels and items I like and visit regularly tend to bubble toward the topStale channels and items tend to disappear and get demand less attention during my skim-and-scan.Hidden things are out of the way, but are still available within a click or twoAfter letting this run for a few days (since all items are new at the first run), I&amp;apos;ve noticed that my news scanning has gotten much faster, even with occasional checks to be sure I&amp;apos;m not really missing anything with my thresholds. The reasons I haven&amp;apos;t immediately uploaded it for all of you: No preferences for thresholds - I&amp;apos;m editing constants at the header of my template for now; dependancy on Perl modules that don&amp;apos;t come with Ampheta - only a few, but I&amp;apos;d like to wean away from them.  Oh, and it&amp;apos;s also nasty code that I want to refactor into a bunch of subroutines, some of which will be factored out of the template and eventually replaced with calls to core AmphetaDesk code.  (Too much logic in my template.) I also want to add some &quot;karma&quot; features so that, beyond metrics of age, visits, and appearances, you can add your own manual rating and opinion to the process of sorting and show/hide.  And then there&amp;apos;s the idea of categories/playlists I want to steal from iTunes as well.  But, I might just clean up what I have by this weekend and do the early release thing so you can all cheer or jeer it at will.  I also need to drop back into the AmphetaDesk dev crowd.  I miss those guys... " />

<div class="content">Very cool stuff! Cant wait to see it. I&#39;ve been toying with the idea of &quot;favorites&quot; aswell with PocketFeed (that you mentioned in the original article). I&#39;ve found that while useful to have the content with me, without some automated intelligence to it&#39;s organization, it&#39;s a big blob of blog data.</div>

<div class="content">Oh, come on.  Post it already! :-)
I can&#39;t wait to play with in.  I&#39;m writing about AmphetaDesk for Linux Magazine, and it&#39;be nice to mention some of this stuff too.
