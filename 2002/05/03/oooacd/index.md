<p>I just grabbed <a href="http://technoerotica.net/micropoll.html">Micropoll</a> to play with from <a href="http://technoerotica.net">technoerotica.net</a></p>
<p>Let's see if this works: <!--#include virtual="/micropoll.cgi?doesitwork"--></p>
<p>Kinda fits with the other little <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI">SSI</a> widgets I've been cramming in here.  Now if only I could figure out which one is delaying the load of my main page.  Aw hell, I was going to throw it all into <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP">PHP</a> anyway.</p>
