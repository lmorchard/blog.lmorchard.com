Things were down for about a day or so, and when they came back up most everything was broken.  Seems that the sysadmin of this server added a few security improvements, such as disallowing execution of CGI scripts with dangerous permissions, which revealed my sloppy and &amp;quot;atrocious&amp;quot; (the sysadmin&amp;apos;s word) use of them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*gulp*  Bad me.  Shows that it&amp;apos;s been a long while since I had a website on a multi-user machine-- not that that&amp;apos;s a very valid excuse, but it seems less urgent to tighten up permissions when you own the machine, have a small and trusted team working on it, and it sits behind two firewalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm.  I need to get schooled in some security mojo with the quickness.  Loving the Wiki Way is one thing, but bending over like the goatse.cx guy (no, I&amp;apos;m not linking to it) is another thing altogether.&lt;br&gt;
