I was running Win2K, and Win98 before that, and I can't really see the big deal.  </p>\n<p>To be fair, I can say that I don't make fun of Windows for crashing as much anymore, although XP did just crash this week with a big fat bluescreen which took out the entire body of preferences in my user account including all my digital VCR schedules.  So that was annoying.  But rare now, anyway.  And most times it can be blamed on drivers or non-Windows software...  but gah.</p>\n<p>But as for the rest of XP... I can't stand Luna.  I turn off all the bells and whistles until it starts looking like Win98.  I reduce my Windows Explorer down to about what it looked like in '96, just a folder tree on the left and detail-view on the right.  Most of the other \"helpful\" features of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> just annoy the crap out of me.  Am I missing the benefits of XP?  It just really seems like hairs are being split and sugar's being poured in since about 1998 with Windows.  Maybe the thing is that no one's come up with any new dramatic, paradigm-shattering new things, so incremental perfection is all that's left for Windows.</p>\n<p>So here's what I'm getting to:  I'm thinking of <i>downgrading</i> my home PC to either <span style=\"background : [#FFFFCE](/tag/FFFFCE);\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/WinME?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">WinME</font></span> or Win98, and I might just stop the upgrade cycle there.  And I'll stop it for good unless I see some dire need to upgrade my Microsoft OS.  I don't seem to have any software which <i>requires</i> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a>.  Rarely, something requires Win2K or NT, but most of that stuff I replace with a Unix app.  At work I've been running Win98 in a Virtual PC instance on my OS X machine, and all my daily-use software runs fine on it.  And it really doesn't crash all that much.</p>\n<p>And this isn't just an anti-Microsoft thing.  Well, to be honest, in part it is.  And in part, I don't want my Windows habit to suck me into recurring Microsoft payments, should they perfect the licensing enforcement and stop letting me buy the thing once and make me sign up for a monthly fee.
