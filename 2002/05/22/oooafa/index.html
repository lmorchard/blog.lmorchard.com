  <meta property="og:description" content="From Chris Heschong:...While I don&amp;apos;t believe it&amp;apos;s 100% done, I&amp;apos;ve put up the code to my new pet RSS aggregator here for the moment. More to come shortly.A nice, simple RSS aggregator in PHP that seems to run nicely on my iBook.  Planning on poking at it some more, so I hope the alligator is of the non-bitey variety. As Rael&amp;apos;s little blosxom has hinted at, OS X has the potential to be the perfect end-user desktop website platform.  I even had Movable Type running on it without much fuss.  If only Apple had shipped with mod_perl and PHP modules active in Apache, it would be that much more amazing.  I suppose that&amp;apos;s easy enough to rectify.   Makes me feel strange running Radio UserLand on my OS X iBook, besides the CPU consumption.  So much duplication of what&amp;apos;s already there.  Of course, there are the plusses of cross-platform goodness, integrated environment goodness, and things that just feel generally slick about it.  Eh, but I don&amp;apos;t have to feel strange about that anymore, since I moved Radio to my Windows box.  Now Radio fights with my PVR program for CPU.  Grr. I&amp;apos;ve been thinking about this lately, too: Cocoa GUI talking via XML-RPC or SOAP to a web app locally hosted.  It&amp;apos;s been mused about before, though I forget where.  I seem to remember that Dave had mentioned a company working on something like this.  Could be interesting. Seems to me that the potential and power of OS X for these sorts of apps (ie. desktop websites, networked info filters, etc...) has barely been tapped yet. Unix on the desktop.  Really.  Who woulda thunk it? " />
