But I've also been re-reading David Brin's <i>Earth</i>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/VernorVinge\">VernorVinge</a>'s <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>, and have a few musings about them.  Also have been doing some intermittent Lisp and Python hacking.  Oh, and I also will be trying a bit of Perl/Cocoa hacking for <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> in the very, very near future.
