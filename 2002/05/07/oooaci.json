The LiveJournal is also a way to say something such that my friends who don&#39;t use Radio see it. (I don&#39;t think I have any friends who use any other RSS aggregator, hmm.)\n\nOf course, I could also count my Advogato diary, but it just has select items from my Radio blog since I hooked Radio up with an &quot;Advogato&quot; category. (Exploding beakers, there.)\n\nSince LiveJournal is such a nice gated community, I&#39;d wager having a blog and a LiveJournal is more common than having two blogs of one&#39;s own.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085547&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.unpretty.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8cc55b7fff188c267ceeed9cee14c256&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.unpretty.org&quot;&gt;patrick&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085547&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-05-09T23:00:14&quot;&gt;2002-05-09T23:00:14&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;I have my very plain and simple weblog using Greymatter&#39;s original open source CGI script as well as my LiveJournal.
