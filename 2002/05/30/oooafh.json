I don&#39;t know if it messes with any radio files, but i don&#39;t think it will hurt it. I think you could use the windows scheudler to start it, i don&#39;t have XP but i prefer to use WinCron on my 2K boxes. So you could have WinCron schedule to start and stop it at given times.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083169&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b7cd0c63edfc249685399a482df345d2&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;pn&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083169&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-05-30T21:19:10&quot;&gt;2002-05-30T21:19:10&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;you can use perl on win32 to kill arbitrary processes.  i use a scheduled process using the windows scheduler to launch a perl program that kills certain processes.\n</code></pre><p><a href=\"http://www.xav.com/perl/site/lib/Win32/Process.html\">http://www.xav.com/perl/site/lib/Win32/Process.html</a></div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083173&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ebb1f73c56f5710b685d2c619aa67a4d&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Matthew Ernest&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083173&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-05-30T22:42:52&quot;&gt;2002-05-30T22:42:52&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&quot;fileMenu.quit()&quot; is the bit of UserTalk that, as one might guess, closes Radio as if you has selected Quit from the File menu.\n</code></pre><p>I called that as a macro from a file named &quot;die.txt&quot; that I put under &quot;c:\\program files\\Radio Userland\\www\\system&quot;. If I then hit the url &quot;<a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:5335/system/die&quot;\">http://127.0.0.1:5335/system/die&quot;</a>, Radio will close itself. </p>\n<p>Be sure not to put it in a directory that gets rendered and upstreamed (like I had at first), or else when Radio looks at it to try to render the file the app will close. I suppose that someone who knows what the hell XML-RPC is could put that over in the Web Services folder so that you could make a call to it in a saner fashion.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083180&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.pycs.net/devlog/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=83fb71394815ceacae87e153d1638531&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.pycs.net/devlog/&quot;&gt;Phil&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083180&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-06-05T21:24:57&quot;&gt;2002-06-05T21:24:57&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;I wonder if pushing Radio&#39;s priority down a bit would help.
