  <meta property="og:description" content="Does anyone out there know of a workable, preferably free app for WinXP with which I can launch and quit a program on a scheduled basis?  Starting to work my mad Google skillz to find this, but having a hard time coming up with search terms that give me good results.  See, Radio UserLand demands too much CPU from any of the machines I currently own.  The desktop where I want to park it also serves as my PVR, and when it starts up to record a show, Radio keeps stealing CPU from the video encoding, and I end up with choppy and sometimes dead video.  I even tried screwing with priorities, and that only seems to help moderately. So, I want to start up Radio, let it churn free.  Then just before a show comes on, I want to quit Radio.  I was doing this manually via a VNC connection from work, but that&amp;apos;s just stupid.  The other alternatives I&amp;apos;ve tried are running it under Wine on my Debian Linux box, which doesn&amp;apos;t quite seem to work happily, or to run Radio again on my OS X iBook, which seems to crush the poor thing. I suppose my desktop PC is due for an upgrade, containing only a 600MHz Athlon (though 512MB of RAM), but I&amp;apos;ve been waiting on that.  Funny, the last time I upgraded, it was to run a few more games.  This time, its to make Radio happier.  :) (Addendum: Hey, wait, Radio&amp;apos;s an intelligent, reasonable platform...  I wonder if I couldn&amp;apos;t just get it to shut itself down at a given time, and then have Windows launch it again.  I think the shutdown is the main issue, since Windows seems to come with a scheduler already for launching programs.) " />

<div class="content">You can use PSkill from Sysinternals: <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pskill.shtml">http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pskill.shtml</a> , Its free and it works like the unix kill, just pskill radio.exe and your done. I don&#39;t know if it messes with any radio files, but i don&#39;t think it will hurt it. I think you could use the windows scheudler to start it, i don&#39;t have XP but i prefer to use WinCron on my 2K boxes. So you could have WinCron schedule to start and stop it at given times.</div>

<div class="content">you can use perl on win32 to kill arbitrary processes.  i use a scheduled process using the windows scheduler to launch a perl program that kills certain processes.

<div class="content">&quot;fileMenu.quit()&quot; is the bit of UserTalk that, as one might guess, closes Radio as if you has selected Quit from the File menu.
I called that as a macro from a file named &quot;die.txt&quot; that I put under &quot;c:\program files\Radio Userland\www\system&quot;. If I then hit the url &quot;<a href="http://127.0.0.1:5335/system/die&quot;">http://127.0.0.1:5335/system/die&quot;</a>, Radio will close itself. 
Be sure not to put it in a directory that gets rendered and upstreamed (like I had at first), or else when Radio looks at it to try to render the file the app will close. I suppose that someone who knows what the hell XML-RPC is could put that over in the Web Services folder so that you could make a call to it in a saner fashion.</div>

<div class="content">I wonder if pushing Radio&#39;s priority down a bit would help.  I&#39;m coding a DirectX app at the moment that is really jittery when Radio is running at normal priority, but taking Radio down to &#39;BelowNormal&#39; makes it run fine.
&#39;course, it won&#39;t do much for the responsiveness of Radio&#39;s web server :)</div>
