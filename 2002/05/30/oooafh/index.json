Starting to work my mad Google skillz to find this, but having a hard time coming up with search terms that give me good results.  See, Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> demands too much CPU from any of the machines I currently own.  The desktop where I want to park it also serves as my PVR, and when it starts up to record a show, Radio keeps stealing CPU from the video encoding, and I end up with choppy and sometimes dead video.  I even tried screwing with priorities, and that only seems to help moderately.</p>\n<p>So, I want to start up Radio, let it churn free.  Then just before a show comes on, I want to quit Radio.  I was doing this manually via a VNC connection from work, but that's just stupid.  The other alternatives I've tried are running it under Wine on my Debian Linux box, which doesn't <i>quite</i> seem to work happily, or to run Radio again on my OS X iBook, which seems to crush the poor thing.</p>\n<p>I suppose my desktop PC is due for an upgrade, containing only a 600MHz Athlon (though 512MB of RAM), but I've been waiting on that.  Funny, the last time I upgraded, it was to run a few more games.  This time, its to make Radio happier.  :)</p>\n<p>(<i>Addendum</i>: Hey, wait, Radio's an intelligent, reasonable platform...  I wonder if I couldn't just get it to shut <i>itself</i> down at a given time, and then have Windows launch it again.  I think the shutdown is the main issue, since Windows seems to come with a scheduler already for launching programs.)</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=oooafh\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083168\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.10500bc.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2a158ec6895b9af4ce255febfe69ffee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.10500bc.org\">Josh Cooper</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083168\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-05-30T21:17:08\">2002-05-30T21:17:08</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">You can use PSkill from Sysinternals: http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pskill.shtml , Its free and it works like the unix kill, just pskill radio.exe and your done.
