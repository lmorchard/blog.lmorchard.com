        <meta property="og:description" content="Ouch.  Remember that no matter how expert you may be on some things, if you start from false premises, you&#39;re doomed from the start.  Just caught this article over on Linux Journal entitled &quot;Obsolete Microkernel Dooms Mac OS X to Lag Linux in Performance&quot;.  
In the article, the author expounds at length on the nature of microkernels and their performance hits, and makes a very clear and unabashed claim that &quot;the microkernel project has failed&quot;.  Well, I don&#39;t know a great deal about microkernels, other than vague skimmings here and there.  But what I do know, is that you don&#39;t say &quot;Obsolete Microkernel Dooms Mac OS X to Lag Linux in Performance&quot; and then let slip something like &quot;I&#39;m not sure how Darwin&#39;s drivers work...&quot;, as well as never providing any metrics, analysis, code, or proof to back up the headline&#39;s claim other than to beat up a theoretical microkernel strawman.
The interesting thing to me though, is that rather than read the article first, I read the comments.  And the thing I saw was an enormous number of comments all pointing to Apple&#39;s Mach Overview, so almost instantly I was informed about the credibility of the article itself.  When you have a hundred geeks telling you to RTFM after a lenghty article, it says something.
In particular, the Apple document says:Mach 3.0 was originally conceived as a simple, extensible, communications microkernel. It is capable of running as a standalone kernel, with other traditional operating-system services such as I/O, file systems, and networking stacks running as user-mode servers.
However, in Mac OS X, Mach is linked with other kernel components into a single kernel address space. This is primarily for performance; it is much faster to make a direct call between linked components than it is to send messages or do RPCs between separate tasks. This modular structure results in a more robust and extensible system than a monolithic kernel would allow, without the performance penalty of a pure microkernel.

So, from what I gathered, this little blurb counters much of what the author actually claimed would slow OS X down.  I may be mistaken on this, but it seems to be what everyone else was saying as well.
So, whereas in another circumstance, this article might&#39;ve been taken as Linuxite Anti-Mac-OS-X FUD (what&#39;s the world coming to? :) ), in this circumstance the article is just taken as an obvious demonstration of a lack of research.  Other than a bit of a sensation when I saw the headline in my aggregator, the steam got let out of it almost instantly.
