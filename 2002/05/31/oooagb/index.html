  <meta property="og:description" content="Sam Ruby wants to go Beyond Backlinks, and I&amp;apos;m right there with him.  He writes about the various means we&amp;apos;ve tried so far to discover connections (ie. referrers and linksback and Jon&amp;apos;s analysis of blogroll connections), and muses further.  I love the idea of further automation in surprisingly discovering connections and automatically exploring other feeds, based on discovered connections. A plug for LiveJournal:  I love their user info pages.  I&amp;apos;ve been idly musing for a while now on how one might decentralize this and extend it web-wide throughout blogspace.  I love seeing the friends and friends-of lists, analogous to blogrolls and inverse-blogrolls.  And, I really love the interests lists, since just by entering a catalog of phrases, you can see unexpected links to other people interested in the same things.  Not quite correlations or deep analysis, but it helps.   But it&amp;apos;s the decentralization that rubs.  I could probably start a service that provides user info page workalikes to bloggers.  I could offer it for free, but then I might get popular and have to pay more for my altruism than I can afford.  (Sometimes I worry about BlogRolling.com.)  I could offer it for a small fee, but then the service would probably never see widespread use.  Were it decentrallized, I could write some software, and others could pay their own way in server resources.  More to think about this. Also, if I can get time this weekend, there are a lot of parts of David Brin&amp;apos;s novel, Earth, that I&amp;apos;d like to babble about.  Reading it right now, and seeing that he wrote it just around 1990, I&amp;apos;m amazed at how fresh it still is.  Sci-fi and speculative fiction rarely stand the test of years and unexpected advances, but a lot of the stuff in this book - particularly about the way in which people deal with information, how they discuss and create and manage it - seems to be happening right now. Anyway, more soon. " />

<div class="content">Take a peek at the FOAF vocabulary.  This works much like RSS in that you &quot;just put the file at a URL&quot; and then everybody else needs to just link to it to get the info.  Then you can use aggregators, or just spiders, to do &quot;here&#39;s other people who...&quot;.
They have properties for mail address, homepage, image, nicks, work info, knows (people), interests, projects, etc. and it&#39;s wide open for extension.</div>

<div class="content">Actually, I&#39;ve been peeking at FOAF off and on for awhile yet, since it looks like they want to do a lot of what I want to do... but I haven&#39;t seen it go very far yet.  I should peek again.  I think if somehow it managed to take off in blogspace, it&#39;d be wild.  Or, it could fall flat and no one really gets interested.  Hmm, need to look at it again though, all the same.</div>

<div class="content">As is rather typical, the RDF folks actually have no tools for it (specifically), and their libraries are on the complex end of the scale (&quot;all of RDF goodness&quot;).  FOAF-for-the-rest-of-us needs someone interested in writing the little tools necessary to make it work easily, like readers, to-html, viewers, etc.  I&#39;ll check to see if my Orchard (no relation :-) tool will read it, since it&#39;s a generic RDF-lite reader that I used for RSS 1.0.</div>

<div class="content">Oops, no, Orchard&#39;s RDF support isn&#39;t generic.  The gist of it is there, it&#39;s missing the parser tho.</div>

<div class="content">I miss that feature about LiveJournal. Last month I completed my move to Movable Type from LiveJournal. I really get tired of clicking around to see who all has updated their weblogs.. then go log in to LiveJournal to read my old friends page (there a lot of entries that are marked as friends-only). 
A big weblog directory would be very nice. Something for people to register with and connect with other people instead of just randomly clicking around (like how I found you!). You could then find people based on their interest of coffee, Radiohead, and Jabber or maybe where they live. If you liked the person&#39;s content, you&#39;d just go back to their profile and click &quot;add to my friends page&quot; .. then the database would do all the same things that LiveJournal does. hmmm... i like this idea.....</div>
