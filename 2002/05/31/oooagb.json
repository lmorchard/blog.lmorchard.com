This works much like RSS in that you &quot;just put the file at a URL&quot; and then everybody else needs to just link to it to get the info.  Then you can use aggregators, or just spiders, to do &quot;here&#39;s other people who...&quot;.\n</code></pre><p>They have properties for mail address, homepage, image, nicks, work info, knows (people), interests, projects, etc. and it&#39;s wide open for extension.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085155&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085155&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-05-31T16:41:45&quot;&gt;2002-05-31T16:41:45&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Actually, I&#39;ve been peeking at FOAF off and on for awhile yet, since it looks like they want to do a lot of what I want to do... but I haven&#39;t seen it go very far yet.  I should peek again.  I think if somehow it managed to take off in blogspace, it&#39;d be wild.  Or, it could fall flat and no one really gets interested.  Hmm, need to look at it again though, all the same.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085156&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=743ec87899694a206abd6bdca8fed5fc&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ken MacLeod&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085156&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-05-31T17:32:10&quot;&gt;2002-05-31T17:32:10&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;As is rather typical, the RDF folks actually have no tools for it (specifically), and their libraries are on the complex end of the scale (&quot;all of RDF goodness&quot;).  FOAF-for-the-rest-of-us needs someone interested in writing the little tools necessary to make it work easily, like readers, to-html, viewers, etc.  I&#39;ll check to see if my Orchard (no relation :-) tool will read it, since it&#39;s a generic RDF-lite reader that I used for RSS 1.0.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085157&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=743ec87899694a206abd6bdca8fed5fc&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ken MacLeod&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085157&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-05-31T17:55:03&quot;&gt;2002-05-31T17:55:03&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Oops, no, Orchard&#39;s RDF support isn&#39;t generic.

Last month I completed my move to Movable Type from LiveJournal. I really get tired of clicking around to see who all has updated their weblogs.. then go log in to LiveJournal to read my old friends page (there a lot of entries that are marked as friends-only). \n</code></pre><p>A big weblog directory would be very nice. Something for people to register with and connect with other people instead of just randomly clicking around (like how I found you!). You could then find people based on their interest of coffee, Radiohead, and Jabber or maybe where they live. If you liked the person&#39;s content, you&#39;d just go back to their profile and click &quot;add to my friends page&quot; .. then the database would do all the same things that LiveJournal does. hmmm... i like this idea.....</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
