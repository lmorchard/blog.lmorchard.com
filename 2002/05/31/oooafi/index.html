        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ouch.  Remember that no matter how expert you may be on some things, if you start from false premises, you&#39;re doomed from the start.  Just caught this article over on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxjournal.com&quot;&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/a&gt; entitled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6105&quot;&gt;Obsolete Microkernel Dooms Mac OS X to Lag Linux in Performance&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the article, the author expounds at length on the nature of microkernels and their performance hits, and makes a very clear and unabashed claim that &quot;the microkernel project has failed&quot;.  Well, I don&#39;t know a great deal about microkernels, other than vague skimmings here and there.  But what I do know, is that you don&#39;t say &quot;Obsolete Microkernel Dooms Mac OS X to Lag Linux in Performance&quot; and then let slip something like &quot;I&#39;m not sure how Darwin&#39;s drivers work...&quot;, as well as never providing any metrics, analysis, code, or proof to back up the headline&#39;s claim other than to beat up a theoretical microkernel strawman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing to me though, is that rather than read the article first, I read the comments.  And the thing I saw was an enormous number of comments all pointing to Apple&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Darwin/General/KernelProgramming/Mach/Mach_Overview.html&quot;&gt;Mach Overview&lt;/a&gt;, so almost instantly I was informed about the credibility of the article itself.  When you have a hundred geeks telling you to RTFM after a lenghty article, it says something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the Apple document says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mach 3.0 was originally conceived as a simple, extensible, communications microkernel. It is capable of running as a standalone kernel, with other traditional operating-system services such as I/O, file systems, and networking stacks running as user-mode servers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;However, in Mac OS X, Mach is linked with other kernel components into a single kernel address space. This is primarily for performance; it is much faster to make a direct call between linked components than it is to send messages or do RPCs between separate tasks. This modular structure results in a more robust and extensible system than a monolithic kernel would allow, without the performance penalty of a pure microkernel.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;So, from what I gathered, this little blurb counters much of what the author actually claimed would slow OS X down.  I may be mistaken on this, but it seems to be what everyone else was saying as well.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, whereas in another circumstance, this article might&#39;ve been taken as Linuxite Anti-Mac-OS-X &lt;a href=&quot;http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/f/FUD.html&quot;&gt;FUD&lt;/a&gt; (what&#39;s the world coming to? :) ), in this circumstance the article is just taken as an obvious demonstration of a lack of research.  Other than a bit of a sensation when I saw the headline in my aggregator, the steam got let out of it almost instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lather, rinse, repeat, and apply to all other utterances and publications.&lt;/p&gt;
