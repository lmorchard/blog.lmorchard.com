    "summary": "<p>Sam Ruby wants to go <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/05/31/beyondBacklinks.html\">Beyond Backlinks</a>, and I'm right there with him.  He writes about the various means we've tried so far to discover connections (ie. referrers and linksback and <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100887/2002/05/28.html#a268\">Jon's analysis</a> of blogroll connections), and muses further.  I love the idea of further automation in surprisingly discovering connections and automatically exploring other feeds, based on discovered connections.</p>\n<p>A plug for <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com\">LiveJournal</a>:  I love their <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=deus_x\">user info pages</a>.  I've been idly musing for a while now on how one might decentralize this and extend it web-wide throughout blogspace.  I love seeing the <b>friends</b> and <b>friends-of</b> lists, analogous to blogrolls and inverse-blogrolls.  And, I really love the <b>interests</b> lists, since just by entering a catalog of phrases, you can see unexpected links to other people interested in the same things.  Not quite correlations or deep analysis, but it helps.  </p>\n<p>But it's the decentralization that rubs.  I could probably start a service that provides user info page workalikes to bloggers.  I could offer it for free, but then I might get popular and have to pay more for my altruism than I can afford.  (Sometimes I worry about <a href=\"http://www.blogrolling.com\">BlogRolling.com</a>.)  I could offer it for a small fee, but then the service would probably never see widespread use.  Were it decentrallized, I could write some software, and others could pay their own way in server resources.  More to think about this.</p>\n<p>Also, if I can get time this weekend, there are a lot of parts of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055329024X/0xdecafbad-20\">David Brin's novel, Earth,</a> that I'd like to babble about.  Reading it right now, and seeing that he wrote it just around 1990, I'm amazed at how fresh it still is.  Sci-fi and speculative fiction rarely stand the test of years and unexpected advances, but a lot of the stuff in this book - particularly about the way in which people deal with information, how they discuss and create and manage it - seems to be happening <i>right now</i>.</p>\n<p>Anyway, more soon.</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>Ouch.  Remember that no matter how expert you may be on some things, if you start from false premises, you're doomed from the start.  Just caught this article over on <a href=\"http://www.linuxjournal.com\">Linux Journal</a> entitled \"<a href=\"http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6105\">Obsolete Microkernel Dooms Mac OS X to Lag Linux in Performance</a>\".  </p>\n<p>In the article, the author expounds at length on the nature of microkernels and their performance hits, and makes a very clear and unabashed claim that \"the microkernel project has failed\".  Well, I don't know a great deal about microkernels, other than vague skimmings here and there.  But what I do know, is that you don't say \"Obsolete Microkernel Dooms Mac OS X to Lag Linux in Performance\" and then let slip something like \"I'm not sure how Darwin's drivers work...\", as well as never providing any metrics, analysis, code, or proof to back up the headline's claim other than to beat up a theoretical microkernel strawman.</p>\n<p>The interesting thing to me though, is that rather than read the article first, I read the comments.  And the thing I saw was an enormous number of comments all pointing to Apple's <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Darwin/General/KernelProgramming/Mach/Mach_Overview.html\">Mach Overview</a>, so almost instantly I was informed about the credibility of the article itself.  When you have a hundred geeks telling you to RTFM after a lenghty article, it says something.</p>\n<p>In particular, the Apple document says:</p><blockquote><i>Mach 3.0 was originally conceived as a simple, extensible, communications microkernel. It is capable of running as a standalone kernel, with other traditional operating-system services such as I/O, file systems, and networking stacks running as user-mode servers.<p></p>\n</i><p><i>However, in Mac OS X, Mach is linked with other kernel components into a single kernel address space. This is primarily for performance; it is much faster to make a direct call between linked components than it is to send messages or do RPCs between separate tasks. This modular structure results in a more robust and extensible system than a monolithic kernel would allow, without the performance penalty of a pure microkernel.</i></p></blockquote>So, from what I gathered, this little blurb counters much of what the author actually claimed would slow OS X down.  I may be mistaken on this, but it seems to be what everyone else was saying as well.<p></p>\n<p>So, whereas in another circumstance, this article might've been taken as Linuxite Anti-Mac-OS-X <a href=\"http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/f/FUD.html\">FUD</a> (what's the world coming to? :) ), in this circumstance the article is just taken as an obvious demonstration of a lack of research.  Other than a bit of a sensation when I saw the headline in my aggregator, the steam got let out of it almost instantly.</p>\n<p>Lather, rinse, repeat, and apply to all other utterances and publications.</p>\n",

Starting to work my mad Google skillz to find this, but having a hard time coming up with search terms that give me good results.  See, Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> demands too much CPU from any of the machines I currently own.  The desktop where I want to park it also serves as my PVR, and when it starts up to record a show, Radio keeps stealing CPU from the video encoding, and I end up with choppy and sometimes dead video.  I even tried screwing with priorities, and that only seems to help moderately.</p>\n<p>So, I want to start up Radio, let it churn free.  Then just before a show comes on, I want to quit Radio.  I was doing this manually via a VNC connection from work, but that's just stupid.  The other alternatives I've tried are running it under Wine on my Debian Linux box, which doesn't <i>quite</i> seem to work happily, or to run Radio again on my OS X iBook, which seems to crush the poor thing.</p>\n<p>I suppose my desktop PC is due for an upgrade, containing only a 600MHz Athlon (though 512MB of RAM), but I've been waiting on that.  Funny, the last time I upgraded, it was to run a few more games.  This time, its to make Radio happier.  :)</p>\n<p>(<i>Addendum</i>: Hey, wait, Radio's an intelligent, reasonable platform...  I wonder if I couldn't just get it to shut <i>itself</i> down at a given time, and then have Windows launch it again.  I think the shutdown is the main issue, since Windows seems to come with a scheduler already for launching programs.)</p>\n",

This snags my eye for two reasons: 1) Orbitz is a client of my employer - we do a ton of web promotions for them; and 2) LISP is one of those things I keep meaning to get back into, kinda like I keep meaning to read things from that gigantic Shakespeare collection I asked for and recieved for Christmas from me mum.</p>\n<p>The quote that Ronald pulls out from the article is:</p><blockquote><i>The high-level algorithms are almost entirely in Lisp, one of the oldest programming languages. You're excused for chuckling, or saying \"Why Lisp?\" Although the language can be inefficient if used without extreme caution, it has a reputation for compactness. One line of Lisp can replace 20 lines of C. ITA's programmers, who learned the language inside and out while at MIT, note that LISP is highly effective if you ditch the prefabricated data structures. \"We're something of a poster child for LISP these days,\" says Wertheimer. \"Lisp vendors love us.\"</i></blockquote>Funny, if you did an s/Lisp/Perl/g and an s/LISP/Perl/g on that text, you'd almost have a quote from me.  I've also heard Perl often compared to LISP, amongst the upper ranks of Perl wizards.  Oldest language-- hmm, no, but it's been around the block.  Inefficient without caution-- check, hand-holding is at a minimum.  Compactness-- check, many bash it for obfucation facilitation.  Effective after ditching prefab structs-- check, if you enjoy slinging hashes all over, like I have until recently.  And so far, we're a poster child for Perl here.<p></p>\n<p>What is it that I have in Perl?  Well, I've named it the Toybox.  It's a web application platform.  We do everything with it.  Reusable software components composed into applications with a web-based construction tool.  The components contain machine and human readable descriptions on properties and methods, to enable inspection by tool and documentation generation.  Also, the components and the framework are designed to provide predefined collaboration patterns so that one component can supplement or modify the behavior of another without that other component needing to be modified or altered.  I've also just recently added a persistent object layer for all those pesky little parameterizing trinkets we started needed to throw around.  (I really wish I could Open Source this thing. :) )</p>\n<p>So there's a continual grumble here to switch to Java, sometimes from me, and sometimes from another developer or two.  In some ways, a switch and reimplmentation is a no-brainer, considering tool support and labor pool.  But, is this overhyped?  Wherever I've gone, I've just picked up whatever was used there.  My basic computer science background lets me switch technologies pretty easily.  Is this rare?</p>\n<p>But as for the languages themselves... From the trenches, doing object-oriented stuff in perl is painful and dirty.  In a lot of other ways, it feels nice because you can jump out of the OO mindset and do some naughty things when you think you need to.  And if you're careful.  But when you do, you don't get any help from the language, which I think is one of the major selling points of Java.</p>\n<p>And then occasionally, a client demands to know the specifics of our platform.  Such as, what vendor's app server are we using?  What database server?  And when we say Perl and a platform almost completely developed in-house, noses crinkle and doubts arise.  But they rarely have a complaint about the end result and the speed at which we execute it.</p>\n<p>I guess what I'm getting at is this:  Having a hard time untangling politics, job market, and the right tool choice.  LISP seems to have done alright by Orbitz, and Perl's done alright by us.  So far, that is.  I always vaguely worry about the \"non-standard technology\" I use here, though.  Is that such a valid worry, or am I just swallowing vendors' marketing pills like our clients?  Because the \"standard\" just happens to be the buzzwordy things that a number of companies sunk money into and work hard to justify.</p>\n<p>But, hell, someone had to have started creating something alien and new to come up with what's \"standard\" today.  I seem to see stories from time to time about companies whose \"secret weapon\" is just such a \"non-standard technology\".  They avoid many of the pitfalls that the herd faces by taking their own path, but trade them for new ones.  There's risk in that, but then again there's risk in everything with a potential for gain.</p>\n<p>Then again, there's the argument against wheel reinvention.  I seem to like reinventing wheels sometimes for the hell of it, simply because I want to know how wheels work.  Sometimes I even feel arrogant enough to assert that I can make a better wheel.

Seems like the majority of the authors on my news aggregator scan were all blogging from the <a href=\"http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etcon2002/\">O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference</a> this week.  For some reason, I hadn't even heard of it until last week.  This mystifies me.  I can't believe I hadn't checked this conference out long ago and found a way, by hook or by crook, to get my butt over there.  Seems like they covered an alarming number of the topics about which I'm fascinated.  But, beyond the content of the conference itself, I would have loved to witness firsthand the phenomena of an audience full of bloggers tick-tacking away in realtime.  And I <b>so</b> would have been running <a href=\"http://www.etherpeg.org/\">EtherPEG</a> on my iBook <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/1414.html\">like Rob Flickenger was</a>.</p>\n<p>It's been forever since I managed to get out to a technical conference.  Not that I managed to globe-trot with any great frequency before the Internet bubble burst, when money was flush and expense reports were easy, but I was starting to feel like I was making inroads into a community.  Now I feel cloistered in over here at my company and I don't know if my employer necessarily sees a value in me attending things like this.  Marketing and sales make heroic efforts to streak around from coast to coast-- man, I don't envy them-- but I always stay here.  Sometimes I wonder if it's because they're afraid I might let some of the mojo slip.  But that's being pretty presumptious of the quality of the mojo I make here.  :)  (For what it's worth, there are nervous chuckles when I talk about Open Sourcing bits of my work.)</p>\n<p>This is starting to sound like spoiled geek whining.  It isn't that I want the company sugar-daddy to fly me to Milan every month-- I just start feeling a bit isolated and claustrophobic working with the same few dozen people, only a tiny handful of whom are actually technically-minded, week in and week out.  So it's nice to feel a part of a wider community of like- or at least relatedly-minded people who are passionate about this stuff.  </p>\n<p>I'm an obsessive nerd.  This is what I tell people who ask me, \"Don't you get tired doing this all the time,\" or, \"Why do you have more than one computer?\"  When talking to myself (as I often do) or to other geeks, I call it passion.  I appreciate passion for its own sake, and I love talking to other impassioned people.</p>\n<p>I always try to be tenative about my pretensions, but here goes another one:  All the way back to when people were dingy, loin-cloth-clothed stereotypical and mythical cavemen sitting around comfy fires, there was always some oddball or scrawny thing who insisted on playing around at the edge of the firelight and further.  Or banging around with an odd pair of rocks, making sharp things.  </p>\n<p>I want to hang out more with my fellow rock bangers.</p>\n",

I'd been planning to get around to making one inspired from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000141.phtml\">our blogchat</a>, but he's got it first.  Cool.  :)  Looks like <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100887/2002/05/12.html#a234\">Jon's picked up on it, too</a>.  \n</p>\n<br><br>\n<p>\nJon muses:</p><blockquote><i>I haven't yet looked into what it will take to make the reporting item- rather than page-specific. It's doable, I'm sure. Thanks, Stephen!

Permalinks are anchors within those pages.  However, I haven't seen browsers reporting the post-anchor-hash info for referrals.  At first though, one would need to have Radio spew blog entries into individual files to make this JS linkback scheme work at per-entry granularity.  Otherwise, I'd <i>love</i> to see this work for Radio.  I'd also love to see it woven with <a href=\"http://rcs.userland.com/\">community server</a> services.\n</p>\n<br><br>\n<p>\nA few brief musings on the <a href=\"http://www.downes.ca/referrers.txt\">referrers script itself</a>:\n</p>\n<br><br>\n<ul>\n<br><br>\n<li>\nHmm, haven't seen <a href=\"http://cgi-lib.berkeley.edu/\">cgi-lib.pl</a> used since my Perl 4 and pre-CGI.pm days.

It's a start on what I was <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000142.phtml\">musing about over here</a>.\n</li>\n<br><br>\n<li>\nI want to steal this, maybe transliterate it into <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> (since my webhost frowns on my CGIs now), and hook it up to a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MySQL\">MySQL</a> database.  Stephen doesn't want to host the world's referers, but I wonder how mad my host will get if I open mine up.  :)  Would make for some neat data to draw maps with, but probably shouldn't do things to make myself an even more annoying band practicing neighbor.\n</li>\n<br><br>\n</ul>\n",

Basically, I want some software to give every person here an internal blog or journal.  Immediately, I want this to capture internal narrative.  A future subversive idea I have for it is to eventually pipe some of these internal entries out to our public company website.  (Yes, I'm reading The Cluetrain Manifesto again.)\n</p>\n<p>\nI've gotten almost everyone here on the wiki bandwagon, and we're using it regularly as a knowledge capture and collaboration tool.  So, they're used to me throwing odd new tech at them.  Unfortunately, the wiki isn't precisely suitable to what I want for the k-logs.  These are my requirements so far:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Must be dead simple to use in all aspects, so that it sits far below the laziness threshold it takes to record an idea or narrative as it occurs.</li>\n<li>Rich set of categories and metadata by which an entry can be tagged.  (ie. On what project were you working?  On what project task?  With what products?  How much time did you spend?)</li>\n<li>Arbitrary views on weblog entries, querying on category and metadata, maybe even on full-text search.  I want to be able to weave together, on the fly, the narrative of any person, project, product, or any other topic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nI'm looking, hopefully, for something free.  At the moment, I'd have a hard time campaigning for the purchase of a fleet of Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> subscriptions for all of us, unfortunately.  Someday, perhaps.  (I could just imagine the insane possibilities of a Radio on every employee's desktop.)  But, is there anything out there like this now?  It's simple enough that I could probably roll my own in a weekend or less, but it'd be nice to jump on the bandwagon of an established k-log tool.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlso really looking at more ways to lower the laziness threshold.  We just converted the entire company over to using Jabber as our official instant messaging platform, so I thought it'd be pretty keen to have the k-log system establish a presence to receive IM'ed journal entries.  Along the lines of the wiki adoption, I'd probably have to get everyone to embed a certain style of keywords or some other convention to get the k-log system to pick up categories.\n</p>\n<p>\nOr, to make it even lazier, could I get the k-log system to automatically discover categories by the mention of keywords?  Hmm, this could be fun.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnyone out there working at a k-logged company?\n</p>\n",

So, I get suspended, to be later restored with a lecture on the nature of CGI.  My scripts were called \"fucking insane\" by the admin who finally gave me back my keys.  And, on top of it, I got a lesson in UNIX file permissions while he was at it.</p>\n<p>Well, the thing is... of course I understand CGI, and the expense of launching external processes.  And I gathered that the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI\">SSI</a>-and-CGI combination was braindead at the end of the day.  And I understand the necessity for restrictive file permissions.  But still, even with all that, I let things get sloppy.  </p>\n<p>This is vaguely embarassing.</p>\n<p>So, today I hastily reimplemented everything using that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI\">SSI</a>-and-CGI scheme in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a>.  I'd started leisurely on the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> replacements this weekend, but this was a kick in the ass to finish it.  Almost every *.shtml page is a *.phtml page now.  I rewrote my referral link listing code, as well as my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed display code, in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> functions.  There are still some places where things are broken (most notably the referrals in the wiki), but I'll get around to fixing them.  Not too bad for starting from zero <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> exposure (somehow) until this weekend.</p>\n<p>I'd like to think that this won't happen again, but I suspect it might.</p>\n<p>The problem is that this site is my mad science laboratory.  I mix things together, set things on fire, and occasionally have something explode.  I get enthusiastic about seeing what I can do, without a whole lot of regard toward safety or keeping the wires out of sight.  I figure that I'll tighten up the bolts and polish up the shells of the interesting experiments, and just archive the ones that turn out boring.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, this leads to me playing loose with security and resource conservation.  I really need to watch this more, since the sysadmin reminded me, \"Remember, your account is on a multi-user, time-sharing UNIX operating system.\"  My first reaction to this was, \"Well, duh,\" but then my second reaction was... \"Oops.\"  It's not that I don't know these things.  It's just that I get quite a bit ahead of them in tinkering.</p>\n<p>I have to try to find a balance between boiling beakers and safety goggles.</p>\n<p>And, I wonder if this webhost is the right place for this site.  They certainly don't have the world's best customer service.  It's low touch, high grumble BOFH service.  It appears that the people running the show are experts (I see the name of one of the admins all over various Open Source projects' patch submissions), but don't have a whole lot of time or patience for bullshit.  But, I pretty much knew that going in.  It makes things cheap, but it's also a bozo filter.</p>\n<p>And with some of the things I'll be doing, I'm likely to be a continual bozo.</p>\n<p>The best thing would be, as <a href=\"http://www.pipetree.com/qmacro/\">DJ</a> suggested earlier today in blogchat, to find a cheap-cheap colocation somewhere.  It's not as if I don't have machines to spare-- I just need a safe, constant full peer and static IP net connection.  I'd love to have something I could run persistent servers on, play with a few different app servers, a couple generations of Apache, etc.  The things I want to do can be done safely, given that I pay attention, but I doubt that they will make for a quiet neighborhood.  On any server I play, I'll be the noisy bastard down the street blaring the metal and practicing with his band every night.</p>\n<p>Hmm.. have to think about that co-lo thing.</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>I just noticed <a href=\"http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/technology/xanadu.html\">Ghosts of Xanadu</a> published on <a href=\"http://www.disenchanted.com\">Disenchanted</a>, where they make an analysis of the linkback meme and it's historic roots.  They cover pretty much all the big ideas I've been poking at in my head, and give props to Xanadu.  Heck, they even mention Godel, Escher, &amp; Bach (which my girlfriend &amp; I have started reading again) and ant scent trails.</p>\n<p>So along with the <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/JavaScript?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">JavaScript</font></span>-powered linkback thing, something else I've been thinking about is a little semantic sugar to add to the mix.  I keep forgetting to mention it, but what makes <a href=\"http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/linkback.html\">Disenchanted's linkback system</a> very good is that Disenchanted \"personally visits all pages that point to us and may write a short note that will accompany the returning link.\"  They manually visit and annotate their links back, whereas my site just trundles along publishing blind links.</p>\n<p>I'd like to change that with my site.  The first thing I'll probably do is set up some triggers to track new referring links to my pages, and maybe give me an interface to queue them up, browse them, visit them, and annotate them.  </p>\n<p>But the second thing is something that would require a little group participation from out there in blogspace.  It might not work.  Then again, it might catch on like crazy.  I want to investigate links back automatically, and generate annotations.  I'm lazy and don't want to visit everyone linking to me, which sounds rude, but I think that the best improvements to blogspace come with automation.  (In reality, I do tend to obsessively explore the links that show up in my referral log, but bear with me.)</p>\n<p>I can respect the manual effort Disenchanted goes through, but I don't wanna.  So, I want a robot to travel back up referring links.  What will it find there?  Well, at present, probably just an HTML page.  Likely a weblog entry, maybe a wiki page.  What can I reasonably expect to derive from that page?  Maybe a title, possibly an author if I inform the robot a bit about what to look for. (ie. some simple scraping rules for blogs I know regularly link to me.)  </p>\n<p>What else can I scrape?</p>\n<p>Well, if bloggers (or blog software authors) out there help me a bit, I might be able to scrape a whole lot.  I just stuck a <a href=\"http://wander-lust.com\">Wander-Lust</a> button on my weblog, and I read about <a href=\"http://wander-lust.com/scoutinfo.html\">their blog syndication service</a>.  You can throw in specially constructed HTML comments that their robot can scrape to automatically slurp and syndicate some of your content.  Not a new idea, but it reminds me.</p>\n<p>So bloggers could have their software leave some semantic milk &amp; cookies out for my robot when it wanders back up their referring links.  Maybe it could be in a crude HTML comment format.</p>\n<p>Or maybe it could be in a bit of embedded <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a>.  Hmm.  Anyone?</p>\n<p>What would be useful to go in there?  I might like to know a unique URL for the page I'm looking at, versus having many links back to the same blog entry (on the front page, in archives, as an individual page with comments, etc.)  I might also like to know who you are, where you're coming from, and maybe (just maybe) a little blurb about why you just linked to me.  I'd like to publish all these things along with my link back to you, in order to describe the nature of the link and record the structure we're forming.</p>\n<p>This seems like another idea blogs could push along, semantic web tech as applied to two-way links.</p>\n<p>Of course, the important thing here is laziness.  I'm lazy and want to investigate your link to me with a robot.  But you're lazy too.  There's no way that you'll want to do more work that I do to provide me with the data for my robot to harvest.  So... how to make this as easy as making a link to me is now-- or better yet, can we make it easier to make a richly described link?  That would really set some fires.</p>\n",

But beyond the fact that he mentions me, I really like the biological metaphor for blogspace he explores there.  </p>\n<p>In the short time I've had this blog out here, I've tossed in a few handfuls of small hacks that have incrementally connected it to others and made discovery of some connections automatic.  What I'm doing is mostly inspired by what I see other bloggers doing.  Something about all this feels very different from what's happened on the web thus far.  I don't have, nor likely will ever have, one of the more popular blogs on the block-- but for the short time I've had it, this thing has gotten more connected than anything else I've ever done on the web.  It's certainly by no genius of my own that this has happened.  There's something big to this.</p>\n<p>Pardon the pretention, but it seems that there's this <a href=\"http://www.santafe.edu/~malcolm/preprints/descartes.pdf\">\"Reverse-Entropy\"</a>  going on here through these incremental tweaks and the construction of these small, elegant connecting channels between walls are what will very shortly raise the level of blogspace to.. what, a <a href=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0134.html?printable=1\">singularity</a>?  Not sure, but it's seeming more and more like David Brin's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055329024X/0xdecafbad-20\">Earth</a>.  (I've got to read that again and pull some quotes.)</p>\n<p>So (back to practical matters), <a href=\"http://www.downes.ca/\">Stephen Downes</a> dropped into my <a href=\"http://www.blogchat.com\">blogchat</a> for a visit and we chatted briefly about <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000112.shtml#000112\">the linkback meme</a>.  One thing we'd touched on was a fully <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/JavaScript?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">JavaScript</font></span> exploiting referrer service one could use on a site where one could not host dynamic content like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI\">SSI</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a>, etc.   Jon also touches on pretty much the same thing in musing about a <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100887/2002/05/06.html#a216\">backlink display in Radio</a>.</p>\n<p>More centralized services bug me-- I really want to see a completely decentrallized blogspace.  But, it's baby steps that need to be taken.  Since there's no P2P killer app plumbing for blogspace yet, we need full peers to get hosted.  </p>\n<p>Some, like mine, are hosted where dynamic content is available and I am capable (and willing) to hack at the dynamic bits.  Others are hosted where content must be static, and others have owners who either can't or don't want to bother with hacking on the plumbing.  So some central services are still needed to prop up blogs.  Baby steps.  Get the tech working, observe the flying sparks, and get bored tinkering with what doesn't work.</p>\n<p>But it would be brilliant if someday soon, something like Radio can become 100% decentrallized, with installations collaborating to form the space via firewall-piercing instant messaging conduits, pub/sub connections, content store-and-forward, distributed indexing, and the whole utopian bunch of Napster dreamy stuff.</p>\n<p>Okay, back to work.<br>\n</p>\n",

Instead, LJ seems not itchy enough to abandon (and I have friends there), and MT seems comfy enough for now.  So, Radio remains a place of bunsen burners and exploding beakers for me for now.  (This is not a complaint, this is a cause for gleeful and evil rubbing of hands together.)</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"http://deus-x.livejournal.com\">LiveJournal</a>, however, was my first successful blog.  And by successful, I mean that I managed to keep writing there, usually trying to babble more at length than just copying a few headlines.  My writing there is pretty random, by intention.  I'd originally started it to supplement my daily writing in my paper journal, as some other outlet for words to keep me writing and maintain my ability to string more than two words together coherently.  </p>\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a>, I'm more likely to rant about things like religion and touchy issues.  I'm also more likely to talk about <a href=\"http://missadroit.livejournal.com\">my girlfriend</a> and other events in life more interesting to my closer circle of friends.</p>\n<p>I consider 0xDECAFBAD to be my nerd-blog, or my \"professional\" blog.  It's where I'm more likely to ramble about things in my life as a geekish craftsperson.  I could draw a Venn diagram, but suffice it to say that I think there are different, but overlapping, audiences for my high-nerdity versus my more personal ramblings.</p>\n<p>Does anyone else do this?  I'm sure I'm not alone in cordoning my blog faces off from each other.  But should I feel the need to separate things like this?  Although I can't find a link to it, I seem to remember <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/\">Shelley Powers</a> writing about tearing down her cordons between her nerd-core and normal-person blog sides.  Of course, I try to thin the barriers at least by displaying my <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/customview.cgi?user=deus_x&amp;styleid=32679\">LiveJournal </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed over on the side as a \"sibling\" blog.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, its a strange form of self-classification.  On the other, though, it seems to work for me.  Visit <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">0xDECAFBAD</a> to see my vaguely professional high-nerdity.  But if you want to get closer to me as a human being, come visit my <a href=\"http://deus-x.livejournal.com\">LiveJournal</a> and see me and my place in the community there.  If you <i>really</i> want to know me... well, <a href=\"mailto:deus_x@pobox.com\">email me</a> or maybe IM me.  And maybe, just maybe, if you happen to be in town, let's head down to the pub.</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>Okay, so it's a given that I'm not giving up my PVR soon.  So, which ones work best?  And why?</p>\n<p>So far, all of mine have been homebrew, thanks mostly to <a href=\"http://www.ati.com\">ATI</a> video cap / tuner cards.  I've never owned a <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/TiVO?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">TiVO</font></span>, although I've lusted over them.  But my current setup seems serviceable.  I managed to record the entire run of the third season of Buffy in rerun onto VCDs with the ATI Multimedia Center software.  (No cracks on the Buffster.  If you don't like it, try s/Buffy/Babylon 5/ or maybe s/Buffy/Nova/ in your head.)</p>\n<p>Now, I'm looking to replace the Windows this runs on with a Linux install.  I already record radio shows under Linux with a PCI radio tuner, and under OS X sometimes with a USB FM tuner.  So now I see this <a href=\"http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/VCR-HOWTO.html\">VCR HOWTO</a> which claims:</p><blockquote><i> This is a guide to setting up your GNU/Linux workstation as a digital VCR using the video4linux driver and a supported tuner card. A section has been added for creating VCD's that can be played in any DVD/VCD player as well.</i></blockquote>Sounds precisely like what I'm doing right now.  And I <i>think</i> that my ATI All-in-Wonder Radeon card can be supported under Linux.  If not, I have a backup <a href=\"http://www.zoltrix-int.com/products/video/8MMZXGENIE.htm\">BT848-based Zoltrix TV tuner</a> that works for sure, but that one only seems to have mono audio, unfortunately.<p></p>\n<p>Has anyone put together a working Linux setup as described in the HOWTO?  If so, how do you like it?</p>\n<p>On the other hand...  Should I still think of getting a <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/TiVo?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">TiVo</font></span>?  What's so special about it, other than dead simple ease of use?  I'd want to immediately crack it open and start hacking more HD space into it, as well as <a href=\"http://www.9thtee.com/tivoairnet.htm\">TiVo <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"></span></a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/AirNET?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">AirNET</font> Ethernet Adapter Board.  But I think my Linux box will do this, and more.  Though, I'm not sure if Linux supports the TV-out for my ATI card.  I've also heard that <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/TiVo?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">TiVo</font></span> captures closed captioning.  Eh, neat, but I don't need it.  Not at the moment, anyway.  Then I hear about things like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=sonicblue+spy\">SonicBlue being ordered to spy on PVR users</a>, and I feel much safer having a home-cobbled PVR.</p>\n<p>What d'you think?</p>\n",

Now, I'm reading what <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100629/2002/05/06.html#a108\">Mike James has to say</a> about what <a href=\"http://www.templetons.com/brad/tvfuture.html\">Brad Templeton has to say</a> about the <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/TiVO?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">TiVO</font></span>, PVR's, and what <i>they</i> are gonna do.  </p>\n<p>Brad offers up a few very good suggestions-- ways to offer more options with regards to TV funding, ways to mix up and better target ads and ways to buy out the ad time.  Some of the \"enter the keyword from the ad\" suggestions strike me as eerily similar to the ways warez and porn trading servers on the <a href=\"http://www.hotlinesw.com/\">Hotline</a> network.  Go visit 3 sites, usually casino sites and other banners, spend about 30 seconds exposed to each site searching for a certain keyboard, come back to the warez/pr0n server with your keywords in hand.</p>\n<p>Again, the porn leads the way.  :)  Well, sort of.  The Hotline servers are pirating the porn industry, but porn tends to always be one of the drivers of tech.  I wonder if purveyors of porn might not also be the first to hit on the new business model that rakes in the cash from what's coming?</p>\n<p>I can't help but think of this in terms of golden geese.  TV studios have had a golden goose in advertisers, and she's laid wonderful eggs for decades.  But now the old gal's tired and the eggs are getting smaller and less shiny.  Must be something in the water or the goose feed that's changed.  Seems that there just might be another goose out there that'll lay even bigger eggs.  Not only that, but I hear that this new goose might even deliver the eggs right to them, and maybe even thank them for it.  But, rather than questing and finding this new   kind of goose, they're trying to sow the goose feed fields with salt and poisons.  And they're looking for thicker chains for the current goose's ankles, and reinforcing the bars of the cage.</p>\n<p>I really must be missing something.  I can't help but think that consumers wouldn't mind being treated like customers, finally, and not as assumed thieves.  I have to think that some very smart people work in the entertainment industry.  At least a few of them must have read the Cluetrain Manfesto and come away with something.  Is this just naive to think?  Seems vaguely incomprehensible to me that fear has them working this hard to maintain an aging business model, where the rewards would be staggering if they put that much effort into exploiting a new one.  And they'd be praised instead of pissing everyone off.</p>\n<p>Wish I could remember the quote (was it Heinlein?) about companies and their making money, which basically gets summed up in Mike's quoting of <a href=\"http://www.thespidermanmovie.com/\">Spidey</a>, \"I think I missed the part where this became my problem.\"  It's already been heavily quoted, but it's worth repeating.<br>\n</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>I've been trying out <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> on my token Wintel box at home, and it really doesn't impress me.  I was running Win2K, and Win98 before that, and I can't really see the big deal.  </p>\n<p>To be fair, I can say that I don't make fun of Windows for crashing as much anymore, although XP did just crash this week with a big fat bluescreen which took out the entire body of preferences in my user account including all my digital VCR schedules.  So that was annoying.  But rare now, anyway.  And most times it can be blamed on drivers or non-Windows software...  but gah.</p>\n<p>But as for the rest of XP... I can't stand Luna.  I turn off all the bells and whistles until it starts looking like Win98.  I reduce my Windows Explorer down to about what it looked like in '96, just a folder tree on the left and detail-view on the right.  Most of the other \"helpful\" features of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> just annoy the crap out of me.  Am I missing the benefits of XP?  It just really seems like hairs are being split and sugar's being poured in since about 1998 with Windows.  Maybe the thing is that no one's come up with any new dramatic, paradigm-shattering new things, so incremental perfection is all that's left for Windows.</p>\n<p>So here's what I'm getting to:  I'm thinking of <i>downgrading</i> my home PC to either <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/WinME?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">WinME</font></span> or Win98, and I might just stop the upgrade cycle there.  And I'll stop it for good unless I see some dire need to upgrade my Microsoft OS.  I don't seem to have any software which <i>requires</i> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a>.  Rarely, something requires Win2K or NT, but most of that stuff I replace with a Unix app.  At work I've been running Win98 in a Virtual PC instance on my OS X machine, and all my daily-use software runs fine on it.  And it really doesn't crash all that much.</p>\n<p>And this isn't just an anti-Microsoft thing.  Well, to be honest, in part it is.  And in part, I don't want my Windows habit to suck me into recurring Microsoft payments, should they perfect the licensing enforcement and stop letting me buy the thing once and make me sign up for a monthly fee.  Unless they can start showing me something like <a href=\"http://static.userland.com/updatelogs/radio.xml\">the Radio </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> radio.root changes <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed, I don't see a benefit to <i>me</i> to pay on a subscription basis.  I suppose their list of patches and things fits that bill, but it's not the same to me.  With Radio, I see a stream of improvements and new features.  With Microsoft, I see largely a stream of fixes and replacements for things they've already sold me.  But, I suppose it's apples and oranges.  Radio can afford to bootstrap and occasionally break, whereas Windows must strive to be solid as a rock.</p>\n<p>This makes me feel vaguely luddite.</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>My webhost had a bit of an outtage, and the machine on which this site is hosted suffered a nasty hard drive crash.  Things were down for about a day or so, and when they came back up most everything was broken.  Seems that the sysadmin of this server added a few security improvements, such as disallowing execution of CGI scripts with dangerous permissions, which revealed my sloppy and \"atrocious\" (the sysadmin's word) use of them.  </p>\n<p>*gulp*  Bad me.  Shows that it's been a long while since I had a website on a multi-user machine-- not that that's a very valid excuse, but it seems less urgent to tighten up permissions when you own the machine, have a small and trusted team working on it, and it sits behind two firewalls.</p>\n<p>Hmm.  I need to get schooled in some security mojo with the quickness.  Loving the Wiki Way is one thing, but bending over like the goatse.cx guy (no, I'm not linking to it) is another thing altogether.<br>\n</p>\n",
