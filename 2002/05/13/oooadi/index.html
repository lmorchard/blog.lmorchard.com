        <meta property="og:description" content="Had a busy weekend living life, entertaining the girl, and cleaning my cave.  A few quick things, if only to remind myself to remember to think about them:





Inspired by a suggestion from Eric Scheid to move from my server-included blocks to client-included blocks via ?JavaScript, I did a little exploration into the idea and whipped up a quick, generalized script to mangle the contents of any given URL into a document.writeln().  Not sure how robust this thing is.



Also, not sure how widely supported the JS-include hack is.  On the other hand, Stephen Downes had made a good point in my blogchat the other day concerning JS-based hacks:  my visitors can turn them off by disabling Javascript.  Having been employed in the field of internet promotions these past 6 years, this seems like a nightmare.  But, having been reading the Cluetrain Manifesto and following smart blogs, I start to think this is a Good Thing.


I see that JanneJalkanen  and crew are musing out an update to the XML-RPC wiki interface.  Having worked on my own implementations of this interface, I need to keep an eye on this, even if I can&#39;t quite be as active as I like.


HTTP Extensions for a Content-Addressable Web seems hot as hell, especially for the future decentrallized publishing world I&#39;m dreaming of.



I&#39;m updating my home linux box, Memoria, with Debian, defecting from Mandrake Linux.  Wish me luck.  Oh, and the HD in the machine has a few cranky parts from having been dropped.  Wish it luck.



Running a telnet BBS at telnet://deus-x.dyndns.org:2323.  The domain may change to bbs.decafbad.com soon.  I miss the BBS days.  I may bemoan the loss of local community gateways onto the &#39;net someday soon.  I&#39;m using Synchronet on a poor overworked Pentium 70Mhz PC running Win98, on which I also inflicted Radio UserLand for the time being.  No one really calls on my BBS.  I&#39;ve been thinking of hosting the UNIX version on Memoria.



Thinking of trying out Radio UserLand on Memoria under Wine.  I&#39;ve seen mutterings which claim that this is possible.  Anyone?



I want to wax pretentious with a few musings on the Singularity, birth control, anti-biotics, glasses, and self-modifying code.  I might not get around to it, though.
