        <meta property="og:description" content="Just noticed that Stephen Downes emailed me about his implementation of a Javascript-based referrer linkback system.  I&#39;d been planning to get around to making one inspired from our blogchat, but he&#39;s got it first.  Cool.  :)  Looks like Jon&#39;s picked up on it, too.  



Jon muses:I haven&#39;t yet looked into what it will take to make the reporting item- rather than page-specific. It&#39;s doable, I&#39;m sure. Thanks, Stephen! A ?JavaScript-oriented solution like this will appeal to a lot of Radio users.



The biggest issue I see for Radio, obviously, is that the style there is to have many blog entries on one page for the day.  Permalinks are anchors within those pages.  However, I haven&#39;t seen browsers reporting the post-anchor-hash info for referrals.  At first though, one would need to have Radio spew blog entries into individual files to make this JS linkback scheme work at per-entry granularity.  Otherwise, I&#39;d love to see this work for Radio.  I&#39;d also love to see it woven with community server services.



A few brief musings on the referrers script itself:





Hmm, haven&#39;t seen cgi-lib.pl used since my Perl 4 and pre-CGI.pm days.  I&#39;d forgotten how serviceable the thing still is.



I like get_page_title().  It&#39;s a start on what I was musing about over here.



I want to steal this, maybe transliterate it into PHP (since my webhost frowns on my CGIs now), and hook it up to a MySQL database.  Stephen doesn&#39;t want to host the world&#39;s referers, but I wonder how mad my host will get if I open mine up.  :)  Would make for some neat data to draw maps with, but probably shouldn&#39;t do things to make myself an even more annoying band practicing neighbor." />
