I&#39;m using Mac OS X.  I have a Griffin iMic and a D-Link USB Radio.  I can control the radio with DSBRTuner (with source code!)  I thought that that would be the hard part.  Now, what I want is a simple way to record sound to disk in AIFF format, preferably from the command line or at least with source code.  I&#39;ve tried a few other sound recording apps, but they&#39;re all mostly inadequate and overkill at the same time.  Most of them won&#39;t record to disk, so capturing 4 hours of audio into memory hurts a lot.
I want to, in part, record radio shows with cron jobs.  This shouldn&#39;t be rocket science.  So, anyone know how to write a simple audio-to-disk app for OS X?" />
