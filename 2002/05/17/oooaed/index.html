        <meta property="og:description" content="Whew.  Been swamped this week, with work and with life in general.  So, sadly, 0xDECAFBAD got a bit neglected.  
When last I was working on things, I was in the middle of some decent-sized reworks of various parts to go easier on the servers and do things in a smarter way.  Amongst all that, I notice that since my suspension the admin of my web host has been poking in from time to time and still tinkering with my site.  This week they&#39;ve been doing things like turning off execution permissions site-wide (and therefore disabling all scripts here) and shutting off various cron jobs and calling it abuse-- eg. a nightly tarball of my site, to be scp&#39;ed down by a home machine&#39;s cron job later in the night.  Supposedly they have backups, but I don&#39;t.
On the one hand, I understand an admin wanting to maintain the performance of a server he owns.  On the other hand, I&#39;m a tenant.  Does your landlord continually come into your apartment when you&#39;re not home, without notification?  Does he or she wander around, unplugging your clocks and appliances, shutting off your heat while you&#39;re gone?  I could understand if the apartment was on fire, then some immediate action is required.  But you know, I&#39;d just like to have a little notification.
