When last I was working on things, I was in the middle of some decent-sized reworks of various parts to go easier on the servers and do things in a smarter way.  Amongst all that, I notice that since my suspension the admin of my web host has been poking in from time to time and still tinkering with my site.  This week they&amp;apos;ve been doing things like turning off execution permissions site-wide (and therefore disabling all scripts here) and shutting off various cron jobs and calling it abuse-- eg. a nightly tarball of my site, to be scp&amp;apos;ed down by a home machine&amp;apos;s cron job later in the night.  Supposedly they have backups, but I don&amp;apos;t. On the one hand, I understand an admin wanting to maintain the performance of a server he owns.  On the other hand, I&amp;apos;m a tenant.  Does your landlord continually come into your apartment when you&amp;apos;re not home, without notification?  Does he or she wander around, unplugging your clocks and appliances, shutting off your heat while you&amp;apos;re gone?  I could understand if the apartment was on fire, then some immediate action is required.  But you know, I&amp;apos;d just like to have a little notification. Moving on... " />
