It appears that the new Multi-Author Weblog Tool does almost exactly what I&amp;apos;d mused about doing as a GroupsWeblogWithRadioUserLand, were I to ever get around to it.  Been drifting away from Radio lately, but I need to get it working on a decent machine.  It ate my iBook CPU time like dingoes eat babies, and on my home desktop Windows machine it would eat enough CPU to cripple my PVR functions.  I&amp;apos;d like to see about either moving that PVR function to a  Linux box, or trying to run Radio under Wine. " />
