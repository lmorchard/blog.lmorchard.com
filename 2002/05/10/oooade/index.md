<p>Yay!  It appears that the new <a href="http://radio.userland.com/multiAuthorWeblogTool">Multi-Author Weblog Tool</a> does almost exactly what I'd mused about doing as a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/GroupWeblogWithRadioUserLand">GroupsWeblogWithRadioUserLand</a>, were I to ever get around to it.  Been drifting away from Radio lately, but I need to get it working on a decent machine.  It ate my iBook CPU time like dingoes eat babies, and on my home desktop Windows machine it would eat enough CPU to cripple my PVR functions.  I'd like to see about either moving that PVR function to a  Linux box, or trying to run Radio under <a href="http://www.winehq.com">Wine</a>.</p>
