Basically, I want some software to give every person here an internal blog or journal.  Immediately, I want this to capture internal narrative.  A future subversive idea I have for it is to eventually pipe some of these internal entries out to our public company website.  (Yes, I'm reading The Cluetrain Manifesto again.)\n</p>\n<p>\nI've gotten almost everyone here on the wiki bandwagon, and we're using it regularly as a knowledge capture and collaboration tool.

It makes me think of BlogFace, which is mentioned here and here. Using Zope's cataloging mechanism, the blog is just a dynamic query of a part of the site (a wiki, perhaps? ;), date-organized.

It makes me think of BlogFace, which is mentioned here and here. Using Zope's cataloging mechanism, the blog is just a dynamic query of a part of the site (a wiki, perhaps? ;), date-organized. You can look for metadata, full-text matching, anything you want. This would be server-side, however; Zope might be a bit heavy as a client.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088465\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.mygroupservices.com/Group.aspx/humayun\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=31399c7ec5c557cf3eefe3785af70175&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.mygroupservices.com/Group.aspx/humayun\">Humayun Lari</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088465\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-05-13T19:57:50\">2002-05-13T19:57:50</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Well, I work at a k-logged company, but then, we're also working on a k-logging tool...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mygroupservices.com/\r\n\r\nIt covers the \"dead simple\" part.\r\n\r\nRegarding metadata, since most people ignore it (see Word's Properties window for an example), our solution is to let people create all the weblogs and groups they want, then flow all the recent events in the person's groups into a \"What's New\" page.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

  "summary": "<p>\nSpeaking of software I want to get deployed at work (ie. time tracking), another thing I want to take the plunge with is k-logging.  Basically, I want some software to give every person here an internal blog or journal.  Immediately, I want this to capture internal narrative.  A future subversive idea I have for it is to eventually pipe some of these internal entries out to our public company website.  (Yes, I'm reading The Cluetrain Manifesto again.)\n</p>\n<p>\nI've gotten almost everyone here on the wiki bandwagon, and we're using it regularly as a knowledge capture and collaboration tool.  So, they're used to me throwing odd new tech at them.  Unfortunately, the wiki isn't precisely suitable to what I want for the k-logs.  These are my requirements so far:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Must be dead simple to use in all aspects, so that it sits far below the laziness threshold it takes to record an idea or narrative as it occurs.</li>\n<li>Rich set of categories and metadata by which an entry can be tagged.  (ie. On what project were you working?  On what project task?  With what products?  How much time did you spend?)</li>\n<li>Arbitrary views on weblog entries, querying on category and metadata, maybe even on full-text search.  I want to be able to weave together, on the fly, the narrative of any person, project, product, or any other topic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nI'm looking, hopefully, for something free.  At the moment, I'd have a hard time campaigning for the purchase of a fleet of Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> subscriptions for all of us, unfortunately.  Someday, perhaps.  (I could just imagine the insane possibilities of a Radio on every employee's desktop.)  But, is there anything out there like this now?  It's simple enough that I could probably roll my own in a weekend or less, but it'd be nice to jump on the bandwagon of an established k-log tool.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlso really looking at more ways to lower the laziness threshold.  We just converted the entire company over to using Jabber as our official instant messaging platform, so I thought it'd be pretty keen to have the k-log system establish a presence to receive IM'ed journal entries.  Along the lines of the wiki adoption, I'd probably have to get everyone to embed a certain style of keywords or some other convention to get the k-log system to pick up categories.\n</p>\n<p>\nOr, to make it even lazier, could I get the k-log system to automatically discover categories by the mention of keywords?  Hmm, this could be fun.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnyone out there working at a k-logged company?\n</p>\n",
