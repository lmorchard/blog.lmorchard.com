Not only that, but I got a little bit extra - seems that since my model of iBook is no longer available, the repair tech found that he was required to replace my dying 9GB hard drive with a quieter 15GB drive.  Not a gigantic improvement, but it ends up being just enough to be nifty and was free to boot.  Also, I splurged a little bit before starting Christmas shopping, and replaced the 256MB of RAM with a 512MB module.  The improvement from 384MB to 640MB under &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOSX&quot;&gt;MacOSX&lt;/a&gt; was much more marked than I&#39;d anticipated.  I don&#39;t know what kept me so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my desires for a new iBook or a glitzy &lt;span style=&quot;background : #FFFFCE;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/TiBook?topicparent=Main.FilterData&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;TiBook&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are dampened for now, and my pocket book thanks me.  And, if/when I decide to toss this thing up onto eBay, the extras couldn&#39;t hurt the value.  Also, I imagine that my expectations of OS X will have set me up for amazement once I get to play with a machine that supports Quartz Extreme and has a more decent processor speed.&lt;/p&gt;
