What&amp;apos;s exciting to me though, is that I tossed it together with an hour&amp;apos;s hacking in Python, using the Twisted framework.  So, starting work in a language and framework both mostly new to me is fun.  Also, it&amp;apos;s interesting to work in the event-driven style again, even though I still think I still want threads (see:  Blog:000090).  If I go to threads, I think I&amp;apos;d swap over to Java. I was tempted to start the thing in Perl, since I already know my way around the language, and I already know my way around POE, a major event-driven framework in that scene.  But, I&amp;apos;ve been programming in perl almost to the exclusion of other languages for a little over 10 years now, not counting some excursions into Java or assignments for college classes.  I think it&amp;apos;s time to expand, and force my brane wider.  I&amp;apos;ve touched on this topic before, but it&amp;apos;s been ages since I had any energy to devote to this place and its projects. At least I didn&amp;apos;t go completely apeshit and start this in Lisp or ?Scheme.  :)  Though I&amp;apos;d still like to make myself an assignment using one of those two, I&amp;apos;d like a few collaborators on this project at some point.  I figure Python would be more hackable for this at present. " />
