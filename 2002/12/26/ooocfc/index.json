Still trying to find the middle ground between clean design and fecund dirt.  There&#39;s no perfect design I&#39;ve ever run into in my time so far, and I don&#39;t expect to.

There will be no time that I&#39;ve participated in a design that ends up being marvelously perfect.  But what I&#39;m trying to feel toward is how to get the balance right between clean and dirt, given skill levels and team sizes and project complexity.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ooocfc</p>\n",
