After citing a very good perspective on software as gardening from &lt;a href=&quot;http://pragmaticprogrammer.com&quot;&gt;The Pragmatic Programmer&lt;/a&gt;, he writes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;As I&amp;apos;ve mentioned before there are a number of software development practices moving toward a more humane process. And I think the ideas underpinning worse-is-better play a big part in this. The major one in my mind is this hypothesis: there is no such thing as a perfect software design. Have you ever seen or heard of one? What design hasn&amp;apos;t been modified over time due to changing needs or conditions?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Good points.  Still trying to find the middle ground between clean design and fecund dirt.  There&amp;apos;s no perfect design I&amp;apos;ve ever run into in my time so far, and I don&amp;apos;t expect to.  But, what I have learned, is that where there is no design at all, you have disaster.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So I guess the main thing I&amp;apos;ve learned so far is that this guilty love of a dirty yet elegant hack while giving myself a &amp;quot;tsk-tsk&amp;quot; with a hope to design it more fully next time is useless.  There will be no time that I&amp;apos;ve participated in a design that ends up being marvelously perfect.  But what I&amp;apos;m trying to feel toward is how to get the balance right between clean and dirt, given skill levels and team sizes and project complexity.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
