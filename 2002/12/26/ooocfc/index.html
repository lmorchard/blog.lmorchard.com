        <meta property="og:description" content="Chris Winters threw me a link to my recent ramble on completely planned perfection versus workable organic imperfection in software design.  After citing a very good perspective on software as gardening from The Pragmatic Programmer, he writes:As I&#39;ve mentioned before there are a number of software development practices moving toward a more humane process. And I think the ideas underpinning worse-is-better play a big part in this. The major one in my mind is this hypothesis: there is no such thing as a perfect software design. Have you ever seen or heard of one? What design hasn&#39;t been modified over time due to changing needs or conditions?
Good points.  Still trying to find the middle ground between clean design and fecund dirt.  There&#39;s no perfect design I&#39;ve ever run into in my time so far, and I don&#39;t expect to.  But, what I have learned, is that where there is no design at all, you have disaster.
So I guess the main thing I&#39;ve learned so far is that this guilty love of a dirty yet elegant hack while giving myself a &quot;tsk-tsk&quot; with a hope to design it more fully next time is useless.  There will be no time that I&#39;ve participated in a design that ends up being marvelously perfect.  But what I&#39;m trying to feel toward is how to get the balance right between clean and dirt, given skill levels and team sizes and project complexity." />
