  <meta property="og:description" content="This week, at work, I cobbled together a hack for MovableType that hooks it up with an LDAP server for author accounts: MovableTypeLDAPAuthors.  This is an early, early, early release of the thing, and is likely to do very nasty things for all that I know.  But, I wanted to share, and it seems to be working for the proof of concept at work (that is, MT weblogs on our intranet for every employee).  Hopefully soon it&amp;apos;ll be approved, and I&amp;apos;ll be looking into a commercial use license for MovableType.  You know, for all the praise I&amp;apos;ve read about MovableType, something I&amp;apos;ve really not seen much attention toward is the code itself.  I mean, yeah this thing is great, and it&amp;apos;s so simple to install and use by even non-techies.  But, under the hood, there&amp;apos;re some nice things going on - like a very decent object persistence approach; templating for pretty strict code/presentation separation; a workable servlet-like app structure with facilities for localization and a dispatch-table approach to executing web app methods.  There are some spots that are a bit too if/else-ful for my taste, like the CMS&amp;apos; edit_object() method, but hey, it works.  In other words, MovableType isn&amp;apos;t just a cobbled together tangle of code that happens to produce weblogs.  I&amp;apos;ve seen piles of well-used code on the web before that all seem to do what they advertise, but present a nightmare under the hood.  (cough Matt Wright&amp;apos;s famous scripts cough)  No, MovableType looks like the result of experience, and I feel biased, because it demonstrates a lot of the same perl web app design patterns I&amp;apos;ve been employing and advocating for years now.  So, my LDAP hack was a bit of enjoyable fun, instead of a chore.  Along the lines of what I&amp;apos;d written last week about perfection versus good enough, I think MovableType is a good example.  It&amp;apos;s something I could have written, but didn&amp;apos;t write and didn&amp;apos;t release and didn&amp;apos;t support and didn&amp;apos;t make lots of people happy along the way.  All the did-nots are the important bit.  It&amp;apos;s why I have two projects dead (Iaijutsu and Iaido) after a few years&amp;apos; effort, and MovableType is a gigantic success today.  So, these are the kind of lessons that  are an important part of what this weblog is about for me. " />

<div class="content">Exciting to see work  in this direction. I&#39;m using MT a lot for  student projects at  the Berkeley J-School, and can imagine this being useful. However, I don&#39;t have a need for each student get their own blog. Instead, I  would want to make sets of students into LDAP groups and then attach that group to a specific blog. See these:
<a href="http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/biplog/">http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/biplog/</a>
<a href="http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/sanpablo/">http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/sanpablo/</a>
<a href="http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/election2002/">http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/election2002/</a>
So in these cases we have, say 20 students in a class, the output of which is a publication in the form of a web site. I  have to create a login for each student. LDAP would be useful for me if I could tell them they could use their  existing network logins.</div>

<div class="content">Hmm, this sounds like a good idea:  Shared blogs based on LDAP groups.  I have yet to get far into how to configure this stuff beyond hard coded module vars, but I think it would be useful to pick a branch of the LDAP tree where all blog groups might live.  I could then make an explicitly-run script that generates any not-yet-existant blogs for LDAP groups, or maybe work in some autocreation magic that generates them on the fly.</div>
