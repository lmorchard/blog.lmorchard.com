        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;This week, at work, I cobbled together a hack for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType&quot;&gt;MovableType&lt;/a&gt; that hooks it up with an LDAP server for author accounts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableTypeLDAPAuthors&quot;&gt;MovableTypeLDAPAuthors&lt;/a&gt;.  This is an early, early, early release of the thing, and is likely to do very nasty things for all that I know.  But, I wanted to share, and it seems to be working for the proof of concept at work (that is, MT weblogs on our intranet for every employee).  Hopefully soon it&amp;apos;ll be approved, and I&amp;apos;ll be looking into a commercial use license for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType&quot;&gt;MovableType&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You know, for all the praise I&amp;apos;ve read about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType&quot;&gt;MovableType&lt;/a&gt;, something I&amp;apos;ve really not seen much attention toward is the code itself.  I mean, yeah this thing is great, and it&amp;apos;s so simple to install and use by even non-techies.  But, under the hood, there&amp;apos;re some nice things going on - like a very decent object persistence approach; templating for pretty strict code/presentation separation; a workable servlet-like app structure with facilities for localization and a dispatch-table approach to executing web app methods.  There are some spots that are a bit too if/else-ful for my taste, like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/CMS&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/a&gt;&amp;apos; edit_object() method, but hey, it works.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In other words, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType&quot;&gt;MovableType&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;apos;t just a cobbled together tangle of code that happens to produce weblogs.  I&amp;apos;ve seen piles of well-used code on the web before that all seem to do what they advertise, but present a nightmare under the hood.  (&lt;strong&gt;cough&lt;/strong&gt; Matt Wright&amp;apos;s famous scripts &lt;strong&gt;cough&lt;/strong&gt;)  No, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType&quot;&gt;MovableType&lt;/a&gt; looks like the result of experience, and I feel biased, because it demonstrates a lot of the same perl web app design patterns I&amp;apos;ve been employing and advocating for years now.  So, my LDAP hack was a bit of enjoyable fun, instead of a chore.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Along the lines of what I&amp;apos;d written last week &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000354.phtml&quot;&gt;about perfection versus good enough&lt;/a&gt;, I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType&quot;&gt;MovableType&lt;/a&gt; is a good example.  It&amp;apos;s something I &lt;strong&gt;could&lt;/strong&gt; have written, but &lt;strong&gt;didn&amp;apos;t&lt;/strong&gt; write and &lt;strong&gt;didn&amp;apos;t&lt;/strong&gt; release and &lt;strong&gt;didn&amp;apos;t&lt;/strong&gt; support and &lt;strong&gt;didn&amp;apos;t&lt;/strong&gt; make lots of people happy along the way.  All the did-nots are the important bit.  It&amp;apos;s why I have two projects dead (&lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/iaijutsu&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Iaijutsu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/iaido&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Iaido&lt;/a&gt;) after a few years&amp;apos; effort, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType&quot;&gt;MovableType&lt;/a&gt; is a gigantic success today.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, these are the kind of lessons that  are an important part of what this weblog is about for me.&lt;/p&gt;

<div class="content">Exciting to see work  in this direction. I'm using MT a lot for  student projects at  the Berkeley J-School, and can imagine this being useful. However, I don't have a need for each student get their own blog. Instead, I  would want to make sets of students into LDAP groups and then attach that group to a specific blog. See these:
http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/biplog/
http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/sanpablo/
http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/election2002/
So in these cases we have, say 20 students in a class, the output of which is a publication in the form of a web site. I  have to create a login for each student. LDAP would be useful for me if I could tell them they could use their  existing network logins.</div>

<div class="content">Hmm, this sounds like a good idea:  Shared blogs based on LDAP groups.  I have yet to get far into how to configure this stuff beyond hard coded module vars, but I think it would be useful to pick a branch of the LDAP tree where all blog groups might live.  I could then make an explicitly-run script that generates any not-yet-existant blogs for LDAP groups, or maybe work in some autocreation magic that generates them on the fly.</div>
