This is an early, early, early release of the thing, and is likely to do very nasty things for all that I know.  But, I wanted to share, and it seems to be working for the proof of concept at work (that is, MT weblogs on our intranet for every employee).  Hopefully soon it'll be approved, and I'll be looking into a commercial use license for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>.</p>\n<p>You know, for all the praise I've read about <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>, something I've really not seen much attention toward is the code itself.  I mean, yeah this thing is great, and it's so simple to install and use by even non-techies.  But, under the hood, there're some nice things going on - like a very decent object persistence approach; templating for pretty strict code/presentation separation; a workable servlet-like app structure with facilities for localization and a dispatch-table approach to executing web app methods.  There are some spots that are a bit too if/else-ful for my taste, like the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/CMS\">CMS</a>' edit_object() method, but hey, it works.</p>\n<p>In other words, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> isn't just a cobbled together tangle of code that happens to produce weblogs.
