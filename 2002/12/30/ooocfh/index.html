The crucial thing is that it move forward in tinkerer-sized steps, remain understood and tested at each point, and do some reasonably useful new thing after each lurch in order to remain interesting.

<div class="content">Absolutely. I guess that is kind of what I was trying to provide with my post (see my site). But even these chunks may be too big to start out with. It's clear that this is not going to be a small undertaking, in terms of its vision. It's also exactly the kind of project that could easily just become one big cluster_f.
To me, it seems reasonable to define the base architecture for the peer or node. I think that something simple like an agent framework that sits operates as a localhost peer server would be an appropriate basis. This will allow us to add services as components, perhaps beginning with agents/bots or aggregators.
What's cool about this, is that this meme is something that everybody is catching onto very quickly, so maybe the combined efforts of a bunch of busy people could lead to the first (that I am aware of) project born in blogspace!</div>
