I guess that is kind of what I was trying to provide with my post (see my site). But even these chunks may be too big to start out with. It&#39;s clear that this is not going to be a small undertaking, in terms of its vision. It&#39;s also exactly the kind of project that could easily just become one big cluster_f.\n\nTo me, it seems reasonable to define the base architecture for the peer or node. I think that something simple like an agent framework that sits operates as a localhost peer server would be an appropriate basis. This will allow us to add services as components, perhaps beginning with agents/bots or aggregators.\n\nWhat&#39;s cool about this, is that this meme is something that everybody is catching onto very quickly, so maybe the combined efforts of a bunch of busy people could lead to the first (that I am aware of) project born in blogspace!</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221084901&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221084901&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-12-31T16:52:35&quot;&gt;2002-12-31T16:52:35&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;This is a test comment&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
