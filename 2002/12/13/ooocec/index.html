        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Another little train of thought, whose conclusion will probably be obvious to anyone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder how hard it would be for me to make a little personal idea processor like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Eastgate Tinderbox&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt;?  Very likely much harder than it was for its author to create the original - I&amp;apos;m by no means smarter than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.markbernstein.org/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Mark Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;, and he&amp;apos;s got years on me in developing tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Tinderbox&lt;/a&gt;.  So why would I even consider rolling my own in this case?  Certainly not the price - for a tool like that, the price is a steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I think it&amp;apos;s because I don&amp;apos;t have full access to hack the thing, and it has a few itchy spots for me.  At least, that&amp;apos;s the way it looked when I last tried a demo on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOSX&quot;&gt;MacOSX&lt;/a&gt;.  I wish I could fix them, and rolling my own is the best way I know for that.  And besides, I&amp;apos;m in a real &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt; love fest lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But...  Is it really so bad as it is?  Bad enough to try to play catch up with what someone else has already devoted so much to?  Nope.  Bad idea.  Best to promote &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2002/12/12.html#a537&quot;&gt;recombinant growth&lt;/a&gt;, and rephrase the question:  I wonder how long it would take me to get used to the tool&amp;apos;s quirks as I percieve them, make suggestions to the author, and then use the extraordinary hackability &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt; present in the tool to get it soaking in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a lesson that&amp;apos;s taken me awhile to resign to learn, so I figured this would be a good exercise to document it.  And to think, I once spent a year or two trying to re-implement &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zope.org&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Zope&lt;/a&gt;, by myself, mostly in quiet, and with not much to show in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

<div class="content">Ideagraph is a Tinderbox-like tool backed by RDF :
http://www.ideagraph.net/2002-12/
It can build mindmaps and use items from RSS feeds. Etc, etc.
Still a work in progress, but I'm getting there...</div>

<div class="content">Tinderbox itself is going to move closer to RDF, under the hood, in the coming months.  All things considered, it's a flexible and extensible tool -- and the Tinderbox team is open to ideas for making things work even more smoothly with other tools.</div>
