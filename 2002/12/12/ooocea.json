It didn&#39;t seem to work very well on my Mac running OS X - mouse pointers disappearing, clunky windows and randomly disappearing graphics.  Not sure what the issue was, but it wasn&#39;t very positive for my first try&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221087197&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://weblog.burningbird.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fab5bffa5622f63e6b0ff81a2b0e3956&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://weblog.burningbird.net&quot;&gt;Burningbird&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221087197&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-12-13T19:41:04&quot;&gt;2002-12-13T19:41:04&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Thanks for pointing out Brownsauce! That was one I missed, and fell in love with when I played with it last night.
