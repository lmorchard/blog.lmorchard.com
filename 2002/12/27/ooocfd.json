Looks Great, thanks l.m.orchard !\n\nI just downloaded the new, new amphetaoutlines, installed it and ran amphetadesk. Default browser WAS  IE6.0 sp2. Took about 15 min. for newsfeeds to be retrieved, OK, IE opens, outliner opens with all channels collapsed. Tried to expand, got an error on page message.\nSo, I figured I&#39;d try another browser, I don&#39;t like IE anyway, so I opened Mozilla 1.2, copied in link, EveryThing Works Fine.\n\nIt looks great, now I know what everyone was raving about. Thanks again, l.m.orchard !\n\nCurtis</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
