        <meta property="og:description" content="About the difference between BlogWalking and Moblogging, Bryce writes:Moblogging is about capturing the moment with multimedia.
Moblogs exist in a seperate space from traditional weblogs, and that&#39;s where the disconnect with Blogwalking occurs.
Blogwalking is about taking our weblogs with us.Originally, we&#39;d written about BlogWalking as literally walking with your blog, publishing &amp; management software and all installed on a mobile device.  The spirit of it, in my mind, was mobile blogging.
Then, I read about Moblogging and assume it&#39;s the same thing.  But, Bryce points out an important distinction that I think I get now.  BlogWalking is coming from one direction, trying to make the blog mobile.  Moblogging comes from the other direction, trying to make the mobile blogged.  
I&#39;d off-handedly wondered what it would be like as a BlogWalker, if I could add a camera, GPS device, temperature sensor, and other various things to a PDA loaded with blog software - I already have the blog, but I want to add multimedia to it.  Well, Mobloggers already have multimedia devices, with voice and imaging and more to come - they want to capture that content in a blog.
It&#39;s a subtle difference, but somewhat important, I think.  And after experiences with my Treo, an admittedly underpowered device versus the Zaurus, I&#39;m leaning toward Moblogging.  Keep the blog software off the mobile device, but make the mobile device into a multimedia blogging terminal.  I think Moblogging is really the spirit of what I want from BlogWalking.
I&#39;m hoping for a color HipTop after my Sprint PCS contract is up.  The Treo has been nice to me, but it hasn&#39;t amazed me.  Although the grass is always greener, the HipTop seem the more amazing device to me." />

<div class="content">There's a color model on the way? I literally have a 2nd tab open in which I was just about to complete an Amazon purchase of the current (greyscale) model for $99 + T-Mobile activation. Sure, there's always something better and cheaper on the way, but this might bet worth waiting for.
Any further info or pointers you can offer, Les?
Thanks</div>

<div class="content">Alas, I have no special knowledge toward the availability of a color HipTop - only the assumption that, by this time next year, there'll be color in them thar HipTops, or else.
I guess what I left out is that I had signed up for my 1 year Sprint contract within a week of the HipTop being released.  Grr.</div>
