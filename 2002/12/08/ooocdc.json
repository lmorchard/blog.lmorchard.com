I literally have a 2nd tab open in which I was just about to complete an Amazon purchase of the current (greyscale) model for $99 + T-Mobile activation. Sure, there&#39;s always something better and cheaper on the way, but this might bet worth waiting for.\n\nAny further info or pointers you can offer, Les?\n\nThanks</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221086712&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221086712&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-12-09T03:48:48&quot;&gt;2002-12-09T03:48:48&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Alas, I have no special knowledge toward the availability of a color HipTop - only the assumption that, by this time next year, there&#39;ll be color in them thar HipTops, or else.\n</code></pre><p>I guess what I left out is that I had signed up for my 1 year Sprint contract within a week of the HipTop being released.
