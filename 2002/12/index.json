It would be a web proxy, email filter, spam cop, a place for agents and schedule tasks to run and more. It would be responsible for both receiving and sending of information - as web pages, emails, web services requests, ftp file postings, etc. In the middle it would do analysis like for Spam or <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> autodiscovery, intelligent bookmark history, etc. ...  This sort of app would be for people like myself who spend an innordinate amount of time on the internet.</i></blockquote>Precisely.  Exactly.  Even down to the combination of P2P and desktop-to-server mix he writes about.  I think we&#39;re starting to ride a meme here.  This is what I want from a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy\">PersonalWebProxy</a>.  I&#39;ve been trying to think of a better name for this class of app - it&#39;s more than a literal web proxy.  I want an agent and an assistant - something that sits shotgun with me while I putter around and can help me study what I do and see.  I want something that can eventually do things in my name for me, if I allow it.  I want basically all the things Russell wants, along with everything agents do for the characters in David Brin&#39;s <i>Earth</i>.\n<br /><br />\nSo.  How to <strong>do</strong> this?  I think I need to spend some more time fleshing out a spec before I do much more in terms of putting gadgets together.  Need to reign in the fantasy, lay out some feasible first revision features, and start.  I want it all, but I want to start out with something hackable, useful, and inviting for collaboration.\n<br /><br />\nStill probably too early to be thinking about implementation language, but I have been experimenting and expect some of these things to become the base for my development.  My ideas on choices have become less clear-cut now.  When last <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000362.phtml\" target=\"_top\">I wrote</a> about this topic, and languages, <a href=\"http://www.ulaluma.com/pyx\" target=\"_top\">Donovan Preston</a> left a comment enlightening me with regards to my Python/Twisted vs Java/Threads consideration.  In fact, threads are available in the Python/Twisted environment as well.  So, now I&#39;m back to thinking about things like free library availability, environment maturity, possible collaborators, and my own comfort level in each.\n<br /><br />\nBah.  At this point, I think I know all I need to know about what various environment choices can do in order to come up with a set of features that can be reasonably implemented in either or any environment.  Need to solidify this wishlist into a task list and design and get going.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ooocff</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087249\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0114241/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=527a02c0012ff2583c9e8654cd2bd97c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0114241/\">Ray Grieselhuber</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087249\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-12-29T01:55:16\">2002-12-29T01:55:16</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">This, to me, is the next generation in portal server & web collaboration technology.

    "body": "<cite>Russell Beattie</cite> <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/index.jsp?date=20021227#160210\" target=\"_top\">writes</a>:<blockquote><i> The idea in my mind is for a project that would be a universal personal proxy (UPP) that sits between you and the internet. It would be a web proxy, email filter, spam cop, a place for agents and schedule tasks to run and more. It would be responsible for both receiving and sending of information - as web pages, emails, web services requests, ftp file postings, etc. In the middle it would do analysis like for Spam or <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> autodiscovery, intelligent bookmark history, etc. ...  This sort of app would be for people like myself who spend an innordinate amount of time on the internet.</i></blockquote>Precisely.  Exactly.  Even down to the combination of P2P and desktop-to-server mix he writes about.  I think we're starting to ride a meme here.  This is what I want from a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy\">PersonalWebProxy</a>.  I've been trying to think of a better name for this class of app - it's more than a literal web proxy.  I want an agent and an assistant - something that sits shotgun with me while I putter around and can help me study what I do and see.  I want something that can eventually do things in my name for me, if I allow it.  I want basically all the things Russell wants, along with everything agents do for the characters in David Brin's <i>Earth</i>.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo.  How to <strong>do</strong> this?  I think I need to spend some more time fleshing out a spec before I do much more in terms of putting gadgets together.  Need to reign in the fantasy, lay out some feasible first revision features, and start.  I want it all, but I want to start out with something hackable, useful, and inviting for collaboration.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nStill probably too early to be thinking about implementation language, but I have been experimenting and expect some of these things to become the base for my development.  My ideas on choices have become less clear-cut now.  When last <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000362.phtml\" target=\"_top\">I wrote</a> about this topic, and languages, <a href=\"http://www.ulaluma.com/pyx\" target=\"_top\">Donovan Preston</a> left a comment enlightening me with regards to my Python/Twisted vs Java/Threads consideration.  In fact, threads are available in the Python/Twisted environment as well.  So, now I'm back to thinking about things like free library availability, environment maturity, possible collaborators, and my own comfort level in each.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBah.  At this point, I think I know all I need to know about what various environment choices can do in order to come up with a set of features that can be reasonably implemented in either or any environment.  Need to solidify this wishlist into a task list and design and get going.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=ooocff\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087249\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0114241/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=527a02c0012ff2583c9e8654cd2bd97c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0114241/\">Ray Grieselhuber</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087249\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-12-29T01:55:16\">2002-12-29T01:55:16</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">This, to me, is the next generation in portal server & web collaboration technology.

It would be a web proxy, email filter, spam cop, a place for agents and schedule tasks to run and more. It would be responsible for both receiving and sending of information - as web pages, emails, web services requests, ftp file postings, etc. In the middle it would do analysis like for Spam or <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> autodiscovery, intelligent bookmark history, etc. ...  This sort of app would be for people like myself who spend an innordinate amount of time on the internet.</i></blockquote>Precisely.  Exactly.  Even down to the combination of P2P and desktop-to-server mix he writes about.  I think we&apos;re starting to ride a meme here.  This is what I want from a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy\">PersonalWebProxy</a>.  I&apos;ve been trying to think of a better name for this class of app - it&apos;s more than a literal web proxy.  I want an agent and an assistant - something that sits shotgun with me while I putter around and can help me study what I do and see.  I want something that can eventually do things in my name for me, if I allow it.  I want basically all the things Russell wants, along with everything agents do for the characters in David Brin&apos;s <i>Earth</i>.\n<br><br>\nSo.  How to <strong>do</strong> this?  I think I need to spend some more time fleshing out a spec before I do much more in terms of putting gadgets together.  Need to reign in the fantasy, lay out some feasible first revision features, and start.  I want it all, but I want to start out with something hackable, useful, and inviting for collaboration.\n<br><br>\nStill probably too early to be thinking about implementation language, but I have been experimenting and expect some of these things to become the base for my development.  My ideas on choices have become less clear-cut now.  When last <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000362.phtml\" target=\"_top\">I wrote</a> about this topic, and languages, <a href=\"http://www.ulaluma.com/pyx\" target=\"_top\">Donovan Preston</a> left a comment enlightening me with regards to my Python/Twisted vs Java/Threads consideration.  In fact, threads are available in the Python/Twisted environment as well.  So, now I&apos;m back to thinking about things like free library availability, environment maturity, possible collaborators, and my own comfort level in each.\n<br><br>\nBah.  At this point, I think I know all I need to know about what various environment choices can do in order to come up with a set of features that can be reasonably implemented in either or any environment.  Need to solidify this wishlist into a task list and design and get going.<p></p>\n"

Took about 15 min. for newsfeeds to be retrieved, OK, IE opens, outliner opens with all channels collapsed. Tried to expand, got an error on page message.\nSo, I figured I'd try another browser, I don't like IE anyway, so I opened Mozilla 1.2, copied in link, EveryThing Works Fine.\nIt looks great, now I know what everyone was raving about.

However, there's absolutely no reason you can't use threads if you continue with your Twisted implementation. Twisted fully supports the Half-Async/Half-Threaded design pattern. See twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorThreads for information.\nThe benefits of this design pattern are obvious. You get the speed advantages of the asynchronous bottom layer, which is already written, and the business logic code that runs in threads can be naive. Zope uses this design pattern to allow page assembly code to run synchronous db queries, xml-rpc queries, etc.\nEwan Grantham: You can help if this project is continued in Python; if you know Java, you're going to have no problem learning Python, and you're going to have tons of fun using it.\nPersonally, I am very interested in developing and using the PersonalWebProxy. The first thing I thought about writing was a look-ahead accellerator -- when you visit a page, the proxy fetches that page and all the pages that are linked from that page, so when you click a link the page is already downloaded.\nAnother thing I'd like is a permanent history. Whenever I use any browser to browse through the proxy, the PWP should keep track of where I have been, and allow me to review this history chronologically, and also perhaps automatically sort things by keyword. I'd also like this history to be (once I have set up PWP to do so) synchronized with a remote server, so for example, when I am browsing at home, my history file gets synchronized with my web host, and when I am browsing at work, the same history file on my web host is updated.\nSomething that goes along with this idea is a permanent bookmarks interface. Visiting the PWP application on a certain web port should show me a list of bookmarks and allow me to add to them, categorize them, etc. The big advantage here would be the syncronization I just talked about with my web host space. My bookmarks would then be available from any host on the internet; no matter what machine I am using (as long as I'm running PWP), my bookmarks would also be locally available.\nAnother idea I have been thinking about ever since you started talking about the PersonalWebProxy project is something like a mail proxy. The way it would work is, you would set up the PWP to connect to your mail account as a client. It would then download certain mail messages (more about that later) and re-serve them as a local mail server. You would then set up your email client to talk to the mail server running inside PWP. Thus, the same sort of transformation that occurs while you're browsing web pages occurs to your email.\nThe first thing I would do with this is set up the server only to download email from email addresses in a certain list. Then I would allow rules based sorting. Of course, this functionality is all present in a basic email client, but once you're relatively sure you're not downloading spam you can start doing more interesting things. (The idea of only downloading email messages from people in a list is similar to only accepting instant messages from people in your buddy list)\nSo things start to get more interesting: We index email for searching, and synchronize email with the email repository on my web host; we parse email messages from friends looking for URLs and have the web proxy immediately download the pages so they are on the hard drive for later, instant viewing; we can send ourselves commands in a simple command language from anything that can send email. Commands could be things like \"Bookmark this URL that I don't have time to look at right now\"; \"Delay delivery of this reminder until the event is near\"; etc.\nAnyway, this is all just wild pie-in-the-sky dreaming, which I don't normally do. But the prospects of improving our daily internet experience with these ideas, using an application built on Twisted, is very exciting, and very possible.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087188\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5a70d939a73fa73603f2a9255ab81d21&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">BillSeitz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087188\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-12-27T18:39:42\">2002-12-27T18:39:42</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I hear your conflict on the Python/Twisted thing.

A web proxy that can be proactive in constantly searching and updating information in various bins/areas of interest is certainly going to be helpful.\r\n\r\nFWIW,\r\nEwan</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087184\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.averagejackal.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8567583b271540e491e51e5f253e8252&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.averagejackal.net\">Mark M</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087184\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-12-23T18:37:15\">2002-12-23T18:37:15</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Do it in Java!

However, there's absolutely no reason you can't use threads if you continue with your Twisted implementation. Twisted fully supports the Half-Async/Half-Threaded design pattern. See twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorThreads for information.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of this design pattern are obvious. You get the speed advantages of the asynchronous bottom layer, which is already written, and the business logic code that runs in threads can be naive. Zope uses this design pattern to allow page assembly code to run synchronous db queries, xml-rpc queries, etc.\r\n\r\nEwan Grantham: You can help if this project is continued in Python; if you know Java, you're going to have no problem learning Python, and you're going to have tons of fun using it.\r\n \r\nPersonally, I am very interested in developing and using the PersonalWebProxy. The first thing I thought about writing was a look-ahead accellerator -- when you visit a page, the proxy fetches that page and all the pages that are linked from that page, so when you click a link the page is already downloaded.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I'd like is a permanent history. Whenever I use any browser to browse through the proxy, the PWP should keep track of where I have been, and allow me to review this history chronologically, and also perhaps automatically sort things by keyword. I'd also like this history to be (once I have set up PWP to do so) synchronized with a remote server, so for example, when I am browsing at home, my history file gets synchronized with my web host, and when I am browsing at work, the same history file on my web host is updated.\r\n\r\nSomething that goes along with this idea is a permanent bookmarks interface. Visiting the PWP application on a certain web port should show me a list of bookmarks and allow me to add to them, categorize them, etc. The big advantage here would be the syncronization I just talked about with my web host space. My bookmarks would then be available from any host on the internet; no matter what machine I am using (as long as I'm running PWP), my bookmarks would also be locally available.\r\n\r\nAnother idea I have been thinking about ever since you started talking about the PersonalWebProxy project is something like a mail proxy. The way it would work is, you would set up the PWP to connect to your mail account as a client. It would then download certain mail messages (more about that later) and re-serve them as a local mail server. You would then set up your email client to talk to the mail server running inside PWP. Thus, the same sort of transformation that occurs while you're browsing web pages occurs to your email.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I would do with this is set up the server only to download email from email addresses in a certain list. Then I would allow rules based sorting. Of course, this functionality is all present in a basic email client, but once you're relatively sure you're not downloading spam you can start doing more interesting things. (The idea of only downloading email messages from people in a list is similar to only accepting instant messages from people in your buddy list)\r\n\r\nSo things start to get more interesting: We index email for searching, and synchronize email with the email repository on my web host; we parse email messages from friends looking for URLs and have the web proxy immediately download the pages so they are on the hard drive for later, instant viewing; we can send ourselves commands in a simple command language from anything that can send email. Commands could be things like \"Bookmark this URL that I don't have time to look at right now\"; \"Delay delivery of this reminder until the event is near\"; etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is all just wild pie-in-the-sky dreaming, which I don't normally do. But the prospects of improving our daily internet experience with these ideas, using an application built on Twisted, is very exciting, and very possible.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087188\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5a70d939a73fa73603f2a9255ab81d21&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">BillSeitz</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087188\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-12-27T18:39:42\">2002-12-27T18:39:42</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I hear your conflict on the Python/Twisted thing.

For the most part, what he wants is what I want from my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy\">PersonalWebProxy</a>, and more.<br><br><br>\nThe big difference in the writing, though, is that Matt writes from features and what he wants, where I&apos;m already describing things in terms of implementation.  That is, I started talking about &quot;proxy&quot; where he&apos;s talking about &quot;my personal Google and Wayback machine&quot;.  I think looking at it that way makes a more compelling case for this thing being generally useful, rather than just some nerdy toy.\n<br><br>\nAnother way I&apos;m looking at this <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy\">PersonalWebProxy</a> is as an assistant in a sidecar attached to my browser.  I want this assistant to watch me, learn, and pipe up from time to time with suggestions.  I also want to be able to ask questions and to remind me of things I vaguely remember.  Eventually, I&apos;d like this assistant to be able to drive for me from time to time, doing some info hunter-gatherer work for me while I do other things.\n<br><br>\nI&apos;m still working on this thing.  So far I&apos;ve got a proxy in Python and a simple-minded plugin framework.  Two plugins so far: one is a cookie jar separated from any browser - that is, cookies are managed in the proxy, not in the browser; the other is a little thing based on Mark Pilgrim&apos;s <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/15.html\">rssfinder.py</a> that quietly seeks out and gathers <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> links from every text/* resource I view.  It seems to be standing up fairly well.\n<br><br>\nMy next steps are something along these lines:  Should I continue in Python?  To do so means delving deeper into Twisted, using their web app framework for the management UI and staying within their event-driven paradigm in lieu of threading.  The reason I first chose Python is because I wanted something that was quickly and easily hackable and fun to contribute plugins for.  Does this still apply, if things are deep in the Twisted mindset which is not <strong>quite</strong> straightforward?\n<br><br>\nOn the other hand, I took a peek at <a href=\"http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/\">Jetty</a> in Java, which also comes with a simple and hackable HTTP proxy implementation.  I could easily cobble together in Java what I have in Python using this.  I would also say that I could easily make it compatible with whatever plugins were written for the Python version, using Jython, but there&apos;s also a paradigmatic difference were I to go with Java:  Threads in lieu of event-driven design.\n<br><br>\nMaybe I&apos;m thinking too much about this and should just keep doing what I&apos;m doing.  I&apos;m trying to think and second guess a lot about what anyone who might care to play with this thing would actually care about.   As for myself, I seem to be having fun with things as is.</p>\n"

    "html": "<p>This week, at work, I cobbled together a hack for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> that hooks it up with an LDAP server for author accounts: <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableTypeLDAPAuthors\">MovableTypeLDAPAuthors</a>.  This is an early, early, early release of the thing, and is likely to do very nasty things for all that I know.  But, I wanted to share, and it seems to be working for the proof of concept at work (that is, MT weblogs on our intranet for every employee).  Hopefully soon it&#39;ll be approved, and I&#39;ll be looking into a commercial use license for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>.\n<br /><br />\nYou know, for all the praise I&#39;ve read about <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>, something I&#39;ve really not seen much attention toward is the code itself.  I mean, yeah this thing is great, and it&#39;s so simple to install and use by even non-techies.  But, under the hood, there&#39;re some nice things going on - like a very decent object persistence approach; templating for pretty strict code/presentation separation; a workable servlet-like app structure with facilities for localization and a dispatch-table approach to executing web app methods.  There are some spots that are a bit too if/else-ful for my taste, like the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/CMS\">CMS</a>&#39; edit_object() method, but hey, it works.\n<br /><br />\nIn other words, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> isn&#39;t just a cobbled together tangle of code that happens to produce weblogs.  I&#39;ve seen piles of well-used code on the web before that all seem to do what they advertise, but present a nightmare under the hood.  (<strong>cough</strong> Matt Wright&#39;s famous scripts <strong>cough</strong>)  No, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> looks like the result of experience, and I feel biased, because it demonstrates a lot of the same perl web app design patterns I&#39;ve been employing and advocating for years now.  So, my LDAP hack was a bit of enjoyable fun, instead of a chore.\n<br /><br />\nAlong the lines of what I&#39;d written last week <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000354.phtml\">about perfection versus good enough</a>, I think <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> is a good example.  It&#39;s something I <strong>could</strong> have written, but <strong>didn&#39;t</strong> write and <strong>didn&#39;t</strong> release and <strong>didn&#39;t</strong> support and <strong>didn&#39;t</strong> make lots of people happy along the way.

    "summary": "<p>So I&apos;m singing the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> praises at work today.  I&apos;ve gone through creating a very small proof-of-concept task tracking vocabulary in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a>.  Initially, it covers things such as clients, projects, tasks, workers, time card entries.  So far, I just have a vocabulary in RDFS and a sample load of data - both built by hand - but thanks to <a href=\"http://brownsauce.sourceforge.net\" target=\"_top\">the BrownSauce RDF browser</a>, I&apos;ve been able to show off some nifty things.  I know I&apos;ve linked to that project two days in a row now, but I think it was seeing things through that browser that finally turned the last tumbler in my mental lock on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a>.</p>\n<p>As a demo to co-workers, just clicking through the linked resources, I can show who&apos;s managing what projects, who&apos;s been assigned what tasks, what a given person has worked on, etc.  And I just keep drilling through links showing one view of relations after another.  It&apos;s fun.  Someone said it looks like how they breeze through data on fake computers in TV shows.</p>\n<p>Eventually what we want to do, if this proves to be useful, is expand this thing from just task tracking to slurp down more and more knowledge from around the organization and form a semantic intranet.  And, I think it can do it.  I just started getting <a href=\"http://www.hpl.hp.com/semweb/jena-top.html\" target=\"_top\">Jena</a> stashing statements into a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MySQL\">MySQL</a> database, so my next steps are to start actually working up an application around the data.</p>\n<p>So far so good.  I hope I&apos;m not insane to be thinking this is easy.  Waiting for the enthusiasm to calm down so I can realistically take account of what warts are to be found in the current state of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> art.</p>\n"

At the moment, it's not much code and is transparent except for the fact that it transforms every appearance of \"0xDECAFBAD\" on pages into \"0x31337D00D\".  What's exciting to me though, is that I tossed it together with an hour's hacking in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Python\">Python</a>, using the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Twisted\">Twisted</a> framework.

In particular, the <a href=\"http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/wbi/index.html\" target=\"_top\">WBI project</a> at IBM got me initially hooked on things.  I really thought it was nifty how they edited HTML on the fly to weave in the WBI UI and add indicators on links in the page.  And the idea of storing a history of one's web browsing in a local cache, available for review and later search, has always seemed incredibly attractive.</p>\n<p>Lately, I've been thinking of a few more things that might be useful in a personal web proxy:<br />\n<ul>\n<li> Marking pages to be periodically checked for change notification.<br />\n</li>\n<li> A browsing \"shopping cart\", in which to collect pages now for later browsing.<br />\n</li>\n<li> Auto-harvest <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF\">FOAF</a>, and whatever other associated page metadata that might be useful now or later.  Maybe suggest subscribing to the site after a few visits.<br />\n</li>\n<li> Use a ubiquitous rating mechanism, machine learning, and maybe some off-peak spidering to have new content of interest suggested.<br />\n</li>\n<li> Publish and share browsing patterns, generate \"Friends who viewed this page today also viewed this today...\"<br />\n</li>\n<li> Generate <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds for all notification features<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nAnd then, of course, there are things that I've seen already in other projects:<br />\n    * Rich browsing history<br />\n<ul>\n<li> Collaborative annotation<br />\n</li>\n<li> Ad filtering &amp; pop-up blocking<br />\n</li>\n<li> Content summarization<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nI'm thinking it would be nice to put together something like WBI and its modular API, maybe in Python, and make this thing super friendly to quick hacking.

I like to share differnt/funny/off beat links and it works fairly well for that, but the sorting/category system is too cumbersome for 'real' links. A proxy that might add headers (for quick insertion into the db) not to mention filtering and automatic google \"relating\" (I've been using that a lot recently) not too mentio a host of other things might be an elegant way to combine much, while requiring a minimal level of use i/o\nThanks for the idea....

I like to share differnt/funny/off beat links and it works fairly well for that, but the sorting/category system is too cumbersome for 'real' links. A proxy that might add headers (for quick insertion into the db) not to mention filtering and automatic google \"relating\" (I've been using that a lot recently) not too mentio a host of other things might be an elegant way to combine much, while requiring a minimal level of use i/o\r\n\r\nThanks for the idea....

Not a gigantic improvement, but it ends up being just enough to be nifty and was free to boot.  Also, I splurged a little bit before starting Christmas shopping, and replaced the 256MB of RAM with a 512MB module.  The improvement from 384MB to 640MB under <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOSX\">MacOSX</a> was much more marked than I&apos;d anticipated.  I don&apos;t know what kept me so long.</p>\n<p>So, my desires for a new iBook or a glitzy <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/TiBook?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">TiBook</font></span> are dampened for now, and my pocket book thanks me.  And, if/when I decide to toss this thing up onto eBay, the extras couldn&apos;t hurt the value.  Also, I imagine that my expectations of OS X will have set me up for amazement once I get to play with a machine that supports Quartz Extreme and has a more decent processor speed.</p>\n"

    "summary": "<p>Tonight, I was perplexed about a comment claiming to be from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner\">DaveWiner</a> - though it could just as easily be from an impostor - on the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000342.phtml\">final installment</a> of my extended <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> ramblings:</p><blockquote><i>Pretty arrogant if you ask me. What has LM Orchard contributed to the world? Add more value, less bluster and bullshit.</i></blockquote>I suppose I should have stopped while I was ahead, refraining from rambling on about my case study to begin with, let alone responding to this comment.  But, nonetheless I was bothered tonight, and responded:<blockquote><i>Your comment confuses me.<p></p>\n<p>I&apos;ve written that your work has helped me and given me food for thought - despite other disagreements I may have with you. And I&apos;ve written that a tool of yours I&apos;ve come to consider imperfect has, nonetheless, worked perfectly for me. These things remind me that I don&apos;t know it all and have much to learn and hash out. If this is bluster and bullshit, I certainly didn&apos;t intend it as such.</p>\n</i><p><i>As for my contributions and value - I&apos;d like to think I&apos;m doing something right in this field, given that I still have a well-paying job and a non-zero readership of my weblog.</i></p></blockquote>I <strong>was</strong> trying to give a compliment and a positive testimonial, while addressing some of the standard criticisms I&apos;d seen before.  And I wanted to back it up with my own experiences while tempering it with my admitted inexperience.<p></p>\n<p>But, after having had a decent dinner and a measure of time watching soap operas with my girlfriend on the couch, I&apos;ve decided that this is what tweaks me about the comment:  What&apos;s a weblog for, if it doesn&apos;t make room for arrogant bluster and bullshit?  My assumption in writing here is that I know enough or can figure enough out to write things valuable to <strong>someone</strong> - or at least, if I&apos;m wrong, I can still provide myself as a foil of ignorance to someone else&apos;s enlightenment.  </p>\n<p>Attacking the process, or the village idiot himself, is not constructive.</p>\n<p>Hope that helps.  Have a nice day.  Please drive through.</p>\n"

The spirit of it, in my mind, was mobile blogging.<p></p>\n<p>Then, I read about Moblogging and assume it&apos;s the same thing.  But, Bryce points out an important distinction that I think I get now.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlogWalking\">BlogWalking</a> is coming from one direction, trying to make the blog mobile.  Moblogging comes from the other direction, trying to make the mobile blogged.  </p>\n<p>I&apos;d off-handedly wondered what it would be like as a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlogWalker\">BlogWalker</a>, if I could add a camera, GPS device, temperature sensor, and other various things to a PDA loaded with blog software - I already have the blog, but I want to add multimedia to it.  Well, Mobloggers already have multimedia devices, with voice and imaging and more to come - they want to capture that content in a blog.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s a subtle difference, but somewhat important, I think.  And after experiences with my Treo, an admittedly underpowered device versus the Zaurus, I&apos;m leaning toward Moblogging.  Keep the blog software off the mobile device, but make the mobile device into a multimedia blogging terminal.  I think Moblogging is really the spirit of what I want from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlogWalking\">BlogWalking</a>.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m hoping for a color <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/HipTop\">HipTop</a> after my Sprint PCS contract is up.  The Treo has been nice to me, but it hasn&apos;t amazed me.  Although the grass is always greener, the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/HipTop\">HipTop</a> seem the more amazing device to me.</p>\n"

The question to which I <strong>don&apos;t</strong> have an answer is this:  How many developers&apos; problems fall into my kind of domain?</p>\n<p>Third and lastly, though I didn&apos;t get any flames for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> advocacy itself, I got a few private nastygrams flaming me for talking nice about <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner\">DaveWiner</a>&apos;s work after I&apos;d <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000278.phtml\">talked not so nice</a> about him some months ago.  With regard to that, I have to say that I&apos;m not on any particular crusade, other than for that which I find interesting.  That said, I dislike many things Dave does and says.  Though I&apos;d rather not add fuel to fires, I might fail to resist on occasion - as noted above.  However, I&apos;m not the guy who&apos;s going to change his ways, he obviously doesn&apos;t feel a need to change, and I frequently don&apos;t have all the facts anyway.  But I do like some of the guy&apos;s contributions to the world, so when occasion arises (as it did with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>), I&apos;ll say so.  In any case, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner\">DaveWiner</a> has given me much food for thought.<br>\n</p>\n"
