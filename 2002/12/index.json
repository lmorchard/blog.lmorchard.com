I get excited then I flip out because of how much something like this could entail and I find other stuff to do for a while to calm down.

Seeing what people are wishing for out of this class of app, we could wish it into the outer reaches of tinkerer feasibility and then get fed up and go home.  That's what I'd like to avoid, personally.\nI'm puttering around with a bit of a spec for myself today, laying out a limited wishlist drawn from mine and others' ponderings and rationing it out into chunks.  There's no way anyone could handle creating the perfect proxy/agent for the next millennia without descending into insanity and obscurity some 1% into the process.  But, if things can be worked out to where it's being cobbled together in a process of loosely structured madness, there just might be hope.\n\nThe crucial thing is that it move forward in tinkerer-sized steps, remain understood and tested at each point, and do some reasonably useful new thing after each lurch in order to remain interesting.  The process should give tinkerers a chance to spend just a little bit of their non-copious free time to come up with something clever and nifty.  This is how the lazyweb works.\n\nOkay, before I start getting too pretentious here, I'd better get back to work.",

It would be a web proxy, email filter, spam cop, a place for agents and schedule tasks to run and more. It would be responsible for both receiving and sending of information - as web pages, emails, web services requests, ftp file postings, etc. In the middle it would do analysis like for Spam or RSS autodiscovery, intelligent bookmark history, etc. ...  This sort of app would be for people like myself who spend an innordinate amount of time on the internet.Precisely.  Exactly.  Even down to the combination of P2P and desktop-to-server mix he writes about.  I think we're starting to ride a meme here.  This is what I want from a PersonalWebProxy.  I've been trying to think of a better name for this class of app - it's more than a literal web proxy.  I want an agent and an assistant - something that sits shotgun with me while I putter around and can help me study what I do and see.  I want something that can eventually do things in my name for me, if I allow it.  I want basically all the things Russell wants, along with everything agents do for the characters in David Brin's Earth.\n\nSo.  How to do this?  I think I need to spend some more time fleshing out a spec before I do much more in terms of putting gadgets together.  Need to reign in the fantasy, lay out some feasible first revision features, and start.  I want it all, but I want to start out with something hackable, useful, and inviting for collaboration.\n\nStill probably too early to be thinking about implementation language, but I have been experimenting and expect some of these things to become the base for my development.  My ideas on choices have become less clear-cut now.  When last I wrote about this topic, and languages, Donovan Preston left a comment enlightening me with regards to my Python/Twisted vs Java/Threads consideration.  In fact, threads are available in the Python/Twisted environment as well.  So, now I'm back to thinking about things like free library availability, environment maturity, possible collaborators, and my own comfort level in each.\n\nBah.  At this point, I think I know all I need to know about what various environment choices can do in order to come up with a set of features that can be reasonably implemented in either or any environment.  Need to solidify this wishlist into a task list and design and get going.",

I wasn't ready, back then, to read a document like the HTML spec.  But now, Mark Pilgrim makes me want to give it another serious shot, having leveraged the CITE tag in his weblog writing to pull a view of his entries by cited source.  He's good at sneaking in smarty-pants things like that - you probably never knew he was doing it, you think it's wonderful when later revealed later, and then you wish you'd done more homework.  Maybe \"you\" is just me.  :)  You think he plans these things in advance?  I want the Mark Pligrim syllabus.\n\nOf course, the problem with the way so many webmonkeys learned to apply some semblance of web standards was the web browser.  If it showed up nicely in the browser, it was Good.  If ugly, it was Bad.  If invisible or without apparent effect, it was Ignored.  And this mindset worked great for the busy page builder up till 4:30am trying to cobble together the latest brochureware site.\n\nBut now, after all the rushing around and recontextualization of business, it seems we're in the Winter season around here on the Internet.  Not so much new feverish development going on, but a lot of reexamination and introspection - and actual reading of specs.  And some really nifty things are going on, like the \"rediscovery\" of things that were there from the start but not too many people were careful enough to pick up on them at the ass crack of dawn while trying to launch another blight on the web.  (No I'm not bitter about those days at all - no wait, yes I am.  :) )\n\nSo, anyway, Mark Pilgrim wrote:  \"Let?s try pushing the envelope of what HTML is actually designed to do, before we get all hot and bothered trying to replace it, mmmkay?\"  I really like his point.  Now that we're done rushing around trying to solve the insane demands of the moment, or trying to \"add value\" for the stockholders, maybe we can do more mining into what's already out there that we all trampled and stampeded past in the early years.\n\nOr, rather, maybe I'm a \"we\" of few or one here, since obviously some people have already started mining the hills for neglected gems.",

After citing a very good perspective on software as gardening from The Pragmatic Programmer, he writes:As I've mentioned before there are a number of software development practices moving toward a more humane process. And I think the ideas underpinning worse-is-better play a big part in this. The major one in my mind is this hypothesis: there is no such thing as a perfect software design. Have you ever seen or heard of one? What design hasn't been modified over time due to changing needs or conditions?Good points.  Still trying to find the middle ground between clean design and fecund dirt.  There's no perfect design I've ever run into in my time so far, and I don't expect to.  But, what I have learned, is that where there is no design at all, you have disaster.\n\nSo I guess the main thing I've learned so far is that this guilty love of a dirty yet elegant hack while giving myself a \"tsk-tsk\" with a hope to design it more fully next time is useless.  There will be no time that I've participated in a design that ends up being marvelously perfect.  But what I'm trying to feel toward is how to get the balance right between clean and dirt, given skill levels and team sizes and project complexity.",

For the most part, what he wants is what I want from my PersonalWebProxy, and more.\nThe big difference in the writing, though, is that Matt writes from features and what he wants, where I'm already describing things in terms of implementation.  That is, I started talking about \"proxy\" where he's talking about \"my personal Google and Wayback machine\".  I think looking at it that way makes a more compelling case for this thing being generally useful, rather than just some nerdy toy.\n\nAnother way I'm looking at this PersonalWebProxy is as an assistant in a sidecar attached to my browser.  I want this assistant to watch me, learn, and pipe up from time to time with suggestions.  I also want to be able to ask questions and to remind me of things I vaguely remember.  Eventually, I'd like this assistant to be able to drive for me from time to time, doing some info hunter-gatherer work for me while I do other things.\n\nI'm still working on this thing.  So far I've got a proxy in Python and a simple-minded plugin framework.  Two plugins so far: one is a cookie jar separated from any browser - that is, cookies are managed in the proxy, not in the browser; the other is a little thing based on Mark Pilgrim's rssfinder.py that quietly seeks out and gathers RSS links from every text/* resource I view.  It seems to be standing up fairly well.\n\nMy next steps are something along these lines:  Should I continue in Python?  To do so means delving deeper into Twisted, using their web app framework for the management UI and staying within their event-driven paradigm in lieu of threading.  The reason I first chose Python is because I wanted something that was quickly and easily hackable and fun to contribute plugins for.  Does this still apply, if things are deep in the Twisted mindset which is not quite straightforward?\n\nOn the other hand, I took a peek at Jetty in Java, which also comes with a simple and hackable HTTP proxy implementation.  I could easily cobble together in Java what I have in Python using this.  I would also say that I could easily make it compatible with whatever plugins were written for the Python version, using Jython, but there's also a paradigmatic difference were I to go with Java:  Threads in lieu of event-driven design.\n\nMaybe I'm thinking too much about this and should just keep doing what I'm doing.  I'm trying to think and second guess a lot about what anyone who might care to play with this thing would actually care about.   As for myself, I seem to be having fun with things as is.",

    "summary": "This week, at work, I cobbled together a hack for MovableType that hooks it up with an LDAP server for author accounts: MovableTypeLDAPAuthors.  This is an early, early, early release of the thing, and is likely to do very nasty things for all that I know.  But, I wanted to share, and it seems to be working for the proof of concept at work (that is, MT weblogs on our intranet for every employee).  Hopefully soon it'll be approved, and I'll be looking into a commercial use license for MovableType.\n\nYou know, for all the praise I've read about MovableType, something I've really not seen much attention toward is the code itself.  I mean, yeah this thing is great, and it's so simple to install and use by even non-techies.  But, under the hood, there're some nice things going on - like a very decent object persistence approach; templating for pretty strict code/presentation separation; a workable servlet-like app structure with facilities for localization and a dispatch-table approach to executing web app methods.  There are some spots that are a bit too if/else-ful for my taste, like the CMS' edit_object() method, but hey, it works.\n\nIn other words, MovableType isn't just a cobbled together tangle of code that happens to produce weblogs.  I've seen piles of well-used code on the web before that all seem to do what they advertise, but present a nightmare under the hood.  (cough Matt Wright's famous scripts cough)  No, MovableType looks like the result of experience, and I feel biased, because it demonstrates a lot of the same perl web app design patterns I've been employing and advocating for years now.  So, my LDAP hack was a bit of enjoyable fun, instead of a chore.\n\nAlong the lines of what I'd written last week about perfection versus good enough, I think MovableType is a good example.  It's something I could have written, but didn't write and didn't release and didn't support and didn't make lots of people happy along the way.  All the did-nots are the important bit.  It's why I have two projects dead (Iaijutsu and Iaido) after a few years' effort, and MovableType is a gigantic success today.\n\nSo, these are the kind of lessons that  are an important part of what this weblog is about for me.",

I remove the in-proxy decompression, things are fine.  Put it back in, things get cut short.  I poke for a few hours at various bits and parts, to no avail.  \nThen, finally I remember...  \"Hey, you know, I think browsers pay attention to that Content-Length header.  And hey, you know...  decompressed content is larger than compressed content.\"  Bingo.  Problem solved by keeping the Content-Length header updated with the length of modified content.  This makes me feel very dumb, because it's not like I haven't written a handful or two both of HTTP clients and servers.  And I've written code that uses the Content-Length header, over and over again.  I'd've thought this would be something I'd remember more quickly.\nMore often than I'd like to admit, remembering simple and obvious things like the above are what unlock problems that I'd been banging my head against.  The last revelation of this nature I had while frustrated at a project at work was:  \"Not all months are 31 days.\"  And before that, \"Not all days in a year are 24 hours long, due daylight savings time.\"\nTrying to think of more, but I thought I'd share.

    "summary": "I hadn't had a bon mot for it until yesterday, but I've been thinking about the concept of recombinant growth for awhile now and how it intersects with the LazyWeb / blogosphere.  \nIn particular, I've been thinking about design.  I'm of two minds.  As a perfectionist, I want sparkling gorgeous gems of elegance.  It feels so good to be playing with something polished that so obviously has been imbued with immense thought.  But, as a realist and a guy trying to make a living, I also appreciate adhoc rusty tools that still turn a screw.  The thing might fall down in some cases, but otherwise it's a pretty steady companion.\nLooking at it another way, though, many of those otherwise sparkling gems won't let me use them as a hammer the same way I misuse the screwdriver on occasion.  And oftimes, they don't have any control panels to open so I can reroute EPS conduits and exploit leaky abstractions.  And then, there's the problem domain: on what classes of nails is this hammer indented for use?  In one case, a particular hammer shines, in another, it leaves thumbs throbbing.\nI see infernos of flamewars start over principle, predictions of falling skies and doom doom doom.  (It's not maintainable!  It won't scale!  It'll be the end of the web!)  And then I see mischievous wizards and cantankerous veterans pull out a much-abused old standby and knock it out of the park.  (Only the feeble-minded need strong types!  Goto considered harmful - to you, maybe!)  And then, sometimes, when you're in the realm of recombinant growth and the lazyweb, what initially looks like a jumble of wrinkled paper takes one more origami fold and turns into a perfectly formed swan.  It gets confusing sometimes.\nSo anyway, this all leads up to my questions as a naive, wannabe computer scientist:  By what processes of design do we best facilitate recombinant growth?  How deeply and to what level of detail?  How dirty should it be, how unspecified or left with holes or shrugs?  (Plants need dirt to grow.)   How meticulously clean should it be?  (We don't want to attract any bugs.)  How much should be chalked up to bootstrapping, and how much should be wrangled and hogtied into perfect working order?\nI doubt that it there's a single fully valid answer to all this.  But, I'm always interested in any of the answers I find anyway.",

    "summary": "Another little train of thought, whose conclusion will probably be obvious to anyone:\nI wonder how hard it would be for me to make a little personal idea processor like Eastgate Tinderbox using RDF?  Very likely much harder than it was for its author to create the original - I'm by no means smarter than Mark Bernstein, and he's got years on me in developing tools like Tinderbox.  So why would I even consider rolling my own in this case?  Certainly not the price - for a tool like that, the price is a steal.\nNo, I think it's because I don't have full access to hack the thing, and it has a few itchy spots for me.  At least, that's the way it looked when I last tried a demo on MacOSX.  I wish I could fix them, and rolling my own is the best way I know for that.  And besides, I'm in a real RDF love fest lately.\nBut...  Is it really so bad as it is?  Bad enough to try to play catch up with what someone else has already devoted so much to?  Nope.  Bad idea.  Best to promote recombinant growth, and rephrase the question:  I wonder how long it would take me to get used to the tool's quirks as I percieve them, make suggestions to the author, and then use the extraordinary hackability already present in the tool to get it soaking in RDF?\nThis is a lesson that's taken me awhile to resign to learn, so I figured this would be a good exercise to document it.  And to think, I once spent a year or two trying to re-implement Zope, by myself, mostly in quiet, and with not much to show in the end.",

Initially, it covers things such as clients, projects, tasks, workers, time card entries.  So far, I just have a vocabulary in RDFS and a sample load of data - both built by hand - but thanks to the BrownSauce RDF browser, I've been able to show off some nifty things.  I know I've linked to that project two days in a row now, but I think it was seeing things through that browser that finally turned the last tumbler in my mental lock on RDF.\nAs a demo to co-workers, just clicking through the linked resources, I can show who's managing what projects, who's been assigned what tasks, what a given person has worked on, etc.  And I just keep drilling through links showing one view of relations after another.  It's fun.  Someone said it looks like how they breeze through data on fake computers in TV shows.\nEventually what we want to do, if this proves to be useful, is expand this thing from just task tracking to slurp down more and more knowledge from around the organization and form a semantic intranet.  And, I think it can do it.  I just started getting Jena stashing statements into a MySQL database, so my next steps are to start actually working up an application around the data.\nSo far so good.  I hope I'm not insane to be thinking this is easy.  Waiting for the enthusiasm to calm down so I can realistically take account of what warts are to be found in the current state of RDF art.",

What's exciting to me though, is that I tossed it together with an hour's hacking in Python, using the Twisted framework.  So, starting work in a language and framework both mostly new to me is fun.  Also, it's interesting to work in the event-driven style again, even though I still think I still want threads (see:  Blog:000090).  If I go to threads, I think I'd swap over to Java.\nI was tempted to start the thing in Perl, since I already know my way around the language, and I already know my way around POE, a major event-driven framework in that scene.  But, I've been programming in perl almost to the exclusion of other languages for a little over 10 years now, not counting some excursions into Java or assignments for college classes.  I think it's time to expand, and force my brane wider.  I've touched on this topic before, but it's been ages since I had any energy to devote to this place and its projects.\nAt least I didn't go completely apeshit and start this in Lisp or ?Scheme.  :)  Though I'd still like to make myself an assignment using one of those two, I'd like a few collaborators on this project at some point.

    "summary": "About the difference between BlogWalking and Moblogging, Bryce writes:Moblogging is about capturing the moment with multimedia.\nMoblogs exist in a seperate space from traditional weblogs, and that's where the disconnect with Blogwalking occurs.\nBlogwalking is about taking our weblogs with us.Originally, we'd written about BlogWalking as literally walking with your blog, publishing & management software and all installed on a mobile device.  The spirit of it, in my mind, was mobile blogging.\nThen, I read about Moblogging and assume it's the same thing.  But, Bryce points out an important distinction that I think I get now.  BlogWalking is coming from one direction, trying to make the blog mobile.  Moblogging comes from the other direction, trying to make the mobile blogged.  \nI'd off-handedly wondered what it would be like as a BlogWalker, if I could add a camera, GPS device, temperature sensor, and other various things to a PDA loaded with blog software - I already have the blog, but I want to add multimedia to it.  Well, Mobloggers already have multimedia devices, with voice and imaging and more to come - they want to capture that content in a blog.\nIt's a subtle difference, but somewhat important, I think.  And after experiences with my Treo, an admittedly underpowered device versus the Zaurus, I'm leaning toward Moblogging.  Keep the blog software off the mobile device, but make the mobile device into a multimedia blogging terminal.  I think Moblogging is really the spirit of what I want from BlogWalking.\nI'm hoping for a color HipTop after my Sprint PCS contract is up.  The Treo has been nice to me, but it hasn't amazed me.  Although the grass is always greener, the HipTop seem the more amazing device to me.",

    "summary": "Sheesh, have I rambled on forever about this or what?  I think it could have all been summed up so much more concisely, as Paul Prescod did for me:  \"For the 20% that XML-RPC solves, by all means use it!\"  With my case in particular, his 20% is 80% of my problem domain.\nI guess the vehemence and volume of my reaction, which surprises me now looking back, stems from three things:\nFirst, I've gotten used to seeing statements along the lines of \"XmlRpc and its ilk are complete and utter useless shite, will be the end of the web as we know it, and what kind of brane damage have you suffered to continue using it?\"  So, I fully expected to be smacked around for even vaguely hinting that I'd found, in my experience, that XmlRpc is extremely useful.  But, to the contrary, I got a very nice and thoughtful response from Paul Prescod and the flames never rose.  \nSecond, on the level where my purist perfectionist self sits, I've bought into the \"XmlRpc is shite\" meme.  So the fact that I do useful work with it from day to day introduces a bit of cognitive dissonance for me - how can it be complete shite if it's a money maker for me?  I've got to justify this to myself somehow.  Granted, there are warts in XmlRpc - but warts by what measure?  A measure of ideal perfection, or a measure of real world experience?  Well, what Paul gets across to me is that it's the latter, but my experience thus far is very much a small subset of the experiences of people who feel they need to go beyond XmlRpc.  My experience with my problems is valid, and XmlRpc is useful.  It's just that there's a larger domain for which XmlRpc falls down.\nThis, I think is the key:  XmlRpc is not complete shite.  It works just great for the right problems, which happen to be mine.  The question to which I don't have an answer is this:  How many developers' problems fall into my kind of domain?\nThird and lastly, though I didn't get any flames for XmlRpc advocacy itself, I got a few private nastygrams flaming me for talking nice about DaveWiner's work after I'd talked not so nice about him some months ago.  With regard to that, I have to say that I'm not on any particular crusade, other than for that which I find interesting.  That said, I dislike many things Dave does and says.  Though I'd rather not add fuel to fires, I might fail to resist on occasion - as noted above.  However, I'm not the guy who's going to change his ways, he obviously doesn't feel a need to change, and I frequently don't have all the facts anyway.  But I do like some of the guy's contributions to the world, so when occasion arises (as it did with XmlRpc), I'll say so.  In any case, DaveWiner has given me much food for thought.",

    "summary": "This really confuses me.  Seems that I've gotten 2 pieces of comment spam on one of my more visible blog entries (due to controversy) from back in September, More on the Monster Mash.  The first one expresses confusion, then links to something about zip codes, and links again to something about business plans.  The second one is apparently a strange flame at DaveWiner, then links to something about vehicle history reports.\n\nI'll likely delete these in a lil while, but it really confuses me.  Do things like this really bring in financial results to the spammers?  Random links in nonsensical comments and inappropriate flames?  Do they really have some metrics on this, before & after spam revenue results?  This, and other spam, is really seeming like superstition in pigeons, where various kinds of spam are tried and maybe money is made so more kinds of spam are tried until the oddest forms appear.\n\nI really do hope that, some day, the full fury of hell and recipients of spam scorned rain down on the heads of all those slimy bastards.",
