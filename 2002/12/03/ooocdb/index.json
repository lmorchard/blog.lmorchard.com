Well, what Paul gets across to me is that it's the latter, but my experience thus far is very much a small subset of the experiences of people who feel they need to go beyond <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>.  My experience with my problems is valid, and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> is useful.

With regard to that, I have to say that I'm not on any particular crusade, other than for that which I find interesting.  That said, I dislike many things Dave does and says.  Though I'd rather not add fuel to fires, I might fail to resist on occasion - as noted above.  However, I'm not the guy who's going to change his ways, he obviously doesn't feel a need to change, and I frequently don't have all the facts anyway.
