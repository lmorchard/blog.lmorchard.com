Most people would settle into a good book or maybe a James Bond marathon.  Instead, being thankful for unlimited data access and at least having a screen at which to stare (albeit tiny), you install LispMe and a handful of editors and tutorials in a sudden, inspired effort to a) learn a new language (Scheme) and b) write a news aggregator and blogging tool for PalmOS as your first project.  I mean, hey, LispMe has access to net sockets on PalmOS -  XmlRpc and REST, here we come!  Then, you go have Thanksgiving dinner, doze on your mother&amp;apos;s couch in a food coma, dream about hordes of attacking parentheses (too much Scheme and NetHack), and all but forget about the whole thing.
