<div class="content">I spent a while working on a system for PowerGen, a UK electricity company. Electricity is traded here in half hour slots and I reckon I spent about 25% of my time coding to cope with the time when there are 46 or 50 half hour slots in a day sometimes.
There were all sorts of calculations that needed to be done for the generators to do with ramping up and ramping down and changing output. The companies promised never to change anything during the autumn/fall clock change when we had a &quot;repeated&quot; hour.</div>
