I too would like to stop working in the tech industry and do something completely different. \nI started out geeked about the internet upon it's public release. I thought it would be cool to make a difference and come up with some really cool technologies, make new types of interactive gadgets and what not. But it is hard to do what you love when people (mostly the ++unsmart kind), business agendas and worst of all: politics; come into play.\nBy that point, it seems like your not doing what you love anymore, it becomes a compromise, \"Well at least I am in the field of work I love.\" But it seems for me, it's just so hard to put my whole heart into anymore. It doesn't continue to be a personally rewarding field as you progress. At least that is what I found in these past 6 or 7 years of doing this stuff professionally.\nMost CS people aren't going to be content to hack the same code forever and at the same pay rate, so you move on to the next thing, at least it's a new challenge, better pay and you might actually be geeked about the new challenge. Time passes, excitement subsides, the loop starts over again. Pretty soon, there is nowhere to go but management. Eek! Who wants that job, I want a job that requires me to think. I say that because if you had to deal with managers like many I have had, it clearly isn't a requirement. \nI agree, save money, quit work, watch management plea on their knees for you to stay, buy a farm, raise sheep and make sweaters. Just don't do any of that repulsive line dancing.\nOn another of your points, the graphics and multiplayer are what is better about Everquest versus rogue-like games. Well that and the dynamic content, and the variety of things you can pursue in game; like blacksmithing, tailoring, jewelry, baking, pottery, etc. If you&#8217;re a person that really gets into the role-playing aspect of a game, there is actually a role-playing only server in Everquest now, FirionaVie. It has an interesting set of additional rules that make it a bit more fun to play versus the standard servers or PvP. It's more Player versus the Elements, so it forces the social aspect.\nAnd since you seem to be a Mac person now, Everquest is coming out for OSX, though they will be separate from the PC users.\nIt may be possible to hack together a simple rogue-like interface for EQ, though completely blowing your EULA and having the possibility of getting banned. There are people who have macro programs out there that sit on top of the EQ client that can record any number of actions and run them, I don't see why one couldn't use those hooks directly to overlay the simpler interface. Though realistically, you probably don&#8217;t have enough screen area to hold the basic onscreen stuff you may need for grouping and what not.\nI wonder to what extent you extend the current EQ interface with the new XML driven interface.  You can completely customize and mod everything that you see onscreen, it's actually very slick. People have added in-game maps, timers, and new combined features. I wonder if it could even be done that way instead of violating the EULA. Probably not, but I wonder how far you could go with something like that.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086378\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=822e1d2cd4c92265d1abdc74fc88c0d9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Azinsuken</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086378\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-12-30T01:26:56\">2002-12-30T01:26:56</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Hello, i was browsing for hack programs for everquest (so i could report them) and for some reason this site came up are you hosting any everquest hacking downloads?</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

But it is hard to do what you love when people (mostly the ++unsmart kind), business agendas and worst of all: politics; come into play.\r\n\r\nBy that point, it seems like your not doing what you love anymore, it becomes a compromise, \"Well at least I am in the field of work I love.\" But it seems for me, it's just so hard to put my whole heart into anymore. It doesn't continue to be a personally rewarding field as you progress. At least that is what I found in these past 6 or 7 years of doing this stuff professionally.\r\n\r\nMost CS people aren't going to be content to hack the same code forever and at the same pay rate, so you move on to the next thing, at least it's a new challenge, better pay and you might actually be geeked about the new challenge. Time passes, excitement subsides, the loop starts over again. Pretty soon, there is nowhere to go but management. Eek! Who wants that job, I want a job that requires me to think. I say that because if you had to deal with managers like many I have had, it clearly isn't a requirement. \r\n\r\nI agree, save money, quit work, watch management plea on their knees for you to stay, buy a farm, raise sheep and make sweaters. Just don't do any of that repulsive line dancing.\r\n\r\nOn another of your points, the graphics and multiplayer are what is better about Everquest versus rogue-like games. Well that and the dynamic content, and the variety of things you can pursue in game; like blacksmithing, tailoring, jewelry, baking, pottery, etc. If you&#8217;re a person that really gets into the role-playing aspect of a game, there is actually a role-playing only server in Everquest now, FirionaVie. It has an interesting set of additional rules that make it a bit more fun to play versus the standard servers or PvP. It's more Player versus the Elements, so it forces the social aspect.\r\n\r\nAnd since you seem to be a Mac person now, Everquest is coming out for OSX, though they will be separate from the PC users.\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to hack together a simple rogue-like interface for EQ, though completely blowing your EULA and having the possibility of getting banned. There are people who have macro programs out there that sit on top of the EQ client that can record any number of actions and run them, I don't see why one couldn't use those hooks directly to overlay the simpler interface. Though realistically, you probably don&#8217;t have enough screen area to hold the basic onscreen stuff you may need for grouping and what not.\r\n\r\nI wonder to what extent you extend the current EQ interface with the new XML driven interface.  You can completely customize and mod everything that you see onscreen, it's actually very slick. People have added in-game maps, timers, and new combined features. I wonder if it could even be done that way instead of violating the EULA. Probably not, but I wonder how far you could go with something like that.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086378\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=822e1d2cd4c92265d1abdc74fc88c0d9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Azinsuken</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086378\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-12-30T01:26:56\">2002-12-30T01:26:56</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Hello, i was browsing for hack programs for everquest (so i could report them) and for some reason this site came up are you hosting any everquest hacking downloads?</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

First release of work project happens tomorrow, after which I hope to take a 4 day vacation to celebrate my and my girlfriend&apos;s birthday (Oct 24, same day).\n<br><br>\nSome revelations over the last few days:</p><ul><li>October is not 31 days long - it is 31 days and one hour long.</li><li>Java has a class to handle date manipulations that I forgot to use, for some reason - but now that I know about it, there&apos;s some major rearchitecting in store to use it.</li><li>I&apos;m tired of bar graphs, web server logs, and explaining how the tea leaves are read.</li><li>I like my new Treo Communicator - it is great for playing <a href=\"http://roguelike-palm.sourceforge.net/kMoria/index.php\">kMoria</a> (but not <a href=\"http://www.nethack.org\">NetHack</a>) and quickly SSH&apos;ing into a server from bed to restart a process about whose death I was paged on the same device.  (ooh, what if the pager message could contain a button to connect to the server crying wolf?)</li><li>I&apos;ve come to realize that I enjoy playing <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/NetHack\">NetHack</a> and kMoria between compile-and-test cycles at 3AM better than I ever enjoyed Everquest in quieter times.</li><li>On the drive home, as the sun was rising, I was trying to think of just what aspects of Everquest (beyond graphics and besides multiplayer) are better than the family of Rogue-like games.  And...  could someone hack together a Rogue-like UI with which one could play Everquest?</li><li>Also on the drive home, I was thinking that I&apos;d like to take a break from being a geek and a software architect altogether, and maybe raise sheep and make sweaters for awhile.  What do you think?</li><li>Hernias suck, and impending surgery is stress-inducing.</li></ul>Hopefully I&apos;ll be recovered and returned to the world after next week.  I&apos;ve been vaguely poking my head in and around the neighborhood, but with my iBook suffering from seizures and my brain feeling like an alien abduction aftermath, I&apos;ll have a lot of catching up to do.<p></p>\n",

I was thinking that, for the phone, I&#39;d get something small and sleek.  Something that would likely fall through the little hole I inevitably have in every pocket of every jacket and overcoat I own.  And I was thinking that eventually, I&#39;d procure a Sharp Zaurus to replace my PDA.

I had a service contract with Sprint yet to expire, and had heard decent things about the device.  And it turned out that I just didn&#39;t want to give up Palm OS quite yet, and all the other powerful phone-and-PDA combos were so hideously brick-like.  (I know, let&#39;s take a standard Pocket PC, and Krazy-Glue a speaker and a stubby antenna on top!  <a href=\"http://wapsight.com/info/2002/10/10/110227.html\">It&#39;ll look brilliant!</a>)  And along the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlogWalking\">BlogWalking</a> theme, among other things, it does wireless internet admirably well and for a price that I&#39;m not sweating too hard to pay.  The <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/HipTop\">HipTop</a> might&#39;ve done me better, but like I said: contract I&#39;m still stuck in, and Palm OS that I know how to hack.\n<br /><br />\nBefore I&#39;d gotten it, I obsessively poured over reviews.  One of the biggest horror story themes I caught was with getting the thing activated on Sprint&#39;s network, back in August.  Well, no sweat for me there.  I called up the activation number and was walked through the process by a very polite gentleman with a pleasant Indian accent whose phrases and reponses were so identically spoken that I thought I was speaking with a machine.

The new Treo was ringing and hitting Google within 10 minutes after I got off the call, despite his cautioning me that it might take upwards of 6 hours to get processed.\n<br /><br />\nOnce working, the earbud/mic supplied with the device worked very well.  Holding the thing up to my ear is nicer than one might expect when pressing a small slab to the side of one&#39;s face, but I&#39;ll probably use the earbud more.  Now if I only had an elegant way to stow and fetch the earbud on my person while I&#39;m out and about.  Unspooling that tangle is no way to quickly answer the phone.\n<br /><br />\nAs for applications, I had everything from my old Visor transferred in short order, including my body of data whose history went all the way back to my first blocky Palm Pilot.

I would miss the Palm OS platform, it having done alright by me for about 6 years now, but I wanted excitement! and adventure! and modernity!\n<br><br>\nWell, after long deliberation, I saw that <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/CompUSA?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">CompUSA</font></span> was having an 18-months same-as-cash promotion, so I finally dragged myself in there and purchased...  <a href=\"http://www1.sprintpcs.com/explore/PhonesAccessories/PhoneDetails.jsp?selectSkuId=treo300&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2421&amp;CURRENT_USER%3C%3EATR_SCID=ECOMM&amp;CURRENT_USER%3C%3EATR_PCode=None&amp;CURRENT_USER%3C%3EATR_cartState=group&amp;bmUID=1034793472298\">A Treo Communicator 300</a>.  \n<br><br>\nWhat can I say?  I had a service contract with Sprint yet to expire, and had heard decent things about the device.  And it turned out that I just didn&apos;t want to give up Palm OS quite yet, and all the other powerful phone-and-PDA combos were so hideously brick-like.  (I know, let&apos;s take a standard Pocket PC, and Krazy-Glue a speaker and a stubby antenna on top!  <a href=\"http://wapsight.com/info/2002/10/10/110227.html\">It&apos;ll look brilliant!</a>)  And along the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlogWalking\">BlogWalking</a> theme, among other things, it does wireless internet admirably well and for a price that I&apos;m not sweating too hard to pay.  The <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/HipTop\">HipTop</a> might&apos;ve done me better, but like I said: contract I&apos;m still stuck in, and Palm OS that I know how to hack.\n<br><br>\nBefore I&apos;d gotten it, I obsessively poured over reviews.  One of the biggest horror story themes I caught was with getting the thing activated on Sprint&apos;s network, back in August.  Well, no sweat for me there.  I called up the activation number and was walked through the process by a very polite gentleman with a pleasant Indian accent whose phrases and reponses were so identically spoken that I thought I was speaking with a machine.  (Am I looney, or had I read somewhere that many call centers were <a href=\"http://www.outsource2india.com/why_india/articles/call_centers_india.asp\">being outsourced to India</a> and lands abroad via some nice WAN technologies?)  The new Treo was ringing and hitting Google within 10 minutes after I got off the call, despite his cautioning me that it might take upwards of 6 hours to get processed.\n<br><br>\nOnce working, the earbud/mic supplied with the device worked very well.  Holding the thing up to my ear is nicer than one might expect when pressing a small slab to the side of one&apos;s face, but I&apos;ll probably use the earbud more.  Now if I only had an elegant way to stow and fetch the earbud on my person while I&apos;m out and about.  Unspooling that tangle is no way to quickly answer the phone.\n<br><br>\nAs for applications, I had everything from my old Visor transferred in short order, including my body of data whose history went all the way back to my first blocky Palm Pilot.  After that, I went out and snagged a large blob of net apps and synced them up.  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=6&amp;q=http://www.aol.com/aim/aim4palm.html&amp;e=653\">AIM</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pdaapps.com/TreoSmsApp/default.html\">SMS</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=2&amp;q=http://www.arthurian.nu/upirc/download.php3&amp;e=653\">IRC</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http://online.offshore.com.ai/~iang/TGssh/&amp;e=653\">SSH</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http://www.wind-junkie.de/PalmVNC/&amp;e=653\">VNC</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=2&amp;q=http://www.icq.com/download/installpalm.html&amp;e=653\">ICQ</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=5&amp;q=http://www.actualsoft.com/prod_mmpro_details.htm&amp;e=653\">email (via IMAP!)</a>, and most importantly Google via <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http://www.handspring.com/software/blazer_overview.jhtml&amp;e=653\">Blazer</a> all worked great.  (Although, you have to watch AIM.  It <a href=\"http://www.palmblvd.com/boards/Bugs/messages/923.html\">does nasty things</a> occasionally and seems to corrupt its databases, requiring a warm reboot, deletion, and reenabling of all your hacks and extensions.)\n<br><br>\nSo, shortly I&apos;ll be looking for a way to combine <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> or <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/OffNews?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">OffNews</font></span> with <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/Plucker?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">Plucker</font></span> to give me a way to package up and slurp down a day&apos;s reading like I used to do with <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/AvantGo?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">AvantGo</font></span>.  The funny thing, though, is I don&apos;t know whether a single package-and-sync of reading is enough in a day.  It used to be - I would slurp down News.com, Wired News, Slashdot, and a smattering of other sites and be set for the day.  But now, I check my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> at least 6-10 times a day.  Given that, and the fact that I do have a decent allowance for data per month, I may look at putting <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> out on my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies\">JohnCompanies</a> server and whip up a Blazer-friendly skin for it using some ideas from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> to hide redundant items and save me some bytes.\n<br><br>\nIt&apos;s such a difference now, using the Sprint data network with this slim and elegant little Treo, versus when I first bought a <a href=\"http://www.novatelwireless.com/palmtop/minstrel3.html\">Novatel Minstrel</a> for my Palm III and used it to vaguely, slowly, gradually poke around on the web with that solid brick of magic stuff.  I can&apos;t wait until all of this finally converges with affordable, socially inobtrusive wearables.\n<br><br>\nI also just got done reading another <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/VernorVinge\">VernorVinge</a> story, <a href=\"http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/ebook4380.htm\"><i>Fast Times at Fairmont High</i></a>.  I blame him for this.  I want display contact lenses, ubiquitous networking via computing clothes, consensual imagery overlayed across all I see.  I want twitch-speed access to searches so that I can pick up on the song or poem someone starts quoting, and complete the line for them.  I want to ping objects around me and have them respond with self-identification.  I want to <a href=\"http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/technology/fly-by-wire.html\">live-by-wire</a>.  But until then, I have a wireless net connection on my Treo with a keyboard that makes me look only slightly geeky when I type.  That, and a desire to get my butt back into school so that maybe I can get the credentials to climb my way into research with tech like this.</p>\n",

Yay!\n<br /><br />\nYet another demonstration to me that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000258.phtml#000258\">ideas are f&#39;ing worthless</a> and the making is what matters.  Lots of things I&#39;ve been <strong>thinking</strong> about doing, but never get done.  (See also: <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000305.phtml\" title=\"Blog entry #000305\">Blog:000305</a>)  Just a few weeks ago, I managed to upgrade my referrer tracking to dig out the titles of referring pages.  And I&#39;ve had an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/recent_referers_rss.php\">RSS feed</a> of referrers myself for a few months now, but mine&#39;s been ugly as sin and so I&#39;ve kept it to myself.  So now I&#39;ll need to think in earnest about how to do some extraction of the link-surrounding excerpt in referring pages.  Mark&#39;s referrer handling really is elegant - it even seems to know how to collapse multiple views on the same referring entry (ie. front page, archive page, individual entry page).\n<br /><br />\nMore things to play with :)</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ooocof</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084395\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://diveintomark.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2aac8a68f46151f080ddb17ee0d2454e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://diveintomark.org/\">Mark Pilgrim</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084395\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-10-11T15:38:03\">2002-10-11T15:38:03</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Actually, it's even better than that.  I have a list of HTML tags that act as dividers: P, BR, HR, PRE, DIV, SPAN, TD, and a few others.  I grab the text surrounding the link, demarcated by any combination of these dividers.\nThere's some other wicked cool stuff in there too, like trying to guess permalinks (and getting it right about 80% of the time, and avoiding false positives the other 20%).  First it looks for trackback data; if found, that's golden.  Otherwise it looks for the last anchor (name or id attribute in any tag, not just A) before the start of the excerpt, then looks for the first link after the excerpt that contains that anchor.  This picks up the permalink on most blogs, since they include anchor tags before the entry named the same as the permalink (either the filename or the fragment).\nA concrete example (from your own home page): this post is preceded by an anchor \"\"\"[a name=\"000306\"][/a]\"\"\", and followed by a permalink \"\"\"[a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000306.phtml\"]11:16&nbsp;AM[/a]\"\"\".  See how they match?\nIt's not just A tags, though; some anchors are just an id attribute stuck on a div or h3 tag.  There are lots of variations.  Life is messy.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084397\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084397\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-10-11T16:20:29\">2002-10-11T16:20:29</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I just noticed the tag detection as I looked at the sample code you posted.

Lots of things I've been <strong>thinking</strong> about doing, but never get done.  (See also: <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000305.phtml\" title=\"Blog entry #000305\">Blog:000305</a>)  Just a few weeks ago, I managed to upgrade my referrer tracking to dig out the titles of referring pages.  And I've had an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/recent_referers_rss.php\">RSS feed</a> of referrers myself for a few months now, but mine's been ugly as sin and so I've kept it to myself.  So now I'll need to think in earnest about how to do some extraction of the link-surrounding excerpt in referring pages.  Mark's referrer handling really is elegant - it even seems to know how to collapse multiple views on the same referring entry (ie. front page, archive page, individual entry page).\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMore things to play with :)\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=ooocof\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084395\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://diveintomark.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2aac8a68f46151f080ddb17ee0d2454e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://diveintomark.org/\">Mark Pilgrim</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084395\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-10-11T15:38:03\">2002-10-11T15:38:03</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Actually, it's even better than that.  I have a list of HTML tags that act as dividers: P, BR, HR, PRE, DIV, SPAN, TD, and a few others.  I grab the text surrounding the link, demarcated by any combination of these dividers.\r\n\r\nThere's some other wicked cool stuff in there too, like trying to guess permalinks (and getting it right about 80% of the time, and avoiding false positives the other 20%).  First it looks for trackback data; if found, that's golden.  Otherwise it looks for the last anchor (name or id attribute in any tag, not just A) before the start of the excerpt, then looks for the first link after the excerpt that contains that anchor.  This picks up the permalink on most blogs, since they include anchor tags before the entry named the same as the permalink (either the filename or the fragment).\r\n\r\nA concrete example (from your own home page): this post is preceded by an anchor \"\"\"[a name=\"000306\"][/a]\"\"\", and followed by a permalink \"\"\"[a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000306.phtml\"]11:16&nbsp;AM[/a]\"\"\".  See how they match?\r\n\r\nIt's not just A tags, though; some anchors are just an id attribute stuck on a div or h3 tag.  There are lots of variations.  Life is messy.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084397\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084397\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-10-11T16:20:29\">2002-10-11T16:20:29</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I just noticed the tag detection as I looked at the sample code you posted.  Much more sophisticated than I'd initially thought.  :)  I forgot that Python has a useful SGML parser - I need to play with that more.  Usually I assume that I'm stuck in trial-and-error regex-land when I want to dig out some content from a given HTML page.\r\n\r\nAs for the permalink detection, yes I'd found some false positives from the start, but I was amazed at how many non-obvious ones it found.

You make me <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/01.html#there_are_four_lights\">cheer</a>, and you make me <a href=\"http://snowdeal.org/section/ex_machina/archives/2002_10_06_index.html#85536636\">cry</a>.\n<br><br>\nThis makes me think about being a bit more human in this space, along with being the tech obsessive here.  My <a href=\"http://deus-x.livejournal.com/\">LiveJournal</a> has caught most of my personal entries and rants, but maybe I&apos;ll finally merge the two.  Not that I&apos;ve had much time for writing lately, unfortunately, but it&apos;s heading toward colder and longer nights here, and I&apos;m sure the urge will strike.</p>\n",
