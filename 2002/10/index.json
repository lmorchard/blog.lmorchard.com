And...  could someone hack together a Rogue-like UI with which one could play Everquest?</li><li>Also on the drive home, I was thinking that I'd like to take a break from being a geek and a software architect altogether, and maybe raise sheep and make sweaters for awhile.  What do you think?</li><li>Hernias suck, and impending surgery is stress-inducing.</li></ul>Hopefully I'll be recovered and returned to the world after next week.  I've been vaguely poking my head in and around the neighborhood, but with my iBook suffering from seizures and my brain feeling like an alien abduction aftermath, I'll have a lot of catching up to do.<p></p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>So I finally broke down and bought a new gadget.  My phone was 5 years old and losing its antenna, and my Handspring Visor Deluxe (pre-ordered the day of introduction!) was showing its age.  I was thinking that, for the phone, I'd get something small and sleek.  Something that would likely fall through the little hole I inevitably have in every pocket of every jacket and overcoat I own.  And I was thinking that eventually, I'd procure a Sharp Zaurus to replace my PDA.  I would miss the Palm OS platform, it having done alright by me for about 6 years now, but I wanted excitement! and adventure! and modernity!\n<br><br>\nWell, after long deliberation, I saw that <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/CompUSA?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">CompUSA</font></span> was having an 18-months same-as-cash promotion, so I finally dragged myself in there and purchased...  <a href=\"http://www1.sprintpcs.com/explore/PhonesAccessories/PhoneDetails.jsp?selectSkuId=treo300&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2421&amp;CURRENT_USER%3C%3EATR_SCID=ECOMM&amp;CURRENT_USER%3C%3EATR_PCode=None&amp;CURRENT_USER%3C%3EATR_cartState=group&amp;bmUID=1034793472298\">A Treo Communicator 300</a>.<br><br><br>\nWhat can I say?  I had a service contract with Sprint yet to expire, and had heard decent things about the device.  And it turned out that I just didn't want to give up Palm OS quite yet, and all the other powerful phone-and-PDA combos were so hideously brick-like.  (I know, let's take a standard Pocket PC, and Krazy-Glue a speaker and a stubby antenna on top!  <a href=\"http://wapsight.com/info/2002/10/10/110227.html\">It'll look brilliant!</a>)  And along the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlogWalking\">BlogWalking</a> theme, among other things, it does wireless internet admirably well and for a price that I'm not sweating too hard to pay.  The <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/HipTop\">HipTop</a> might've done me better, but like I said: contract I'm still stuck in, and Palm OS that I know how to hack.\n<br><br>\nBefore I'd gotten it, I obsessively poured over reviews.  One of the biggest horror story themes I caught was with getting the thing activated on Sprint's network, back in August.  Well, no sweat for me there.  I called up the activation number and was walked through the process by a very polite gentleman with a pleasant Indian accent whose phrases and reponses were so identically spoken that I thought I was speaking with a machine.  (Am I looney, or had I read somewhere that many call centers were <a href=\"http://www.outsource2india.com/why_india/articles/call_centers_india.asp\">being outsourced to India</a> and lands abroad via some nice WAN technologies?)  The new Treo was ringing and hitting Google within 10 minutes after I got off the call, despite his cautioning me that it might take upwards of 6 hours to get processed.\n<br><br>\nOnce working, the earbud/mic supplied with the device worked very well.  Holding the thing up to my ear is nicer than one might expect when pressing a small slab to the side of one's face, but I'll probably use the earbud more.  Now if I only had an elegant way to stow and fetch the earbud on my person while I'm out and about.  Unspooling that tangle is no way to quickly answer the phone.\n<br><br>\nAs for applications, I had everything from my old Visor transferred in short order, including my body of data whose history went all the way back to my first blocky Palm Pilot.  After that, I went out and snagged a large blob of net apps and synced them up.  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=6&amp;q=http://www.aol.com/aim/aim4palm.html&amp;e=653\">AIM</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pdaapps.com/TreoSmsApp/default.html\">SMS</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=2&amp;q=http://www.arthurian.nu/upirc/download.php3&amp;e=653\">IRC</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http://online.offshore.com.ai/~iang/TGssh/&amp;e=653\">SSH</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http://www.wind-junkie.de/PalmVNC/&amp;e=653\">VNC</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=2&amp;q=http://www.icq.com/download/installpalm.html&amp;e=653\">ICQ</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=5&amp;q=http://www.actualsoft.com/prod_mmpro_details.htm&amp;e=653\">email (via IMAP!)</a>, and most importantly Google via <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http://www.handspring.com/software/blazer_overview.jhtml&amp;e=653\">Blazer</a> all worked great.  (Although, you have to watch AIM.  It <a href=\"http://www.palmblvd.com/boards/Bugs/messages/923.html\">does nasty things</a> occasionally and seems to corrupt its databases, requiring a warm reboot, deletion, and reenabling of all your hacks and extensions.)\n<br><br>\nSo, shortly I'll be looking for a way to combine <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> or <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/OffNews?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">OffNews</font></span> with <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/Plucker?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">Plucker</font></span> to give me a way to package up and slurp down a day's reading like I used to do with <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/AvantGo?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">AvantGo</font></span>.  The funny thing, though, is I don't know whether a single package-and-sync of reading is enough in a day.  It used to be - I would slurp down News.com, Wired News, Slashdot, and a smattering of other sites and be set for the day.  But now, I check my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> at least 6-10 times a day.  Given that, and the fact that I do have a decent allowance for data per month, I may look at putting <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> out on my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies\">JohnCompanies</a> server and whip up a Blazer-friendly skin for it using some ideas from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> to hide redundant items and save me some bytes.\n<br><br>\nIt's such a difference now, using the Sprint data network with this slim and elegant little Treo, versus when I first bought a <a href=\"http://www.novatelwireless.com/palmtop/minstrel3.html\">Novatel Minstrel</a> for my Palm III and used it to vaguely, slowly, gradually poke around on the web with that solid brick of magic stuff.  I can't wait until all of this finally converges with affordable, socially inobtrusive wearables.\n<br><br>\nI also just got done reading another <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/VernorVinge\">VernorVinge</a> story, <a href=\"http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/ebook4380.htm\"><i>Fast Times at Fairmont High</i></a>.  I blame him for this.  I want display contact lenses, ubiquitous networking via computing clothes, consensual imagery overlayed across all I see.  I want twitch-speed access to searches so that I can pick up on the song or poem someone starts quoting, and complete the line for them.  I want to ping objects around me and have them respond with self-identification.  I want to <a href=\"http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/technology/fly-by-wire.html\">live-by-wire</a>.  But until then, I have a wireless net connection on my Treo with a keyboard that makes me look only slightly geeky when I type.  That, and a desire to get my butt back into school so that maybe I can get the credentials to climb my way into research with tech like this.</p>\n",

Marc Barrot presents <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0104487/2002/10/10.html#a423\">Transclusion Breakthrough: The Endless Web Page.</a>  The post reads a bit like an <a href=\"http://grandpasgeneral.com/seamonk.html\">advert for Amazing Live Seamonkeys!</a>, but I think the enthusiasm is understandable:</p><blockquote><i>This is the </i><b>in-browser</b><i> version of what Dave Winer and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> created for Radio's outliner.\n<br><br>\nThis is </i><b>instant rendering</b><i>, happening on the fly as you browse through the current page. It is totally recursive: try clicking on the 'endless web page' node that appears under my name in the demo page.</i></blockquote>Now, I'd like to dissect and figure this out, and add it to my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> hack so that I can stop loading 5MB (!!!) of HTML every time I reload the page.  Beyond that, I can see some very cool applications involving live data navigation and outline rendering and... yeah.  This is cool stuff.<p></p>\n",

I've been busy as hell these last weeks, for reasons personal and professional, but I wanted to take a second to say something:\n<br><br>\nThank you for writing.  You make me <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/01.html#there_are_four_lights\">cheer</a>, and you make me <a href=\"http://snowdeal.org/section/ex_machina/archives/2002_10_06_index.html#85536636\">cry</a>.\n<br><br>\nThis makes me think about being a bit more human in this space, along with being the tech obsessive here.  My <a href=\"http://deus-x.livejournal.com/\">LiveJournal</a> has caught most of my personal entries and rants, but maybe I'll finally merge the two.  Not that I've had much time for writing lately, unfortunately, but it's heading toward colder and longer nights here, and I'm sure the urge will strike.</p>\n",
