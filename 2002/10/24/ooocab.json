After too many lost days and nights with family and friends i finally went to work for my companies biggest client. We do manufacturing, we need computers, but its not like working for the software company. Its a balance.

I too would like to stop working in the tech industry and do something completely different. \n</code></pre><p>I started out geeked about the internet upon it&#39;s public release. I thought it would be cool to make a difference and come up with some really cool technologies, make new types of interactive gadgets and what not. But it is hard to do what you love when people (mostly the ++unsmart kind), business agendas and worst of all: politics; come into play.</p>\n<p>By that point, it seems like your not doing what you love anymore, it becomes a compromise, &quot;Well at least I am in the field of work I love.&quot; But it seems for me, it&#39;s just so hard to put my whole heart into anymore. It doesn&#39;t continue to be a personally rewarding field as you progress. At least that is what I found in these past 6 or 7 years of doing this stuff professionally.</p>\n<p>Most CS people aren&#39;t going to be content to hack the same code forever and at the same pay rate, so you move on to the next thing, at least it&#39;s a new challenge, better pay and you might actually be geeked about the new challenge. Time passes, excitement subsides, the loop starts over again. Pretty soon, there is nowhere to go but management. Eek! Who wants that job, I want a job that requires me to think. I say that because if you had to deal with managers like many I have had, it clearly isn&#39;t a requirement. </p>\n<p>I agree, save money, quit work, watch management plea on their knees for you to stay, buy a farm, raise sheep and make sweaters. Just don&#39;t do any of that repulsive line dancing.</p>\n<p>On another of your points, the graphics and multiplayer are what is better about Everquest versus rogue-like games. Well that and the dynamic content, and the variety of things you can pursue in game; like blacksmithing, tailoring, jewelry, baking, pottery, etc. If you&#8217;re a person that really gets into the role-playing aspect of a game, there is actually a role-playing only server in Everquest now, FirionaVie. It has an interesting set of additional rules that make it a bit more fun to play versus the standard servers or PvP. It&#39;s more Player versus the Elements, so it forces the social aspect.</p>\n<p>And since you seem to be a Mac person now, Everquest is coming out for OSX, though they will be separate from the PC users.</p>\n<p>It may be possible to hack together a simple rogue-like interface for EQ, though completely blowing your EULA and having the possibility of getting banned. There are people who have macro programs out there that sit on top of the EQ client that can record any number of actions and run them, I don&#39;t see why one couldn&#39;t use those hooks directly to overlay the simpler interface. Though realistically, you probably don&#8217;t have enough screen area to hold the basic onscreen stuff you may need for grouping and what not.</p>\n<p>I wonder to what extent you extend the current EQ interface with the new XML driven interface.  You can completely customize and mod everything that you see onscreen, it&#39;s actually very slick. People have added in-game maps, timers, and new combined features. I wonder if it could even be done that way instead of violating the EULA. Probably not, but I wonder how far you could go with something like that.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221086378&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=822e1d2cd4c92265d1abdc74fc88c0d9&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Azinsuken&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221086378&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-12-30T01:26:56&quot;&gt;2002-12-30T01:26:56&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Hello, i was browsing for hack programs for everquest (so i could report them) and for some reason this site came up are you hosting any everquest hacking downloads?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
