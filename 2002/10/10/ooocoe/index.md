Funny, I've just been toying around the last few weeks with doing just this, for <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines">AmphetaOutlines</a>, to cut down on the wodge of HTML it feeds the browser all at once.  Marc Barrot presents <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0104487/2002/10/10.html#a423">Transclusion Breakthrough: The Endless Web Page.</a>  The post reads a bit like an <a href="http://grandpasgeneral.com/seamonk.html">advert for Amazing Live Seamonkeys!</a>, but I think the enthusiasm is understandable:<blockquote><i>This is the </i><b>in-browser</b><i> version of what Dave Winer and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand">UserLand</a> created for Radio's outliner.
<br /><br />
This is </i><b>instant rendering</b><i>, happening on the fly as you browse through the current page. It is totally recursive: try clicking on the 'endless web page' node that appears under my name in the demo page.</i></blockquote>Now, I'd like to dissect and figure this out, and add it to my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines">AmphetaOutlines</a> hack so that I can stop loading 5MB (!!!) of HTML every time I reload the page.  Beyond that, I can see some very cool applications involving live data navigation and outline rendering and... yeah.  This is cool stuff.
