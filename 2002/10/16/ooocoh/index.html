        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;So I finally broke down and bought a new gadget.  My phone was 5 years old and losing its antenna, and my Handspring Visor Deluxe (pre-ordered the day of introduction!) was showing its age.  I was thinking that, for the phone, I&#39;d get something small and sleek.  Something that would likely fall through the little hole I inevitably have in every pocket of every jacket and overcoat I own.  And I was thinking that eventually, I&#39;d procure a Sharp Zaurus to replace my PDA.  I would miss the Palm OS platform, it having done alright by me for about 6 years now, but I wanted excitement! and adventure! and modernity!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Well, after long deliberation, I saw that &lt;span style=&quot;background : #FFFFCE;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/CompUSA?topicparent=Main.FilterData&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;CompUSA&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was having an 18-months same-as-cash promotion, so I finally dragged myself in there and purchased...  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.sprintpcs.com/explore/PhonesAccessories/PhoneDetails.jsp?selectSkuId=treo300&amp;amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2421&amp;amp;CURRENT_USER%3C%3EATR_SCID=ECOMM&amp;amp;CURRENT_USER%3C%3EATR_PCode=None&amp;amp;CURRENT_USER%3C%3EATR_cartState=group&amp;amp;bmUID=1034793472298&quot;&gt;A Treo Communicator 300&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What can I say?  I had a service contract with Sprint yet to expire, and had heard decent things about the device.  And it turned out that I just didn&#39;t want to give up Palm OS quite yet, and all the other powerful phone-and-PDA combos were so hideously brick-like.  (I know, let&#39;s take a standard Pocket PC, and Krazy-Glue a speaker and a stubby antenna on top!  &lt;a href=&quot;http://wapsight.com/info/2002/10/10/110227.html&quot;&gt;It&#39;ll look brilliant!&lt;/a&gt;)  And along the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlogWalking&quot;&gt;BlogWalking&lt;/a&gt; theme, among other things, it does wireless internet admirably well and for a price that I&#39;m not sweating too hard to pay.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/HipTop&quot;&gt;HipTop&lt;/a&gt; might&#39;ve done me better, but like I said: contract I&#39;m still stuck in, and Palm OS that I know how to hack.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Before I&#39;d gotten it, I obsessively poured over reviews.  One of the biggest horror story themes I caught was with getting the thing activated on Sprint&#39;s network, back in August.  Well, no sweat for me there.  I called up the activation number and was walked through the process by a very polite gentleman with a pleasant Indian accent whose phrases and reponses were so identically spoken that I thought I was speaking with a machine.  (Am I looney, or had I read somewhere that many call centers were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outsource2india.com/why_india/articles/call_centers_india.asp&quot;&gt;being outsourced to India&lt;/a&gt; and lands abroad via some nice WAN technologies?)  The new Treo was ringing and hitting Google within 10 minutes after I got off the call, despite his cautioning me that it might take upwards of 6 hours to get processed.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Once working, the earbud/mic supplied with the device worked very well.  Holding the thing up to my ear is nicer than one might expect when pressing a small slab to the side of one&#39;s face, but I&#39;ll probably use the earbud more.  Now if I only had an elegant way to stow and fetch the earbud on my person while I&#39;m out and about.  Unspooling that tangle is no way to quickly answer the phone.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As for applications, I had everything from my old Visor transferred in short order, including my body of data whose history went all the way back to my first blocky Palm Pilot.  After that, I went out and snagged a large blob of net apps and synced them up.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;amp;start=6&amp;amp;q=http://www.aol.com/aim/aim4palm.html&amp;amp;e=653&quot;&gt;AIM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pdaapps.com/TreoSmsApp/default.html&quot;&gt;SMS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;amp;start=2&amp;amp;q=http://www.arthurian.nu/upirc/download.php3&amp;amp;e=653&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;amp;start=1&amp;amp;q=http://online.offshore.com.ai/~iang/TGssh/&amp;amp;e=653&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;amp;start=1&amp;amp;q=http://www.wind-junkie.de/PalmVNC/&amp;amp;e=653&quot;&gt;VNC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;amp;start=2&amp;amp;q=http://www.icq.com/download/installpalm.html&amp;amp;e=653&quot;&gt;ICQ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;amp;start=5&amp;amp;q=http://www.actualsoft.com/prod_mmpro_details.htm&amp;amp;e=653&quot;&gt;email (via IMAP!)&lt;/a&gt;, and most importantly Google via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;amp;start=1&amp;amp;q=http://www.handspring.com/software/blazer_overview.jhtml&amp;amp;e=653&quot;&gt;Blazer&lt;/a&gt; all worked great.  (Although, you have to watch AIM.  It &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.palmblvd.com/boards/Bugs/messages/923.html&quot;&gt;does nasty things&lt;/a&gt; occasionally and seems to corrupt its databases, requiring a warm reboot, deletion, and reenabling of all your hacks and extensions.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, shortly I&#39;ll be looking for a way to combine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk&quot;&gt;AmphetaDesk&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;span style=&quot;background : #FFFFCE;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/OffNews?topicparent=Main.FilterData&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;OffNews&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;span style=&quot;background : #FFFFCE;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/Plucker?topicparent=Main.FilterData&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;Plucker&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to give me a way to package up and slurp down a day&#39;s reading like I used to do with &lt;span style=&quot;background : #FFFFCE;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/AvantGo?topicparent=Main.FilterData&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;AvantGo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  The funny thing, though, is I don&#39;t know whether a single package-and-sync of reading is enough in a day.  It used to be - I would slurp down News.com, Wired News, Slashdot, and a smattering of other sites and be set for the day.  But now, I check my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk&quot;&gt;AmphetaDesk&lt;/a&gt; at least 6-10 times a day.  Given that, and the fact that I do have a decent allowance for data per month, I may look at putting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk&quot;&gt;AmphetaDesk&lt;/a&gt; out on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies&quot;&gt;JohnCompanies&lt;/a&gt; server and whip up a Blazer-friendly skin for it using some ideas from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines&quot;&gt;AmphetaOutlines&lt;/a&gt; to hide redundant items and save me some bytes.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&#39;s such a difference now, using the Sprint data network with this slim and elegant little Treo, versus when I first bought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novatelwireless.com/palmtop/minstrel3.html&quot;&gt;Novatel Minstrel&lt;/a&gt; for my Palm III and used it to vaguely, slowly, gradually poke around on the web with that solid brick of magic stuff.  I can&#39;t wait until all of this finally converges with affordable, socially inobtrusive wearables.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I also just got done reading another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/VernorVinge&quot;&gt;VernorVinge&lt;/a&gt; story, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/ebook4380.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fast Times at Fairmont High&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  I blame him for this.  I want display contact lenses, ubiquitous networking via computing clothes, consensual imagery overlayed across all I see.  I want twitch-speed access to searches so that I can pick up on the song or poem someone starts quoting, and complete the line for them.  I want to ping objects around me and have them respond with self-identification.  I want to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/technology/fly-by-wire.html&quot;&gt;live-by-wire&lt;/a&gt;.  But until then, I have a wireless net connection on my Treo with a keyboard that makes me look only slightly geeky when I type.  That, and a desire to get my butt back into school so that maybe I can get the credentials to climb my way into research with tech like this.&lt;/p&gt;
