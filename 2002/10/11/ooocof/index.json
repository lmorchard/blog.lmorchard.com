I have a list of HTML tags that act as dividers: P, BR, HR, PRE, DIV, SPAN, TD, and a few others.

First it looks for trackback data; if found, that's golden.  Otherwise it looks for the last anchor (name or id attribute in any tag, not just A) before the start of the excerpt, then looks for the first link after the excerpt that contains that anchor.  This picks up the permalink on most blogs, since they include anchor tags before the entry named the same as the permalink (either the filename or the fragment).\nA concrete example (from your own home page): this post is preceded by an anchor \"\"\"[a name=\"000306\"][/a]\"\"\", and followed by a permalink \"\"\"[a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000306.phtml\"]11:16&nbsp;AM[/a]\"\"\".
