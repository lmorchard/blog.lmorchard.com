Still fighting my way through the following: <ul><li>iBook hard drive crash (it's still making that noise, though I thought I could cordon off the bad blocks)</li><li>subsequent email loss (tried to mail me in the last month?  try again, please?)</li><li>final sprint to the end of a work project</li><li>My girlfriend's moving in with me!</li><li>It's my birthday and her birthday (Oct 24th), and our dating anniversary (Oct 27th) (strange alignment, that)</li></ul>But, the work project's almost done.  Going on a vacation this week to celebrate the birthdays and anniversary.  And I'm not sure yet what to do with the iBook.  But!  I plan on torturing myself into prodigious amounts of writing again by having a go at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http://www.nanowrimo.com/&amp;e=653">NaNoWriMo</a>.
