I really need to look more into this FOAF thing over at rdfweb.org.\nOne project I've been mulling over is how to replace something like my user info page at LiveJournal with something web-wide and decentrallized.

    "summary": "Here I am, a Busy Developer trying to work his way up to being a real Computer Scientist.  In doing this, I subject myself to things like RPC vs REST.  I see apparently intelligent people vehemently disagreeing about something, I figure there's something to it.  This may be naive.  I hope that by hurting my brain with this noise, I might take some of the hunch out of my back that gets me just one more caveman level up the evolutionary chart.  I hope you all don't mind hearing my grunts and unks.\nDave linked to me with an Oy.  Was that from my quoting of a quoter quoting?  Or is that an Oy on this REST thing getting all outta hand? :) \nWell, here it goes again:  I found Gordon Weakleim linking to me from my referrers (yay for referrers!), where quotes someone on a discussion forum as having said \"REST, I'm afraid, is unlikely to get anywhere until it is presented in a more utilitarian fashion. It feels much too much like a philosophy or religion or something.\"  And I agree with this, too.  I got introduced to XML-RPC via simple toolkits and real problems solved with satisfaction, and I'm learning SOAP slowly the same way.  Gordon also captures some of my other sentiments.\nI think I get REST now.  Maybe.  Between my last post on REST and finally finding and reading Paul Prescod's \"REST and the Real World\", I feel somewhat illuminated.  \nI also feel very, very behind.  This has all probably been covered ad nauseum on mailing lists I haven't read yet, but this is what I thought on Paul's article:Using someone else's [RESTful] web service requires you to understand their data structures (XML vocabulary and links between documents). . . . RPC APIs merely hide the problem behind an extra layer of non-standardization. First you must figure out the method names available. Then you must still figure out the data structures that may be used as parameters. And then behind those data structures is the implicit data model of the web service.Hmm.  Yes, in an RPC API I have to supply my customer with my method definitions-- including their names, parameters, and return values.  This seems directly comparable to supplying my customer with all the URIs exposed by my app's resources, as well as the data structures used by them.\nHow are these cases so very different?There is no free lunch. The biggest problem most will have with REST is that it requires you to rethink your problem in terms of manipulations of addressable resources instead of method calls to a component.I don't want to rethink my problem, at least not without a clear payback.  When I first learned to rethink my problems in object oriented programming, I got immense payback.  I haven't seen the clear payback case for REST yet.  So far, it looks like an interesting abstraction with a lot of vagueries, name calling, and intimations of harm and danger.\nOf course you may actually implement it on the server side however you want. But the API you communicate to your clients should be in terms of HTTP manipulations on XML documents addressed by URIs, not in terms of method calls with parameters.My customer doesn't want to mess with this, and doesn't want to learn about it.\nYour customers may well prefer a component-based interface to a REST interface.Yup, they do.  My chances of altering their behavior is slim to none-- at least not without a clear case of payback to present.\nProgrammers are more used to APIs and APIs are better integrated into existing programming languages. For client-side programmers, REST is somewhat of a departure although for server-side programmers it is not much different than what they have been doing for the last several years, building web sites.The server-side programmers I work with have been building CGIs and various server-side things which treat URI's as mere gateways onto their applications.  REST is pretty different than what they've been doing for the last several years.\nREST is about imposing a programming discipline of many URIs and few methods. RPC allows you to structure your application however it feels best to you. Let it all hang out! If a particular problem can be solved with RPC, and future extensibility and security are not going to be issues for you, you should certainly use the looser approach.I still don't see the payoff of few methods with many resources versus many methods with few resources.  Either way, should I change my application in the future I'll need to supply my customer with new data descriptions, or with new method descriptions.  How does REST make me magically extensible?  Am I not seeing something?\nThe security angle I can sort of see, given the already built-in ability of web servers and firewalls to control HTTP methods and URI accesses.  But, most times I want my application to manage its security and access control, not the web server or firewall.  Maybe this is a flaw in my application.\nAnyway, the simplicity of REST feels like a possible elegance to me, which I like.  Elegance feels warm and fuzzy, not itchy.  XML-RPC is obviously a bit of a workable hack.  Being able to RESTfully reduce my app down to database-like access via a web of URI resources seems neat.  But, the whole REST thing feels like an inside-out turn of many things.  This is not useful to me unless I can find some abstraction or toolkit to help me wire my apps up to things in the REST way.  XML-RPC was quick for me to get hooked on, since it was a mostly drop-in solution with me writing only a few wrapper methods.\nNow that I understand REST better, I see that I could possibly do most of what I do with SOAP and XML-RPC in a RESTful manner with a bit of brain bending.  It reminds me of threaded versus async / event driven programming.  But I don't know why I should bother: I'm still looking for the payback of REST and I'm still looking for the danger inherent in the RPC model.",

    "summary": "Chris Heschong writes: Ken ?MacLeod notes that, in regards to REST, \"the only thing holding us back is a marshalling standard.\" I'd be a lot happier with REST implementations if this were the case.\n(Whew, I think I need a convention for quoting quoters.  Maybe a new language.  I seem to remember hearing on the Todd Mundt Show that the Turkish language has a facility for specifying whether something you're saying originates with you, or whether you heard it from someone else...)\nAnyway, since Ken ?MacLeod had taken the time to respond in some detail to a post I made asking about REST not too long ago, I thought I should come back around to it.\nSo I think my first confusion was with marshalling.  This is why I like XML-RPC:  I don't worry about much.  As a client, I give it a URL and a method name, and then throw a pile of parameters for the method at it.  As a server-side method, the server gives me parameters when it calls me, and I throw back a return value.  The server takes care of turning the XML into my arguments, and my return value to XML.\nIn all the languages I've worked with it in (ie. Perl, Python, ?UserTalk, and AppleScript), this works conveniently well.  I never actually pay much attention to the XML in XML-RPC.  So, I was very confused in reading a few things about REST and not seeing much mention of this, other than along the lines of \"Oh, well, you could go ahead and use XML-RPC libraries to build messages if you wanted to.\"  Which begged the question for me: Why not just go the whole hog and use XML-RPC?  (Or SOAP, for that matter, but that's another holy war I'm avoiding for the present context.)\nOkay, so REST isn't about marshalling parameters.  Then what is it about?  Well, I think a bit more reading and Ken's response to me have helped illuminate me a bit.\nThe REST point seems to me to be that all operations being attempted by Web Services can be distilled into a few actions:  retrieve, create, update, and delete.  REST says that these fundamentals are already defined as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, respectively.  I think.  Is this right?\nSo, I apply these verbs to URI nouns.  To concretize the concept:  I recently wrote & exposed an XML-RPC API to a scorekeeping component on one of our promotions.  Some of the methods of this API were along the lines of int points.get_points(string email), points.award_points(string email, int points), and points.create_points_account(string email).  To make myself a new account I'd call points.create_points_account(\"deus_x@pobox.com\") and then points.award_points(\"deus_x@pobox.com\", 100) to drop myself some points in the scoreboard.  Then, I would do points.get_points(\"deus_x@pobox.com\") to check my score.\nI'm afraid this example is too simple.  Jon Udell wrote that he wanted to see the \"stock quote example\" retired for being too simplistic to stress the technology in mental experiments.  Hmm.  Oh well, let's see where it goes.\nSo, if I were to RESTify the above example, would the sequence of things be like a POST, PUT, and GET, all to a URL that looks something like:\nhttp://myhost/promotion/players/deus_x@pobox.com/points\nWhereas POST does the account creation, PUT updates the points, and GET of course grabs the points total?\nOkay, maybe POST needs to post to .../players/deus_x@pobox.com with a request body specifying \"points\", to create the new URI?  The request body of the PUT should contain a points value -- positive for award, negative for debit?  And if the thing needed more complex data, I could use something like XML-RPC to encode a data structure as arguments, or as Chris Heschong wrote, use WDDX?\nDo I get it?  Hmm...  okay, have to run to a meeting, but I wanted to post this and see if anyone could give me feedback on my understanding.  I think I see how, if all resources are manipulatable in this manner, one could envision a more abstracted and uniform interface on web resources than a pile of published web services APIs.  But...  can it really be that abstracted?\nHmm.",

    "summary": "Playing with a range of news aggregators once more, since Radio UserLand is making me itchy again.  Pretty much the only ones I really like are Radio, AmphetaDesk, and sometimes Peerkat.\nFor the last week or so I've been mostly alternating between Radio and AmphetaDesk.  The difference in aggregation styles is interesting:  While Radio slices and dices and aggregates feeds by items and serves them up to me in an interwoven chronological order, AmphetaDesk serves my feeds up to me whole and in order of feed modification.  I'm not sure which I like more now.\nI like Radio's style, because I see what's new and only what's new.  Usually.  But, I like AmphetaDesk's style because I see everything, and have realized that I miss things with the rush of new items from all my feeds.  For instance, if someone posts something once per day, I'll likely miss it with Radio unless I check every hour.  But, with AmphetaDesk, I get to see what's new with every person or source whenever I check, and I only miss items if that feed has scrolled them off.\nShelley Powers of burningbird.net wrote a bit about the context destroying nature that RSS and aggregators have on weblogs.  I agree with her somewhat, in that pulling the words out of the surrounding context of the blog and its presentation and community has an altering effect, I wouldn't say that it destroys the weblog.\nFor me, when I see something on my news aggregator, it's as if I'm overhearing it from another room.  I don't get the whole context or see who else is listening or responding, but I hear the gist of something.  And, when subscribed to 100+ RSS feeds, it's like I'm floating in this Nth dimensional space where I can overhear voices from hundreds of rooms without being overwhelmed.  When something triggers some of my mental filters and watchwords, I click the link and delve deeper.\nThere's no way, without an aggregator, that I'd be able to track 100+ people and news sources in a day.  But, because I can, I've been able to learn and discover things and hear voices I never would have before.\nBut, I think the way AmphetaDesk merges these sources might be a nicer alternative.  By not chopping up the feeds, some intra-item context is maintained at least, so I can see developing trains of thought.\nOkay, must go back to work now.",

    "summary": "John Robb writes about the next generation of PCs and such:Here is how I think the battle will evolve in the next five to ten years:...\n1)  A home server.   This PC is always on and lives in a closet.  It serves multiple users that connect to it using mobile wireless screens and keyboards.  ...\n2) An extremely mobile PC ala OQO.  This PC will be attached to a single individual.  ...This sums up much of what I've been anticipating and have found myself building.\nIn the case of the home server, I have two of them actually.\nOne is a headless Linux box behind a cable modem that has accumulated all sorts of autonomous functions: it gathers my mail from various accounts into an IMAP server that I access from everywhere; before I was using Radio UserLand, it used to host all of my news aggregation hacks; it controls and monitors all the X10 devices in my apartment (though these are dwindling away); and until my radio reception got bad when I moved, it used to record radio shows for me using a D-Link USB FM radio.  I actually have a Mac at work that does that does that for me, and dumps the sound files to my server at home periodically.\nThe other \"home server\" is a PC running Win2K with an ATI Radeon All-in-Wonder card.  This machine is my PVR, recording to VCD the few TV shows I actually want to keep up with.  That ends up being about 12 VCDs a week, counting all the episodes of Buffy that I capture.  (Guilty pleasures.)  I keep dumping more and more hard drive space into this machine, and use it as a general apartment-wide file server, as well as a dumping ground for stuff from remote when I'm out yet have net access.  Occasionally I play Windows-based cames on the PC, but it mostly just sits there and does things.\nI would like to combine these boxes into one big Linux box connected wirelessly to my cable modem, sitting in my closet in my apartment, or if I had a house, across the basement from the water heater.  I want this home server to be in the same class of appliances as the furnace, washing machine, and water heater.  The only thing keeping me from dumping the Win2K PC is the PVR functionality I haven't bothered to try under Linux yet.\nIn the case of my extremely mobile PC... \nWell, I'm still in search of this, and the OQO looks very very attractive.  Lately, my mobile PC has been my iBook.  In most of my usual haunts (home, work, coffee shop), my iBook is present and tends to have net access.  I have scripts which auto launch some SSH tunnels back to my Linux server and mount shares on my Win2K box when I switch networks.  It usually works.  I have all my current developing projects on the thing, and I do news aggregation with Radio UserLand.  Occasionally at home, the iBook is what I have with me in the living room, so with the A/V cable I use the iBook to play internet radio on my living room stereo, or I stream movies over my LAN from Win2K PC in the other room.\nBut, what I really want is the Global from Earth: Final Conflict.  I can't find a link or direct info on the thing as used in the series, but it's an amazing fictional device.  Palm-sized with a pull-out screen, clips onto the belt.  Has world-wide satellite video phone, global positioning, and seemingly endless PDA capabilities.  I think I've even seen someone drop it into a cradle and pull up their work on a desktop PC.  I've at least seen some general scenes like: \"Hey, can you drop me a couple gig of that data onto my global so I can look at it later.\"  Seems to have ubiquitous net access, even in low earth orbit. :)\nBut until someone makes that, I'm going to eye that OQO up for awhile and see what people think.  $1000 seems like a sweet price if I can run *BSD or Linux on it.  Funny thing is, so far, I haven't spent very much money at all on all these things I have.  They've all been acquired used or on sale or for free.  Most all of it was cobbled together from scraps.\nLiving in the future is fun. :)",

    "summary": "So I'm starting to play with PHP and working on rewriting my Movable Type templates as *.phtml.\nHaving never really payed much attention to PHP, I'm amazed at how close it is to Perl (obviously on purpose) yet how much effort has been made to sand off the rough bits.  Not sure how much I like it yet, but at least it's a familiar tune they're playing.  The mildly annoying thing is that it's familiar, but there are just a few things I would habitually reach for in Perl that I haven't sussed out yet in PHP.  Like autovivifying data structures.  I abuse those constantly.  I really need to wean myself away from that, methinks.\nOne thing that I was pleasantly surprised to find is PEAR, \"a framework and distribution system for reusable PHP components\".  Hello, CPAN, my old friend. :)  Finding all kinds of things that are immediately useful, like a Cache I can use to more intelligently and easily do the output caching voodoo I do in the perl CGI widgets right now.  \nYou know, a lack of a centrallized CPAN-like system is what has kept me from leaving Perl for many other technologies.  I really wish Java (CJAN?) and Python (CPyAN?) had one supported by their respective communities.  It's just so nice to do a perl -MCPAN -e\"install Date::Parse\" and get what I need.  Maintaining CPAN bundles for my perl software is tasty, too.  Single-command installation of all my app's requirements, and sometimes I can roll it right into the app's installation itself.  Mmm.\nAnyway, it's nice (to say it again) to have a running personal site to tinker with, now that I've gotten off my butt and done it.  This laboratory is letting me manufacture reasons to play with tech I hadn't bothered with before.  \nI mean, I've used ASP and JSP, and for most of the things I've done, I've grown a severe dislike for them both.  I left the \"Hey, you've got HTML in my code!\" paradigm behind, wandered through that \"Hey, you've got code in my HTML\" model, and eventually settled on my standard pattern now:A central app logic controller takes in GET/POST data, dispatches to a method which processes the form data.  That method then constructs data structures, which are in turn passed through a template engine to be rendered by a pile of templates independent from the controller.This, along with some very special self-assembling component-based automation sauce, is the core of what my employer's offerings run on.  But, this has crystallized as a habit for me, and I've not even considered other possibilities for a long time.  This of course has made everything look like a nail for this hammer I have.  \nFor example, while PHP is not quite the right tool for the  things we're doing at my day job, it seems like a perfect option to quickly and easily replace SSI pages on my site with something meatier yet still simple to maintain and doesn't stink like ASP or JSP.  I've also been looking at Cocoon, which if I can ever quite get in a groove with it, looks like a highly refined instance of my standard hammer.\nAnd then there's Radio UserLand.  I love it and hate it.  The hate mostly comes from the slower iBook on which I run it, I think.  The bootstrappiness of it makes me itch sometimes, but other times that just makes it endearing.  The whole self-contained development biodome it represents is pretty sexy, too.  Speaking of autovivifying data structures...  I just have to love a system which has a live, manually tinkerable giant outline/hashtree for a persistence mechanism.\nNext, I really want to swing back around to playing with Flash.  Last time I did something major with it, I was making a game for my employer which really wanted to use web services but I hadn't known it yet.  The game worked pretty well, but I want to see what it can do since last we met.  First thing in mind that seems mildly nifty might be a slick, live updating lil \"Recent Visitors\" app for my front page.\nI'm really feeling what Jon Udell means when he writes about thinking by analogy.  It's also something one of my favorite Comp Sci professors harped on, with regards to what makes a Computer Programmer versus what makes a Computer Scientist.  A small part of his speech always pointed to the notion that a a programmer is almost always pragmatic, memorizing the patterns and greasy innards of whatever tool he or she uses daily.  On the other hand, the scientist is an explorer and finds joy in confusing him or herself by finding the universals and generalities across a range of tools.  In the end, the programmer becomes specialized in a limited domain, while the scientist knows can pick up just about anything that comes along.  And sometimes, many times, the scientist makes new tools for programmers to specialize on.  I want to be and am working toward being a scientist.\nMore soon.",

Auto-linkbacks are more about exploration and manufacturing serendipity. Must explore this further.\nThis is why I went bananas with the referral links everywhere.  Manufactured serendipity.  The referrals do something that a weblog's comment feature just doesn't do.  \nDave & the Userland crew often assert that weblogs are better than discussion groups, for various good reasons.  Radio UserLand shipped without a comment feature (although it has one now), which I assumed was because the UserLand opinion was that the convention to comment & respond to someone's weblog was to do it in your own weblog.\nThe big problem I see, though, is that you're in your own bubble.  If you have something to say about something I wrote, and you're not already in my RSS subscriptions, I'll never read you.  If I don't know you already, chances are that I may not come to be introduced to you.  The same goes for Instant Outlining.  While I appreciate the intentional nature of this tech, and its strengths in avoiding spam, I want to meet you half way.  I want to be surprised and have my ears get warm and turn red when you say something about me.\nReferral-driven linkbacks on all pages on my site do this.  If you post to your weblog and include a link to me, then I hear about it the first time someone traverses that link.  This, to me, is even better than the comment feature.  And, as Mark Pilgrim observes, this is better that a single referers page because these linkbacks appear in context.  The conversation is built up from links in place and on topic and where the action is.  To me, this is the two-way web really in action",

His examples did nifty things with a publicly available XSLT processor to use an XSL stylesheet at one URL and an XML document at another to produce a new document.\n\n\nSo, this is what I've been playing with a bit this week, expecially with GoogleToRSS and RssDisplay.  But, this is what the URL looks like when I string the two together (line wrapping forced):\n\nhttp://www.decafbad.com/web-services/url-based/rss_display.cgi?xml_img=htt\np://www.decafbad.com/images/tinyXML.jpg&src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.decafbad.com%\n2Fweb-services%2Furl-based%2Fgoogle_rss.cgi%3Fquery%3Dlink%3AXGnxCbayl9UC%\n3Awww.decafbad.com%2F%26title%3DLinks+to+0xDECAFBAD%26description%3DTop%25\n2010%2520Links%2520to%25200xDECAFBAD%26\n\n\nWhat a pain this was to build.  I had to make a little form in a throwaway page to trick my browser into doing the hard work.  I suppose I could make a lil utility script to do the meta character escaping more easily.  But, man, if people are already making fun of the punctuation and obfuscation possible in Perl, imagine what they'll say about scripts on the URL-line.  (Assuming I'm not missing reams of existing ridicule already. :) )\n\n\n\nJon does make a note of this little problem, but I'm thinking it's going to be what makes me wrap up my URL-as-command-line experiments.  What would this URL look like if it had 1 or 2 more levels of pipeline? \n\n\nI suppose I could, as he'd also mentioned, employ a few tricks like reducing script names and parameter names down to single characters, but then I'm sacrificing one of the virtues he'd mentioned: the human readable, self-documenting nature of URL-based services.  Well, that gets scrapped at the first layer of pipelined URL indirection with the escaping of URL meta characters.  Hmm...\n\n\n\nStill poking away at things, anyway.",

On the other hand, since those services aren't guaranteed to exist in the same way in every environment, you can argue that the scripting platform should be self sufficient even if that means reinventing wheels...This is something else I've been thinking about with regards to the PersonalServer / DesktopWebAppServer I want to put together.  Thing is, between the slice of a full peer I have at decafbad.com, and the full UNIX environments I have on my 2 linux boxen and one iBook, I have 90% of the environment I want already.\nI have databases, I have web and mail servers, I have WebDAV, and I have schedulers.  Should I just say to hell with it and get on with writing the top layer?  That is, the actual apps I want to run on this nifty personal server framework?  I have been so far, and calling it \"prototype\".  Telling myself that these little apps are just \"playing around\" for until I build a \"real\" desktop environment in which to host the apps.\nSo why reinvent all the wheels to which Jon refers?  Because they \"aren't guaranteed to exist in the same way in every environment\", and I would like to distribute and share my work to people who don't have a full peer, 2 linux boxen, and an iBook.  So, I'd like this stuff to be a simple little wrapped up package that's easy to drop in on a Win32 box.  Or a Linux box, or a Mac OS X box.  So, in order to make a cross-platform PersonalServer, I have to reinvent the wheels and create a run-time environment that itself runs on all platforms so that I don't have to modify the upper layers of the app.\nHmm...  Or, I could just get to work within the excellent environments I already have, screw reinventing wheels, and actually create some apps that would be worth making cross-platform on some later date.  :)  Because the longer I work on reinventing wheels, the fewer things I have that are really any fun to play with in the end.  \nBesides, who would I be kidding if I didn't admit that the stuff I'm playing with right now is for early adopters and AlphaGeeks?  So why waste a lot of time making a pretty box with a bow now?\nMacOsX exists, and RadioUserLand exists, so I might as well stand on their shoulders.

Not to be a dittohead in the Cult of UserLand, but they seem to be bearing this out.  RadioUserLand is so open and inviting for tinkering that I think most of what I'd want from an Open Source clone is already there.  \nHell, I even prefer MacOsX over Linux now.  Am I selling my hacker soul?  I don't think so.  :)\nOkay, okay, enough babbling.  I'll forget about writing my OS-within-an-OS for now and write the apps on top of it.",

    "summary": "Okay after the vote of confidence from Sam Ruby about my thinking out loud about a \"404 correction\" proxy server, I've been thinking more about writing a Radio-like desktop app server.  I want to do more than make a DesktopWebsite, though.  I want to make a full-blown PersonalServer app, capable of hosting things like a PersonalMailServer and a slew of other little local web services & etc.  I may end up giving up and working more within Radio, but as I noted before I have some issues with Radio's performance and stability, which though balanced by my appreciation of the elegance of the system, is being gradually outweighed by my fears of lock-in and pre-existing experience with other technologies.  \nThen again, this thing probably won't replace RadioUserLand for me.  I use it daily, I bought it, and it's not as exciting to reimplement what I already have.  Unless it is exciting.  Make any sense?\nSo, speaking of technologies... which ones should I use to start working on a personal server?  My main goals are mumbled over here.\nI've got a large amount of experience with Perl, and have written desktop apps with it for Mac OS X and Win32.  I'm having more fun with Python, however, and though I haven't written the same apps I imagine that it's on par with Perl.\nThe main thing I'm trying to decide right now is:  multi-threaded vs async/event-driven.\nSee, I need some sort of concurrency to handle multiple network server hits, multiple agents running, a scheduler, and whatever else wants to take up residence inside the PersonalServer.  RadioUserLand, of course, has all of this.\nI've worked a lot with POE in Perl to make some event-driven multitasking apps, a few servers (HTTP, FTP, NNTP, etc) and a few things to replace a fleet of forked scripts.  I've also started looking at Twisted in Python which I gather to be the analogous thing in their camp.  Not the same, but they both are using the same basic idea of event-driven programs.\nThe problem is that, to take code that you would have written for a forking or multi-threaded program, and make it play nice within the event-driven environment, there's a bit of re-think you need to do.  Loops need to be broken up into procedures, turned into self-running events, etc.\nHmm... trying to think of more re-think examples, but the main one I can think of is that long-running loops and processes need to be sliced and diced.  I seem to remember more pain than that.\nAnyway, I'd rather use threads.  In threads, there needs to be a bit of re-think too, in terms of protecting resources from concurrency, but at least the main logic of my code can remain straightforward.  Perl doesn't have threads that I want to touch yet.  Python has threads, but I'm not sure how kosher they are.  Of course, there's always Java, but I want to avoid Java I think.\nAnyone tuned in out there with any thoughts?  Mostly thinking out loud right now.",

Of course there are the non-web crossovers, like searching in AIM via googlematic, but this mostly makes me yawn.  Yes, its fun and geeky, but yawn.  This is not to say that the Google search API itself makes me yawn.\nWhat makes me yawn is anything that's just an alternative direct user interface on the service.  Search from my IDE while I program?  Eh, that's okay, but I could do that by just spawning a browser with a cooked URL and not have to re-engineer a UI do display the results.  Display some results of a canned search in my weblog?  Eh, that's cute, but I could do that with some simple HTML scraping and SSI, if I really really wanted to.  Yeah, I know the web service makes that somuch easier, but the thing it makes easier isn't something I was really interested in the first place.  Maybe I'm not interested because I don't get it yet, or maybe it really is just a novel triviality.\nNo, what will make my overhead lightbulb spark up are applications which involve indirection.  That is, some application which makes searches to answer some other question of mine.  Search results used to spawn further churning.  Or, search results as the result of churning.  Google's suggestions are intriguing: Auto-monitor the web for new information on a subject; Glean market research insights and trends over time; Invent a catchy online game.  But, these sound disappointingly close to a corp-speak shrug.  \nNot that this is unexpected or a bad thing or a statement of derision.  Their Alpha Geeks made the service available, and now its up to the world Alpha Geeks to turn it into magic.  I'm just waiting and thinking though...  the AG's are churning out all permutations of language bindings, alternative interfaces, and weavings of the service into other apps.  This is the first stage of play.  I don't know that I'll feel like playing much yet.  So I'll watch, and maybe tinker a bit, but mostly be thinking about what the next stage of play will become.",

But if anything like this bill ever actually passes, our entire society will instantly turn into Cuba after the embargo, where everybody holds on to their pre-2002 technology, fixing it up year after year, decade after decade, rather than pay for new crippled technology. (In Cuba I believe it was cars in particular; for us it would be computers.)Funny, I have been considering exactly this.  If all this DRM and \"Secure\" media gets legislated and forced upon the market, I'll likely not buy another electronic gadget for a long while, unless maybe it's a used pre-2002 device.  Those, however will probably top the $1000+ range on eBay, unless resale is outlawed as well.\nForcing copy protection and \"secure\" media and \"digital rights management\" onto the market is idiocy.  We don't want it.  Really.  It doesn't make anything nicer for us, no matter how much you use fuzzy happy words like \"secure\" (who's secure? me? nope. my investment in books, music, and movies goes down the drain).\nAnd the stupid horror of it is... this will kill the market for technology toys dead.  The current offering of electronic gadgetry is pretty nifty already.  PCs are pretty damn fast now.  I doubt the majority of people have outstripped the capabilities of the things they own now, if they have bought a PC, mp3 player, CD/DVD burner, PVR, or digital camera recently.  If it turns out that all new stuff past a certain point has inconveniences and copy protection and requires more money to run and etc..  well, then I think people might just settle for what they have awhile longer.  I really think that technolust and thirst for the next bigger and better thing will chill because it'd be more trouble than it's worth.\nMy faith in the intelligence of my fellow Americans, especially my elected officials, is teetering now.  I've been pretty optimistic.  I thought they'd be smart enough to realize these things by now, I never thought they'd get this far.  But seeing that the RIAA, MPAA, and all the other money bloated fuckers are actually being taken seriously and not laughed off Capital Hill have me seriously worried.  The government got stolen a long time ago, and I never wanted to believe it.

I just can't see what's to exotic about what I'm doing in PipeFilters what would prepare me to think it would hobble Radio regularly.\nSometimes, when testing PipeFilters, RadioUserLand somehow manages to bring my iBook to such a grinding, HD thrashing halt, that the CPU Monitor no longer scrolls and I can't even get response from the Dock to kill Radio.  My only hope in this situation is to have a Terminal ready with a kill command typed out, launch the script in Radio that only sometimes offends, and then hit enter if things wig out, hoping that within the next 30-90 seconds the Terminal will be able to get a slice of time to eke out the kill command.\nPart of it might be the iBook itself.

Maybe this time I'll stop before I get to that point and adopt someone else's before I get down to wheel re-invention work.  :)  But it's so fun.\nAnyway, my latest tinkering with SSI can be seen on the right side of 0xDECAFBAD's front page:  Sibling blogs. \n \nSo far, I've got my LiveJournal blog over there, along with my RadioUserLand weblog.  Maybe in listing a few headlines over there, I can entice a few readers to my other spaces.  LiveJournal is where I do most of my general blogging, link posting, and general grousing.  (I think that's my new favorite word)  The RadioUserLand weblog is just an experiment at this point, but it may eventually consume the whole site.\nBasically, RadioUserLand is competing with server-side CGIs and SSIs at this point.  Eventually, they will cooperate.  After that, RadioUserLand may take over.\nAnyway, enjoy RssDisplay if you like-- you can either download it, or PipelineTheWeb and use it straight from my site.",

    "summary": "Via Eric Freeman's Radio Weblog:\nTim O'Reilly: So often, signs of the future are all around us, but it isn't until much later that most of the world realizes their significance. Meanwhile, the innovators who are busy inventing that future live in a world of their own. ... these are the folks I affectionately call \"the alpha geeks,\" the hackers who have such mastery of their tools that they \"roll their own\" when existing products don't give them what they need.\nThat's what I want to be when I grow up:  an alpha geek.\nWell, I already am an alpha geek, only just in fairly obscure circles.  Wherever I've worked, I've become the ToolBuilder.  I'm the guy who takes the stuff we have that never quite all works together, and I weld it together into some freakish kind of A-Team nightmare that lets the team crash through the brick walls.\nAnd here at my current job, I've worked at seeing how far I can take the ThirdTimeAutomate rule.  Where it's lead me (and this company) is to a component-based web application framework with automation support in building up the apps.\nI've gotten the system to the point that a Design Tech (HTML-guy) can crank out a dozen promotions with the system in a day, with a large degree of customization.  Occasionally, a Software Engineer may need to toss in an hour or two to write a custom component subclass or new component.\nThe components are built to be self-describing and, within certain circumstances, automatically collaborate.  We can mix & match promotion aspects and they'll work to integrate themselves.  The efficiency it's given us has allowed this company to survive the dot-com bust with a tiny number of employees and expense.  Now that business is actually picking up, productivity is still so high that we don't need many more people yet.  And it's kept me in a good job all through these rough times.\nIt's really good stuff, and I'm very proud of it.  In a way, it's the culmination of my last 8 years or so of work on the web.  The problem is...  This technology will likely never leave this company.  I've spent my past two years refining it, and it will probably never be seen outside the 2 dozen or so employees of this company, only 3-5 of whom really know what it's about.\nWhich brings me to things like this:Getting Noticed? from Eric Olsen (via Steve Ivy, et al.).  \"As the volume of blogs has ballooned well into six-figures, the need for links from ?star? blogs has become an absolute requirement to be noticed.\"\nBut I think this is how things go in the world in general.  It's a big, big place.  To be noticed in it takes some work.\nSo here I am, an alpha geek and a ToolBuilder spinning in my own circles, hope someday to have my name up in lights.  \n\n\nhttp://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ReleaseEarlyReleaseOften",
