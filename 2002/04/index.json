In doing this, I subject myself to things like RPC vs <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>.  I see apparently intelligent people vehemently disagreeing about something, I figure there's something to it.  This may be naive.  I hope that by hurting my brain with this noise, I might take some of the hunch out of my back that gets me just one more caveman level up the evolutionary chart.  I hope you all don't mind hearing my grunts and unks.</p>\n<p>Dave <a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/04/26#l8a0f5f3b2b135d1dfc731ae637ce8673\">linked to me</a> with an <i>Oy.</i>  Was that from my quoting of a quoter quoting?  Or is that an <i>Oy</i> on this <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> thing getting all outta hand? :) </p>\n<p>Well, here it goes again:  I found Gordon Weakleim linking to me from my referrers (yay for referrers!), where <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0106046/2002/04/26.html#a27\">quotes someone on a discussion forum</a> as having said \"REST, I'm afraid, is unlikely to get anywhere until it is presented in a more utilitarian fashion. It feels much too much like a philosophy or religion or something.\"  And I agree with this, too.  I got introduced to XML-RPC via simple toolkits and real problems solved with satisfaction, and I'm learning SOAP slowly the same way.  Gordon also captures some of my other sentiments.</p>\n<p>I think I get <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> now.  Maybe.  Between my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000127.shtml\">last post on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a></a> and finally finding and reading Paul Prescod's \"<a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/02/20/rest.html?page=1\">REST and the Real World</a>\", I feel somewhat illuminated.  </p>\n<p>I also feel very, very behind.  This has all probably been covered ad nauseum on mailing lists I haven't read yet, but this is what I thought on Paul's article:<blockquote><i>Using someone else's [RESTful] web service requires you to understand their data structures (XML vocabulary and links between documents). . . . RPC APIs merely hide the problem behind an extra layer of non-standardization. First you must figure out the method names available. Then you must still figure out the data structures that may be used as parameters. And then behind those data structures is the implicit data model of the web service.</i></blockquote>Hmm.  Yes, in an RPC API I have to supply my customer with my method definitions-- including their names, parameters, and return values.  This seems directly comparable to supplying my customer with all the URIs exposed by my app's resources, as well as the data structures used by them.</p>\n<p>How are these cases so very different?<blockquote><i>There is no free lunch. The biggest problem most will have with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> is that it requires you to rethink your problem in terms of manipulations of addressable resources instead of method calls to a component.</i></blockquote>I don't want to rethink my problem, at least not without a clear payback.  When I first learned to rethink my problems in object oriented programming, I got immense payback.  I haven't seen the clear payback case for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> yet.  So far, it looks like an interesting abstraction with a lot of vagueries, name calling, and intimations of harm and danger.</p>\n<blockquote><i>Of course you may actually implement it on the server side however you want. But the API you communicate to your clients should be in terms of HTTP manipulations on XML documents addressed by URIs, not in terms of method calls with parameters.</i></blockquote>My customer doesn't want to mess with this, and doesn't want to learn about it.\n<blockquote><i>Your customers may well prefer a component-based interface to a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> interface.</i></blockquote>Yup, they do.  My chances of altering their behavior is slim to none-- at least not without a clear case of payback to present.\n<blockquote><i>Programmers are more used to APIs and APIs are better integrated into existing programming languages. For client-side programmers, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> is somewhat of a departure although for server-side programmers it is not much different than what they have been doing for the last several years, building web sites.</i></blockquote>The server-side programmers I work with have been building CGIs and various server-side things which treat URI's as mere gateways onto their applications.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> is pretty different than what they've been doing for the last several years.\n<blockquote><i>REST is about imposing a programming discipline of many URIs and few methods. RPC allows you to structure your application however it feels best to you. Let it all hang out! If a particular problem can be solved with RPC, and future extensibility and security are not going to be issues for you, you should certainly use the looser approach.</i></blockquote>I still don't see the payoff of few methods with many resources versus many methods with few resources.  Either way, should I change my application in the future I'll need to supply my customer with new data descriptions, or with new method descriptions.  How does <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> make me magically extensible?  Am I not seeing something?\n<p>The security angle I can <i>sort of</i> see, given the already built-in ability of web servers and firewalls to control HTTP methods and URI accesses.  But, most times I want my application to manage its security and access control, not the web server or firewall.  Maybe this is a flaw in my application.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the simplicity of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> feels like a possible elegance to me, which I like.  Elegance feels warm and fuzzy, not itchy.  XML-RPC is obviously a bit of a workable hack.  Being able to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>fully reduce my app down to database-like access via a web of URI resources seems neat.  But, the whole <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> thing feels like an inside-out turn of many things.  This is not useful to me unless I can find some abstraction or toolkit to help me wire my apps up to things in the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> way.  XML-RPC was quick for me to get hooked on, since it was a mostly drop-in solution with me writing only a few wrapper methods.</p>\n<p>Now that I understand <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> better, I see that I could possibly do most of what I do with SOAP and XML-RPC in a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>ful manner with a bit of brain bending.  It reminds me of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000090.shtml#000090\">threaded versus async / event driven</a> programming.  But I don't know why I should bother: I'm still looking for the payback of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> and I'm still looking for the danger inherent in the RPC model.  </p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=oooabh\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086422\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://chris.wiw.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=41a3710dfca25cec2382a08ffb7cdba5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://chris.wiw.org/\">Christopher Heschong</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086422\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-29T18:56:25\">2002-04-29T18:56:25</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Dave's original post said something like: \"Oy, these weenies should stop talking and start writing scripts.\"</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

Maybe a new language.  I seem to remember hearing on the <a href=\"http://www.toddshow.org\">Todd Mundt Show</a> that the Turkish language has a facility for specifying whether something you're saying originates with you, or whether you heard it from someone else...)</p>\n<p>Anyway, since Ken <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/MacLeod?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">MacLeod</font></span> had taken the time to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000102.shtml\">respond in some detail</a> to a post I made asking about <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> not too long ago, I thought I should come back around to it.</p>\n<p>So I think my first confusion was with marshalling.  This is why I like XML-RPC:  I don't worry about much.  As a client, I give it a URL and a method name, and then throw a pile of parameters for the method at it.  As a server-side method, the server gives me parameters when it calls me, and I throw back a return value.  The server takes care of turning the XML into my arguments, and my return value to XML.</p>\n<p>In all the languages I've worked with it in (ie. Perl, Python, <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/UserTalk?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">UserTalk</font></span>, and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AppleScript\">AppleScript</a>), this works conveniently well.  I never actually pay much attention to the XML in XML-RPC.  So, I was very confused in reading a few things about <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> and not seeing much mention of this, other than along the lines of \"Oh, well, you could go ahead and use XML-RPC libraries to build messages if you wanted to.\"  Which begged the question for me: Why not just go the whole hog and use XML-RPC?  (Or SOAP, for that matter, but that's another holy war I'm avoiding for the present context.)</p>\n<p>Okay, so <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> isn't about marshalling parameters.  Then what is it about?  Well, I think a bit more reading and Ken's response to me have helped illuminate me a bit.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> point seems to me to be that all operations being attempted by Web Services can be distilled into a few actions:  retrieve, create, update, and delete.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> says that these fundamentals are already defined as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, respectively.  I think.  Is this right?</p>\n<p>So, I apply these verbs to URI nouns.  To concretize the concept:  I recently wrote &amp; exposed an XML-RPC API to a scorekeeping component on one of our promotions.  Some of the methods of this API were along the lines of <code>int points.get_points(string email)</code>, <code>points.award_points(string email, int points)</code>, and <code>points.create_points_account(string email)</code>.  To make myself a new account I'd call <code>points.create_points_account(\"deus_x@pobox.com\")</code> and then <code>points.award_points(\"deus_x@pobox.com\", 100)</code> to drop myself some points in the scoreboard.  Then, I would do <code>points.get_points(\"deus_x@pobox.com\")</code> to check my score.</p>\n<p>I'm afraid this example is too simple.  Jon Udell <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100887/2002/02/24.html#a92\">wrote</a> that he wanted to see the \"stock quote example\" retired for being too simplistic to stress the technology in mental experiments.  Hmm.  Oh well, let's see where it goes.</p>\n<p>So, if I were to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>ify the above example, would the sequence of things be like a POST, PUT, and GET, all to a URL that looks something like:</p>\n<p><code>http://myhost/promotion/players/deus_x@pobox.com/points</code></p>\n<p>Whereas POST does the account creation, PUT updates the points, and GET of course grabs the points total?</p>\n<p>Okay, maybe POST needs to post to <code>.../players/deus_x@pobox.com</code> with a request body specifying \"points\", to create the new URI?  The request body of the PUT should contain a points value -- positive for award, negative for debit?  And if the thing needed more complex data, I could use something like XML-RPC to encode a data structure as arguments, or as <a href=\"http://chris.wiw.org/2002/04/26.html#a16\">Chris Heschong</a> wrote, use <a href=\"http://www.openwddx.org/\">WDDX</a>?</p>\n<p>Do I get it?  Hmm...  okay, have to run to a meeting, but I wanted to post this and see if anyone could give me feedback on my understanding.  I think I see how, if all resources are manipulatable in this manner, one could envision a more abstracted and uniform interface on web resources than a pile of published web services APIs.  But...  can it really be that abstracted?</p>\n<p>Hmm.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=oooabg\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085579\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=989c4ddf929db7556b199fedf7d9a405&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">pb</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085579\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-26T18:14:55\">2002-04-26T18:14:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Why not POST/GET requests with key=value pairs as a response.

I kind of drifted away from it after not too long, but got interested in wikis again after I saw a few more of them in action out there and read The Wiki Way.\nI liked UseModWiki for its simplicity.  And out of every wiki I've played with so far, I've liked UseModWiki's markup the best.  What I didn't like is that the wiki was in one monolithic script, and that modifications and \"plugins\" were just patches to the uber script.  This seemed very itchy to me, and I wanted modules and plugins so I could easily modify things and keep my mods clean and separate.\nSo I looked at TWiki again.  It's much more modular and geared toward plugins and drop-in mods.  And, it uses template files instead of HTML tangled up with the program code.  Well, sort of.  The more I played with it, the more I came to think that the modules weren't so clean yet, and the templates are a little screwy.  Eh, nothing's perfect.\nThen I started playing with Python and wandered through MoinMoin.  It seems fairly modular, and cleaner than TWiki.  It seems a little less powerful, but not by much.  And it looks like there's the beginnings of multiple output formats in MoinMoin, which is interesting to me because there's a push to try to get our wiki to produce DocBook at work.\nBut I'm starting to reconsider all of this and thinking of moving either to MoinMoin or UseModWiki.  I've found myself editing core TWiki code anyway, and so my mods are not so clean anymore.  This makes me remember what UseModWiki was like, and that monolithic script doesn't seem as bad to me now.  And I really dislike TWiki's markup.  UseModWiki seemed much more author-oriented whereas TWiki's somehow seems to want to look better as a text document.  Mainly my itch is with headers and lists.\nAs for MoinMoin, I'm not sure.  I need to play with it some more, though I seem to remember I had problems with its markup format as well.  And then there's that DocBook output push we've got at work which has me wanting to roll my own wiki-inspired system from scratch.\nIn the end, my issue is that I like wiki but I'm also trying to get a content management system out of it for free, and the two are not precisely the same thing.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083810\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SunirShah\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=959e33c2c9231c2cee8282e6192cdb4f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SunirShah\">Sunir Shah</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083810\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-26T04:30:23\">2002-04-26T04:30:23</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Most users of UseModWiki appreciate the monolithic file format because it's easy for them to configure. For non-programmers, the fewer parts the better. They're not going to patch the script at all.\nI argued with Cliff that the script itself needed to be modularized in some way because it was getting to become one gigantic spaghetti blob. My point was that for development it would be easier, even though for deployment we could repackage the entire program into one file anyway (because Perl is Light.)\nI tried to modularize it back then but I didn't get very far, but I understand the script better now. Eric and I are conspiring to do this because there is mounting pressure to make UseModWiki fit into existing weblog structures for one, and because it's a pain in the butt to patch the script as it stands. We might begin soon enough.\nHowever, I have little faith this will get very far either. For instance, in order to implement RSS, I rewrote the RecentChanges subroutine to take an set of lambdas. In the normal circumstance, these lambdas would emit HTML. In the new circumstance, they would emit RSS. These kinds of patches don't modularize well.\nThe generally philosophy for UseModWiki is in tension between simplicity and flexibility. I don't honestly believe a plug-in, module architecture like TWiki would be healthy for the development of the script. It's too complicated. If anything, I want to keep the system as simple as the original wiki, but with greater depth.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083811\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083811\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-26T10:26:57\">2002-04-26T10:26:57</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Yes, I can see the simplicity/flexibility tension.  It's in UseModWiki and all over the wiki world for that matter.\nAs for modularizing UseModWiki... This may actually be what you mean: you could work things such that during development, the script is broken up, and then another script is run which re-weaves everything into a single monolith for distribution.  Something ala literate programming and the weaver concept, but that's really different from the current state of things.\nOn the other hand, I've noticed that the mods I find myself wanting to do generally fall into two categories: new markup and new output styles.  \nIn the former, I keep leaning toward non-wiki-ish complexity-- seems sometimes I really want PHP in wiki.  Otherwise HTML is pretty much simple and covered by existing markup.  In the latter, I've managed to do this with either simple tweaks or external scripts which load in the UseModWiki script.  Though, emitting DocBook is something that would need quite a bit of work right now, maybe for good reason.  And in both cases, I find myself doing far fewer of either than I thought I would in the first place.\nBut, the simple tweaks can pile up as patches and monolithic scripts just disturb my software design sensibilities.  Of course, I keep leaning toward non-wiki things in wikis.  I'm all confused sometimes. :)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

In the new circumstance, they would emit RSS. These kinds of patches don't modularize well.\r\n\r\nThe generally philosophy for UseModWiki is in tension between simplicity and flexibility. I don't honestly believe a plug-in, module architecture like TWiki would be healthy for the development of the script. It's too complicated. If anything, I want to keep the system as simple as the original wiki, but with greater depth.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083811\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083811\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-26T10:26:57\">2002-04-26T10:26:57</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Yes, I can see the simplicity/flexibility tension.  It's in UseModWiki and all over the wiki world for that matter.\r\n\r\nAs for modularizing UseModWiki... This may actually be what you mean: you could work things such that during development, the script is broken up, and then another script is run which re-weaves everything into a single monolith for distribution.  Something ala literate programming and the weaver concept, but that's really different from the current state of things.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I've noticed that the mods I find myself wanting to do generally fall into two categories: new markup and new output styles.  \r\n\r\nIn the former, I keep leaning toward non-wiki-ish complexity-- seems sometimes I really want PHP in wiki.  Otherwise HTML is pretty much simple and covered by existing markup.  In the latter, I've managed to do this with either simple tweaks or external scripts which load in the UseModWiki script.  Though, emitting DocBook is something that would need quite a bit of work right now, maybe for good reason.  And in both cases, I find myself doing far fewer of either than I thought I would in the first place.\r\n\r\nBut, the simple tweaks can pile up as patches and monolithic scripts just disturb my software design sensibilities.  Of course, I keep leaning toward non-wiki things in wikis.  I'm all confused sometimes. :)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

I&apos;ve decided that ultimately I agree that <a href=\"http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?LoginsAreEvil\">LoginsAreEvil</a>.  I didn&apos;t <i>really</i> want to put up fences, or raise the laziness threshold.  I mostly wanted to identify people, but I was mistaken.  Now, I&apos;d rather <a href=\"http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?AvoidIllusion\">AvoidIllusion</a>.</p>\n<p>There still are a <i>few</i> fences, however.  My reasoning is that my use of this wiki slides into the realm of cheap content management, and I don&apos;t prefer public input on certain things.  A few pages are access controlled, such as the wiki&apos;s front page and my home page.  For this purpose, there&apos;s an alternate password-protected set of wiki commands.  The non-authenticated are under /twiki/bin whereas the authenticated set are at /twiki/sbin.  Just as easy as putting an &apos;s&apos; in the URL.</p>\n<p>Access to the authenticated commands doesn&apos;t necessarily mean you get to edit everything though. :)  That&apos;s access control for you.</p>\n<p>Eventually, maybe I&apos;ll drop the access controls too.  I was also thinking of moving out of TWiki for another wiki implementation like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MoinMoin\">MoinMoin</a>, too.  Still tinkering.</p>\n"

The Google principle: It doesn&apos;t matter where information is because I can get to it with a keystroke.<p></p>\n</i><p><i>So what is Zoe? Think about it as a sort of librarian, tirelessly, continuously, processing, slicing, indexing, organizing, your messages. The end result is this intertwingled web of information. Messages put in context. Your very own knowledge base accessible at your fingertip. No more &quot;attending to&quot; your messages. The messages organization is done automatically for you so as to not have the need to &quot;manage&quot; your email. Because once information is available at a keystroke, it doesn&apos;t matter in which folder you happened to file it two years ago. There is no folder. The information is always there. Accessible when you need it. In context.</i></p></blockquote><p></p>\n<p>Rock on!  I&apos;m either terribly unoriginal or my mind is being read or there&apos;s just a common Alpha Geek wavelength I&apos;m tuning into.  By the description, this is <b>precisely</b> what I wanted to do with a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalMailServer\">PersonalMailServer</a>.  Getting tired of making folders, filtering rules, and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalMailServer\">MailToRSS</a> needs a bit more work and tweaking to be really useful.  </p>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/zoe_info/Education6.html\">the FAQ</a>:</p><blockquote><i>Q: On which platform does ZO? run?<p></p>\n</i><p><i>A: ZO? has been known to run on the following &quot;platforms&quot;:<br>\n...<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOSX\">MacOSX</a> 10.1.4, jre 1.3.1, Mozilla 0.9.9<br>\n...</i></p></blockquote>Rock on.<blockquote><i>Q: How much does ZO? cost?<p></p>\n</i><p><i>A: ZO? is free of charge for personal usage.

That&apos;s no fun!  I want to play!  I don&apos;t see it within 5 minutes of installation, but I think this thing really really needs IMAP.  IMAP would rock for both message import and external mail client access.<p></p>\n<p>But, from the author&apos;s terse response to this question, I&apos;m imagining there are many who&apos;ve asked it and he&apos;s tired of answering why he&apos;s not being trendy :)  I guess I&apos;ll play and see what happens.</p>\n"

    "html": "<p>Playing with a range of news aggregators once more, since <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a></a> is making me itchy again.  Pretty much the only ones I really like are Radio, <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, and sometimes <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/python/peerkat/\">Peerkat</a>.</p>\n<p>For the last week or so I've been mostly alternating between Radio and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>.  The difference in aggregation styles is interesting:  While Radio slices and dices and aggregates feeds by items and serves them up to me in an interwoven chronological order, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> serves my feeds up to me whole and in order of feed modification.  I'm not sure which I like more now.</p>\n<p>I like Radio's style, because I see what's new and only what's new.  Usually.  But, I like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>'s style because I see everything, and have realized that I miss things with the rush of new items from all my feeds.  For instance, if someone posts something once per day, I'll likely miss it with Radio unless I check every hour.  But, with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, I get to see what's new with every <i>person</i> or <i>source</i> whenever I check, and I only miss items if that feed has scrolled them off.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.burningbird.net/weblog/2002_03_01_burningbird_archive.php#75003900\">Shelley Powers of burningbird.net</a> <a href=\"http://p2psmoke.org/distributed/rss.htm\">wrote a bit about</a> the context destroying nature that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> and aggregators have on weblogs.  I agree with her somewhat, in that pulling the words out of the surrounding context of the blog and its presentation and community has an altering effect, I wouldn't say that it destroys the weblog.</p>\n<p>For me, when I see something on my news aggregator, it's as if I'm overhearing it from another room.  I don't get the whole context or see who else is listening or responding, but I hear the gist of something.  And, when subscribed to 100+ <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds, it's like I'm floating in this Nth dimensional space where I can overhear voices from hundreds of rooms without being overwhelmed.  When something triggers some of my mental filters and watchwords, I click the link and delve deeper.</p>\n<p>There's no way, without an aggregator, that I'd be able to track 100+ people and news sources in a day.  But, because I can, I've been able to learn and discover things and hear voices I never would have before.</p>\n<p>But, I think the way <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> merges these sources might be a nicer alternative.  By not chopping up the feeds, some intra-item context is maintained at least, so I can see developing trains of thought.</p>\n<p>Okay, must go back to work now.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=oooaai\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089999\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e5f046c5b46cfb3ef1089da58b2a48bb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/\">Rael</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089999\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-24T19:21:30\">2002-04-24T19:21:30</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Howdy,\nIf you like (in any way ;-) Peerkat, you might want to take a gander at the dynamic duo of Blosxom (Weblog application) and Blagg (RSS Aggregator).\nRael</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090001\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090001\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-24T19:44:13\">2002-04-24T19:44:13</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Wow.

Another haiku of code :)\nTorturing blagg with my pile of subscriptions seems to have gone alright.  I need to tweak around with the templates for blosxom (Blog Some?) to make it more pleasant to visually scan.  Also need to tweak the max # of items on the page.  Maybe some sort of \"Next/Prev 20 items\" pagination would be nice.\nAlso, templatizing how blagg constructs posts from RSS items would be hot, too.\nFirst snag I see though, which you probably already know about, is the way blagg determines whether or not an item is new.  Blagg, of course, uses the title.  However, some of my feeds' items never have titles (ie. Radio UserLand peeps who haven't turned on titles), and others often have the same titles (ie. RSS feeds from wikis).\nI've been trying to figure out the best way to do this in general, and all my solutions keep ending up at a bruteforce MD5 of the whole item.  Of course, the problem in doing that in blagg is that MD5 doesn't come out of the box with perl in OS X, which kills the whole drag-n-drop installation theme.

Keen!  Something that would be nice, though, is if the RSS feed source could be separated from the post title and passed as a separate parameter to the post() sub of the plugin.  Then I could even do something like transform the source attribute into a category or something, should I make a metaWeblog API plugin.

Yeah, MD5 would be a little slow. Perhaps the filename could include a character length count, something like \"raelity.617.title\". That should cover Wiki changes (as a same count edit would be rare, I'd hope). That'd cover RU a bit too.\nSpeaking of which, I just sent Rael a Blaggplug that pings weblogs.com with an update of your blog.

    "body": "<p>Playing with a range of news aggregators once more, since <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a></a> is making me itchy again.  Pretty much the only ones I really like are Radio, <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, and sometimes <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/python/peerkat/\">Peerkat</a>.</p>\r\n<p>For the last week or so I've been mostly alternating between Radio and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>.  The difference in aggregation styles is interesting:  While Radio slices and dices and aggregates feeds by items and serves them up to me in an interwoven chronological order, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> serves my feeds up to me whole and in order of feed modification.  I'm not sure which I like more now.</p>\r\n<p>I like Radio's style, because I see what's new and only what's new.  Usually.  But, I like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>'s style because I see everything, and have realized that I miss things with the rush of new items from all my feeds.  For instance, if someone posts something once per day, I'll likely miss it with Radio unless I check every hour.  But, with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, I get to see what's new with every <i>person</i> or <i>source</i> whenever I check, and I only miss items if that feed has scrolled them off.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.burningbird.net/weblog/2002_03_01_burningbird_archive.php#75003900\">Shelley Powers of burningbird.net</a> <a href=\"http://p2psmoke.org/distributed/rss.htm\">wrote a bit about</a> the context destroying nature that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> and aggregators have on weblogs.  I agree with her somewhat, in that pulling the words out of the surrounding context of the blog and its presentation and community has an altering effect, I wouldn't say that it destroys the weblog.</p>\r\n<p>For me, when I see something on my news aggregator, it's as if I'm overhearing it from another room.  I don't get the whole context or see who else is listening or responding, but I hear the gist of something.  And, when subscribed to 100+ <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds, it's like I'm floating in this Nth dimensional space where I can overhear voices from hundreds of rooms without being overwhelmed.  When something triggers some of my mental filters and watchwords, I click the link and delve deeper.</p>\r\n<p>There's no way, without an aggregator, that I'd be able to track 100+ people and news sources in a day.  But, because I can, I've been able to learn and discover things and hear voices I never would have before.</p>\r\n<p>But, I think the way <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> merges these sources might be a nicer alternative.  By not chopping up the feeds, some intra-item context is maintained at least, so I can see developing trains of thought.</p>\r\n<p>Okay, must go back to work now.</p>\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=oooaai\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089999\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e5f046c5b46cfb3ef1089da58b2a48bb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/\">Rael</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089999\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-24T19:21:30\">2002-04-24T19:21:30</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Howdy,\r\n\r\nIf you like (in any way ;-) Peerkat, you might want to take a gander at the dynamic duo of Blosxom (Weblog application) and Blagg (RSS Aggregator).\r\n\r\nRael</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090001\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090001\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-24T19:44:13\">2002-04-24T19:44:13</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Wow.

Another haiku of code :)\r\n\r\nTorturing blagg with my pile of subscriptions seems to have gone alright.  I need to tweak around with the templates for blosxom (Blog Some?) to make it more pleasant to visually scan.  Also need to tweak the max # of items on the page.  Maybe some sort of \"Next/Prev 20 items\" pagination would be nice.\r\n\r\nAlso, templatizing how blagg constructs posts from RSS items would be hot, too.\r\n\r\nFirst snag I see though, which you probably already know about, is the way blagg determines whether or not an item is new.  Blagg, of course, uses the title.  However, some of my feeds' items never have titles (ie. Radio UserLand peeps who haven't turned on titles), and others often have the same titles (ie. RSS feeds from wikis).\r\n\r\nI've been trying to figure out the best way to do this in general, and all my solutions keep ending up at a bruteforce MD5 of the whole item.  Of course, the problem in doing that in blagg is that MD5 doesn't come out of the box with perl in OS X, which kills the whole drag-n-drop installation theme.  (Nevermind that MD5ing everything might be a tad slow.)\r\n\r\nHrm.  Still playing.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090016\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090016\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-25T12:45:12\">2002-04-25T12:45:12</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Oh yeah, and one other blagg thing:  I see the Blaggplugs.  Keen!  Something that would be nice, though, is if the RSS feed source could be separated from the post title and passed as a separate parameter to the post() sub of the plugin.  Then I could even do something like transform the source attribute into a category or something, should I make a metaWeblog API plugin.

Yeah, MD5 would be a little slow. Perhaps the filename could include a character length count, something like \"raelity.617.title\". That should cover Wiki changes (as a same count edit would be rare, I'd hope). That'd cover RU a bit too.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, I just sent Rael a Blaggplug that pings weblogs.com with an update of your blog.

    "summary": "<p>Playing with a range of news aggregators once more, since <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Radio </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> is making me itchy again.  Pretty much the only ones I really like are Radio, <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, and sometimes <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/python/peerkat/\">Peerkat</a>.</p>\n<p>For the last week or so I&apos;ve been mostly alternating between Radio and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>.  The difference in aggregation styles is interesting:  While Radio slices and dices and aggregates feeds by items and serves them up to me in an interwoven chronological order, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> serves my feeds up to me whole and in order of feed modification.  I&apos;m not sure which I like more now.</p>\n<p>I like Radio&apos;s style, because I see what&apos;s new and only what&apos;s new.  Usually.  But, I like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>&apos;s style because I see everything, and have realized that I miss things with the rush of new items from all my feeds.  For instance, if someone posts something once per day, I&apos;ll likely miss it with Radio unless I check every hour.  But, with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, I get to see what&apos;s new with every <i>person</i> or <i>source</i> whenever I check, and I only miss items if that feed has scrolled them off.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.burningbird.net/weblog/2002_03_01_burningbird_archive.php#75003900\">Shelley Powers of burningbird.net</a> <a href=\"http://p2psmoke.org/distributed/rss.htm\">wrote a bit about</a> the context destroying nature that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> and aggregators have on weblogs.  I agree with her somewhat, in that pulling the words out of the surrounding context of the blog and its presentation and community has an altering effect, I wouldn&apos;t say that it destroys the weblog.</p>\n<p>For me, when I see something on my news aggregator, it&apos;s as if I&apos;m overhearing it from another room.  I don&apos;t get the whole context or see who else is listening or responding, but I hear the gist of something.  And, when subscribed to 100+ <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds, it&apos;s like I&apos;m floating in this Nth dimensional space where I can overhear voices from hundreds of rooms without being overwhelmed.  When something triggers some of my mental filters and watchwords, I click the link and delve deeper.</p>\n<p>There&apos;s no way, without an aggregator, that I&apos;d be able to track 100+ people and news sources in a day.  But, because I can, I&apos;ve been able to learn and discover things and hear voices I never would have before.</p>\n<p>But, I think the way <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> merges these sources might be a nicer alternative.  By not chopping up the feeds, some intra-item context is maintained at least, so I can see developing trains of thought.</p>\n<p>Okay, must go back to work now.</p>\n"

I have scripts which auto launch some SSH tunnels back to my Linux server and mount shares on my Win2K box when I switch networks.  It usually works.  I have all my current developing projects on the thing, and I do news aggregation with Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>.  Occasionally at home, the iBook is what I have with me in the living room, so with the A/V cable I use the iBook to play internet radio on my living room stereo, or I stream movies over my LAN from Win2K PC in the other room.</p>\n<p>But, what I really want is the Global from <a href=\"http://www.efc.com\">Earth: Final Conflict</a>.  I can't find a link or direct info on the thing as used in the series, but it's an amazing fictional device.  Palm-sized with a pull-out screen, clips onto the belt.  Has world-wide satellite video phone, global positioning, and seemingly endless PDA capabilities.  I think I've even seen someone drop it into a cradle and pull up their work on a desktop PC.  I've at least seen some general scenes like: \"Hey, can you drop me a couple gig of that data onto my global so I can look at it later.\"  Seems to have ubiquitous net access, even in low earth orbit. :)</p>\n<p>But until someone makes that, I'm going to eye that OQO up for awhile and see what people think.  $1000 seems like a sweet price if I can run *BSD or Linux on it.  Funny thing is, so far, I haven't spent very much money at all on all these things I have.  They've all been acquired used or on sale or for free.  Most all of it was cobbled together from scraps.</p>\n<p>Living in the future is fun. :)</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=oooaag\n",

    "summary": "<p>John Robb <a href=\"http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/04/24.html#a1621\">writes about the next generation of PCs and such</a>:</p><blockquote><i>Here is how I think the battle will evolve in the next five to ten years:...<p></p>\n<p>1)  A home server.   This PC is always on and lives in a closet.  It serves multiple users that connect to it using mobile wireless screens and keyboards.  ...</p>\n</i><p><i>2) An extremely mobile PC ala OQO.  This PC will be attached to a single individual.  ...</i></p></blockquote>This sums up much of what I&apos;ve been anticipating and have found myself building.<p></p>\n<p>In the case of the home server, I have two of them actually.</p>\n<p>One is a headless Linux box behind a cable modem that has accumulated all sorts of autonomous functions: it gathers my mail from various accounts into an IMAP server that I access from everywhere; before I was using Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>, it used to host all of my news aggregation hacks; it controls and monitors all the X10 devices in my apartment (though these are dwindling away); and until my radio reception got bad when I moved, it used to record radio shows for me using a D-Link USB FM radio.  I actually have a Mac at work that does that does that for me, and dumps the sound files to my server at home periodically.</p>\n<p>The other &quot;home server&quot; is a PC running Win2K with an ATI Radeon All-in-Wonder card.  This machine is my PVR, recording to VCD the few TV shows I actually want to keep up with.  That ends up being about 12 VCDs a week, counting all the episodes of Buffy that I capture.  (Guilty pleasures.)  I keep dumping more and more hard drive space into this machine, and use it as a general apartment-wide file server, as well as a dumping ground for stuff from remote when I&apos;m out yet have net access.  Occasionally I play Windows-based cames on the PC, but it mostly just sits there and does things.</p>\n<p>I would like to combine these boxes into one big Linux box connected wirelessly to my cable modem, sitting in my closet in my apartment, or if I had a house, across the basement from the water heater.  I want this home server to be in the same class of appliances as the furnace, washing machine, and water heater.

Not sure how much I like it yet, but at least it's a familiar tune they're playing.  The mildly annoying thing is that it's familiar, but there are just a few things I would habitually reach for in Perl that I haven't sussed out yet in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a>.  Like autovivifying data structures.  I abuse those constantly.  I really need to wean myself away from that, methinks.</p>\n<p>One thing that I <i>was</i> pleasantly surprised to find is <a href=\"http://pear.php.net\">PEAR</a>, \"a framework and distribution system for reusable <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> components\".  Hello, <a href=\"http://www.cpan.org\">CPAN</a>, my old friend. :)  Finding all kinds of things that are immediately useful, like a <a href=\"http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=40\">Cache</a> I can use to more intelligently and easily do the output caching voodoo I do in the perl CGI widgets right now.  </p>\n<p><b><Aside></b>You know, a lack of a centrallized CPAN-like system is what has kept me from leaving Perl for many other technologies.  I really wish Java (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=cjan\">CJAN</a>?) and Python (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=cpyan&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0\">CPyAN</a>?) had one supported by their respective communities.  It's just so nice to do a <code>perl -MCPAN -e\"install Date::Parse\"</code> and get what I need.  Maintaining CPAN bundles for my perl software is tasty, too.  Single-command installation of all my app's requirements, and sometimes I can roll it right into the app's installation itself.  Mmm.<b></aside></b></p>\n<p>Anyway, it's nice (to say it again) to have a running personal site to tinker with, now that I've gotten off my butt and done it.  This laboratory is letting me manufacture reasons to play with tech I hadn't bothered with before.  </p>\n<p>I mean, I've used ASP and JSP, and for most of the things I've done, I've grown a severe dislike for them both.  I left the \"Hey, you've got HTML in my code!\" paradigm behind, wandered through that \"Hey, you've got code in my HTML\" model, and eventually settled on my standard pattern now:<blockquote>A central app logic controller takes in GET/POST data, dispatches to a method which processes the form data.  That method then constructs data structures, which are in turn passed through a template engine to be rendered by a pile of templates independent from the controller.</blockquote>This, along with some very special self-assembling component-based automation sauce, is the core of what my employer's offerings run on.  But, this has crystallized as a habit for me, and I've not even considered other possibilities for a long time.  This of course has made everything look like a nail for this hammer I have.  </p>\n<p>For example, while <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> is not quite the right tool for the  things we're doing at my day job, it seems like a perfect option to quickly and easily replace <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI\">SSI</a> pages on my site with something meatier yet still simple to maintain and doesn't stink like ASP or JSP.  I've also been looking at <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/cocoon\">Cocoon</a>, which if I can ever quite get in a groove with it, looks like a highly refined instance of my standard hammer.</p>\n<p>And then there's Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>.  I love it and hate it.  The hate mostly comes from the slower iBook on which I run it, I think.  The bootstrappiness of it makes me itch sometimes, but other times that just makes it endearing.  The whole self-contained development biodome it represents is pretty sexy, too.  Speaking of autovivifying data structures...  I just have to love a system which has a live, manually tinkerable giant outline/hashtree for a persistence mechanism.</p>\n<p>Next, I really want to swing back around to playing with Flash.  Last time I did something major with it, I was making a game for my employer which really wanted to use web services but I hadn't known it yet.  The game worked pretty well, but I want to see what it can do since last we met.

It's also something one of my favorite Comp Sci professors harped on, with regards to what makes a Computer Programmer versus what makes a Computer Scientist.  A small part of his speech always pointed to the notion that a a programmer is almost always pragmatic, memorizing the patterns and greasy innards of whatever tool he or she uses daily.  On the other hand, the scientist is an explorer and finds joy in confusing him or herself by finding the universals and generalities across a range of tools.  In the end, the programmer becomes specialized in a limited domain, while the scientist knows can pick up just about anything that comes along.

    "summary": "<p>So I&apos;m starting to play with <a href=\"http://www.php.net\">PHP</a> and working on rewriting my <a href=\"http://www.movabletype.org\">Movable Type</a> templates as *.phtml.</p>\n<p>Having never really payed much attention to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a>, I&apos;m amazed at how close it is to Perl (obviously on purpose) yet how much effort has been made to sand off the rough bits.  Not sure how much I like it yet, but at least it&apos;s a familiar tune they&apos;re playing.  The mildly annoying thing is that it&apos;s familiar, but there are just a few things I would habitually reach for in Perl that I haven&apos;t sussed out yet in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a>.  Like autovivifying data structures.  I abuse those constantly.  I really need to wean myself away from that, methinks.</p>\n<p>One thing that I <i>was</i> pleasantly surprised to find is <a href=\"http://pear.php.net\">PEAR</a>, &quot;a framework and distribution system for reusable <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> components&quot;.  Hello, <a href=\"http://www.cpan.org\">CPAN</a>, my old friend. :)  Finding all kinds of things that are immediately useful, like a <a href=\"http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=40\">Cache</a> I can use to more intelligently and easily do the output caching voodoo I do in the perl CGI widgets right now.  </p>\n<p><b></b></p><aside>You know, a lack of a centrallized CPAN-like system is what has kept me from leaving Perl for many other technologies.  I really wish Java (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=cjan\">CJAN</a>?) and Python (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=cpyan&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0\">CPyAN</a>?) had one supported by their respective communities.  It&apos;s just so nice to do a <code>perl -MCPAN -e&quot;install Date::Parse&quot;</code> and get what I need.  Maintaining CPAN bundles for my perl software is tasty, too.  Single-command installation of all my app&apos;s requirements, and sometimes I can roll it right into the app&apos;s installation itself.  Mmm.<b></b></aside><p></p>\n<p>Anyway, it&apos;s nice (to say it again) to have a running personal site to tinker with, now that I&apos;ve gotten off my butt and done it.  This laboratory is letting me manufacture reasons to play with tech I hadn&apos;t bothered with before.  </p>\n<p>I mean, I&apos;ve used ASP and JSP, and for most of the things I&apos;ve done, I&apos;ve grown a severe dislike for them both.  I left the &quot;Hey, you&apos;ve got HTML in my code!&quot; paradigm behind, wandered through that &quot;Hey, you&apos;ve got code in my HTML&quot; model, and eventually settled on my standard pattern now:</p><blockquote>A central app logic controller takes in GET/POST data, dispatches to a method which processes the form data.  That method then constructs data structures, which are in turn passed through a template engine to be rendered by a pile of templates independent from the controller.</blockquote>This, along with some very special self-assembling component-based automation sauce, is the core of what my employer&apos;s offerings run on.  But, this has crystallized as a habit for me, and I&apos;ve not even considered other possibilities for a long time.  This of course has made everything look like a nail for this hammer I have.  <p></p>\n<p>For example, while <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> is not quite the right tool for the  things we&apos;re doing at my day job, it seems like a perfect option to quickly and easily replace <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI\">SSI</a> pages on my site with something meatier yet still simple to maintain and doesn&apos;t stink like ASP or JSP.  I&apos;ve also been looking at <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/cocoon\">Cocoon</a>, which if I can ever quite get in a groove with it, looks like a highly refined instance of my standard hammer.</p>\n<p>And then there&apos;s Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>.  I love it and hate it.  The hate mostly comes from the slower iBook on which I run it, I think.  The bootstrappiness of it makes me itch sometimes, but other times that just makes it endearing.  The whole self-contained development biodome it represents is pretty sexy, too.  Speaking of autovivifying data structures...  I just have to love a system which has a live, manually tinkerable giant outline/hashtree for a persistence mechanism.</p>\n<p>Next, I really want to swing back around to playing with Flash.  Last time I did something major with it, I was making a game for my employer which really wanted to use web services but I hadn&apos;t known it yet.  The game worked pretty well, but I want to see what it can do since last we met.  First thing in mind that seems mildly nifty might be a slick, live updating lil &quot;Recent Visitors&quot; app for my front page.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m really feeling what <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100887/\">Jon Udell</a> means when he writes about <a href=\"http://www.byte.com/documents/s=7031/byt1016214357418/0318_udell.html\">thinking by analogy</a>.  It&apos;s also something one of my favorite Comp Sci professors harped on, with regards to what makes a Computer Programmer versus what makes a Computer Scientist.  A small part of his speech always pointed to the notion that a a programmer is almost always pragmatic, memorizing the patterns and greasy innards of whatever tool he or she uses daily.  On the other hand, the scientist is an explorer and finds joy in confusing him or herself by finding the universals and generalities across a range of tools.  In the end, the programmer becomes specialized in a limited domain, while the scientist knows can pick up just about anything that comes along.  And sometimes, many times, the scientist <i>makes new tools</i> for programmers to specialize on.  I want to be and am working toward being a scientist.</p>\n<p>More soon.</p>\n"

I had to make a little form in a throwaway page to trick my browser into doing the hard work.  I suppose I could make a lil utility script to do the meta character escaping more easily.  But, man, if people are already making fun of the punctuation and obfuscation possible in <i>Perl</i>, imagine what they'll say about scripts on the URL-line.  (Assuming I'm not missing reams of existing ridicule already. :) )\n</p>\n<br /><br />\n<p>\nJon does make a note of this little problem, but I'm thinking it's going to be what makes me wrap up my URL-as-command-line experiments.  What would this URL look like if it had 1 or 2 more levels of pipeline? \n</p>\n<p>\nI suppose I could, as he'd also mentioned, employ a few tricks like reducing script names and parameter names down to single characters, but then I'm sacrificing one of the virtues he'd mentioned: the human readable, self-documenting nature of URL-based services.  Well, that gets scrapped at the first layer of pipelined URL indirection with the escaping of URL meta characters.

Of course there are the non-web crossovers, like <a href=\"http://www.interconnected.org/home/more/googlematic.gif\">searching in AIM via googlematic</a>, but this mostly makes me yawn.  Yes, its fun and geeky, but yawn.  This is not to say that the Google search API itself makes me yawn.</p>\n<p>What makes me yawn is anything that's just an alternative direct user interface on the service.  Search from my IDE while I program?  Eh, that's okay, but I could do that by just spawning a browser with a cooked URL and not have to re-engineer a UI do display the results.  Display some results of a canned search in my weblog?  Eh, that's cute, but I could do that with some simple HTML scraping and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI\">SSI</a>, if I really really wanted to.  Yeah, I know the web service makes that <i>so</i>much easier, but the thing it makes easier isn't something I was really interested in the first place.  Maybe I'm not interested because I don't get it yet, or maybe it really is just a novel triviality.</p>\n<p>No, what will make my overhead lightbulb spark up are applications which involve indirection.  That is, some application which makes searches to answer some other question of mine.  Search results used to spawn further churning.  Or, search results as the result of churning.  Google's suggestions are intriguing: Auto-monitor the web for new information on a subject; Glean market research insights and trends over time; Invent a catchy online game.  But, these sound disappointingly close to a corp-speak shrug.  </p>\n<p>Not that this is unexpected or a bad thing or a statement of derision.  Their Alpha Geeks made the service available, and now its up to the world Alpha Geeks to turn it into magic.  I'm just waiting and thinking though...  the AG's are churning out all permutations of language bindings, alternative interfaces, and weavings of the service into other apps.  This is the first stage of play.  I don't know that I'll feel like playing much yet.  So I'll watch, and maybe tinker a bit, but mostly be thinking about what the next stage of play will become.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=oooohf\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090292\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://IAwiki.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=92ffcf37d534a7e60938bc270f750979&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://IAwiki.net/\">Eric Scheid</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090292\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-14T01:05:34\">2002-04-14T01:05:34</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">tracerlock?\nhttp://tracerlock.com/</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090293\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090293\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-15T00:45:47\">2002-04-15T00:45:47</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Okay...  Just trying to think how one might do this with the Google search API.\nForget for the moment that the \"demo\" API is limited to 10 search results.  So I make a search and download all 186,000 or however many results come up for my terms.  I store these.  A specified number of minutes later I perform the search again and download the 186,123 results that come up for my search.

Grr.</p>\n<p>I just hope it hasn&apos;t slid over the cliff yet and all these bastards finally hang themselves with all the rope they&apos;ve played out.  I still hope that there&apos;s a sleeping giant of reason out amongst the sheep.</p>\n"

Maybe in listing a few headlines over there, I can entice a few readers to my other spaces.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a> is where I do most of my general blogging, link posting, and general grousing.  (I think that&apos;s my new favorite word)  The <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a> weblog is just an experiment at this point, but it may eventually consume the whole site.</p>\n<p>Basically, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a> is competing with server-side CGIs and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI\">SSI</a>s at this point.  Eventually, they will cooperate.  After that, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a> may take over.</p>\n<p>Anyway, enjoy <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RssDisplay\">RssDisplay</a> if you like-- you can either download it, or <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PipelineTheWeb\">PipelineTheWeb</a> and use it straight from my site.</p>\n"
