   <li>Hmm, trying to see if my outline pings weblogs.com. (<i>It does.</i>)</li>
   <li>Seems like a neat idea to subscribe to io.opml as a buddy.  Let's hope its not <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/NeatLikeDigitalWatches">neat like digital watches</a>.</li>
   <li>Also, I need me some automated outline log archiving and possibly some automated spool-to-weblog action going on here.</li>
   <li><b>Oh, and my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/deus_x/radio">Radio weblog</a> was broken.  Now its not.</b></li>
   <li><i>Spooky.</i></li>
   </ul>
