  <meta property="og:description" content="From Radio UserLand&amp;apos;s Outliner @ 4/4/02; 10:24:32 PMOutlog      Current status: Online, working.   4/4/02; 10:11:30 PM by LMO            Were I insane (perhaps criminally so), and if I knew elisp in emacs better, I would stick instant outlining into Emacs&amp;apos; outline-mode.      Then we might truly have the &quot;emacs of outliners&quot;.      Or something like that.         4/4/02; 9:22:13 PM by LMO            My cats demand my popcorn.  The two of them work in tandem, one distracting and the other snatching.  Astonishingly, they share the spoils.         4/4/02; 9:14:24 PM by LMO            Concering Arboretum, Mark Paschal says: &quot;No matter what I do, Les Orchard has done it first.&quot;      Heehee.  Funny, I&amp;apos;ve never had that said about me before :)  I always feel like I&amp;apos;m behind.      But, Arboretum as &quot;emacs of outliners&quot; is a boast / pipedream.  The current state of affairs is not quite that.  At present, it&amp;apos;s more like My First Cocoa Program [tm]      Actually, I think a Python/Tk (or maybe some other GUI toolkit, say ?WxWindows?) would have a better chance at making it to being a cross-platform &quot;emacs of outliners&quot;.         4/4/02; 7:51:13 PM by LMO            Been sick.  Have to recover.  Too many exciting things happening.      Many many things I want to pick up and run with.                  Instant Outlining                        Arboretum needs to do it.            I want diff for outlines.            It&amp;apos;d also be neat to do some mining to conserve my attention span.                              Has someone mentioned my name (or a given pattern) again since the last time I read their outline?  Maybe bold and italicize my buddy&amp;apos;s name to tell me that I&amp;apos;m really interested in what they just posted.               In IRC, using X-Chat, the name of a channel I&amp;apos;m in turns blue on changes, and turns red on changes and a mention of my nickname.                           I want to write some CGIs that produce OPML.                              Link them live into my I/O, or allow others to subscribe to them.               Will they bolden on subscribers&amp;apos; lists iff they change?                                    Arboretum                        It&amp;apos;s been a little while, but I have been working on an outliner.            This seems even more important now.                     Radio                        I really like PipeFilters.  Need to finish it, at least on the web preferences side of things.  Do you like PipeFilters?            I want IMAP support in Radio UserLand so I can use it as an email client, and possibly to MailToRSS within Radio.                     Jabber                        Firewall traversing RPC is dead sexy.                     Wiki                        Why do I like wiki?                              An interface which steps out of one&amp;apos;s way is a productive interface               Dead simple markup for humans               Dead simple collaboration &amp; versioning               Dead simple, almost automated document structure                           ...and Cocoon                              Seems like a natural.  Transform from human-oriented markup shorthand to an intermediate XML format and run from there with the transformations.                           ...and Python                              MoinMoin seems to have a bit of a primitive pipeline going on with formatter classes.                           ...and ?DocBook                              We want to collaborate on book authoring at work.                           ... and OPML                              Maybe along with Cocoon, make OPML one of the serializations, with hierarchy determined by a sections/headings analgous to HTML&amp;apos;s H1-H4 and ?DocBook&amp;apos;s sect1-sect4                                              " />
