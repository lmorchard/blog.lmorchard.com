Tim O&#39;Reilly: So often, signs of the future are all around us, but it isn&#39;t until much later that most of the world realizes their significance. Meanwhile, the innovators who are busy inventing that future live in a world of their own. ... these are the folks I affectionately call &quot;the alpha geeks,&quot; the hackers who have such mastery of their tools that they &quot;roll their own&quot; when existing products don&#39;t give them what they need.




That&#39;s what I want to be when I grow up:  an alpha geek.
Well, I already am an alpha geek, only just in fairly obscure circles.  Wherever I&#39;ve worked, I&#39;ve become the ToolBuilder.  I&#39;m the guy who takes the stuff we have that never quite all works together, and I weld it together into some freakish kind of A-Team nightmare that lets the team crash through the brick walls.
And here at my current job, I&#39;ve worked at seeing how far I can take the ThirdTimeAutomate rule.  Where it&#39;s lead me (and this company) is to a component-based web application framework with automation support in building up the apps.
I&#39;ve gotten the system to the point that a Design Tech (HTML-guy) can crank out a dozen promotions with the system in a day, with a large degree of customization.  Occasionally, a Software Engineer may need to toss in an hour or two to write a custom component subclass or new component.
The components are built to be self-describing and, within certain circumstances, automatically collaborate.  We can mix &amp; match promotion aspects and they&#39;ll work to integrate themselves.  The efficiency it&#39;s given us has allowed this company to survive the dot-com bust with a tiny number of employees and expense.  Now that business is actually picking up, productivity is still so high that we don&#39;t need many more people yet.  And it&#39;s kept me in a good job all through these rough times.
It&#39;s really good stuff, and I&#39;m very proud of it.  In a way, it&#39;s the culmination of my last 8 years or so of work on the web.  The problem is...  This technology will likely never leave this company.  I&#39;ve spent my past two years refining it, and it will probably never be seen outside the 2 dozen or so employees of this company, only 3-5 of whom really know what it&#39;s about.
Which brings me to things like this:Getting Noticed? from Eric Olsen (via Steve Ivy, et al.).  &quot;As the volume of blogs has ballooned well into six-figures, the need for links from ?star? blogs has become an absolute requirement to be noticed.&quot;




But I think this is how things go in the world in general.  It&#39;s a big, big place.  To be noticed in it takes some work.
So here I am, an alpha geek and a ToolBuilder spinning in my own circles, hope someday to have my name up in lights.
