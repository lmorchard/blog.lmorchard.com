&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2002/04/09/future.html&quot;&gt;Tim O&amp;apos;Reilly&lt;/a&gt;: So often, signs of the future are all around us, but it isn&amp;apos;t until much later that most of the world realizes their significance. Meanwhile, the innovators who are busy inventing that future live in a world of their own. ... these are the folks I affectionately call &amp;quot;the alpha geeks,&amp;quot; the hackers who have such mastery of their tools that they &amp;quot;roll their own&amp;quot; when existing products don&amp;apos;t give them what they need.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;apos;s what I want to be when I grow up:  an alpha geek.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I already am an alpha geek, only just in fairly obscure circles.  Wherever I&amp;apos;ve worked, I&amp;apos;ve become the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ToolBuilder&quot;&gt;ToolBuilder&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;apos;m the guy who takes the stuff we have that never quite all works together, and I weld it together into some freakish kind of A-Team nightmare that lets the team crash through the brick walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here at my current job, I&amp;apos;ve worked at seeing how far I can take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ThirdTimeAutomate&quot;&gt;ThirdTimeAutomate&lt;/a&gt; rule.  Where it&amp;apos;s lead me (and this company) is to a component-based web application framework with automation support in building up the apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;ve gotten the system to the point that a Design Tech (HTML-guy) can crank out a dozen promotions with the system in a day, with a large degree of customization.  Occasionally, a Software Engineer may need to toss in an hour or two to write a custom component subclass or new component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The components are built to be self-describing and, within certain circumstances, automatically collaborate.  We can mix &amp;amp; match promotion aspects and they&amp;apos;ll work to integrate themselves.  The efficiency it&amp;apos;s given us has allowed this company to survive the dot-com bust with a tiny number of employees and expense.  Now that business is actually picking up, productivity is still so high that we don&amp;apos;t need many more people yet.  And it&amp;apos;s kept me in a good job all through these rough times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;apos;s really good stuff, and I&amp;apos;m very proud of it.  In a way, it&amp;apos;s the culmination of my last 8 years or so of work on the web.  The problem is...  This technology will likely never leave this company.  I&amp;apos;ve spent my past two years refining it, and it will probably never be seen outside the 2 dozen or so employees of this company, only 3-5 of whom really know what it&amp;apos;s about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to things like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redmonk.net/2002/04/09#item1111&quot;&gt;Getting Noticed?&lt;/a&gt; from Eric Olsen (via Steve Ivy, et al.).  &amp;quot;As the volume of blogs has ballooned well into six-figures, the need for links from ?star? blogs has become an absolute requirement to be noticed.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But I think this is how things go in the world in general.  It&amp;apos;s a big, big place.  To be noticed in it takes some work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am, an alpha geek and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ToolBuilder&quot;&gt;ToolBuilder&lt;/a&gt; spinning in my own circles, hope someday to have my name up in lights.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
