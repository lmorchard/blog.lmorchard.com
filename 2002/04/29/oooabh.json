It feels much too much like a philosophy or religion or something.&quot;  And I agree with this, too.

This has all probably been covered ad nauseum on mailing lists I haven&apos;t read yet, but this is what I thought on Paul&apos;s article:<blockquote><i>Using someone else&apos;s [RESTful] web service requires you to understand their data structures (XML vocabulary and links between documents). . . . RPC APIs merely hide the problem behind an extra layer of non-standardization. First you must figure out the method names available. Then you must still figure out the data structures that may be used as parameters. And then behind those data structures is the implicit data model of the web service.</i></blockquote>Hmm.  Yes, in an RPC API I have to supply my customer with my method definitions-- including their names, parameters, and return values.  This seems directly comparable to supplying my customer with all the URIs exposed by my app&apos;s resources, as well as the data structures used by them.</p><p></p>\n<p></p><p>How are these cases so very different?<blockquote><i>There is no free lunch.

When I first learned to rethink my problems in object oriented programming, I got immense payback.  I haven&apos;t seen the clear payback case for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> yet.  So far, it looks like an interesting abstraction with a lot of vagueries, name calling, and intimations of harm and danger.</p><p></p>\n<p><blockquote><i>Of course you may actually implement it on the server side however you want.
