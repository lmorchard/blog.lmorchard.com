Just trying to think how one might do this with the Google search API.\n</code></pre><p>Forget for the moment that the &quot;demo&quot; API is limited to 10 search results.  So I make a search and download all 186,000 or however many results come up for my terms.  I store these.  A specified number of minutes later I perform the search again and download the 186,123 results that come up for my search.  I run a diff between these and have my changes.</p>\n<p>Seems like downloading those hundreds of thousands of search results, a periodic times, possibly by dozens to hundreds of users of the app, will be nasty and undesirable.</p>\n<p>I suppose some pooling of terms and centrallizing the searching into another app would maybe help cushion this...  but something seems itchy and wrong about this to me.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
