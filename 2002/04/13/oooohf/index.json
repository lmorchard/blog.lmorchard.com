Display some results of a canned search in my weblog?  Eh, that's cute, but I could do that with some simple HTML scraping and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI\">SSI</a>, if I really really wanted to.  Yeah, I know the web service makes that <i>so</i>much easier, but the thing it makes easier isn't something I was really interested in the first place.

That is, some application which makes searches to answer some other question of mine.  Search results used to spawn further churning.  Or, search results as the result of churning.  Google's suggestions are intriguing: Auto-monitor the web for new information on a subject; Glean market research insights and trends over time; Invent a catchy online game.

Their Alpha Geeks made the service available, and now its up to the world Alpha Geeks to turn it into magic.  I'm just waiting and thinking though...  the AG's are churning out all permutations of language bindings, alternative interfaces, and weavings of the service into other apps.  This is the first stage of play.  I don't know that I'll feel like playing much yet.  So I'll watch, and maybe tinker a bit, but mostly be thinking about what the next stage of play will become.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=oooohf\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090292\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://IAwiki.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=92ffcf37d534a7e60938bc270f750979&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://IAwiki.net/\">Eric Scheid</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090292\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-14T01:05:34\">2002-04-14T01:05:34</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">tracerlock?\nhttp://tracerlock.com/</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090293\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090293\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-15T00:45:47\">2002-04-15T00:45:47</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Okay...
