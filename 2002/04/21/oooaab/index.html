        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mark Pilgrim &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/04/21.html#autolinkbacks_vs_instant_outlining&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;i&gt;IO is more controlled [than linkbacks] -- you have to subscribe to other people&amp;apos;s feeds to read their responses -- and is therefore better suited for intentional collaboration. Auto-linkbacks are more about exploration and &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/03/13/manufacturedSerendipity.html&quot;&gt;manufacturing serendipity&lt;/a&gt;. Must explore this further.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I went bananas with the referral links everywhere.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/03/13/manufacturedSerendipity.html&quot;&gt;Manufactured serendipity&lt;/a&gt;.  The referrals do something that a weblog&amp;apos;s comment feature just doesn&amp;apos;t do.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave &amp;amp; the Userland crew &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/02/23#morningCoffeeNotes&quot;&gt;often assert&lt;/a&gt; that weblogs are better than discussion groups, for various good reasons.  Radio &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/a&gt; shipped without a comment feature (although it has one now), which I assumed was because the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/a&gt; opinion was that the convention to comment &amp;amp; respond to someone&amp;apos;s weblog was to do it in your own weblog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big problem I see, though, is that you&amp;apos;re in your own bubble.  If you have something to say about something I wrote, and you&amp;apos;re not already in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; subscriptions, I&amp;apos;ll never read you.  If I don&amp;apos;t know you already, chances are that I may not come to be introduced to you.  The same goes for Instant Outlining.  While I appreciate the intentional nature of this tech, and its strengths in avoiding spam, I want to meet you half way.  I want to be surprised and have my ears get warm and turn red when you say something about me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referral-driven linkbacks on all pages on my site do this.  If you post to your weblog and include a link to me, then I hear about it the first time someone traverses that link.  This, to me, is even better than the comment feature.  And, as Mark Pilgrim observes, this is better that a single referers page because these linkbacks appear &lt;i&gt;in context&lt;/i&gt;.  The conversation is built up from links &lt;i&gt;in place&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;on topic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;where the action is&lt;/i&gt;.  To me, this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thetwowayweb.com/&quot;&gt;the two-way web&lt;/a&gt; really in action&lt;/p&gt;

<div class="content">The current linkbacks for this article include:
* http://diveintomark.org/ (6)
* http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/04/21.html (1)
* http://www.diveintomark.org/ (1)
I suspect these are all from the same link.  The second link, the permalink, is probably the most useful for linkback.  It would be nice to come up with a convention or feature not unlike HTML BASE that indicates "this is the right context for this link".</div>

<div class="content">Yup, they are all the same link.  Not sure how I could collapse them though without some cue from the referer.  One thing I could maybe do is order them by domain, or maybe make an outline out of them.</div>

<div class="content">Collapsing them all under the most specific (ie, longest) URL would fix it: you'd get the one with the #anchor, then.
What's the right name for "string subtraction," anyway?</div>
