        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Okay after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/2002/04/14.html#a351&quot;&gt;vote of confidence from Sam Ruby&lt;/a&gt; about my thinking out loud about a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000087.shtml#000087&quot;&gt;&quot;404 correction&quot; proxy server&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ve been thinking more about writing a Radio-like desktop app server.  I want to do more than make a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebsite&quot;&gt;DesktopWebsite&lt;/a&gt;, though.  I want to make a full-blown &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalServer&quot;&gt;PersonalServer&lt;/a&gt; app, capable of hosting things like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalMailServer&quot;&gt;PersonalMailServer&lt;/a&gt; and a slew of other little local web services &amp;amp; etc.  I may end up giving up and working more within Radio, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000080.shtml#000080&quot;&gt;as I noted before&lt;/a&gt; I have some issues with Radio&#39;s performance and stability, which though balanced by my appreciation of the elegance of the system, is being gradually outweighed by my fears of lock-in and pre-existing experience with other technologies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, this thing probably won&#39;t replace &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand&quot;&gt;RadioUserLand&lt;/a&gt; for me.  I use it daily, I bought it, and it&#39;s not as exciting to reimplement what I already have.  Unless it is exciting.  Make any sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, speaking of technologies... which ones should I use to start working on a personal server?  My main goals are mumbled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer&quot;&gt;over here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got a large amount of experience with Perl, and have written desktop apps with it for Mac OS X and Win32.  I&#39;m having more fun with Python, however, and though I haven&#39;t written the same apps I imagine that it&#39;s on par with Perl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing I&#39;m trying to decide right now is:  multi-threaded vs async/event-driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, I need some sort of concurrency to handle multiple network server hits, multiple agents running, a scheduler, and whatever else wants to take up residence inside the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalServer&quot;&gt;PersonalServer&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand&quot;&gt;RadioUserLand&lt;/a&gt;, of course, has all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve worked a lot with &lt;a href=&quot;http://poe.perl.org/&quot;&gt;POE in Perl&lt;/a&gt; to make some event-driven multitasking apps, a few servers (HTTP, FTP, NNTP, etc) and a few things to replace a fleet of forked scripts.  I&#39;ve also started looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/ipc10paper&quot;&gt;Twisted in Python&lt;/a&gt; which I gather to be the analogous thing in their camp.  Not the same, but they both are using the same basic idea of event-driven programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that, to take code that you would have written for a forking or multi-threaded program, and make it play nice within the event-driven environment, there&#39;s a bit of re-think you need to do.  Loops need to be broken up into procedures, turned into self-running events, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm... trying to think of more re-think examples, but the main one I can think of is that long-running loops and processes need to be sliced and diced.  I seem to remember more pain than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&#39;d rather use threads.  In threads, there needs to be a bit of re-think too, in terms of protecting resources from concurrency, but at least the main logic of my code can remain straightforward.  Perl doesn&#39;t have threads that I want to touch yet.  Python has threads, but I&#39;m not sure how kosher they are.  Of course, there&#39;s always Java, but I want to avoid Java I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone tuned in out there with any thoughts?  Mostly thinking out loud right now.&lt;/p&gt;

<div class="content">I've been playing around with exactly the same idea - of a PersonalWebServer with built-in scheduler, object database etc. And again, Perl is my comfort zone. And the lack of decent thread support has been a stumbling block. I have too much work done in top level apps in Perl to change over to Python or anything else.
Anyway, I used threads to invoke a scheduler thread and a http daemon thread as an experiment, and they seem to work pretty fine together.
I plan to keep the Perl object database (presently embedded in my top level apps - using Storable persistant objects indexed using an RDBMS for searches using pre-configured object attributes) as an external server, and plan to get the PersonalWebAppServer to talk to the database server using XML-RPC.</div>
