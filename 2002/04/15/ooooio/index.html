        <meta property="og:description" content="Okay after the vote of confidence from Sam Ruby about my thinking out loud about a &quot;404 correction&quot; proxy server, I&#39;ve been thinking more about writing a Radio-like desktop app server.  I want to do more than make a DesktopWebsite, though.  I want to make a full-blown PersonalServer app, capable of hosting things like a PersonalMailServer and a slew of other little local web services &amp; etc.  I may end up giving up and working more within Radio, but as I noted before I have some issues with Radio&#39;s performance and stability, which though balanced by my appreciation of the elegance of the system, is being gradually outweighed by my fears of lock-in and pre-existing experience with other technologies.  
Then again, this thing probably won&#39;t replace RadioUserLand for me.  I use it daily, I bought it, and it&#39;s not as exciting to reimplement what I already have.  Unless it is exciting.  Make any sense?
So, speaking of technologies... which ones should I use to start working on a personal server?  My main goals are mumbled over here.
I&#39;ve got a large amount of experience with Perl, and have written desktop apps with it for Mac OS X and Win32.  I&#39;m having more fun with Python, however, and though I haven&#39;t written the same apps I imagine that it&#39;s on par with Perl.
The main thing I&#39;m trying to decide right now is:  multi-threaded vs async/event-driven.
See, I need some sort of concurrency to handle multiple network server hits, multiple agents running, a scheduler, and whatever else wants to take up residence inside the PersonalServer.  RadioUserLand, of course, has all of this.
I&#39;ve worked a lot with POE in Perl to make some event-driven multitasking apps, a few servers (HTTP, FTP, NNTP, etc) and a few things to replace a fleet of forked scripts.  I&#39;ve also started looking at Twisted in Python which I gather to be the analogous thing in their camp.  Not the same, but they both are using the same basic idea of event-driven programs.
The problem is that, to take code that you would have written for a forking or multi-threaded program, and make it play nice within the event-driven environment, there&#39;s a bit of re-think you need to do.  Loops need to be broken up into procedures, turned into self-running events, etc.
Hmm... trying to think of more re-think examples, but the main one I can think of is that long-running loops and processes need to be sliced and diced.  I seem to remember more pain than that.
Anyway, I&#39;d rather use threads.  In threads, there needs to be a bit of re-think too, in terms of protecting resources from concurrency, but at least the main logic of my code can remain straightforward.  Perl doesn&#39;t have threads that I want to touch yet.  Python has threads, but I&#39;m not sure how kosher they are.  Of course, there&#39;s always Java, but I want to avoid Java I think.
Anyone tuned in out there with any thoughts?  Mostly thinking out loud right now." />

<div class="content">I've been playing around with exactly the same idea - of a PersonalWebServer with built-in scheduler, object database etc. And again, Perl is my comfort zone. And the lack of decent thread support has been a stumbling block. I have too much work done in top level apps in Perl to change over to Python or anything else.
Anyway, I used threads to invoke a scheduler thread and a http daemon thread as an experiment, and they seem to work pretty fine together.
I plan to keep the Perl object database (presently embedded in my top level apps - using Storable persistant objects indexed using an RDBMS for searches using pre-configured object attributes) as an external server, and plan to get the PersonalWebAppServer to talk to the database server using XML-RPC.</div>
