        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a column on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.byte.com/documents/s=7117/byt1018644007316/0415_udell.html&quot;&gt;Zope Lessons Learned&lt;/a&gt;, Jon Udell writes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;It seems silly to recreate, in a scripting platform, services that already exist in the environment. On the other hand, since those services aren&amp;apos;t guaranteed to exist in the same way in every environment, you can argue that the scripting platform should be self sufficient even if that means reinventing wheels...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is something else I&amp;apos;ve been thinking about with regards to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalServer&quot;&gt;PersonalServer&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer&quot;&gt;DesktopWebAppServer&lt;/a&gt; I want to put together.  Thing is, between the slice of a full peer I have at decafbad.com, and the full UNIX environments I have on my 2 linux boxen and one iBook, I have 90% of the environment I want already.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have databases, I have web and mail servers, I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WebDAV&quot;&gt;WebDAV&lt;/a&gt;, and I have schedulers.  Should I just say to hell with it and get on with writing the top layer?  That is, the actual apps I want to run on this nifty personal server framework?  I have been so far, and calling it &amp;quot;prototype&amp;quot;.  Telling myself that these little apps are just &amp;quot;playing around&amp;quot; for until I build a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; desktop environment in which to host the apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why reinvent all the wheels to which Jon refers?  Because they &amp;quot;aren&amp;apos;t guaranteed to exist in the same way in every environment&amp;quot;, and I would like to distribute and share my work to people who don&amp;apos;t have a full peer, 2 linux boxen, and an iBook.  So, I&amp;apos;d like this stuff to be a simple little wrapped up package that&amp;apos;s easy to drop in on a Win32 box.  Or a Linux box, or a Mac OS X box.  So, in order to make a cross-platform &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalServer&quot;&gt;PersonalServer&lt;/a&gt;, I have to reinvent the wheels and create a run-time environment that itself runs on all platforms so that I don&amp;apos;t have to modify the upper layers of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm...  Or, I could just get to work within the excellent environments I already have, screw reinventing wheels, and actually create some apps that would be &lt;i&gt;worth&lt;/i&gt; making cross-platform on some later date.  :)  Because the longer I work on reinventing wheels, the fewer things I have that are really any fun to play with in the end.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, who would I be kidding if I didn&amp;apos;t admit that the stuff I&amp;apos;m playing with right now is for early adopters and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AlphaGeek&quot;&gt;AlphaGeeks&lt;/a&gt;?  So why waste a lot of time making a pretty box with a bow now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOsX&quot;&gt;MacOsX&lt;/a&gt; exists, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand&quot;&gt;RadioUserLand&lt;/a&gt; exists, so I might as well stand on their shoulders.  I wish I could find the permalink, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scriptingnews.com&quot;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; was talking about Open Source developers banding together on a mailing lists to &amp;quot;crush&amp;quot; a commercial product.  He works toward the conclusion that this is stupid and useless, and that cooperation is more in everyone&amp;apos;s interest.  Not to be a dittohead in the Cult of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/a&gt;, but they seem to be bearing this out.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand&quot;&gt;RadioUserLand&lt;/a&gt; is so open and inviting for tinkering that I think most of what I&amp;apos;d want from an Open Source clone is already there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, I even prefer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOsX&quot;&gt;MacOsX&lt;/a&gt; over Linux now.  Am I selling my hacker soul?  I don&amp;apos;t think so.  :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, okay, enough babbling.  I&amp;apos;ll forget about writing my OS-within-an-OS for now and write the apps on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
