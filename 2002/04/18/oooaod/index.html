His examples did nifty things with a publicly available XSLT processor to use an XSL stylesheet at one URL and an XML document at another to produce a new document.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, this is what I&amp;apos;ve been playing with a bit this week, expecially with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/GoogleToRSS&quot;&gt;GoogleToRSS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RssDisplay&quot;&gt;RssDisplay&lt;/a&gt;.  But, this is what the URL looks like when I string the two together (line wrapping forced):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What a pain this was to build.  I had to make a little form in a throwaway page to trick my browser into doing the hard work.  I suppose I could make a lil utility script to do the meta character escaping more easily.  But, man, if people are already making fun of the punctuation and obfuscation possible in &lt;i&gt;Perl&lt;/i&gt;, imagine what they&amp;apos;ll say about scripts on the URL-line.  (Assuming I&amp;apos;m not missing reams of existing ridicule already. :) )
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Jon does make a note of this little problem, but I&amp;apos;m thinking it&amp;apos;s going to be what makes me wrap up my URL-as-command-line experiments.  What would this URL look like if it had 1 or 2 more levels of pipeline? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I suppose I could, as he&amp;apos;d also mentioned, employ a few tricks like reducing script names and parameter names down to single characters, but then I&amp;apos;m sacrificing one of the virtues he&amp;apos;d mentioned: the human readable, self-documenting nature of URL-based services.  Well, that gets scrapped at the first layer of pipelined URL indirection with the escaping of URL meta characters.  Hmm...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still poking away at things, anyway.
