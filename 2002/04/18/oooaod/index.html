        <meta property="og:description" content="Jon Udell wrote a few columns and weblog entries about pipelining the web, and the power of the URL-line as akin to a UNIX command line with pipes.  His examples did nifty things with a publicly available XSLT processor to use an XSL stylesheet at one URL and an XML document at another to produce a new document.


So, this is what I&#39;ve been playing with a bit this week, expecially with GoogleToRSS and RssDisplay.  But, this is what the URL looks like when I string the two together (line wrapping forced):

What a pain this was to build.  I had to make a little form in a throwaway page to trick my browser into doing the hard work.  I suppose I could make a lil utility script to do the meta character escaping more easily.  But, man, if people are already making fun of the punctuation and obfuscation possible in Perl, imagine what they&#39;ll say about scripts on the URL-line.  (Assuming I&#39;m not missing reams of existing ridicule already. :) )



Jon does make a note of this little problem, but I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s going to be what makes me wrap up my URL-as-command-line experiments.  What would this URL look like if it had 1 or 2 more levels of pipeline? 


I suppose I could, as he&#39;d also mentioned, employ a few tricks like reducing script names and parameter names down to single characters, but then I&#39;m sacrificing one of the virtues he&#39;d mentioned: the human readable, self-documenting nature of URL-based services.  Well, that gets scrapped at the first layer of pipelined URL indirection with the escaping of URL meta characters.  Hmm...
