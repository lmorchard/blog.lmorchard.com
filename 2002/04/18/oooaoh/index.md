<p>One brief thing:  When I switched over to Mac OS X on my laptop and on my desktop at work, and I bought the <a href="http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/wsx/">WindowShade X</a> haxie, and then installed <a href="http://www.students.tut.fi/~tuomov/pwm/">PWM</a> as my window manager on every X11-running machine I use (including the OS X boxen).</p>
<p>I've come to this conclusion today:  Windowshading is the outliner of window management.</p>
