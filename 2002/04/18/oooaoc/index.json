(That wouldn't've been as much fun, since Radio's already got verbs to handle it! :) Sometimes reinvention is fun.)  I think I need to do some more homework on it to make it worth of a new name, like do searches when visitors aren't visiting it.  (Currently, it updates at most once per hour, at least once per visitor.)  Maybe do some time-series search differences...  hmm, but what can one do with just the top 10 results?\n\n\n</p>\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n<p>shortname=oooaoc</p>\n",
