        <meta property="og:description" content="Well, I bit the bullet and pitched in the extra bucks to upgrade my hosting which, among other things, finally gave me an access_log.  The first thing I did was install Webalizer over here.  Should my access log reports not be public?  Hmm.  Well they are for now, if that becomes a problem, I&#39;ll put a password on it.
The second thing I did was attempt to copy the Disenfranchised linkback act and make a wiki and SSI includable referers widget, which I&#39;m calling ShowReferers.  Mine&#39;s not quite so slick as their implementation, since with theirs you can construct your links to refer to paragraph numbers in a page so that a link back to you is injected right there on their refered-to page.  
The neat thing here, though, is that I stuck it into the view template for DecafbadWiki so that every wiki page will show referral links, if there are any.  I also dropped it into the pages for each story on the weblog.  (Which reminds me that I need to make the story pages nicer, since I hardly ever look at them but the referrals tell me that other people see them more.)
I didn&#39;t quite get the value of referral links before, but I do now. :)" />
