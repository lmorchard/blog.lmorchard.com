The first thing I did was install &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/&quot;&gt;Webalizer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/stats/&quot;&gt;over here&lt;/a&gt;.  Should my access log reports not be public?  Hmm.  Well they are for now, if that becomes a problem, I&amp;apos;ll put a password on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing I did was attempt to copy the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/linkback.html&quot;&gt;Disenfranchised linkback act&lt;/a&gt; and make a wiki and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI&quot;&gt;SSI&lt;/a&gt; includable referers widget, which I&amp;apos;m calling &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShowReferers&quot;&gt;ShowReferers&lt;/a&gt;.  Mine&amp;apos;s not quite so slick as their implementation, since with theirs you can construct your links to refer to paragraph numbers in a page so that a link back to you is injected right there on their refered-to page.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neat thing here, though, is that I stuck it into the view template for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome&quot;&gt;DecafbadWiki&lt;/a&gt; so that every wiki page will show referral links, if there are any.  I also dropped it into the pages for each story on the weblog.  (Which reminds me that I need to make the story pages nicer, since I hardly ever look at them but the referrals tell me that other people see them more.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;apos;t quite get the value of referral links before, but I do now. :)&lt;/p&gt;
