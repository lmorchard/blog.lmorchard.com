  <meta property="og:description" content="In a column on Zope Lessons Learned, Jon Udell writes:It seems silly to recreate, in a scripting platform, services that already exist in the environment. On the other hand, since those services aren&amp;apos;t guaranteed to exist in the same way in every environment, you can argue that the scripting platform should be self sufficient even if that means reinventing wheels...This is something else I&amp;apos;ve been thinking about with regards to the PersonalServer / DesktopWebAppServer I want to put together.  Thing is, between the slice of a full peer I have at decafbad.com, and the full UNIX environments I have on my 2 linux boxen and one iBook, I have 90% of the environment I want already. I have databases, I have web and mail servers, I have WebDAV, and I have schedulers.  Should I just say to hell with it and get on with writing the top layer?  That is, the actual apps I want to run on this nifty personal server framework?  I have been so far, and calling it &quot;prototype&quot;.  Telling myself that these little apps are just &quot;playing around&quot; for until I build a &quot;real&quot; desktop environment in which to host the apps. So why reinvent all the wheels to which Jon refers?  Because they &quot;aren&amp;apos;t guaranteed to exist in the same way in every environment&quot;, and I would like to distribute and share my work to people who don&amp;apos;t have a full peer, 2 linux boxen, and an iBook.  So, I&amp;apos;d like this stuff to be a simple little wrapped up package that&amp;apos;s easy to drop in on a Win32 box.  Or a Linux box, or a Mac OS X box.  So, in order to make a cross-platform PersonalServer, I have to reinvent the wheels and create a run-time environment that itself runs on all platforms so that I don&amp;apos;t have to modify the upper layers of the app. Hmm...  Or, I could just get to work within the excellent environments I already have, screw reinventing wheels, and actually create some apps that would be worth making cross-platform on some later date.  :)  Because the longer I work on reinventing wheels, the fewer things I have that are really any fun to play with in the end.   Besides, who would I be kidding if I didn&amp;apos;t admit that the stuff I&amp;apos;m playing with right now is for early adopters and AlphaGeeks?  So why waste a lot of time making a pretty box with a bow now? MacOsX exists, and RadioUserLand exists, so I might as well stand on their shoulders.  I wish I could find the permalink, but Dave Winer was talking about Open Source developers banding together on a mailing lists to &quot;crush&quot; a commercial product.  He works toward the conclusion that this is stupid and useless, and that cooperation is more in everyone&amp;apos;s interest.  Not to be a dittohead in the Cult of UserLand, but they seem to be bearing this out.  RadioUserLand is so open and inviting for tinkering that I think most of what I&amp;apos;d want from an Open Source clone is already there.   Hell, I even prefer MacOsX over Linux now.  Am I selling my hacker soul?  I don&amp;apos;t think so.  :) Okay, okay, enough babbling.  I&amp;apos;ll forget about writing my OS-within-an-OS for now and write the apps on top of it. " />
