I would have responded sooner but somehow I missed this post.  Forgive me, I was in a mood.\n\nHere&#39;s an update: I&#39;ve written a small proxy server or two in Perl for debugging, but I&#39;d rather use someone else&#39;s proxy code.  If this thing works, I&#39;d use it full-time, so best to start with something that&#39;s production-ready.  I played with Squid thinking I could use a redirector but that only seems to modify requests, not responses.  Apparently what I want is a &quot;reverse proxy,&quot; which they&#39;re still working on.\n\nSo now I&#39;m thinking either Apache with mod_proxy and mod_perl or a personal proxy server like  Muffin.\n\nIf anyone has thoughts, I&#39;d like to hear them.  I&#39;m gonna write this code eventually, I swear :-)</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
