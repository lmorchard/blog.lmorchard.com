        <meta property="og:description" content="This having a website to tinker with thing is kinda neat.  Right now, I&#39;m growing a nasty beasty using SSI and perl CGIs, just because it was quick and seemed like a good idea at the time.  Obviously, now that I&#39;m starting to get more than 2 visitors per hour, the SSI/CGI mix starts to slow things down.  I do try a few smart-ish things, like making the CGIs do heavy lifting only once or twice per hour (at most) while spitting out cached results the rest of the time.  But, there&#39;s still the overhead of external perl process launch.
So, I&#39;m toying around with the idea of using Mason, whose design and purpose I seem to finally get, or learning PHP, whose design and purpose I dislike as much as ASP and JSP but whose simple utility I get now.  Nice thing is, my web host has both PHP and mod_perl installed for me, and I can toy with either or both.  There are other things I might play with learning as well.  These are all things that pretty much everyone has already gone through, but it&#39;s fun to grow a site by tinkering and see things pop up.  
I&#39;ve been making and optimizing the same sorts of sites and applications for so long that I&#39;ve started falling out of the loop on technologies not quite applicable to what I&#39;ve been devoted to.  This site of mine is proving to be a fun laboratory, complete with bunsen burners, Jacob&#39;s ladders, and those little curly tubes running between beakers." />
