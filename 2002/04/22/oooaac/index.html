Right now, I&amp;apos;m growing a nasty beasty using SSI and perl CGIs, just because it was quick and seemed like a good idea at the time.  Obviously, now that I&amp;apos;m starting to get more than 2 visitors per hour, the SSI/CGI mix starts to slow things down.

So, I&amp;apos;m toying around with the idea of using Mason, whose design and purpose I seem to finally get, or learning PHP, whose design and purpose I dislike as much as ASP and JSP but whose simple utility I get now.  Nice thing is, my web host has both PHP and mod_perl installed for me, and I can toy with either or both.  There are other things I might play with learning as well.  These are all things that pretty much everyone has already gone through, but it&amp;apos;s fun to grow a site by tinkering and see things pop up.   I&amp;apos;ve been making and optimizing the same sorts of sites and applications for so long that I&amp;apos;ve started falling out of the loop on technologies not quite applicable to what I&amp;apos;ve been devoted to.  This site of mine is proving to be a fun laboratory, complete with bunsen burners, Jacob&amp;apos;s ladders, and those little curly tubes running between beakers. " />
