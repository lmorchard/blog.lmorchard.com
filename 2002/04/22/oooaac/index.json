Right now, I'm growing a nasty beasty using <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI\">SSI</a> and perl CGIs, just because it was quick and seemed like a good idea at the time.  Obviously, now that I'm starting to get more than 2 visitors per hour, the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI\">SSI</a>/CGI mix starts to slow things down.

Nice thing is, <a href=\"http://www.csoft.net\">my web host</a> has both <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> and mod_perl installed for me, and I can toy with either or both.
