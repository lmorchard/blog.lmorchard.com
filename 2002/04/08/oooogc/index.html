      Is Jeremy Bowers doing outline diffs as a Jabber conference?
         
         Screenshot (should open in browser)
         
      If so...  WOW.
      
   4/6/02; 4:58:40 PM by LMO -- Comments in my buddy list
      
      So I hope this doesn&#39;t break anything.
      I did a &quot;Get Info&quot; on a few of my buddies in my list, and edited the author line to add some parenthetical comments.  Just a note on why I&#39;m interested in this buddy&#39;s outline.
      It seems to work without a problem, and the note appears when next the buddy updates his or her outline.
      Seems like this needs a more accessible UI.  Like...  how about allowing me to edit the names right in my buddy list?
      
   4/6/02; 4:55:12 PM by LMO -- Auto-archiving script?
      
      Just got around to splitting off the last week or so&#39;s archives into separate files.  There&#39;s got to be a better way.  I wonder how hard it would be to make a script that does it nightly, or at least with a high degree of automation after being pointed at a branch of my outline?" />
