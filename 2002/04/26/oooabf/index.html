<div class="content">Funny you should mention this just now. That&#39;s where I&#39;ve been heading with AmphetaDesk. The new code base I&#39;ve designed, along with a wrapper binary, should allow me to do hotpatching relatively soon. As a matter of fact, this very day I was talking about creating an App::OnlineUpdate module in perl.</div>

<div class="content">Sweet!  I was just playing with some class reloading in Python, but I&#39;ve done that in Perl before, too.
One thing I really like about Radio&#39;s updates is that since they have a mini-OS runnin on your machine anyway, they can push whole new apps down to you if you want them.  Fix bugs without you needing to download anything, close security holes, etc.
Been wondering what you&#39;ve been up to with Ampheta :)</div>
