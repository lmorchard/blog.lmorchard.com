That&#39;s where I&#39;ve been heading with AmphetaDesk. The new code base I&#39;ve designed, along with a wrapper binary, should allow me to do hotpatching relatively soon. As a matter of fact, this very day I was talking about creating an App::OnlineUpdate module in perl.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221086460&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221086460&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-04-27T12:40:10&quot;&gt;2002-04-27T12:40:10&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Sweet!  I was just playing with some class reloading in Python, but I&#39;ve done that in Perl before, too.\n</code></pre><p>One thing I really like about Radio&#39;s updates is that since they have a mini-OS runnin on your machine anyway, they can push whole new apps down to you if you want them.  Fix bugs without you needing to download anything, close security holes, etc.</p>\n<p>Been wondering what you&#39;ve been up to with Ampheta :)</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
