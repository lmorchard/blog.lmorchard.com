Like Christopher says, this started to fall apart when I needed richer data structures.</p>\n<p>As for REST, it seems that their idea is to not make function calls.  What you do with REST is to treat URIs more like database resources, on which you perform SELECT (GET), INSERT (POST), UPDATE (PUT) and DELETE (DELETE).  So instead of calling an award_points method on my player object, I UPDATE (PUT) points on the points resource of my player (represented by URI).</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
