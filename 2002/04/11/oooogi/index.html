  <meta property="og:description" content="I feel like I&amp;apos;m discovering SSI again, as if for the first time.  I&amp;apos;m using it around here to piece together a few pages with dynamic elements, among other things.  Seems like all I need most times for this, as opposed to a more general web app framework or CMS.  I&amp;apos;m sure eventually I&amp;apos;ll get tired of it after having run into all the problems everyone else in the world has, and roll my own CMS again.  Maybe this time I&amp;apos;ll stop before I get to that point and adopt someone else&amp;apos;s before I get down to wheel re-invention work.  :)  But it&amp;apos;s so fun. Anyway, my latest tinkering with SSI can be seen on the right side of 0xDECAFBAD&amp;apos;s front page:  Sibling blogs.    So far, I&amp;apos;ve got my LiveJournal blog over there, along with my RadioUserLand weblog.  Maybe in listing a few headlines over there, I can entice a few readers to my other spaces.  LiveJournal is where I do most of my general blogging, link posting, and general grousing.  (I think that&amp;apos;s my new favorite word)  The RadioUserLand weblog is just an experiment at this point, but it may eventually consume the whole site. Basically, RadioUserLand is competing with server-side CGIs and SSIs at this point.  Eventually, they will cooperate.  After that, RadioUserLand may take over. Anyway, enjoy RssDisplay if you like-- you can either download it, or PipelineTheWeb and use it straight from my site. " />
