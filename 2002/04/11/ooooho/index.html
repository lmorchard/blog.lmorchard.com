The more these things happen, the more it starts to make me think maybe I should cut loose soon and take what I&#39;ve liked about Radio and do some wheel reinvention and cloning in the Python-based things I was thinking about.

<div class="content">Ive got the same misgiving about Radio, and Ive been thinking about the wiki weblog connection too (so, happy to make your acquaintance ;-).  
However, the pace of development in the Radio space is telling us something too.  In particular, Simon Fells Word-to-Radio-via Soap hack strikes me as an instantly invaluable tool.
Which brings me to Wiki/Weblog/Radio convergences.  Im thinking
*the most impressively wonderful thing about Radio is the authors ability to work locally site and have the results mirrored on the hosted site.   Its not clear a heavily-collaborated wiki site could or should survive that.
* Why then isnt the solution to build an RSS aggregrator into the wiki so that the contents of subscribed-to weblogs are displayed by the wiki.  (Or are you trying to replace Twiki altogether via Radio?  If so, why?)  Now authors get to continue authoring weblogs in a tool optimized for weblogging and syndicating.  But readers get to read (and even modify!) the syndicated content on a tool optimized for *that*  purpose.</div>
