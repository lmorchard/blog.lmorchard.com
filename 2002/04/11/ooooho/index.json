Since January, when I bought <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a>, I've been getting sucked into the platform.  I resisted at first.. I mean why learning another language, especially one bound to a single, commecial platform?  Well, the more I played with it, the more the platform looked elegant, and the $40 I spent on it was chump change for what it can do.  I can see the foot-in-the-door when I start thinking if there's a way we can use Frontier at work.</p>\n<p>So, I'm tinkering and playing... And I'm putting up with flakey things happening, which confuses me.  Inexplicable delays, screen flashes, stuttery speed-up and slowdown of text entry.  The <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PipeFilters\">PipeFilters</a> app I'm working on is killing Radio on my iBook.  Sometimes <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a> crashes.  I just can't see what's to exotic about what I'm doing in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PipeFilters\">PipeFilters</a> what would prepare me to think it would hobble Radio regularly.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, when testing <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PipeFilters\">PipeFilters</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a> somehow manages to bring my iBook to such a grinding, HD thrashing halt, that the CPU Monitor no longer scrolls and I can't even get response from the Dock to kill Radio.  My only hope in this situation is to have a Terminal ready with a kill command typed out, launch the script in Radio that only sometimes offends, and then hit enter if things wig out, hoping that within the next 30-90 seconds the Terminal will be able to get a slice of time to eke out the kill command.</p>\n<p>Part of it might be the iBook itself.  This thing, though pretty and nice, is just not meant to run OS X.  It runs it, but I beat the crap out of it.  It feels like a 486 laptop.  I just switched to a dual 800 G4 Mac at work, and OS X is a dream there.  Though...  Radio still crashes from time to time.</p>\n<p>The more these things happen, the more it starts to make me think maybe I should cut loose soon and take what I've liked about Radio and do some wheel reinvention and cloning in the Python-based things I was thinking about.</p>\n<p>But I so want Radio to work well.  It's got so many nice ideas in it.  I'm just worried that there's too much bootstrap in there.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooooho\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089344\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0104369/2002/04/13.html\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9f3f78b261b6f185ec2e996fbd8a2326&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0104369/2002/04/13.html\">Jon Schull</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089344\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-14T00:11:17\">2002-04-14T00:11:17</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Ive got the same misgiving about Radio, and Ive been thinking about the wiki weblog connection too (so, happy to make your acquaintance ;-).  \nHowever, the pace of development in the Radio space is telling us something too.
