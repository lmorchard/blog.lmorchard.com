In particular, Simon Fells Word-to-Radio-via Soap hack strikes me as an instantly invaluable tool.\n\nWhich brings me to Wiki/Weblog/Radio convergences.  Im thinking\n\n<em>    the most impressively wonderful thing about Radio is the authors ability to work locally site and have the results mirrored on the hosted site.   Its not clear a heavily-collaborated wiki site could or should survive that.\n\n</em> Why then isnt the solution to build an RSS aggregrator into the wiki so that the contents of subscribed-to weblogs are displayed by the wiki.  (Or are you trying to replace Twiki altogether via Radio?  If so, why?)  Now authors get to continue authoring weblogs in a tool optimized for weblogging and syndicating.  But readers get to read (and even modify!) the syndicated content on a tool optimized for <em>that</em>  purpose.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
