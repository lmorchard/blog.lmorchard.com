<p>Is it just me, or did my last entry make me sound like an obsessive, compulsive nerd?  :)  Funny, I don't think I am.  If I am, it's fun anyway.  And not all that expensive.  And I actually do get out and do things and have a bit of a social life.  Really, I do.  Sometimes.</p>
<p>Oh, and I just noticed my wiki was broken for editing.  Gah, that was unfun.  Fixed now.</p>
