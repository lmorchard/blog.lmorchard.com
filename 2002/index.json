It would be a web proxy, email filter, spam cop, a place for agents and schedule tasks to run and more. It would be responsible for both receiving and sending of information - as web pages, emails, web services requests, ftp file postings, etc. In the middle it would do analysis like for Spam or <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> autodiscovery, intelligent bookmark history, etc. ...  This sort of app would be for people like myself who spend an innordinate amount of time on the internet.</i></blockquote>Precisely.  Exactly.  Even down to the combination of P2P and desktop-to-server mix he writes about.  I think we&#39;re starting to ride a meme here.  This is what I want from a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy\">PersonalWebProxy</a>.  I&#39;ve been trying to think of a better name for this class of app - it&#39;s more than a literal web proxy.  I want an agent and an assistant - something that sits shotgun with me while I putter around and can help me study what I do and see.  I want something that can eventually do things in my name for me, if I allow it.  I want basically all the things Russell wants, along with everything agents do for the characters in David Brin&#39;s <i>Earth</i>.\n<br /><br />\nSo.  How to <strong>do</strong> this?  I think I need to spend some more time fleshing out a spec before I do much more in terms of putting gadgets together.  Need to reign in the fantasy, lay out some feasible first revision features, and start.  I want it all, but I want to start out with something hackable, useful, and inviting for collaboration.\n<br /><br />\nStill probably too early to be thinking about implementation language, but I have been experimenting and expect some of these things to become the base for my development.  My ideas on choices have become less clear-cut now.  When last <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000362.phtml\" target=\"_top\">I wrote</a> about this topic, and languages, <a href=\"http://www.ulaluma.com/pyx\" target=\"_top\">Donovan Preston</a> left a comment enlightening me with regards to my Python/Twisted vs Java/Threads consideration.  In fact, threads are available in the Python/Twisted environment as well.  So, now I&#39;m back to thinking about things like free library availability, environment maturity, possible collaborators, and my own comfort level in each.\n<br /><br />\nBah.  At this point, I think I know all I need to know about what various environment choices can do in order to come up with a set of features that can be reasonably implemented in either or any environment.  Need to solidify this wishlist into a task list and design and get going.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ooocff</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087249\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0114241/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=527a02c0012ff2583c9e8654cd2bd97c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0114241/\">Ray Grieselhuber</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087249\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-12-29T01:55:16\">2002-12-29T01:55:16</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">This, to me, is the next generation in portal server & web collaboration technology.

    "body": "<cite>Russell Beattie</cite> <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/index.jsp?date=20021227#160210\" target=\"_top\">writes</a>:<blockquote><i> The idea in my mind is for a project that would be a universal personal proxy (UPP) that sits between you and the internet. It would be a web proxy, email filter, spam cop, a place for agents and schedule tasks to run and more. It would be responsible for both receiving and sending of information - as web pages, emails, web services requests, ftp file postings, etc. In the middle it would do analysis like for Spam or <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> autodiscovery, intelligent bookmark history, etc. ...  This sort of app would be for people like myself who spend an innordinate amount of time on the internet.</i></blockquote>Precisely.  Exactly.  Even down to the combination of P2P and desktop-to-server mix he writes about.  I think we're starting to ride a meme here.  This is what I want from a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy\">PersonalWebProxy</a>.  I've been trying to think of a better name for this class of app - it's more than a literal web proxy.  I want an agent and an assistant - something that sits shotgun with me while I putter around and can help me study what I do and see.  I want something that can eventually do things in my name for me, if I allow it.  I want basically all the things Russell wants, along with everything agents do for the characters in David Brin's <i>Earth</i>.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo.  How to <strong>do</strong> this?  I think I need to spend some more time fleshing out a spec before I do much more in terms of putting gadgets together.  Need to reign in the fantasy, lay out some feasible first revision features, and start.  I want it all, but I want to start out with something hackable, useful, and inviting for collaboration.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nStill probably too early to be thinking about implementation language, but I have been experimenting and expect some of these things to become the base for my development.  My ideas on choices have become less clear-cut now.  When last <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000362.phtml\" target=\"_top\">I wrote</a> about this topic, and languages, <a href=\"http://www.ulaluma.com/pyx\" target=\"_top\">Donovan Preston</a> left a comment enlightening me with regards to my Python/Twisted vs Java/Threads consideration.  In fact, threads are available in the Python/Twisted environment as well.  So, now I'm back to thinking about things like free library availability, environment maturity, possible collaborators, and my own comfort level in each.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBah.  At this point, I think I know all I need to know about what various environment choices can do in order to come up with a set of features that can be reasonably implemented in either or any environment.  Need to solidify this wishlist into a task list and design and get going.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=ooocff\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087249\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0114241/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=527a02c0012ff2583c9e8654cd2bd97c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0114241/\">Ray Grieselhuber</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087249\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-12-29T01:55:16\">2002-12-29T01:55:16</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">This, to me, is the next generation in portal server & web collaboration technology.

It would be a web proxy, email filter, spam cop, a place for agents and schedule tasks to run and more. It would be responsible for both receiving and sending of information - as web pages, emails, web services requests, ftp file postings, etc. In the middle it would do analysis like for Spam or <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> autodiscovery, intelligent bookmark history, etc. ...  This sort of app would be for people like myself who spend an innordinate amount of time on the internet.</i></blockquote>Precisely.  Exactly.  Even down to the combination of P2P and desktop-to-server mix he writes about.  I think we&apos;re starting to ride a meme here.  This is what I want from a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy\">PersonalWebProxy</a>.  I&apos;ve been trying to think of a better name for this class of app - it&apos;s more than a literal web proxy.  I want an agent and an assistant - something that sits shotgun with me while I putter around and can help me study what I do and see.  I want something that can eventually do things in my name for me, if I allow it.  I want basically all the things Russell wants, along with everything agents do for the characters in David Brin&apos;s <i>Earth</i>.\n<br><br>\nSo.  How to <strong>do</strong> this?  I think I need to spend some more time fleshing out a spec before I do much more in terms of putting gadgets together.  Need to reign in the fantasy, lay out some feasible first revision features, and start.  I want it all, but I want to start out with something hackable, useful, and inviting for collaboration.\n<br><br>\nStill probably too early to be thinking about implementation language, but I have been experimenting and expect some of these things to become the base for my development.  My ideas on choices have become less clear-cut now.  When last <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000362.phtml\" target=\"_top\">I wrote</a> about this topic, and languages, <a href=\"http://www.ulaluma.com/pyx\" target=\"_top\">Donovan Preston</a> left a comment enlightening me with regards to my Python/Twisted vs Java/Threads consideration.  In fact, threads are available in the Python/Twisted environment as well.  So, now I&apos;m back to thinking about things like free library availability, environment maturity, possible collaborators, and my own comfort level in each.\n<br><br>\nBah.  At this point, I think I know all I need to know about what various environment choices can do in order to come up with a set of features that can be reasonably implemented in either or any environment.  Need to solidify this wishlist into a task list and design and get going.<p></p>\n"

Took about 15 min. for newsfeeds to be retrieved, OK, IE opens, outliner opens with all channels collapsed. Tried to expand, got an error on page message.\nSo, I figured I'd try another browser, I don't like IE anyway, so I opened Mozilla 1.2, copied in link, EveryThing Works Fine.\nIt looks great, now I know what everyone was raving about.

However, there's absolutely no reason you can't use threads if you continue with your Twisted implementation. Twisted fully supports the Half-Async/Half-Threaded design pattern. See twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorThreads for information.\nThe benefits of this design pattern are obvious. You get the speed advantages of the asynchronous bottom layer, which is already written, and the business logic code that runs in threads can be naive. Zope uses this design pattern to allow page assembly code to run synchronous db queries, xml-rpc queries, etc.\nEwan Grantham: You can help if this project is continued in Python; if you know Java, you're going to have no problem learning Python, and you're going to have tons of fun using it.\nPersonally, I am very interested in developing and using the PersonalWebProxy. The first thing I thought about writing was a look-ahead accellerator -- when you visit a page, the proxy fetches that page and all the pages that are linked from that page, so when you click a link the page is already downloaded.\nAnother thing I'd like is a permanent history. Whenever I use any browser to browse through the proxy, the PWP should keep track of where I have been, and allow me to review this history chronologically, and also perhaps automatically sort things by keyword. I'd also like this history to be (once I have set up PWP to do so) synchronized with a remote server, so for example, when I am browsing at home, my history file gets synchronized with my web host, and when I am browsing at work, the same history file on my web host is updated.\nSomething that goes along with this idea is a permanent bookmarks interface. Visiting the PWP application on a certain web port should show me a list of bookmarks and allow me to add to them, categorize them, etc. The big advantage here would be the syncronization I just talked about with my web host space. My bookmarks would then be available from any host on the internet; no matter what machine I am using (as long as I'm running PWP), my bookmarks would also be locally available.\nAnother idea I have been thinking about ever since you started talking about the PersonalWebProxy project is something like a mail proxy. The way it would work is, you would set up the PWP to connect to your mail account as a client. It would then download certain mail messages (more about that later) and re-serve them as a local mail server. You would then set up your email client to talk to the mail server running inside PWP. Thus, the same sort of transformation that occurs while you're browsing web pages occurs to your email.\nThe first thing I would do with this is set up the server only to download email from email addresses in a certain list. Then I would allow rules based sorting. Of course, this functionality is all present in a basic email client, but once you're relatively sure you're not downloading spam you can start doing more interesting things. (The idea of only downloading email messages from people in a list is similar to only accepting instant messages from people in your buddy list)\nSo things start to get more interesting: We index email for searching, and synchronize email with the email repository on my web host; we parse email messages from friends looking for URLs and have the web proxy immediately download the pages so they are on the hard drive for later, instant viewing; we can send ourselves commands in a simple command language from anything that can send email. Commands could be things like \"Bookmark this URL that I don't have time to look at right now\"; \"Delay delivery of this reminder until the event is near\"; etc.\nAnyway, this is all just wild pie-in-the-sky dreaming, which I don't normally do. But the prospects of improving our daily internet experience with these ideas, using an application built on Twisted, is very exciting, and very possible.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087188\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5a70d939a73fa73603f2a9255ab81d21&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">BillSeitz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087188\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-12-27T18:39:42\">2002-12-27T18:39:42</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I hear your conflict on the Python/Twisted thing.

A web proxy that can be proactive in constantly searching and updating information in various bins/areas of interest is certainly going to be helpful.\r\n\r\nFWIW,\r\nEwan</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087184\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.averagejackal.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8567583b271540e491e51e5f253e8252&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.averagejackal.net\">Mark M</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087184\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-12-23T18:37:15\">2002-12-23T18:37:15</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Do it in Java!

However, there's absolutely no reason you can't use threads if you continue with your Twisted implementation. Twisted fully supports the Half-Async/Half-Threaded design pattern. See twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorThreads for information.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of this design pattern are obvious. You get the speed advantages of the asynchronous bottom layer, which is already written, and the business logic code that runs in threads can be naive. Zope uses this design pattern to allow page assembly code to run synchronous db queries, xml-rpc queries, etc.\r\n\r\nEwan Grantham: You can help if this project is continued in Python; if you know Java, you're going to have no problem learning Python, and you're going to have tons of fun using it.\r\n \r\nPersonally, I am very interested in developing and using the PersonalWebProxy. The first thing I thought about writing was a look-ahead accellerator -- when you visit a page, the proxy fetches that page and all the pages that are linked from that page, so when you click a link the page is already downloaded.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I'd like is a permanent history. Whenever I use any browser to browse through the proxy, the PWP should keep track of where I have been, and allow me to review this history chronologically, and also perhaps automatically sort things by keyword. I'd also like this history to be (once I have set up PWP to do so) synchronized with a remote server, so for example, when I am browsing at home, my history file gets synchronized with my web host, and when I am browsing at work, the same history file on my web host is updated.\r\n\r\nSomething that goes along with this idea is a permanent bookmarks interface. Visiting the PWP application on a certain web port should show me a list of bookmarks and allow me to add to them, categorize them, etc. The big advantage here would be the syncronization I just talked about with my web host space. My bookmarks would then be available from any host on the internet; no matter what machine I am using (as long as I'm running PWP), my bookmarks would also be locally available.\r\n\r\nAnother idea I have been thinking about ever since you started talking about the PersonalWebProxy project is something like a mail proxy. The way it would work is, you would set up the PWP to connect to your mail account as a client. It would then download certain mail messages (more about that later) and re-serve them as a local mail server. You would then set up your email client to talk to the mail server running inside PWP. Thus, the same sort of transformation that occurs while you're browsing web pages occurs to your email.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I would do with this is set up the server only to download email from email addresses in a certain list. Then I would allow rules based sorting. Of course, this functionality is all present in a basic email client, but once you're relatively sure you're not downloading spam you can start doing more interesting things. (The idea of only downloading email messages from people in a list is similar to only accepting instant messages from people in your buddy list)\r\n\r\nSo things start to get more interesting: We index email for searching, and synchronize email with the email repository on my web host; we parse email messages from friends looking for URLs and have the web proxy immediately download the pages so they are on the hard drive for later, instant viewing; we can send ourselves commands in a simple command language from anything that can send email. Commands could be things like \"Bookmark this URL that I don't have time to look at right now\"; \"Delay delivery of this reminder until the event is near\"; etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is all just wild pie-in-the-sky dreaming, which I don't normally do. But the prospects of improving our daily internet experience with these ideas, using an application built on Twisted, is very exciting, and very possible.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087188\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5a70d939a73fa73603f2a9255ab81d21&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">BillSeitz</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087188\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-12-27T18:39:42\">2002-12-27T18:39:42</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I hear your conflict on the Python/Twisted thing.

For the most part, what he wants is what I want from my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy\">PersonalWebProxy</a>, and more.<br><br><br>\nThe big difference in the writing, though, is that Matt writes from features and what he wants, where I&apos;m already describing things in terms of implementation.  That is, I started talking about &quot;proxy&quot; where he&apos;s talking about &quot;my personal Google and Wayback machine&quot;.  I think looking at it that way makes a more compelling case for this thing being generally useful, rather than just some nerdy toy.\n<br><br>\nAnother way I&apos;m looking at this <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy\">PersonalWebProxy</a> is as an assistant in a sidecar attached to my browser.  I want this assistant to watch me, learn, and pipe up from time to time with suggestions.  I also want to be able to ask questions and to remind me of things I vaguely remember.  Eventually, I&apos;d like this assistant to be able to drive for me from time to time, doing some info hunter-gatherer work for me while I do other things.\n<br><br>\nI&apos;m still working on this thing.  So far I&apos;ve got a proxy in Python and a simple-minded plugin framework.  Two plugins so far: one is a cookie jar separated from any browser - that is, cookies are managed in the proxy, not in the browser; the other is a little thing based on Mark Pilgrim&apos;s <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/15.html\">rssfinder.py</a> that quietly seeks out and gathers <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> links from every text/* resource I view.  It seems to be standing up fairly well.\n<br><br>\nMy next steps are something along these lines:  Should I continue in Python?  To do so means delving deeper into Twisted, using their web app framework for the management UI and staying within their event-driven paradigm in lieu of threading.  The reason I first chose Python is because I wanted something that was quickly and easily hackable and fun to contribute plugins for.  Does this still apply, if things are deep in the Twisted mindset which is not <strong>quite</strong> straightforward?\n<br><br>\nOn the other hand, I took a peek at <a href=\"http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/\">Jetty</a> in Java, which also comes with a simple and hackable HTTP proxy implementation.  I could easily cobble together in Java what I have in Python using this.  I would also say that I could easily make it compatible with whatever plugins were written for the Python version, using Jython, but there&apos;s also a paradigmatic difference were I to go with Java:  Threads in lieu of event-driven design.\n<br><br>\nMaybe I&apos;m thinking too much about this and should just keep doing what I&apos;m doing.  I&apos;m trying to think and second guess a lot about what anyone who might care to play with this thing would actually care about.   As for myself, I seem to be having fun with things as is.</p>\n"

    "html": "<p>This week, at work, I cobbled together a hack for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> that hooks it up with an LDAP server for author accounts: <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableTypeLDAPAuthors\">MovableTypeLDAPAuthors</a>.  This is an early, early, early release of the thing, and is likely to do very nasty things for all that I know.  But, I wanted to share, and it seems to be working for the proof of concept at work (that is, MT weblogs on our intranet for every employee).  Hopefully soon it&#39;ll be approved, and I&#39;ll be looking into a commercial use license for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>.\n<br /><br />\nYou know, for all the praise I&#39;ve read about <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>, something I&#39;ve really not seen much attention toward is the code itself.  I mean, yeah this thing is great, and it&#39;s so simple to install and use by even non-techies.  But, under the hood, there&#39;re some nice things going on - like a very decent object persistence approach; templating for pretty strict code/presentation separation; a workable servlet-like app structure with facilities for localization and a dispatch-table approach to executing web app methods.  There are some spots that are a bit too if/else-ful for my taste, like the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/CMS\">CMS</a>&#39; edit_object() method, but hey, it works.\n<br /><br />\nIn other words, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> isn&#39;t just a cobbled together tangle of code that happens to produce weblogs.  I&#39;ve seen piles of well-used code on the web before that all seem to do what they advertise, but present a nightmare under the hood.  (<strong>cough</strong> Matt Wright&#39;s famous scripts <strong>cough</strong>)  No, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> looks like the result of experience, and I feel biased, because it demonstrates a lot of the same perl web app design patterns I&#39;ve been employing and advocating for years now.  So, my LDAP hack was a bit of enjoyable fun, instead of a chore.\n<br /><br />\nAlong the lines of what I&#39;d written last week <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000354.phtml\">about perfection versus good enough</a>, I think <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> is a good example.  It&#39;s something I <strong>could</strong> have written, but <strong>didn&#39;t</strong> write and <strong>didn&#39;t</strong> release and <strong>didn&#39;t</strong> support and <strong>didn&#39;t</strong> make lots of people happy along the way.

    "summary": "<p>So I&apos;m singing the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> praises at work today.  I&apos;ve gone through creating a very small proof-of-concept task tracking vocabulary in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a>.  Initially, it covers things such as clients, projects, tasks, workers, time card entries.  So far, I just have a vocabulary in RDFS and a sample load of data - both built by hand - but thanks to <a href=\"http://brownsauce.sourceforge.net\" target=\"_top\">the BrownSauce RDF browser</a>, I&apos;ve been able to show off some nifty things.  I know I&apos;ve linked to that project two days in a row now, but I think it was seeing things through that browser that finally turned the last tumbler in my mental lock on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a>.</p>\n<p>As a demo to co-workers, just clicking through the linked resources, I can show who&apos;s managing what projects, who&apos;s been assigned what tasks, what a given person has worked on, etc.  And I just keep drilling through links showing one view of relations after another.  It&apos;s fun.  Someone said it looks like how they breeze through data on fake computers in TV shows.</p>\n<p>Eventually what we want to do, if this proves to be useful, is expand this thing from just task tracking to slurp down more and more knowledge from around the organization and form a semantic intranet.  And, I think it can do it.  I just started getting <a href=\"http://www.hpl.hp.com/semweb/jena-top.html\" target=\"_top\">Jena</a> stashing statements into a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MySQL\">MySQL</a> database, so my next steps are to start actually working up an application around the data.</p>\n<p>So far so good.  I hope I&apos;m not insane to be thinking this is easy.  Waiting for the enthusiasm to calm down so I can realistically take account of what warts are to be found in the current state of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> art.</p>\n"

At the moment, it's not much code and is transparent except for the fact that it transforms every appearance of \"0xDECAFBAD\" on pages into \"0x31337D00D\".  What's exciting to me though, is that I tossed it together with an hour's hacking in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Python\">Python</a>, using the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Twisted\">Twisted</a> framework.

In particular, the <a href=\"http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/wbi/index.html\" target=\"_top\">WBI project</a> at IBM got me initially hooked on things.  I really thought it was nifty how they edited HTML on the fly to weave in the WBI UI and add indicators on links in the page.  And the idea of storing a history of one's web browsing in a local cache, available for review and later search, has always seemed incredibly attractive.</p>\n<p>Lately, I've been thinking of a few more things that might be useful in a personal web proxy:<br />\n<ul>\n<li> Marking pages to be periodically checked for change notification.<br />\n</li>\n<li> A browsing \"shopping cart\", in which to collect pages now for later browsing.<br />\n</li>\n<li> Auto-harvest <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF\">FOAF</a>, and whatever other associated page metadata that might be useful now or later.  Maybe suggest subscribing to the site after a few visits.<br />\n</li>\n<li> Use a ubiquitous rating mechanism, machine learning, and maybe some off-peak spidering to have new content of interest suggested.<br />\n</li>\n<li> Publish and share browsing patterns, generate \"Friends who viewed this page today also viewed this today...\"<br />\n</li>\n<li> Generate <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds for all notification features<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nAnd then, of course, there are things that I've seen already in other projects:<br />\n    * Rich browsing history<br />\n<ul>\n<li> Collaborative annotation<br />\n</li>\n<li> Ad filtering &amp; pop-up blocking<br />\n</li>\n<li> Content summarization<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nI'm thinking it would be nice to put together something like WBI and its modular API, maybe in Python, and make this thing super friendly to quick hacking.

I like to share differnt/funny/off beat links and it works fairly well for that, but the sorting/category system is too cumbersome for 'real' links. A proxy that might add headers (for quick insertion into the db) not to mention filtering and automatic google \"relating\" (I've been using that a lot recently) not too mentio a host of other things might be an elegant way to combine much, while requiring a minimal level of use i/o\nThanks for the idea....

I like to share differnt/funny/off beat links and it works fairly well for that, but the sorting/category system is too cumbersome for 'real' links. A proxy that might add headers (for quick insertion into the db) not to mention filtering and automatic google \"relating\" (I've been using that a lot recently) not too mentio a host of other things might be an elegant way to combine much, while requiring a minimal level of use i/o\r\n\r\nThanks for the idea....

Not a gigantic improvement, but it ends up being just enough to be nifty and was free to boot.  Also, I splurged a little bit before starting Christmas shopping, and replaced the 256MB of RAM with a 512MB module.  The improvement from 384MB to 640MB under <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOSX\">MacOSX</a> was much more marked than I&apos;d anticipated.  I don&apos;t know what kept me so long.</p>\n<p>So, my desires for a new iBook or a glitzy <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/TiBook?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">TiBook</font></span> are dampened for now, and my pocket book thanks me.  And, if/when I decide to toss this thing up onto eBay, the extras couldn&apos;t hurt the value.  Also, I imagine that my expectations of OS X will have set me up for amazement once I get to play with a machine that supports Quartz Extreme and has a more decent processor speed.</p>\n"

    "summary": "<p>Tonight, I was perplexed about a comment claiming to be from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner\">DaveWiner</a> - though it could just as easily be from an impostor - on the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000342.phtml\">final installment</a> of my extended <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> ramblings:</p><blockquote><i>Pretty arrogant if you ask me. What has LM Orchard contributed to the world? Add more value, less bluster and bullshit.</i></blockquote>I suppose I should have stopped while I was ahead, refraining from rambling on about my case study to begin with, let alone responding to this comment.  But, nonetheless I was bothered tonight, and responded:<blockquote><i>Your comment confuses me.<p></p>\n<p>I&apos;ve written that your work has helped me and given me food for thought - despite other disagreements I may have with you. And I&apos;ve written that a tool of yours I&apos;ve come to consider imperfect has, nonetheless, worked perfectly for me. These things remind me that I don&apos;t know it all and have much to learn and hash out. If this is bluster and bullshit, I certainly didn&apos;t intend it as such.</p>\n</i><p><i>As for my contributions and value - I&apos;d like to think I&apos;m doing something right in this field, given that I still have a well-paying job and a non-zero readership of my weblog.</i></p></blockquote>I <strong>was</strong> trying to give a compliment and a positive testimonial, while addressing some of the standard criticisms I&apos;d seen before.  And I wanted to back it up with my own experiences while tempering it with my admitted inexperience.<p></p>\n<p>But, after having had a decent dinner and a measure of time watching soap operas with my girlfriend on the couch, I&apos;ve decided that this is what tweaks me about the comment:  What&apos;s a weblog for, if it doesn&apos;t make room for arrogant bluster and bullshit?  My assumption in writing here is that I know enough or can figure enough out to write things valuable to <strong>someone</strong> - or at least, if I&apos;m wrong, I can still provide myself as a foil of ignorance to someone else&apos;s enlightenment.  </p>\n<p>Attacking the process, or the village idiot himself, is not constructive.</p>\n<p>Hope that helps.  Have a nice day.  Please drive through.</p>\n"

The spirit of it, in my mind, was mobile blogging.<p></p>\n<p>Then, I read about Moblogging and assume it&apos;s the same thing.  But, Bryce points out an important distinction that I think I get now.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlogWalking\">BlogWalking</a> is coming from one direction, trying to make the blog mobile.  Moblogging comes from the other direction, trying to make the mobile blogged.  </p>\n<p>I&apos;d off-handedly wondered what it would be like as a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlogWalker\">BlogWalker</a>, if I could add a camera, GPS device, temperature sensor, and other various things to a PDA loaded with blog software - I already have the blog, but I want to add multimedia to it.  Well, Mobloggers already have multimedia devices, with voice and imaging and more to come - they want to capture that content in a blog.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s a subtle difference, but somewhat important, I think.  And after experiences with my Treo, an admittedly underpowered device versus the Zaurus, I&apos;m leaning toward Moblogging.  Keep the blog software off the mobile device, but make the mobile device into a multimedia blogging terminal.  I think Moblogging is really the spirit of what I want from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlogWalking\">BlogWalking</a>.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m hoping for a color <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/HipTop\">HipTop</a> after my Sprint PCS contract is up.  The Treo has been nice to me, but it hasn&apos;t amazed me.  Although the grass is always greener, the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/HipTop\">HipTop</a> seem the more amazing device to me.</p>\n"

The question to which I <strong>don&apos;t</strong> have an answer is this:  How many developers&apos; problems fall into my kind of domain?</p>\n<p>Third and lastly, though I didn&apos;t get any flames for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> advocacy itself, I got a few private nastygrams flaming me for talking nice about <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner\">DaveWiner</a>&apos;s work after I&apos;d <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000278.phtml\">talked not so nice</a> about him some months ago.  With regard to that, I have to say that I&apos;m not on any particular crusade, other than for that which I find interesting.  That said, I dislike many things Dave does and says.  Though I&apos;d rather not add fuel to fires, I might fail to resist on occasion - as noted above.  However, I&apos;m not the guy who&apos;s going to change his ways, he obviously doesn&apos;t feel a need to change, and I frequently don&apos;t have all the facts anyway.  But I do like some of the guy&apos;s contributions to the world, so when occasion arises (as it did with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>), I&apos;ll say so.  In any case, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner\">DaveWiner</a> has given me much food for thought.<br>\n</p>\n"

Weblog archives can consume a great deal of space, yet those pages are infrequently requested. Why not GZip entries from previous months and use a 404 handler to extract pages as-needed?</i></blockquote>The funky caching to which he refers involves implementing a 404 (page not found) handler that, instead of just supplying condolences for a missing page, actually digs the page up out of cold storage if it can.  I think I need to look into this for my site - throw all the old blog entries away into gzipped files, or maybe a tarball per month, and have a funky 404 handler dig them out when needed.\n<br /><br />\nThere are issues with this - such as what happens if I want to edit old content, or I change templates, or what not - but I think there could be decent solutions for those.  Hell, maybe this is an easier way to blog locally and publish globally - don&#39;t rsync directories of files, just publish locally and upload a new tarball.  Then, on the remote site, delete the index, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> files, and other affected files and watch happy updates ensue.  If a massive site change is made, rebuild locally, re-tarball every thing, upload the new tarballs, and delete all remote content to trigger revivification.

By sending a 404, you're telling the user-agent that \"the server has not found anything matching the Request-URI,\" when you mean to say \"the server found the page matching the Request-URI (despite it being stored locally in a compressed archive).\" In general, the user-agent doesn't need to, and shouldn't, know how the data is stored on the server. So the fact that it is compressed on the server is irrelevant to a user-agent requesting the data.\nTherefore, hijacking a webserver's 404 mechanism to provide this functionality is sub-optimal.

Then, delete some key known changed pages, and updates happen upon visitor demand.\nThis might be easier to manage with some web hosting accounts that allow 404 handler CGIs, but not databases or other software installation.  Then again, it could just all be more work than ever necessary, but it sounds like a nifty idea.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "So, while I was catching up on T Bryce Yehl's blog since missing <a href=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/blog/2002/11/04/so_long_radio.html\">his transition</a> to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>, I caught an <a href=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/blog/2002/11/18/dynamic_vs_static.html\">interesting blurb he wrote</a> with regards to <a href=\"http://philringnalda.com/archives/002388.php\">Phil Ringnalda's ponderings</a> on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FriedPages\">FriedPages</a> and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BakedPages\">BakedPages</a> in weblogs:<blockquote><i>\"Funky caching\" could be useful for a static publishing system as well. Weblog archives can consume a great deal of space, yet those pages are infrequently requested. Why not GZip entries from previous months and use a 404 handler to extract pages as-needed?</i></blockquote>The funky caching to which he refers involves implementing a 404 (page not found) handler that, instead of just supplying condolences for a missing page, actually digs the page up out of cold storage if it can.  I think I need to look into this for my site - throw all the old blog entries away into gzipped files, or maybe a tarball per month, and have a funky 404 handler dig them out when needed.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThere are issues with this - such as what happens if I want to edit old content, or I change templates, or what not - but I think there could be decent solutions for those.  Hell, maybe this is an easier way to blog locally and publish globally - don't rsync directories of files, just publish locally and upload a new tarball.  Then, on the remote site, delete the index, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> files, and other affected files and watch happy updates ensue.  If a massive site change is made, rebuild locally, re-tarball every thing, upload the new tarballs, and delete all remote content to trigger revivification.

Weblog archives can consume a great deal of space, yet those pages are infrequently requested. Why not GZip entries from previous months and use a 404 handler to extract pages as-needed?</i></blockquote>The funky caching to which he refers involves implementing a 404 (page not found) handler that, instead of just supplying condolences for a missing page, actually digs the page up out of cold storage if it can.  I think I need to look into this for my site - throw all the old blog entries away into gzipped files, or maybe a tarball per month, and have a funky 404 handler dig them out when needed.\n<br><br>\nThere are issues with this - such as what happens if I want to edit old content, or I change templates, or what not - but I think there could be decent solutions for those.  Hell, maybe this is an easier way to blog locally and publish globally - don&apos;t rsync directories of files, just publish locally and upload a new tarball.  Then, on the remote site, delete the index, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> files, and other affected files and watch happy updates ensue.  If a massive site change is made, rebuild locally, re-tarball every thing, upload the new tarballs, and delete all remote content to trigger revivification.  Scary but possibly nifty.<p></p>\n"

    "html": "<p>So, from my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000333.phtml\">last installment</a>, I left off with this:  My daily situation with regards to integrating the web-based services of various parties boils down to what I can explain in 30 minutes to a developer of unknown competence to whom I&#39;m barely a priority.  So far, I&#39;ve been able to apply <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> as a solution to this problem with a great degree of success.\n<br /><br />\nAbout this, endulging me although I&#39;m sure issues like mine have been hashed out a million times already on various mailing lists, <a href=\"http://www.blogstream.com/pauls/1038403139\">Paul Prescod writes</a>:<blockquote><i>There&#39;s nothing wrong with the way you&#39;ve used XML-RPC and I&#39;ve used it that way myself. I only write to ensure that you (and anyone reading) understands the costs and benefits of this approach. You&#39;ve given up on many of the feature of the underlying XML and HTTP technologies. If you don&#39;t need the features, then amen, let her rip. But people building more substantial apps do need them.</i></blockquote>\n<br /><br />\nYes.  So, I know that my chosen solution has its blemishes and land mines awaiting my step.  But, none of them have bitten me yet, nor do I expect them to for some time.  On the contrary, for every practical application of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> we&#39;ve deployed, we&#39;ve had happy clients.  While working in this industry, the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=80/20%20rule\">80/20 rule</a> has been beaten into me - so if a solution that&#39;s 20% complete solves 80% of our problems, it&#39;s time to move onto the next problem.\n<br /><br />\nThis, however, is a dangerous thing to become complacent about - there&#39;re still 20% worth of problems out there for which this solution falls down.  And each one will become a work-till-3-am nightmare when they hit.  And besides, I&#39;m a perfectionist and a purist at heart, so the dirtiness of this solution will never fail to irk me.  It may be simple, but simple is not necessarily elegant.  So what about the rest of Paul&#39;s points?\n<br /><br /></p>\n<blockquote><i>The first axis of flexibility you've given up is in character set. XML-RPC disallows Unicode character strings.</i></blockquote>On one hand, my impulse is to respond to this by invoking <a href=\"http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?String=exact&amp;Acronym=YAGNI\">YAGNI</a> - since our use of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> involves messages between machines, I don't care about localizing those.  I'll just keep to language neutral data in there.  But, I'm naive.  With a bit of pondering, I can identify at least one area where user-supplied input needs to be traded - shared registration and login for global promotions.  And if I can identify one, there's bound to be more.  I don't have as much experience with Unicode and handling languages other than English as I'd like, so I can't trust my assumptions here.\n<br /><br />\n<blockquote><i>XML-RPC is brutally non-extensible. ... Dave Winer has been actively hostile to every effort to evolve XML-RPC.</i></blockquote>In this case, I'd say this is a good thing, for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> in particular.  It does what it does, no more and no less, and this will never change.  I will never need to bring up versions of the spec in my 1/2 hour conversation with the junior engineer.  And though I don't want to second guess Dave Winer, I assume this is the goal in his insistence on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> being ever frozen.  The alternative at which he points, if memory serves, is SOAP.\n<br /><br />\n<blockquote><i>The third aspect: XML itself. What will happen when and if your industry, whatever it is, canonizes a schema for what you do, like the hundreds of existing ones. ... Maybe your industry isn't organized enough to define a schema for whatever it is you do.</i></blockquote>Bingo.  Our industry is neither mature nor organized enough to conceive of any sort of schema.  Our products and the concepts involved in our work are in constant change, not to mention the conditions of the market and what will continue to work.\n<br /><br />\n<blockquote><i>Another way of attacking your interoperability problem would be to start from that point of view, defining the XML and then working back to the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> system. That's a much more natural way to define a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>-based web service and is arguably a better way to define web services in general. I would be curious whether you tried this.</i></blockquote>Nope, haven't tried this.  This is where I start calling things \"ivory tower\".  To me, it makes elegant sense.  \n<br /><br />\n<blockquote><i>You say you tried \"REST-ish URL schemes\" but that isn't the same as trying <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>. In particular, you don't say much about what your XML strategy was.</i></blockquote>Calling our early interop schemes \"REST-ish\" may have been too strong an association with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>.  No XML strategy.  More like: \"Make a GET to this URL with these query parameters, documented here.  You'll get a simple text response back, documented here.\"  This was always balked at, though I thought it was the simplest thing in the world.  I might have some thoughts on the failure of this, if I think about it some more.\n<br /><br />\n<blockquote><i>I don't know your suppliers, but in the vast majority of situations I have been exposed to, they \"get it\" if you tell them: \"here are some XML example documents. POST things like that to me when you want me to do something and GET them from me when you want to get information from me.\"</i></blockquote>Whenever XML is brought up, fear rises and eyes glaze.  We're the \"supplier\" in most situations, and it's rare that our clients are tech-centered companies.

These are two technologies that most real network application developers already know and will need to know going into the future. The gist of your story is that the people consuming your application are not network application developers and do not need the extensibility, flexibility and XML-integration of the REST model.

But that is not true. Web Services have made such a miniscule impact in our day to day lives because they solve less than 20% of the integration problems they were supposed to solve (rough guess). Conversely, the Blog world would crash to a halt without REST (in its HTML,  RSS and Trackback incarnations).\nFor the 20% that XML-RPC solves, by all means use it!

So, I know that my chosen solution has its blemishes and land mines awaiting my step.  But, none of them have bitten me yet, nor do I expect them to for some time.  On the contrary, for every practical application of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> we've deployed, we've had happy clients.  While working in this industry, the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=80/20%20rule\">80/20 rule</a> has been beaten into me - so if a solution that's 20% complete solves 80% of our problems, it's time to move onto the next problem.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis, however, is a dangerous thing to become complacent about - there're still 20% worth of problems out there for which this solution falls down.  And each one will become a work-till-3-am nightmare when they hit.  And besides, I'm a perfectionist and a purist at heart, so the dirtiness of this solution will never fail to irk me.  It may be simple, but simple is not necessarily elegant.  So what about the rest of Paul's points?\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<blockquote><i>The first axis of flexibility you've given up is in character set.

I'll just keep to language neutral data in there.  But, I'm naive.  With a bit of pondering, I can identify at least one area where user-supplied input needs to be traded - shared registration and login for global promotions.  And if I can identify one, there's bound to be more.  I don't have as much experience with Unicode and handling languages other than English as I'd like, so I can't trust my assumptions here.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<blockquote><i>XML-RPC is brutally non-extensible. ...

It does what it does, no more and no less, and this will never change.  I will never need to bring up versions of the spec in my 1/2 hour conversation with the junior engineer.  And though I don't want to second guess Dave Winer, I assume this is the goal in his insistence on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> being ever frozen.

Our industry is neither mature nor organized enough to conceive of any sort of schema.  Our products and the concepts involved in our work are in constant change, not to mention the conditions of the market and what will continue to work.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<blockquote><i>Another way of attacking your interoperability problem would be to start from that point of view, defining the XML and then working back to the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> system.

No XML strategy.  More like: \"Make a GET to this URL with these query parameters, documented here.

If they use a SOAP encoding, you get some of that. But there just is nothing simpler than saying &quot;Here&#39;s the XML-RPC interface, and some sample code in a few of the popular scripting languages.&quot; If you want developers to get going quickly, avoid the religious wars, just support XML-RPC. Now even this isn&#39;t bluster-free. Think of it as evangelism. Have a nice day.</i></blockquote>Though I don&#39;t like his remarks on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>, I gotta give Dave an <i>amen</i> here and thank him for having <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> out there for me to stumble upon.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> seems shiny and neat to me but incomplete - I&#39;m pulling for it because it seems warm and fuzzy to my ivory tower branes.  SOAP seems to try to be nice &amp; clean, but feels grungy and toxic to me and I&#39;ve always felt a vague sense of unease when walking past its house on the block.  In the middle, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> seems to be the right balance of dirt and acidity to grow things in.\n<br /><br />\nAbout <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>, I can speak with some experience now.  I first started tinkering with it a few months shy of a year ago, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000020.phtml#000020\">when I first launched this blog</a>.  I went to <a href=\"http://www.xmlrpc.com\" target=\"_top\">http://www.xmlrpc.com</a> and learned it in less than an afternoon.  Cobbled together a few <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Projects\">Projects</a> with it, and saw an opportunity to introduce <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> as a new tech at work.<br><br /><br />\n(In case you don&#39;t know about my job, I&#39;m the guy who does most of the research &amp; development, tool building, and overall platform architecture at a promotions company called <a href=\"http://www.eprize.net\">ePrize</a>.  I grumble about the place from time to time, but on the whole they let me do an amazing amount of wandering around in finding new things.)\n<br /><br />\nAnyway, we&#39;d been poking around with a few different means of integrating our promotions into clients&#39; websites.  You see, we host the web part of all promotions on our servers, and work toward making inclusion of those promotions not much harder than slipping in a banner.  But sometimes, there&#39;s just no avoiding more complex integration.  And sometimes, it&#39;s exactly what you want with things like shared sign-up &amp; login, awarding tokens &amp; coupons, and coordinating between vendors&#39; services.  So, we had a few different <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>-esque URL-based schemes, some FTP-and-PGP-based things, and even managed to convince one client to use a one-off protocol between two perl net daemons.  Every time, it was something new, and we could seem to get no two clients happy with the same integration scheme.\n<br /><br />\nThen one day I bring <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> into the office, and weave it into our app platform at the ground floor.  Overnight, just about every aspect of every promotion we do can be accessed via <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>, given the proper switches thrown and the right access controls set.  Producing an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> API spec for potential clients took mostly a bit of cut &amp; paste massaging of our internal API docs.<br><br /><br />\n(Your mileage may vary greatly, but our homegrown platform seemed pre-designed to fit with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>.  This point right here may be what makes this anecdote fall on its face for you and your experiences.  But, based on the success we have with it on the client end of things, I suspect that we&#39;re not that much an outlier.)\n<br /><br />\nThe next day, we had a meeting with a giant customer whose name I&#39;m not sure I can mention, but suffice it to say you&#39;ve heard of them and It&#39;s very, very likely that you&#39;ve used their gadgets.  We helped them put together a customer referral and rewards program, using <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> as the glue between an online store vendor, the client&#39;s site, and us.  It was a great success, and since then we&#39;ve done another dozen or so cool promotions involving <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>.\n<br /><br />\nWhat makes this tech so successful here is that it&#39;s so simple and decently understood.  I get it, my boss gets it, his boss gets it, the sales guys get it, and the marketing guy who&#39;s always our first contact at a client gets it.  And when we finally drill down to a tech guy on the client&#39;s side, we just tell him, &quot;Here&#39;s the API for your promotion, and visit <a href=\"http://www.xmlrpc.com\" target=\"_top\">http://www.xmlrpc.com</a> for details on how to call it.&quot;  And that&#39;s it - 75% of the time they get it and implement it.  The rest of the time, we have to spend some time proving the tech and answering doubts, but it&#39;s always a pleasant experience from our end having all the answers.\n<br /><br />\nI&#39;ll adore <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> if/when it gets to this point in helping me get mine and my client counterparts&#39; jobs done.\n<br /><br />\nAnyway, this is sounding like a bad infomercial and I need to get back to work.  But I had to toss out this bit of anecdotal dross in favor of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=oooccb</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085436\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f62aedd5a22327cb4b3d8cc7f94022a4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Joh</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085436\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-11-26T23:55:01\">2002-11-26T23:55:01</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">...unless your client is in China and oops, Dave forgot to mention that since Radio can't do Unicode, the XmlRpc spec only uses ASCII strings.

Boring, yawn, inventory management, who cares?  Well, imagine if those things, along with their readers, got so ludicrously cheap and small that mothers would stick &#39;em to kids&#39; underwear as they went off to camp, and readers came standard in watches and cell phones.  Imagine that, somehow, the range was improved to at least 20 feet - your reader sends out a radio ping (MARCO!) and back comes a list of the contents of the room as every object responds (POLO!).  Assume as well that your reader can work out the location of each of these objects.\n<br /><br />\nIgnore the big brother fears for now - everyone will have this stuff, not just the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MiB\">MiBs</a>.  Also, ignore my ignorance - many of these enhanced tricks are likely impossible or at least very hard for these little gadgets.  For now.  Until someone does something clever.<br><br /><br />\nBut, imagine!  Never lose your keys again!  Find the cat!

Bah - I&#39;ve got a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RFID\">RFID</a> business card in my pocket.

I don&#39;t know the man, and am familiar with his work in only the most cursory way - I&#39;ve read a bit about Xanadu, skimmed some articles on its history, but I&#39;ve yet to download the code finally released a few years ago and see what&#39;s what.  Having said that, this interview reads like the bitter mutterings of a guy who wants to slug <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TimBL\">TimBL</a> and the rest of us web hackers for making him all but obsolete.\n<br /><br />\nFrom what I&#39;ve read, the body of work surrounding Xanadu seems to have a lot to say for itself, though some of that - the assorted collection of almost psychedelic jargon invented to describe its convolutions - seems almost self parodying.  The history of Xanadu and Nelson&#39;s work with hypertext systems looks to me to be yet another proof that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000258.phtml#000258\">ideas are fucking worthless</a>, and another vote in favor of bazaar- over cathedral-style development.\n<br /><br />\nMaybe it&#39;s the fault of the interviewer, but Nelson comes across as a bit self-aggrandizing in trying to puff up how creative and multi-talented and immersed in media - I mean, he made his own rock opera for cripes sake!  So I guess this should set the stage for his authority when he dismisses HTML as &quot;a degenerate form of [hypertext] that has been standardised by people who, I think, do not understand the real problems&quot; and the web as &quot;... trivially simple ... massively successful like karaoke - anybody can do it.&quot;\n<br /><br />\nBut y&#39;know, for all his criticism of systems here and now, and claiming that the people involved with the web don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing - he has a surprising lack of working software out in the world.  That&#39;s what I consider success - working and well used implementation.  Who doesn&#39;t understand the real problems?  One can only build architectures of vapor for so long up in the ivory tower before one must pit it against the world.  I don&#39;t suppose he&#39;s ever tossed around the idea that maybe, just maybe, Xanadu hasn&#39;t stormed the world because it&#39;s too big and cumbersome and amazingly convoluted for anyone who hasn&#39;t worked with it for 30 years to put into use?  There is much to be said for the benefits of Karaoke-simple technology.\n<br /><br />\nSo yeah, maybe on some Platonic plane of ideal forms, compared to The One True Hypertext, HTML is crap.  Okay, maybe right here on my hard drive, HTML is crap.  But it&#39;s on my hard drive, and I use it.  It&#39;s been learned from, and attempts are being made to improve upon it.  As far as I know, Nelson&#39;s ideas of perfection have never seen a pounding from the world of imperfection.  That&#39;s the crucible in which things are really formed.  You get your software in reasonable shape, toss it to the wolves, and see how it fares.  Realize that some of your prized pet theories and designs were bullshit, and rework the thing for the next time around.\n<br /><br />\nOkay, that&#39;s my rant.

From what I've read (not having been there in the mid-70's), Nelson's been influential like crazy.\nHe'd envisioned so many of the things taken for granted today - but every time I read an interview with him, he seems so bitter with all the imperfect renditions of his ideas.  Seems like he just can't get around to accepting that \"pretty good\" implementations are good enough.\nBut, I could have him all wrong, having gotten all my impressions from mostly second- and third-hand sources.\nThanks for the book reference, though - must read that someday, although a cursory search seems to show that it's a rare find.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088518\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5272443429a5812b961abfb0d1ceeb81&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">John Dougan</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088518\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-11-12T06:15:10\">2002-11-12T06:15:10</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">While there is bitterness there, I read it more as long term frustration. It looks similar to the attitudes I think I've seen in Jef Raskin and Doug Engelbart. These are people with a clear personal vision of some aspect of computing that they feel is radically better that the existing (flawed) practice. This happens all of the time, you say? No big deal?  Sure, but in their cases there are factors that make it much more frustrating. In no particular order:\nTheir vision predates and was the _misunderstood_ inspiration for the existing models. Sometimes it predates them by a lot. Can you imagine thinking of this stuff in 1962 then having to wait 25 years for people to start getting it?  Or to give a demonstration in 1968 of a working intelligence augmentation system (http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/1968Demo.html)...and then being best known for the mouse. Or to be best known for creating the Macintosh, which was then ripped from you while your better later work is marginalized.\nDoug and Jef _have_ produced working systems. They've usually been misunderstood, or ignored.\nOne of the hallmarks I've noticed in all their works is that they are systems thinkers, whose vision works best if it's taken altogether, not piecemeal. TBL's Semantic Web fits into this category as well.  There are synergistic effects between the components that should make their total effect much more than the linear sum. I suspect that this is why they tend to see 'pretty good' versions as not good enough. There is a threshold level that has to be exceeded before it is truly good enough.\nThey all seem to see their visions as fundamentally simple and often it is a source of great confusion as to how others can continue to not understand.\nIn the past they haven't received much credit for their work outside a narrow group of insiders. This has changed to some extent but it's hard to become all happy happy after 30 years of being disregarded or called impractical. Or after being dissed by people who haven't studied the actual design and the practical issues that lead to it.\nIn Ted's case there is a history of implementation attempts that have failed. Ted is a designer, not a builder, and it looks to be a source of never-ending frustration to him that he just can't go and build it himself. He appears to have built small software projects himself, but he doesn't have the implementation talent for larger ones.\nTaking the above a bit further, Ted is fundamentally a liberal arts guy whoses progression into computers was because he wanted to use the systems he saw as possible, and the only way was to direct it himself. *Bazzar style development wasn't available back then* as it really requires Internet availability on a large scale. He's trying the bazzar now, but the other issues and the old history get in the way.\nTed also has the Cassandra problem: 20 years ago he predicted many of the problems we have with the current hypertext systems, and he designed solutions. You can guess what happened next.\nTed and Doug are also getting old, and I'm certain that is a contributing factor to their attitude. They want to see somthing happen in their lifetimes, and they don't have many more chances so they have to be more forceful. This can be taken the wrong way.\nThe good news is that Jef Raskin is young enough to continue persuing his vision over at sourceforge with a Bazzar style project.\nUltimately what they want is their visions to be implemented and deliver their promised benefits.\nhttp://www.bootstrap.org/\nhttp://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/MouseSitePg1.html\nhttp://mxmora.best.vwh.net/JefRaskin.html\nhttp://humane.sourceforge.net/home/index.html\nhttp://www.sunless-sea.net/forum\nhttp://www.abora.org/\nhttp://www.unrealities.com/robj/xancurs.htm\nhttp://xanadu.com.au/ararat\nhttp://www.nongnu.org/gzz/\nDisclosure: I have met and taken a UI design course from Ted and had some fascinating discussion with him.

Seems like he just can't get around to accepting that \"pretty good\" implementations are good enough.\r\n\r\nBut, I could have him all wrong, having gotten all my impressions from mostly second- and third-hand sources.\r\n\r\nThanks for the book reference, though - must read that someday, although a cursory search seems to show that it's a rare find.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088518\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5272443429a5812b961abfb0d1ceeb81&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">John Dougan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088518\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-11-12T06:15:10\">2002-11-12T06:15:10</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">While there is bitterness there, I read it more as long term frustration. It looks similar to the attitudes I think I've seen in Jef Raskin and Doug Engelbart. These are people with a clear personal vision of some aspect of computing that they feel is radically better that the existing (flawed) practice. This happens all of the time, you say? No big deal?  Sure, but in their cases there are factors that make it much more frustrating. In no particular order:\r\n\r\nTheir vision predates and was the _misunderstood_ inspiration for the existing models. Sometimes it predates them by a lot. Can you imagine thinking of this stuff in 1962 then having to wait 25 years for people to start getting it?  Or to give a demonstration in 1968 of a working intelligence augmentation system (http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/1968Demo.html)...and then being best known for the mouse. Or to be best known for creating the Macintosh, which was then ripped from you while your better later work is marginalized.\r\n\r\nDoug and Jef _have_ produced working systems. They've usually been misunderstood, or ignored.\r\n\r\nOne of the hallmarks I've noticed in all their works is that they are systems thinkers, whose vision works best if it's taken altogether, not piecemeal. TBL's Semantic Web fits into this category as well.  There are synergistic effects between the components that should make their total effect much more than the linear sum. I suspect that this is why they tend to see 'pretty good' versions as not good enough. There is a threshold level that has to be exceeded before it is truly good enough.\r\n\r\nThey all seem to see their visions as fundamentally simple and often it is a source of great confusion as to how others can continue to not understand.\r\n\r\nIn the past they haven't received much credit for their work outside a narrow group of insiders. This has changed to some extent but it's hard to become all happy happy after 30 years of being disregarded or called impractical. Or after being dissed by people who haven't studied the actual design and the practical issues that lead to it.\r\n\r\nIn Ted's case there is a history of implementation attempts that have failed. Ted is a designer, not a builder, and it looks to be a source of never-ending frustration to him that he just can't go and build it himself. He appears to have built small software projects himself, but he doesn't have the implementation talent for larger ones.\r\n\r\nTaking the above a bit further, Ted is fundamentally a liberal arts guy whoses progression into computers was because he wanted to use the systems he saw as possible, and the only way was to direct it himself. *Bazzar style development wasn't available back then* as it really requires Internet availability on a large scale. He's trying the bazzar now, but the other issues and the old history get in the way.\r\n\r\nTed also has the Cassandra problem: 20 years ago he predicted many of the problems we have with the current hypertext systems, and he designed solutions. You can guess what happened next.\r\n\r\nTed and Doug are also getting old, and I'm certain that is a contributing factor to their attitude. They want to see somthing happen in their lifetimes, and they don't have many more chances so they have to be more forceful. This can be taken the wrong way.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that Jef Raskin is young enough to continue persuing his vision over at sourceforge with a Bazzar style project.\r\n\r\nUltimately what they want is their visions to be implemented and deliver their promised benefits.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bootstrap.org/\r\nhttp://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/MouseSitePg1.html\r\nhttp://mxmora.best.vwh.net/JefRaskin.html\r\nhttp://humane.sourceforge.net/home/index.html\r\nhttp://www.sunless-sea.net/forum\r\nhttp://www.abora.org/\r\nhttp://www.unrealities.com/robj/xancurs.htm\r\nhttp://xanadu.com.au/ararat\r\nhttp://www.nongnu.org/gzz/\r\n\r\nDisclosure: I have met and taken a UI design course from Ted and had some fascinating discussion with him.

    "summary": "<p>I&apos;m a little late on this, but I just read an <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1581891.stm\">BBC interview with Ted Nelson</a> this weekend.  I don&apos;t know the man, and am familiar with his work in only the most cursory way - I&apos;ve read a bit about Xanadu, skimmed some articles on its history, but I&apos;ve yet to download the code finally released a few years ago and see what&apos;s what.  Having said that, this interview reads like the bitter mutterings of a guy who wants to slug <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TimBL\">TimBL</a> and the rest of us web hackers for making him all but obsolete.\n<br><br>\nFrom what I&apos;ve read, the body of work surrounding Xanadu seems to have a lot to say for itself, though some of that - the assorted collection of almost psychedelic jargon invented to describe its convolutions - seems almost self parodying.  The history of Xanadu and Nelson&apos;s work with hypertext systems looks to me to be yet another proof that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000258.phtml#000258\">ideas are fucking worthless</a>, and another vote in favor of bazaar- over cathedral-style development.\n<br><br>\nMaybe it&apos;s the fault of the interviewer, but Nelson comes across as a bit self-aggrandizing in trying to puff up how creative and multi-talented and immersed in media - I mean, he made his own rock opera for cripes sake!  So I guess this should set the stage for his authority when he dismisses HTML as &quot;a degenerate form of [hypertext] that has been standardised by people who, I think, do not understand the real problems&quot; and the web as &quot;... trivially simple ... massively successful like karaoke - anybody can do it.&quot;\n<br><br>\nBut y&apos;know, for all his criticism of systems here and now, and claiming that the people involved with the web don&apos;t know what they&apos;re doing - he has a surprising lack of working software out in the world.  That&apos;s what I consider success - working and well used implementation.  Who doesn&apos;t understand the real problems?  One can only build architectures of vapor for so long up in the ivory tower before one must pit it against the world.  I don&apos;t suppose he&apos;s ever tossed around the idea that maybe, just maybe, Xanadu hasn&apos;t stormed the world because it&apos;s too big and cumbersome and amazingly convoluted for anyone who hasn&apos;t worked with it for 30 years to put into use?  There is much to be said for the benefits of Karaoke-simple technology.\n<br><br>\nSo yeah, maybe on some Platonic plane of ideal forms, compared to The One True Hypertext, HTML is crap.  Okay, maybe right here on my hard drive, HTML is crap.  But it&apos;s on my hard drive, and I use it.  It&apos;s been learned from, and attempts are being made to improve upon it.  As far as I know, Nelson&apos;s ideas of perfection have never seen a pounding from the world of imperfection.  That&apos;s the crucible in which things are really formed.  You get your software in reasonable shape, toss it to the wolves, and see how it fares.  Realize that some of your prized pet theories and designs were bullshit, and rework the thing for the next time around.\n<br><br>\nOkay, that&apos;s my rant.  Now I&apos;m back to work, and possibly maybe off to check out more things Xanadu and Nelson on my lunch break.</p>\n"

But, I tried explaining what I think I understand in a comment on his blog and I figure it&#39;s worth reposting here for ridicule and correction:\n<br /><br />\nDid you happen to catch <a href=\"http://www.sciencefriday.com/pages/2002/Nov/hour2_110102.html\">Tim Berners-Lee on NPR Science Friday</a> today? Not sure if you get the broadcast there, or listen to the stream.

Likely I&#39;ll fail miserably, but here goes.\n<br /><br />\nFirst simple thing: Look at your weblog page. What would it take to extract the list of people from your blogroll, just given your URL? What about the titles of all the weblog posts on that page?\n<br /><br />\nYou, personally, can extract that information very easily since you, as a learned human, grasp the semantics of the page quite quickly. (The semantics are, basically, what&#39;s what and what&#39;s where and what does it all describe.)\n<br /><br />\nImagine a document containing exactly all of the same info your weblog page presents - only the data is completely, easily accessible to a robot in a universal, easily handled format.\n<br /><br />\nFurthermore, imagine that the schema describing the data to be found on your page is in that same format. And then, imagine that the document describing the construction of schema is in that same format. And then imagine that the decomposition continues, all of the way down to base data types and relationships. Eventually, the whole thing rests on the back of a turtle - er I mean a sort of universal client.\n<br /><br />\nNow, what if every single page on the web were available in this manner? No scraping, no regex, no tricks. I could use the entire web as database and execute queries that draw from data available on a myriad of disparate URLs. My client can figure out what to do with whatever it finds at a URL by chasing descriptions and meta-descriptions until it reaches the level of understanding implemented in the client.\n<br /><br />\nGoing out on a limb here, but imagine a practical example: &quot;Hello computer, find me 2 roundtrip tickets for 7 days anytime in the next 10 weeks, for under US$300 each, to a vacation spot where the weather this time of year is usually warm and sunny, the exchange rate is better than 3 to 1 US dollar, and is rated as better than average by Ann Arbor, MI bloggers.&quot;\n<br /><br />\nAssume my semantic web client knows some URLs to airlines, to international weather services, to exchange rates, and to vacation spot reviews in weblogs in Ann Arbor, MI. Assume that there are schema available for the things these URLs describe. Assume that my semantic web client can parse my natural language query.\n<br /><br />\nSo, it takes my request, goes out and snags the URLs appropriate to the various topics involved. Once it has all it need to process the data in each URL, it can find me the answer to my query, based on data pulled from all over the place.\n<br /><br />\nNow, get nuttier and bring in some intelligence with robots that can do some inference and reasoning. Say I throw out some facts: Mammals breathe oxygen. Men are mammals. Joe is a man. With the right client, the query &quot;Give me all oxygen breathers,&quot; will include Joe in its results.\n<br /><br />\nWhew. There.

The development pattern I've just described is neither new nor unknown to me - I've been here before and I've read the accounts of others who've been here before.  And I know the benefits in sticking to a clean test-driven dev cycle, and keeping a stern check on scope creep.  I know these things, and I try to practice these things - I'm normally known as the guy who pees in the happy idea cheerios - so what hit me this time?\n<br /><br />\nI'm carefully trying to steer clear from writing a rant or a whine - I know that my angst comes from a loss of perspective in being nose-to-nose with this project.  I know it will get better once this is done, and I know from recent developments that this project can and will be rescued unlike many doomed projects.  It will be good and well used and the disappointments will fade.  But for the life of this project, the late nights and my absence from life online and off have been real, as have been the doubts and fears.\n<br /><br />\nThat said, what the hell happened?

First release of work project happens tomorrow, after which I hope to take a 4 day vacation to celebrate my and my girlfriend&#39;s birthday (Oct 24, same day).\n<br /><br />\nSome revelations over the last few days:<ul><li>October is not 31 days long - it is 31 days and one hour long.</li><li>Java has a class to handle date manipulations that I forgot to use, for some reason - but now that I know about it, there&#39;s some major rearchitecting in store to use it.</li><li>I&#39;m tired of bar graphs, web server logs, and explaining how the tea leaves are read.</li><li>I like my new Treo Communicator - it is great for playing <a href=\"http://roguelike-palm.sourceforge.net/kMoria/index.php\">kMoria</a> (but not <a href=\"http://www.nethack.org\">NetHack</a>) and quickly SSH&#39;ing into a server from bed to restart a process about whose death I was paged on the same device.  (ooh, what if the pager message could contain a button to connect to the server crying wolf?)</li><li>I&#39;ve come to realize that I enjoy playing <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/NetHack\">NetHack</a> and kMoria between compile-and-test cycles at 3AM better than I ever enjoyed Everquest in quieter times.</li><li>On the drive home, as the sun was rising, I was trying to think of just what aspects of Everquest (beyond graphics and besides multiplayer) are better than the family of Rogue-like games.  And...  could someone hack together a Rogue-like UI with which one could play Everquest?</li><li>Also on the drive home, I was thinking that I&#39;d like to take a break from being a geek and a software architect altogether, and maybe raise sheep and make sweaters for awhile.  What do you think?</li><li>Hernias suck, and impending surgery is stress-inducing.</li></ul>Hopefully I&#39;ll be recovered and returned to the world after next week.  I&#39;ve been vaguely poking my head in and around the neighborhood, but with my iBook suffering from seizures and my brain feeling like an alien abduction aftermath, I&#39;ll have a lot of catching up to do.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ooocab</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086365\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://revjim.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=33660e6606dfa6f2a374625315bc40b1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://revjim.net/\">Reverend Jim</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086365\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-10-24T11:21:04\">2002-10-24T11:21:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I can't tell you how many times I've considered getting out of the programming/IT business all together and just doing something normal.

I too would like to stop working in the tech industry and do something completely different. \nI started out geeked about the internet upon it's public release. I thought it would be cool to make a difference and come up with some really cool technologies, make new types of interactive gadgets and what not. But it is hard to do what you love when people (mostly the ++unsmart kind), business agendas and worst of all: politics; come into play.\nBy that point, it seems like your not doing what you love anymore, it becomes a compromise, \"Well at least I am in the field of work I love.\" But it seems for me, it's just so hard to put my whole heart into anymore. It doesn't continue to be a personally rewarding field as you progress. At least that is what I found in these past 6 or 7 years of doing this stuff professionally.\nMost CS people aren't going to be content to hack the same code forever and at the same pay rate, so you move on to the next thing, at least it's a new challenge, better pay and you might actually be geeked about the new challenge. Time passes, excitement subsides, the loop starts over again. Pretty soon, there is nowhere to go but management. Eek! Who wants that job, I want a job that requires me to think. I say that because if you had to deal with managers like many I have had, it clearly isn't a requirement. \nI agree, save money, quit work, watch management plea on their knees for you to stay, buy a farm, raise sheep and make sweaters. Just don't do any of that repulsive line dancing.\nOn another of your points, the graphics and multiplayer are what is better about Everquest versus rogue-like games. Well that and the dynamic content, and the variety of things you can pursue in game; like blacksmithing, tailoring, jewelry, baking, pottery, etc. If you&#8217;re a person that really gets into the role-playing aspect of a game, there is actually a role-playing only server in Everquest now, FirionaVie. It has an interesting set of additional rules that make it a bit more fun to play versus the standard servers or PvP. It's more Player versus the Elements, so it forces the social aspect.\nAnd since you seem to be a Mac person now, Everquest is coming out for OSX, though they will be separate from the PC users.\nIt may be possible to hack together a simple rogue-like interface for EQ, though completely blowing your EULA and having the possibility of getting banned. There are people who have macro programs out there that sit on top of the EQ client that can record any number of actions and run them, I don't see why one couldn't use those hooks directly to overlay the simpler interface. Though realistically, you probably don&#8217;t have enough screen area to hold the basic onscreen stuff you may need for grouping and what not.\nI wonder to what extent you extend the current EQ interface with the new XML driven interface.  You can completely customize and mod everything that you see onscreen, it's actually very slick. People have added in-game maps, timers, and new combined features. I wonder if it could even be done that way instead of violating the EULA. Probably not, but I wonder how far you could go with something like that.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086378\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=822e1d2cd4c92265d1abdc74fc88c0d9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Azinsuken</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086378\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-12-30T01:26:56\">2002-12-30T01:26:56</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Hello, i was browsing for hack programs for everquest (so i could report them) and for some reason this site came up are you hosting any everquest hacking downloads?</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

Along with the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed of &quot;Further Reading&quot; items he&apos;s made available, he&apos;s got a nice game of follow-the-leader set up for the rest of us referrer log watchers.  Nice &amp; elegant &amp; makes me ashamed.  :)\n<br><br>\n<strong>Update:</strong> Mark pulls back the curtain and <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/projects/misc/linkbackparser.py.txt\">reveals the secret</a>.  Yay!\n<br><br>\nYet another demonstration to me that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000258.phtml#000258\">ideas are f&apos;ing worthless</a> and the making is what matters.  Lots of things I&apos;ve been <strong>thinking</strong> about doing, but never get done.  (See also: <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000305.phtml\" title=\"Blog entry #000305\">Blog:000305</a>)  Just a few weeks ago, I managed to upgrade my referrer tracking to dig out the titles of referring pages.  And I&apos;ve had an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/recent_referers_rss.php\">RSS feed</a> of referrers myself for a few months now, but mine&apos;s been ugly as sin and so I&apos;ve kept it to myself.  So now I&apos;ll need to think in earnest about how to do some extraction of the link-surrounding excerpt in referring pages.  Mark&apos;s referrer handling really is elegant - it even seems to know how to collapse multiple views on the same referring entry (ie. front page, archive page, individual entry page).\n<br><br>\nMore things to play with :)</p>\n"

These parsers are often cheaper to deal with when you know that the format you&#39;re expecting doesn&#39;t involve namespaces.  You trade some flexibility for some ease of development.<blockquote><i>For these guys, just introducing an xmlns attribute is enough to make them reject the feed.

I conclude that the same broken parsers that didn&#39;t like the 2.0 feeds with the xmlns attributes, must also not like the 1.0 feeds.</i></blockquote>And your conclusion would likely be correct - because those parsers weren&#39;t expecting to consume namespace-using XML, and they shouldn&#39;t be expecting <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> v1.0.  If an application is designed with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 in mind, then the author should be using a namespace-aware parser and correctly handle the namespaces, since that&#39;s the nature of the beast.  To neglect or mishandle namespaces in consuming <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 is a mistake.<br><br /><br />\nAdmittedly, some applications which apparently consume <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> v1.0 feeds correctly may be broken in this way - this is not unique to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> v2.0.  If they&#39;re broken, they need fixing.   But that&#39;s another story...\n<br /><br />\nSo, on to the conclusion:<blockquote><i>If this is true, we can&#39;t design using namespaces until:\n<br /><br /></p>\n<ol>\n<li>All the parsers are fixed, or\n<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Users/content providers expect and accept this kind of breakage (I don&#39;t want to be the one delivering that bit of bad news, got burned not only by the users, but by developers too, people generally don&#39;t know about this problem, or if they do know are not being responsible with the info).\n<br /><br />\nAnyway it looks to me like there&#39;s a big problem in the strategy of formats that intend to organize around namespaces.</blockquote></i>Well, of course, end users should not expect breakage.  This is obvious to me.  No one really wants that.<br><br /><br />\nThe big problem I see in the strategy, though, is this:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 claims to be backward-compatible with the 0.9x family, but the addition of namespaces in XML is enough of a fundamental change to break this.  I think <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/message/4115\">what Shelly wrote in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>-DEV</a> is correct:  &quot;Namespace support is NOT a\ntrivial change, and will break several technologies, including <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> if\nnamespace support isn&#39;t compiled in. This isn&#39;t something that can be\nhacked out.&quot;\n<br /><br />\nWhen I originally read about the emergence of something called <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0, I said &quot;<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000268.phtml#000268\">Go man, go</a>!&quot;  But I also said, &quot;What&#39;s the catch?&quot;  Well, this appears to be a catch.  But I think it can be worked through.  This is not a <strong>fundamental</strong> problem with namespaces themselves.  This is a versioning problem, and a problem with anticipating all the implications the new version brings to the table.  This goes for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0, <strong>as well as</strong> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0.\n<br /><br />\nThe first thing is to nail a few things down about version numbers and reverse-compatibility.  It&#39;s been my experience that, when some thing experiences an increment to its major version number, reverse-compatibility is not guaranteed.  So, I would assume that from a v0.94 to a v2.0, things are sufficiently different that using it would require that, indeed, &quot;All the parsers are fixed&quot; to support the new major version.  So for the most part, v2.0 follows the v0.94 tradition faithfully, but on this issue it parts ways - and yes, potential consumers of v2.0 feeds will need to adjust from their v0.94 code.  Thems the breaks, I&#39;ve been told, when it comes to major version upgrades.\n<br /><br />\nSo, again, I don&#39;t think that this is a fundamental flaw with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0, or namespaces.  This is an issue of versioning, understanding the technology&#39;s implications, and reverse-compatibility.<!--more-->\nshortname=ooobii</li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089859\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scripting.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=dc59c5ba9a8aa0a6225d9959eea3b7f3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scripting.com/\">Dave Winer</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089859\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-28T16:18:26\">2002-09-28T16:18:26</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Very interesting and thanks for the thoughtful comments. So the problem could be nailed by adding a comment to the 2.0 spec saying something like this (not an attempt at spec text):\nRSS 2.0 feeds are compatible with 0.91 and 0.92 in that every 0.91 or 0.92 source is also a 2.0 source (modulo the version attribute on the rss element), with the exception that, if it uses namespaces, it may not work with some aggregators that do not correctly parse sources that use namespaces. As of Fall 2002, there are enough incompatible parsers to make this advisory necessary. If you wish to be fully backward compatible, do not use namespaces in your feeds.\nDoes this basically sum up your post?? If so, I think that serves as enough of a red flag for non-namespace aware parsers that some feeds at some time in the future will break (maybe now) and that they should test with 2.0 feeds that do use the namespace compatibility, the sooner the better.\nDave</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089861\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9c49b9a4f6b6f35c422a05921bd41ad5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Charles Cook</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089861\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-28T16:36:58\">2002-09-28T16:36:58</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">The problem is nothing to do with parsers.

If an application is designed with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 in mind, then the author should be using a namespace-aware parser and correctly handle the namespaces, since that&apos;s the nature of the beast.  To neglect or mishandle namespaces in consuming <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 is a mistake.<br><br><br>\nAdmittedly, some applications which apparently consume <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> v1.0 feeds correctly may be broken in this way - this is not unique to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> v2.0.  If they&apos;re broken, they need fixing.   But that&apos;s another story...\n<br><br>\nSo, on to the conclusion:<blockquote><i>If this is true, we can&apos;t design using namespaces until:\n<br><br><p></p>\n<ol>\n<li>All the parsers are fixed, or\n<br><br></li>\n<li>Users/content providers expect and accept this kind of breakage (I don&apos;t want to be the one delivering that bit of bad news, got burned not only by the users, but by developers too, people generally don&apos;t know about this problem, or if they do know are not being responsible with the info).\n<br><br>\nAnyway it looks to me like there&apos;s a big problem in the strategy of formats that intend to organize around namespaces.</li></ol></i></blockquote>Well, of course, end users should not expect breakage.  This is obvious to me.  No one really wants that.<br><br><br>\nThe big problem I see in the strategy, though, is this:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 claims to be backward-compatible with the 0.9x family, but the addition of namespaces in XML is enough of a fundamental change to break this.  I think <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/message/4115\">what Shelly wrote in </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>-DEV is correct:  &quot;Namespace support is NOT a\ntrivial change, and will break several technologies, including <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> if\nnamespace support isn&apos;t compiled in. This isn&apos;t something that can be\nhacked out.&quot;\n<br><br>\nWhen I originally read about the emergence of something called <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0, I said &quot;<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000268.phtml#000268\">Go man, go</a>!&quot;  But I also said, &quot;What&apos;s the catch?&quot;  Well, this appears to be a catch.  But I think it can be worked through.  This is not a <strong>fundamental</strong> problem with namespaces themselves.  This is a versioning problem, and a problem with anticipating all the implications the new version brings to the table.  This goes for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0, <strong>as well as</strong> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0.\n<br><br>\nThe first thing is to nail a few things down about version numbers and reverse-compatibility.  It&apos;s been my experience that, when some thing experiences an increment to its major version number, reverse-compatibility is not guaranteed.  So, I would assume that from a v0.94 to a v2.0, things are sufficiently different that using it would require that, indeed, &quot;All the parsers are fixed&quot; to support the new major version.  So for the most part, v2.0 follows the v0.94 tradition faithfully, but on this issue it parts ways - and yes, potential consumers of v2.0 feeds will need to adjust from their v0.94 code.  Thems the breaks, I&apos;ve been told, when it comes to major version upgrades.\n<br><br>\nSo, again, I don&apos;t think that this is a fundamental flaw with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0, or namespaces.  This is an issue of versioning, understanding the technology&apos;s implications, and reverse-compatibility."

    "html": "<p>I completely disagree with <a href=\"http://www.ozzie.net/blog/2002/09/25.html#a65\">Ray Ozzie</a> (&quot;I&#39;m thinking right now that I&#39;d prefer to stick with human talkback rather than automated pingback&quot;), <a href=\"http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/09/25.html#a2597\">John Robb</a> (&quot;I don&#39;t want pingback, trackback, or refererback.&quot;), and <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/2002/09/25.html#a1192\">Sam Gentile</a> (&quot;Amen to that.&quot;).\n<br /><br />\nI want as much automated and intervention-free invitation to participation in my blog as I can provide.  I want <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/03/13/manufacturedSerendipity.html\">manufactured serendipty</a> to operate here while I&#39;m away or asleep.  I want this site to help me discover connections and uncover links, whether by automated agent or by friendly visitor.  I want to lower the thresholds to interaction as far as I can.  I love it when I&#39;ve seen a few visitors to my site talk amongst themselves while I was on my drive to work.\n<br /><br />\nOf course, I&#39;ve never been cracked or assaulted by an exploit of my systems.  I don&#39;t have unwanted stalkers or abusive anti-fans or malicious kids or babbling spammers after me in this space.  Perhaps if I did, my systems might not tend toward such openness.  I think this is a statement on many things beyond blogs, but that&#39;s a post for other days.  Maybe some day I&#39;ll have these negative elements facing me, and I&#39;ll have to revise my systems and their direction to account for them.\n<br /><br />\nOn the other hand, I&#39;ve got a naive notion that the openness itself can counteract much of the reason to become closed in the first place.  Should the need arise, I think I can come up with some measures to deflect inane and juvenile attacks.  As for spammers, I tend to think that their days are numbered anyway - but if they do arrive on my weblog I think I can leverage many of the technologies I use right now with great effectiveness on my email inbox.  But, to defuse real frustration behind attacks, I tend to think that <strong>more</strong> communication, not less, is what&#39;s needed.\n<br /><br />\nBut I&#39;m not sure at all, though, whether or not the threat of abuse is what motivates Ray and John to leave automated discussion channels closed.  It&#39;s just one motive I&#39;ve seen discussed before.  I think they want more &quot;human&quot; and personal contact.\n<br /><br />\nWith regards to that:  The irony in my life is that, with my lack of much free time,  automated agents, aggregators, and weblogs have given me more personal contact with human beings than I might have been able to achieve without them.  I&#39;m trying to remember the thread a few months ago between <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner\">DaveWiner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JonUdell\">JonUdell</a>, and others concerning humans with the uncanny ability to connect other people together.

Very interesting!</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "I completely disagree with <a href=\"http://www.ozzie.net/blog/2002/09/25.html#a65\">Ray Ozzie</a> (\"I'm thinking right now that I'd prefer to stick with human talkback rather than automated pingback\"), <a href=\"http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/09/25.html#a2597\">John Robb</a> (\"I don't want pingback, trackback, or refererback.\"), and <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/2002/09/25.html#a1192\">Sam Gentile</a> (\"Amen to that.\").\r\n<br /><br />\r\nI want as much automated and intervention-free invitation to participation in my blog as I can provide.  I want <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/03/13/manufacturedSerendipity.html\">manufactured serendipty</a> to operate here while I'm away or asleep.  I want this site to help me discover connections and uncover links, whether by automated agent or by friendly visitor.  I want to lower the thresholds to interaction as far as I can.  I love it when I've seen a few visitors to my site talk amongst themselves while I was on my drive to work.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOf course, I've never been cracked or assaulted by an exploit of my systems.  I don't have unwanted stalkers or abusive anti-fans or malicious kids or babbling spammers after me in this space.  Perhaps if I did, my systems might not tend toward such openness.  I think this is a statement on many things beyond blogs, but that's a post for other days.  Maybe some day I'll have these negative elements facing me, and I'll have to revise my systems and their direction to account for them.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOn the other hand, I've got a naive notion that the openness itself can counteract much of the reason to become closed in the first place.  Should the need arise, I think I can come up with some measures to deflect inane and juvenile attacks.  As for spammers, I tend to think that their days are numbered anyway - but if they do arrive on my weblog I think I can leverage many of the technologies I use right now with great effectiveness on my email inbox.  But, to defuse real frustration behind attacks, I tend to think that <strong>more</strong> communication, not less, is what's needed.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBut I'm not sure at all, though, whether or not the threat of abuse is what motivates Ray and John to leave automated discussion channels closed.  It's just one motive I've seen discussed before.  I think they want more \"human\" and personal contact.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWith regards to that:  The irony in my life is that, with my lack of much free time,  automated agents, aggregators, and weblogs have given me more personal contact with human beings than I might have been able to achieve without them.  I'm trying to remember the thread a few months ago between <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner\">DaveWiner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JonUdell\">JonUdell</a>, and others concerning humans with the uncanny ability to connect other people together.  This very thing was supposed:  That aggregators and weblogs could augment one's ability to act as such a superconnector.  In that regard, I consider my agents, aggregators, and weblogs as integral to me as the new and improved pair of glasses I picked up last week.  Just as I can't see road signs without my glasses, I can't keep track of people without my agents.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>Update:</strong> And happily, Greg Graham, someone I've not met before, sends me an <a href=\"http://theologynotes.org/archives/000013.html#000013\">unexpected <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> ping</a> and invites me to another blog I've never visited.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=ooobie\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090630\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=89410ff704c02b63e1ab39fe07d54905&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/\">Sam Ruby</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090630\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-25T22:18:43\">2002-09-25T22:18:43</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I'm not sure what is going on..

    "summary": "<p>I completely disagree with <a href=\"http://www.ozzie.net/blog/2002/09/25.html#a65\">Ray Ozzie</a> (&quot;I&apos;m thinking right now that I&apos;d prefer to stick with human talkback rather than automated pingback&quot;), <a href=\"http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/09/25.html#a2597\">John Robb</a> (&quot;I don&apos;t want pingback, trackback, or refererback.&quot;), and <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/2002/09/25.html#a1192\">Sam Gentile</a> (&quot;Amen to that.&quot;).\n<br><br>\nI want as much automated and intervention-free invitation to participation in my blog as I can provide.  I want <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/03/13/manufacturedSerendipity.html\">manufactured serendipty</a> to operate here while I&apos;m away or asleep.  I want this site to help me discover connections and uncover links, whether by automated agent or by friendly visitor.  I want to lower the thresholds to interaction as far as I can.  I love it when I&apos;ve seen a few visitors to my site talk amongst themselves while I was on my drive to work.\n<br><br>\nOf course, I&apos;ve never been cracked or assaulted by an exploit of my systems.  I don&apos;t have unwanted stalkers or abusive anti-fans or malicious kids or babbling spammers after me in this space.  Perhaps if I did, my systems might not tend toward such openness.  I think this is a statement on many things beyond blogs, but that&apos;s a post for other days.  Maybe some day I&apos;ll have these negative elements facing me, and I&apos;ll have to revise my systems and their direction to account for them.\n<br><br>\nOn the other hand, I&apos;ve got a naive notion that the openness itself can counteract much of the reason to become closed in the first place.  Should the need arise, I think I can come up with some measures to deflect inane and juvenile attacks.  As for spammers, I tend to think that their days are numbered anyway - but if they do arrive on my weblog I think I can leverage many of the technologies I use right now with great effectiveness on my email inbox.  But, to defuse real frustration behind attacks, I tend to think that <strong>more</strong> communication, not less, is what&apos;s needed.\n<br><br>\nBut I&apos;m not sure at all, though, whether or not the threat of abuse is what motivates Ray and John to leave automated discussion channels closed.  It&apos;s just one motive I&apos;ve seen discussed before.  I think they want more &quot;human&quot; and personal contact.\n<br><br>\nWith regards to that:  The irony in my life is that, with my lack of much free time,  automated agents, aggregators, and weblogs have given me more personal contact with human beings than I might have been able to achieve without them.  I&apos;m trying to remember the thread a few months ago between <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner\">DaveWiner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JonUdell\">JonUdell</a>, and others concerning humans with the uncanny ability to connect other people together.  This very thing was supposed:  That aggregators and weblogs could augment one&apos;s ability to act as such a superconnector.  In that regard, I consider my agents, aggregators, and weblogs as integral to me as the new and improved pair of glasses I picked up last week.  Just as I can&apos;t see road signs without my glasses, I can&apos;t keep track of people without my agents.\n<br><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Update:</strong> And happily, Greg Graham, someone I&apos;ve not met before, sends me an <a href=\"http://theologynotes.org/archives/000013.html#000013\">unexpected </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> ping and invites me to another blog I&apos;ve never visited.</p>\n"

It would be like the URI or XLink specs requiring documents to contain metadata, or the PNG spec to require that images not contain red flowers -- it's not their place to worry about it.\nIf the pingback spec required DC metadata, then it would just be adding one more dependency, one more spec that we'd have to monitor in case it affected pingback in some way.\nWhen you ping a page, you can expect to find all the metadata that the HTML spec says you can expect to find.

State that in the spec, strongly suggest it or require some subset of DC in meta tags.  I want to know that, when I send a ping at a supporting (X)HTML page, I can expect to find some metadata in an agreed upon way.

It would be like the URI or XLink specs requiring documents to contain metadata, or the PNG spec to require that images not contain red flowers -- it's not their place to worry about it.\r\n\r\nIf the pingback spec required DC metadata, then it would just be adding one more dependency, one more spec that we'd have to monitor in case it affected pingback in some way.\r\n\r\nWhen you ping a page, you can expect to find all the metadata that the HTML spec says you can expect to find. If you want documents to have more, speak to the HTML working group. :-)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090115\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090115\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-29T04:06:16\">2002-09-29T04:06:16</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Yup - right you are.

Not to mention that my site was having a seizure last night - not good things to recommend that one check out a new technology. \n<br><br>\nWell, I did manage to see the spec, but haven&apos;t tried implementing it yet.  (Though it shouldn&apos;t be too hard, given a few round tuits.)  A few things, in particular that I like about <a href=\"http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback-1.0\">Pingback</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> URIs are used to specify the source and target of the ping, no other information is involved in setting up the relation (ie. arbitrary IDs, etc).  This makes site-wide integration of Pingback drop-dead simple - everything&apos;s already identifiable via URI.\n</li>\n<li> If one implements Pingback HTTP headers, one can allow non-HTML resources to be pinged.  (ie. Ping my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF\">FOAF</a> file when you add me to yours, and I might add you to mine.  That might be pushing the spec a bit, though.)\n</li>\n<li> The XML-RPC server is not tied to any sites it may serve.  I could offer one here, and you could point to it from your site, and if I allowed it I could record pings for you as a service.\n</li>\n</ul>\nAll-in-all, Pingback just seems like a more direct, intentional form of referrer log.\n<br><br>\nOne thing I don&apos;t like about Pingback, though (and the same for referrer logs):  It&apos;s just about URIs and links between them.  It says nothing much about titles or excerpts or comment bodies.  The spec suggests that a Pingback server <strong>might</strong> retrieve &quot;other data required from the content of Alice&apos;s new post,&quot; but makes no statement on how this is to happen.  I like that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> sets down how to provide a bit more information.\n<br><br>\nI&apos;ve got a vague idea in my little head, and I think it&apos;s something <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net\">Sam Ruby</a> touched on:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShowReferers\">ShowReferers</a>, form-submitted comments, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a>, and Pingback are all just different on-ramps to inviting open participation in discussion on one&apos;s blog.  I want to take a shot at implementing Pingback very soon - but I might also try taking a shot at implementing a unified comment system that accepts comments for any URI from any of the aforementioned sources.  I&apos;d also like something that scans a blog entry I post for links, then investigate those links for Pingback/TrackBack availability - all to make the system even <strong>more</strong> automatic.  I doubt that it would be very difficult, though I am notoriously naive.

That is, if the interface doesn&#39;t go <em>too</em> far away from usability.  I think Graffiti was a good compromise between machine and human understanding.  Let the machine focus with its autistic intensity on the task at hand, and let the human fill in the gaps.  This is why I fully expect to see Intelligence Amplification arrive many, many moons before Artificial Intelligence arrives, if ever.\n<br /><br />\nI doubt that machines will ever come up far enough to meet man, but man and machine can meet halfway and still have an astonishing relationship.  So, one can spend enormous resources trying to make computers understand people (who barely understand themselves), or we can make understandable interfaces and mostly intelligible systems and fudge the rest.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ooobhf</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089831\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.panic.com/~stevenf\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ae2c0b2d1d3219cac5409a77a1c99fb2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.panic.com/~stevenf\">stevenf</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089831\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-20T22:06:45\">2002-09-20T22:06:45</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">For my money, the Newton 2x00's handwriting recognition kicks Graffiti all the way up the street and then back down again.

Another little project that became, all of a sudden, so much easier than I thought.  I love Unix and OS X.  Before this, I&apos;d been looking high and low for all the parts:  a scheduler, a sound recorder, an app controller, etc &amp; so forth.  Given the source code to DSBRTuner, I was almost about to hack some solutions into it, but I&apos;d never gotten the time.\n<br><br>\nNow, I can happily record and listen to my favorite late Sunday night radio show during the week again!\n<br><br>\nOh yeah, and the ugly scripts:\n<br><br>\n1) dsbr_start_recording\n<pre>#!/bin/sh\nFREQ=$1\nMP3_FN=&quot;$2-`date &quot;+%Y%m%dT%H%M%S&quot;`.mp3&quot;\nOSA=/usr/bin/osascript\nTELL=&apos;tell application &quot;DSBRTUNER&quot; to&apos;\n\n<p>open /Applications/DSBRTuner.app\n$OSA -e &quot;$TELL set frequency to $FREQ&quot;\n$OSA -e &quot;$TELL record to file &quot;$MP3_FN&quot;&quot;\n<br><br>\n2) dsbr_stop_recording</p>\n<pre>#!/bin/sh\nOSA=/usr/bin/osascript\nTELL=&apos;tell application &quot;DSBRTUNER&quot; to&apos;\n\nopen /Applications/DSBRTuner.app\n$OSA -e &quot;$TELL stop recording&quot;\n$OSA -e &quot;$TELL quit&quot;</pre>\n</pre>"

But, work got busy and I promptly got distracted away.  If anything, though, I could see something like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF\">FOAF</a> being really nice as a start for this purpose.  Of course, there&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.imc.org/pdi/\">vCard</a>, but I think it wouldn&apos;t be very hard to convert to it from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF\">FOAF</a>.  The universality and connectivity that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> could bring to this seem terribly nice.  Throw in periodic auto-refresh, either literally by scheduled re-query, or by pub/sub notification, and you&apos;ve got a neat auto-updating address book just for starters.</p>\n"

And then, very recently, the thing became insatiable with desire for my CPU and memory.</p>\n<p>Turns out, in my spiffy new XML channel/item metadata files, I wasn't deleting data associated with old and no longer available items.  This resulted in multi-megabyte XML files which <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> happily munched through for each channel to which I'm subscribed.  Well, this update now regularly cleanses those files, leaving metadata stored only for those items that appeared in the current update of the channel.</p>\n<p>So, if <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> has been becoming a dog for you, you might want to give this a shot.  Upon the first run, the new code will wipe old data from the files.  If your poor, battered machine can't survive another run in the current circumstances, then wipe the contents of <code>data/channels_meta</code> and start again.  (But don't wipe your subscriptions or channel data!  Just the <code>channels_meta</code> data.)</p>\n<p>Let me know if this does good things for you.  In the meantime, I'm thinking about what I could do by applying these <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/BayesianAlgorithms?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">BayesianAlgorithms</font></span> (and those not-quite-so-BayesianAlgorithms) people have been tinkering with for use against spam.  What if I could have <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> initially sort my news items into ordered buckets of interest, according to my past viewing and scoring behavior?  I really need to do some machine learning research.</p>\n<p>Hell, what if I could go further and have a spider crawl blogrolls, looking for weblogs that seem to match other things I find interesting?  Seems promising, though I think I'm still too naive about the subject.</p>\n<p>Okay.  Time for bed.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooobha\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082696\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.groovycompany.nl/Blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e2822d781b09ef9889d1c3b610280046&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.groovycompany.nl/Blog/\">Quadsk8</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082696\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-18T15:36:36\">2002-09-18T15:36:36</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I'm glad we have a very loyal beta-tester on this skin! :-)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082697\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1f311d2ae9cd3f0e02d56b15924519ca&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\">Ehud Lamm</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082697\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-18T18:51:50\">2002-09-18T18:51:50</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Well, I am using this, so I installed the new version.\nNo news, is good news :-)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082698\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7aeda8ae5621d97ec1b1f7b7c20822e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/\">Jeremy Zawodny</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082698\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-20T03:31:17\">2002-09-20T03:31:17</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Kick Ass!\nAmphetaOutlines is way cool.

    "body": "<p>One more thing, before I go to bed:  An <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> update.</p>\r\n<p>I'm not sure how many of you are still using the thing, but I've been using it hourly since I embarked upon the experiment.  And then, very recently, the thing became insatiable with desire for my CPU and memory.</p>\r\n<p>Turns out, in my spiffy new XML channel/item metadata files, I wasn't deleting data associated with old and no longer available items.  This resulted in multi-megabyte XML files which <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> happily munched through for each channel to which I'm subscribed.  Well, this update now regularly cleanses those files, leaving metadata stored only for those items that appeared in the current update of the channel.</p>\r\n<p>So, if <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> has been becoming a dog for you, you might want to give this a shot.  Upon the first run, the new code will wipe old data from the files.  If your poor, battered machine can't survive another run in the current circumstances, then wipe the contents of <code>data/channels_meta</code> and start again.  (But don't wipe your subscriptions or channel data!  Just the <code>channels_meta</code> data.)</p>\r\n<p>Let me know if this does good things for you.  In the meantime, I'm thinking about what I could do by applying these <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/BayesianAlgorithms?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">BayesianAlgorithms</font></span> (and those not-quite-so-BayesianAlgorithms) people have been tinkering with for use against spam.  What if I could have <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> initially sort my news items into ordered buckets of interest, according to my past viewing and scoring behavior?  I really need to do some machine learning research.</p>\r\n<p>Hell, what if I could go further and have a spider crawl blogrolls, looking for weblogs that seem to match other things I find interesting?  Seems promising, though I think I'm still too naive about the subject.</p>\r\n<p>Okay.  Time for bed.</p>\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=ooobha\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082696\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.groovycompany.nl/Blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e2822d781b09ef9889d1c3b610280046&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.groovycompany.nl/Blog/\">Quadsk8</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082696\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-18T15:36:36\">2002-09-18T15:36:36</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I'm glad we have a very loyal beta-tester on this skin! :-)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082697\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1f311d2ae9cd3f0e02d56b15924519ca&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\">Ehud Lamm</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082697\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-18T18:51:50\">2002-09-18T18:51:50</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Well, I am using this, so I installed the new version.\r\nNo news, is good news :-)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082698\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7aeda8ae5621d97ec1b1f7b7c20822e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/\">Jeremy Zawodny</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082698\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-20T03:31:17\">2002-09-20T03:31:17</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Kick Ass!\r\n\r\nAmphetaOutlines is way cool.

    "summary": "<p>One more thing, before I go to bed:  An <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> update.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m not sure how many of you are still using the thing, but I&apos;ve been using it hourly since I embarked upon the experiment.  And then, very recently, the thing became insatiable with desire for my CPU and memory.</p>\n<p>Turns out, in my spiffy new XML channel/item metadata files, I wasn&apos;t deleting data associated with old and no longer available items.  This resulted in multi-megabyte XML files which <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> happily munched through for each channel to which I&apos;m subscribed.  Well, this update now regularly cleanses those files, leaving metadata stored only for those items that appeared in the current update of the channel.</p>\n<p>So, if <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> has been becoming a dog for you, you might want to give this a shot.  Upon the first run, the new code will wipe old data from the files.  If your poor, battered machine can&apos;t survive another run in the current circumstances, then wipe the contents of <code>data/channels_meta</code> and start again.  (But don&apos;t wipe your subscriptions or channel data!  Just the <code>channels_meta</code> data.)</p>\n<p>Let me know if this does good things for you.  In the meantime, I&apos;m thinking about what I could do by applying these <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/BayesianAlgorithms?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">BayesianAlgorithms</font></span> (and those not-quite-so-BayesianAlgorithms) people have been tinkering with for use against spam.  What if I could have <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> initially sort my news items into ordered buckets of interest, according to my past viewing and scoring behavior?  I really need to do some machine learning research.</p>\n<p>Hell, what if I could go further and have a spider crawl blogrolls, looking for weblogs that seem to match other things I find interesting?  Seems promising, though I think I&apos;m still too naive about the subject.</p>\n<p>Okay.  Time for bed.</p>\n"

He was originally a customer of yours.  Then, just for the fun of it, he made his own implementation of the news aggregation features of your software, and <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/history.html\">even acknowledged his source of inspiration</a> when he released <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, calling Radio \"<i>a wonderful piece of work</i>\".  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> isn't for sale - it's free and open source.  If that makes him a competitor to your selling product, I think you need to work harder or smarter.<blockquote><i>...explains on his weblog how he intends to kill me. Even he says it's too harsh; and it may be a joke, if so, it's not funny. I don't see the humor in my own death, esp at the hands of a person like Hemenway. (He also coined the term Jewgregator,</blockquote></i>Morbus is over the top on a frequent basis, and sometimes too far over the top.  This is a known fact - his sense of humor is obviously dark and a bit off kilter.  He also produces good working software, and writes useful articles.  But three obvious things:  1) He didn't state any intention to kill you - it's just that it seems his mere presence would be enough to set you a-boil.  2) He referred to <a href=\"http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/1031728134.shtml\">Kevin Burton's account</a> of meeting you, which depicts you as someone very easily set a-boil.  3) You're providing an example in support of the account.<blockquote><i>and calls <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 \"Hitler\" for some reason.)</blockquote></i>The \"some reason\" to which you alude is this bit Morbus said in IRC: \"I say 'proposed' rather innocently - its more 'shoved down everyone's throat by nazi dictator'... we should code name rss 2.0 'hitler'\".  There's frustration in there, and his wasn't the only head nodding in the room.  Morbus is over the top and says charged things I'd choose not to, but the frustration is real and genuine, and shared by more than one member of the community out here.  Yet, you always seem to \"take the high road\" by focusing on the over-the-top aspect, no matter the degree, ignoring the genuine gripe.<blockquote><i>...Bill Kearney has sent me private email about my deathbed, and what he hopes to teach me there, so I've chosen to filter his mail to a place where I never see it.</blockquote></i>Referring to private email is cheap - it's your word and his.<blockquote><i>I tried to come up with a word to describe how I feel about these people, this is what I came up with: monster.</blockquote></i>What a nasty thing to call potential collaborators and customers.  And what a viral, contagious thing, as you later demonstrate with Ben.  This doesn't seem very cluetrain-ish.<blockquote><i>...Hemenway has crossed that line. What happens next is stuff that will involve the police. I won't stand for these kinds of threats.</blockquote></i>What threat was made, and when will you be calling the police?  And how seriously will they take you?  You said yourself that you knew he wasn't seriously threatening you.  What stuff \"happens next\"?<blockquote><i>None of this means that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 will be delayed by even one moment.</blockquote></i>Thus, you avoid having to address the concerns all the \"monsters\" raise.<blockquote><i>I thought competition in the software business in the 80s was rough, but this is so much worse. Competition used to require a certain collegiality and professionalism. It's not true today. Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their way. Their perversion may even be the reason they're involved.</blockquote></i>But the funny thing about all of this is that most of this isn't business - it's hobby.  You've got a business, he's got a hobby, yet somehow he's competing with you.  I'm not a businessman by any stretch, but this comparison seems very odd.  (Hint:  Morbus is not acting as a professional in this context.  He can correct me if I've mistakenly assumed this.)</p>\n<p>These are people screwing around, trying things, playing with code.  And in order for these people to \"get their way\", they have to be nice to people and convince them to help out.  Otherwise, the cats wander off in search of fatter mice.  It becomes apparent rather quickly what sort of people they are from just a short bit of interaction with them.  And I've seen them \"triangulated\" as very nice people.<blockquote><i>Mr. Hemenway goes by the name Morbus Iff on his weblog, and writes for O'Reilly Associates, and for Ben Hammersley's syndication weblog. Mr. Hammersley is a reporter for the UK Guardian newspaper.</blockquote></i><blockquote><i>Postscript: Ben Hammersley threatened to sue me if I don't remove the previous paragraph. But every statement is true...</blockquote></i><a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=specious\">Specious</a> reasoning, at best.  Yes, Mr. Hammersley invited Morbus to write with him.  So, you feel free to splash him with the monster paint by association?<blockquote><i>The Guardian requests an apology. For what? They ran a tainted review.</blockquote></i>Oh, now we see the reason: He didn't plug your product in his review.  Though, he did say in the article, \"Did you notice how all those programs are free to use?\"  Perhaps he should have made that more a focus of the article, but he was writing about <i>free</i> programs.  I'm neither in his head, nor in the head of any Guardian editor, but maybe they didn't want the article to become free advertising for a commercial product?  Who knows.  He didn't mention you.  So that makes him a monster?<blockquote><i>Hammersley is a participant in the debate over the future of syndication technology, yet he wrote a review for the Guardian where that was not disclosed.</blockquote></i>This is obvious:  Many people who write about technology are involved with technology, even helping shape its direction.  It's what makes them most qualified to write about it.  This argument is starting to sound like politics - from whom did he get his funding?  I don't see you complaining when a \"participant in the debate\" <i>does</i> mention your product in an article.<blockquote><i>Now, either Hammersley didn't tell them, or they don't care, or British newspapers run ads without saying they're ads.</blockquote></i>Or maybe they didn't want to run <i>unpaid ads</i>?</p>\n<p>Okay.  I'm done.   This has distracted me from work for long enough today.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooobgh\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084163\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://shawnyeager.com/monolog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=546b2f1947278db93fa8f7c734876111&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://shawnyeager.com/monolog/\">Shawn</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084163\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-17T15:58:55\">2002-09-17T15:58:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Now that's a hell of a post.

First off, \"RSS 2.0: Hitler\" came first - it was, as l.m.orchard mentions, frustration at the RSS 2.0 spec, and the dictator like quality of Winer and his handling of it.\n\"Jewgregator\" came later, and is metaphoric in nature. With Dave being the dictator of RSS 2.0, there are all these other aggregator users, developers of RSS, and lovers of syndication who are being shafted with no respite. Dave thinks he has a wonderful spec, much like Hitler thought he was doing a \"good thing\" by cultural cleansing. The Jews suffered at the hands of Hitler, much like users will suffer at the hands of Winer.\nOf course, I do realize the inbred triviliazing of life based on this comparison - I'm not condoning, nor wiping away the deaths that occurred. It's merely another over-the-top metaphor that is ruder than necessary on a closer examination.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084174\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1f311d2ae9cd3f0e02d56b15924519ca&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\">Ehud Lamm</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084174\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-17T19:10:39\">2002-09-17T19:10:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Humor with reference to Jewish people is quite all right.

Let me be completely clear, at no time have I expressed any desire to see any form of harm be brought upon any of the individuals involved.  \nIt's most troubling to see someone trying to have people think that.  I find such behavior despicable and most certainly actionable.  It smacks of them wanting to plant some seed that would allow escalating it into some sort larger threat or conspiracy.  Given California's stalking laws and past posts about it, one can't help being left to wonder if this isn't an attempt to garner some sort of defense that would justify filing a such a claim.  \nWhipping up the old mob sympathy to support outrageous claims has certainly happened many times before, is that what we're seeing here?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084181\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084181\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-17T19:39:39\">2002-09-17T19:39:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Ehud:  Yeah, I phrased that wrong.

It seems the truth is starting to come crawling out of it's dark corners.  \nI'm likewise dumbfounded by Winer's arrogance and abuse.  The pleas of false sympathy are staggeringly ridiculous.  \nI have been a paying customer of Userland (small albeit, but one nonetheless).  This whole episode arose after receiving several obscene e-mails from him in reply to serious issues raised about said purchase.  At one point I was verbally offered a refund from Dave.  It has never materialized, perhaps being a welcher is another unexpected facet of his psychoses.\nWhile I'll make no arguments as to my use of, shall we say, pointedly direct style, I find it continuously appalling to hear in discussions with others that my experiences with him are nearly duplicates of theirs.  I'm shocked to see a vendor behaving in such a patently ridiculous manner.\nI have tremendous sympathies for anyone suffering from physical difficulties, cardiac or otherwise.  My dearly departed parents both suffered from heart ailments; they died three weeks apart.  I had to run two miles as a 14yr old kid to get help as my mother suffered her first myocardial infarction.  Now do I flail that about as some sort of shield to deflect culpability?  Hardly.  I've seen up close the agonies people suffer.  I've also seen the results of a lifetime of bad behavior and it's contributory influences.  So please, shut your pie hole you newbie.\nHis twisting of my comments is plain for all to see by reading the text of the original message.  And his slanderous attempts to conflate my actions with any form of violence or ill-will are utterly despicable.  \nShame on us?  Shame on US?&nbsp;  You hypocritical idiot!

    "body": "<p>I don't really want to add noise to the signal and would really rather just see some work get done, but I'm still disgusted by <a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1744#monsters\">what Dave is writing</a>:<blockquote><i>...One of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>'s competitors Kevin Hemenway, the author of Amphetadesk</blockquote></i>Competitor?  He was originally a customer of yours.  Then, just for the fun of it, he made his own implementation of the news aggregation features of your software, and <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/history.html\">even acknowledged his source of inspiration</a> when he released <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, calling Radio \"<i>a wonderful piece of work</i>\".  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> isn't for sale - it's free and open source.  If that makes him a competitor to your selling product, I think you need to work harder or smarter.<blockquote><i>...explains on his weblog how he intends to kill me. Even he says it's too harsh; and it may be a joke, if so, it's not funny. I don't see the humor in my own death, esp at the hands of a person like Hemenway. (He also coined the term Jewgregator,</blockquote></i>Morbus is over the top on a frequent basis, and sometimes too far over the top.  This is a known fact - his sense of humor is obviously dark and a bit off kilter.  He also produces good working software, and writes useful articles.  But three obvious things:  1) He didn't state any intention to kill you - it's just that it seems his mere presence would be enough to set you a-boil.  2) He referred to <a href=\"http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/1031728134.shtml\">Kevin Burton's account</a> of meeting you, which depicts you as someone very easily set a-boil.  3) You're providing an example in support of the account.<blockquote><i>and calls <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 \"Hitler\" for some reason.)</blockquote></i>The \"some reason\" to which you alude is this bit Morbus said in IRC: \"I say 'proposed' rather innocently - its more 'shoved down everyone's throat by nazi dictator'... we should code name rss 2.0 'hitler'\".  There's frustration in there, and his wasn't the only head nodding in the room.  Morbus is over the top and says charged things I'd choose not to, but the frustration is real and genuine, and shared by more than one member of the community out here.  Yet, you always seem to \"take the high road\" by focusing on the over-the-top aspect, no matter the degree, ignoring the genuine gripe.<blockquote><i>...Bill Kearney has sent me private email about my deathbed, and what he hopes to teach me there, so I've chosen to filter his mail to a place where I never see it.</blockquote></i>Referring to private email is cheap - it's your word and his.<blockquote><i>I tried to come up with a word to describe how I feel about these people, this is what I came up with: monster.</blockquote></i>What a nasty thing to call potential collaborators and customers.  And what a viral, contagious thing, as you later demonstrate with Ben.  This doesn't seem very cluetrain-ish.<blockquote><i>...Hemenway has crossed that line. What happens next is stuff that will involve the police. I won't stand for these kinds of threats.</blockquote></i>What threat was made, and when will you be calling the police?  And how seriously will they take you?  You said yourself that you knew he wasn't seriously threatening you.  What stuff \"happens next\"?<blockquote><i>None of this means that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 will be delayed by even one moment.</blockquote></i>Thus, you avoid having to address the concerns all the \"monsters\" raise.<blockquote><i>I thought competition in the software business in the 80s was rough, but this is so much worse. Competition used to require a certain collegiality and professionalism. It's not true today. Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their way. Their perversion may even be the reason they're involved.</blockquote></i>But the funny thing about all of this is that most of this isn't business - it's hobby.  You've got a business, he's got a hobby, yet somehow he's competing with you.  I'm not a businessman by any stretch, but this comparison seems very odd.  (Hint:  Morbus is not acting as a professional in this context.  He can correct me if I've mistakenly assumed this.)</p>\r\n<p>These are people screwing around, trying things, playing with code.  And in order for these people to \"get their way\", they have to be nice to people and convince them to help out.  Otherwise, the cats wander off in search of fatter mice.  It becomes apparent rather quickly what sort of people they are from just a short bit of interaction with them.  And I've seen them \"triangulated\" as very nice people.<blockquote><i>Mr. Hemenway goes by the name Morbus Iff on his weblog, and writes for O'Reilly Associates, and for Ben Hammersley's syndication weblog. Mr. Hammersley is a reporter for the UK Guardian newspaper.</blockquote></i><blockquote><i>Postscript: Ben Hammersley threatened to sue me if I don't remove the previous paragraph. But every statement is true...</blockquote></i><a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=specious\">Specious</a> reasoning, at best.  Yes, Mr. Hammersley invited Morbus to write with him.  So, you feel free to splash him with the monster paint by association?<blockquote><i>The Guardian requests an apology. For what? They ran a tainted review.</blockquote></i>Oh, now we see the reason: He didn't plug your product in his review.  Though, he did say in the article, \"Did you notice how all those programs are free to use?\"  Perhaps he should have made that more a focus of the article, but he was writing about <i>free</i> programs.  I'm neither in his head, nor in the head of any Guardian editor, but maybe they didn't want the article to become free advertising for a commercial product?  Who knows.  He didn't mention you.  So that makes him a monster?<blockquote><i>Hammersley is a participant in the debate over the future of syndication technology, yet he wrote a review for the Guardian where that was not disclosed.</blockquote></i>This is obvious:  Many people who write about technology are involved with technology, even helping shape its direction.  It's what makes them most qualified to write about it.  This argument is starting to sound like politics - from whom did he get his funding?  I don't see you complaining when a \"participant in the debate\" <i>does</i> mention your product in an article.<blockquote><i>Now, either Hammersley didn't tell them, or they don't care, or British newspapers run ads without saying they're ads.</blockquote></i>Or maybe they didn't want to run <i>unpaid ads</i>?</p>\r\n<p>Okay.  I'm done.

First off, \"RSS 2.0: Hitler\" came first - it was, as l.m.orchard mentions, frustration at the RSS 2.0 spec, and the dictator like quality of Winer and his handling of it.\r\n\r\n\"Jewgregator\" came later, and is metaphoric in nature. With Dave being the dictator of RSS 2.0, there are all these other aggregator users, developers of RSS, and lovers of syndication who are being shafted with no respite. Dave thinks he has a wonderful spec, much like Hitler thought he was doing a \"good thing\" by cultural cleansing. The Jews suffered at the hands of Hitler, much like users will suffer at the hands of Winer.\r\n\r\nOf course, I do realize the inbred triviliazing of life based on this comparison - I'm not condoning, nor wiping away the deaths that occurred. It's merely another over-the-top metaphor that is ruder than necessary on a closer examination.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084174\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1f311d2ae9cd3f0e02d56b15924519ca&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\">Ehud Lamm</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084174\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-17T19:10:39\">2002-09-17T19:10:39</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Humor with reference to Jewish people is quite all right.

There is no need for sympathy here, we're simply trying to create a standard format that EVERYONE has imput into, and isn't runby a dictator.  Stop bringing up your illness, and try to grow up.

It seems the truth is starting to come crawling out of it's dark corners.  \r\n\r\nI'm likewise dumbfounded by Winer's arrogance and abuse.  The pleas of false sympathy are staggeringly ridiculous.  \r\n\r\nI have been a paying customer of Userland (small albeit, but one nonetheless).  This whole episode arose after receiving several obscene e-mails from him in reply to serious issues raised about said purchase.  At one point I was verbally offered a refund from Dave.  It has never materialized, perhaps being a welcher is another unexpected facet of his psychoses.\r\n\r\nWhile I'll make no arguments as to my use of, shall we say, pointedly direct style, I find it continuously appalling to hear in discussions with others that my experiences with him are nearly duplicates of theirs.  I'm shocked to see a vendor behaving in such a patently ridiculous manner.\r\n\r\nI have tremendous sympathies for anyone suffering from physical difficulties, cardiac or otherwise.  My dearly departed parents both suffered from heart ailments; they died three weeks apart.  I had to run two miles as a 14yr old kid to get help as my mother suffered her first myocardial infarction.  Now do I flail that about as some sort of shield to deflect culpability?  Hardly.  I've seen up close the agonies people suffer.  I've also seen the results of a lifetime of bad behavior and it's contributory influences.  So please, shut your pie hole you newbie.\r\n\r\nHis twisting of my comments is plain for all to see by reading the text of the original message.  And his slanderous attempts to conflate my actions with any form of violence or ill-will are utterly despicable.  \r\n\r\nShame on us?  Shame on US?&nbsp;  You hypocritical idiot!  Shame on YOU for making others suffer and exposing yourself to all sorts of added stress.  If you want to commit suicide with your postings that's your choice.

    "summary": "<p>I don&apos;t really want to add noise to the signal and would really rather just see some work get done, but I&apos;m still disgusted by <a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1744#monsters\">what Dave is writing</a>:</p><blockquote><i>...One of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>&apos;s competitors Kevin Hemenway, the author of Amphetadesk</i></blockquote>Competitor?  He was originally a customer of yours.  Then, just for the fun of it, he made his own implementation of the news aggregation features of your software, and <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/history.html\">even acknowledged his source of inspiration</a> when he released <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, calling Radio &quot;<i>a wonderful piece of work</i>&quot;.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> isn&apos;t for sale - it&apos;s free and open source.  If that makes him a competitor to your selling product, I think you need to work harder or smarter.<blockquote><i>...explains on his weblog how he intends to kill me. Even he says it&apos;s too harsh; and it may be a joke, if so, it&apos;s not funny. I don&apos;t see the humor in my own death, esp at the hands of a person like Hemenway. (He also coined the term Jewgregator,</i></blockquote>Morbus is over the top on a frequent basis, and sometimes too far over the top.  This is a known fact - his sense of humor is obviously dark and a bit off kilter.  He also produces good working software, and writes useful articles.  But three obvious things:  1) He didn&apos;t state any intention to kill you - it&apos;s just that it seems his mere presence would be enough to set you a-boil.  2) He referred to <a href=\"http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/1031728134.shtml\">Kevin Burton&apos;s account</a> of meeting you, which depicts you as someone very easily set a-boil.  3) You&apos;re providing an example in support of the account.<blockquote><i>and calls <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 &quot;Hitler&quot; for some reason.)</i></blockquote>The &quot;some reason&quot; to which you alude is this bit Morbus said in IRC: &quot;I say &apos;proposed&apos; rather innocently - its more &apos;shoved down everyone&apos;s throat by nazi dictator&apos;... we should code name rss 2.0 &apos;hitler&apos;&quot;.  There&apos;s frustration in there, and his wasn&apos;t the only head nodding in the room.  Morbus is over the top and says charged things I&apos;d choose not to, but the frustration is real and genuine, and shared by more than one member of the community out here.  Yet, you always seem to &quot;take the high road&quot; by focusing on the over-the-top aspect, no matter the degree, ignoring the genuine gripe.<blockquote><i>...Bill Kearney has sent me private email about my deathbed, and what he hopes to teach me there, so I&apos;ve chosen to filter his mail to a place where I never see it.</i></blockquote>Referring to private email is cheap - it&apos;s your word and his.<blockquote><i>I tried to come up with a word to describe how I feel about these people, this is what I came up with: monster.</i></blockquote>What a nasty thing to call potential collaborators and customers.  And what a viral, contagious thing, as you later demonstrate with Ben.  This doesn&apos;t seem very cluetrain-ish.<blockquote><i>...Hemenway has crossed that line. What happens next is stuff that will involve the police. I won&apos;t stand for these kinds of threats.</i></blockquote>What threat was made, and when will you be calling the police?  And how seriously will they take you?  You said yourself that you knew he wasn&apos;t seriously threatening you.  What stuff &quot;happens next&quot;?<blockquote><i>None of this means that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 will be delayed by even one moment.</i></blockquote>Thus, you avoid having to address the concerns all the &quot;monsters&quot; raise.<blockquote><i>I thought competition in the software business in the 80s was rough, but this is so much worse. Competition used to require a certain collegiality and professionalism. It&apos;s not true today. Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their way. Their perversion may even be the reason they&apos;re involved.</i></blockquote>But the funny thing about all of this is that most of this isn&apos;t business - it&apos;s hobby.  You&apos;ve got a business, he&apos;s got a hobby, yet somehow he&apos;s competing with you.  I&apos;m not a businessman by any stretch, but this comparison seems very odd.  (Hint:  Morbus is not acting as a professional in this context.  He can correct me if I&apos;ve mistakenly assumed this.)<p></p>\n<p>These are people screwing around, trying things, playing with code.  And in order for these people to &quot;get their way&quot;, they have to be nice to people and convince them to help out.  Otherwise, the cats wander off in search of fatter mice.  It becomes apparent rather quickly what sort of people they are from just a short bit of interaction with them.  And I&apos;ve seen them &quot;triangulated&quot; as very nice people.</p><blockquote><i>Mr. Hemenway goes by the name Morbus Iff on his weblog, and writes for O&apos;Reilly Associates, and for Ben Hammersley&apos;s syndication weblog. Mr. Hammersley is a reporter for the UK Guardian newspaper.</i></blockquote><blockquote><i>Postscript: Ben Hammersley threatened to sue me if I don&apos;t remove the previous paragraph. But every statement is true...</i></blockquote><a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=specious\">Specious</a> reasoning, at best.  Yes, Mr. Hammersley invited Morbus to write with him.  So, you feel free to splash him with the monster paint by association?<blockquote><i>The Guardian requests an apology. For what? They ran a tainted review.</i></blockquote>Oh, now we see the reason: He didn&apos;t plug your product in his review.  Though, he did say in the article, &quot;Did you notice how all those programs are free to use?&quot;  Perhaps he should have made that more a focus of the article, but he was writing about <i>free</i> programs.  I&apos;m neither in his head, nor in the head of any Guardian editor, but maybe they didn&apos;t want the article to become free advertising for a commercial product?  Who knows.  He didn&apos;t mention you.  So that makes him a monster?<blockquote><i>Hammersley is a participant in the debate over the future of syndication technology, yet he wrote a review for the Guardian where that was not disclosed.</i></blockquote>This is obvious:  Many people who write about technology are involved with technology, even helping shape its direction.  It&apos;s what makes them most qualified to write about it.  This argument is starting to sound like politics - from whom did he get his funding?  I don&apos;t see you complaining when a &quot;participant in the debate&quot; <i>does</i> mention your product in an article.<blockquote><i>Now, either Hammersley didn&apos;t tell them, or they don&apos;t care, or British newspapers run ads without saying they&apos;re ads.</i></blockquote>Or maybe they didn&apos;t want to run <i>unpaid ads</i>?<p></p>\n<p>Okay.  I&apos;m done.   This has distracted me from work for long enough today.</p>\n"

    "summary": "<p>Neat!  I love the blogosphere.  Bryce is <a href=\"http://radio.ntwizards.net/2002/09/10.html#a976\">attempting to implement</a> what <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000270.phtml#000270\">I&apos;d babbled about</a> last week: <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlogWalking\">BlogWalking</a> with a Zaurus.  I&apos;m still saving my pennies, and I&apos;ve yet to acquire a Zaurus of my own.  So, I&apos;ll be watching this experiment eagerly.</p>\n<p>I don&apos;t expect it to be perfect or necessarily go smoothly, but it&apos;s a first step.  Someone had mentioned that a PDA is inappropriate to host something like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>, since it&apos;s usually off or easy to lose.  Personally, I want to head toward having an easily wearable or pocketable device that contains (or at least has seamless access to) all my personal data, so a PDA seems ideal to me.  However, maybe a large server at  home behind my cable modem would work better as a personal data sink, with the the PDA being more like a personal data <i>buffer</i>.  This was suggested in comments on my previous entry as well, I believe.</p>\n<p>So, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> itself on a PDA and paired with rsync may or may not be nifty in the end.  I&apos;d like to try it, and then maybe think about doing something like a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BloggerAPI\">BloggerAPI</a> / metaWeblogAPI client that can buffer up entries and fire off the XML-RPC calls at a given sync time.</p>\n<p>Hmm...  more to think about.</p>\n"

Just <a href=\"http://saladwithsteve.com/osx/2002_02_01_archive.html#9710921\">use <code>rsync</code> to publish</a> whenever the thing finds itself on a network, wireless or otherwise.  Maybe that happens while you're out <a href=\"http://www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/WarWalking\">Warwalking</a> - better yet, maybe that wireless network detector you cobbled together autoblogs what it finds while in your pocket.  </p>\n<p>But, beyond that, I wonder what else having your blog in your pocket might give you?  Toss in a GPS unit somehow, maybe some other things like a thermometer device?  A compass?  Thinking about ways to automatically capture metadata about your present environment.  Why?  Why not, I'm sure if I thought longer, that stuff would seem useful.  </p>\n<p>And then there's the non-automatic writing you might do: jot down thoughts occuring on the spur of the moment; capture the scene as you sit in the park; report on the scene of an accident - or a disaster?  If you have a digital camera, and if both the PDA and camera had bluetooth, integrate the two so that you can easily combine the picture and 1000 words while they're fresh in your mind.</p>\n<p>But what about the other end of things - aggregation and reading?

I smell a meme.\nBack in March I wrote a longish piece titled Blogging Anywhere that briefly described how I was using PDAs to weblog wirelessly back in Y2K and went on to discuss modern options, including the idea of running weblog software directly on the Zaurus. I've not actually tried to do so yet, but it's been on my mind lately as I consider switching from Radio to Movable Type. I'm already using MT under a Linux VMware guest installation to maintain a private weblog, with FTP  pushing the static pages to my web host. Doing the same thing on the Zaurus doesn't seem challenging, but I'm not sure that using a PDA as the primary repository for weblog data is desirable.\nIf there was a way to keep two Movable Type installations synchronized...\nI think the best solution is to have weblog clients for PDAs that are designed to work offline and take advantage of network connections when they are available. I wrote such a client for Pocket PCs, check out Pocket Blog. It has some problems, but mostly it works ;-)\nAvantBlog is a Blogger API client that works with AvantGo. It's not as rich as Pocket Blog but can work on any platform with an AvantGo client supporting offline forms (Palm OS, CE, Pocket PC). handX weblog is another option for Palm OS users, but it is very limited and doesn't integrate with other weblog software.\nOn the aggregation front, PocketRSS and Pocket Feed are available now for Pocket PCs. I'm not aware of any Palm OS or Zaurus-specific aggregators, but AvantGo and Mazingo achieve similar ends.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088484\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.ntwizards.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=206fbbec4cb9474d5a622b33a450319b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.ntwizards.net\">Bryce</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088484\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-07T07:42:12\">2002-09-07T07:42:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">One more thing, now is a great time to be thinking about location-based services.

Not super-clean, of course. (And aided by my use of a tool which takes StructuredText instead of HTML, so I don't have to worry about silly tags.)\nI'm definitely intrigued by the open-ness of the Zaurus, though.

I smell a meme.\r\n\r\nBack in March I wrote a longish piece titled Blogging Anywhere that briefly described how I was using PDAs to weblog wirelessly back in Y2K and went on to discuss modern options, including the idea of running weblog software directly on the Zaurus. I've not actually tried to do so yet, but it's been on my mind lately as I consider switching from Radio to Movable Type. I'm already using MT under a Linux VMware guest installation to maintain a private weblog, with FTP  pushing the static pages to my web host. Doing the same thing on the Zaurus doesn't seem challenging, but I'm not sure that using a PDA as the primary repository for weblog data is desirable.\r\n\r\nIf there was a way to keep two Movable Type installations synchronized...\r\n\r\nI think the best solution is to have weblog clients for PDAs that are designed to work offline and take advantage of network connections when they are available. I wrote such a client for Pocket PCs, check out Pocket Blog. It has some problems, but mostly it works ;-)\r\n\r\nAvantBlog is a Blogger API client that works with AvantGo. It's not as rich as Pocket Blog but can work on any platform with an AvantGo client supporting offline forms (Palm OS, CE, Pocket PC). handX weblog is another option for Palm OS users, but it is very limited and doesn't integrate with other weblog software.\r\n\r\nOn the aggregation front, PocketRSS and Pocket Feed are available now for Pocket PCs. I'm not aware of any Palm OS or Zaurus-specific aggregators, but AvantGo and Mazingo achieve similar ends.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088484\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://radio.ntwizards.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=206fbbec4cb9474d5a622b33a450319b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://radio.ntwizards.net\">Bryce</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088484\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-07T07:42:12\">2002-09-07T07:42:12</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">One more thing, now is a great time to be thinking about location-based services.

Not super-clean, of course. (And aided by my use of a tool which takes StructuredText instead of HTML, so I don't have to worry about silly tags.)\r\n\r\nI'm definitely intrigued by the open-ness of the Zaurus, though.

Personally, I've been using it as my primary browser for about 5 weeks now, and update to the latest nightly every few days.  I had a glitch or two, but it's come light years from when I first started playing with it and it already seems to leave Mozilla-proper in the dust.</li>\n<li><b>Caffinated scraping:</b>\n<br /><br />\nI've been cobbling together an (X)HTML-to-RSS scraper using what I've learned of Java, XSLT, and XPath lately.  I've been tempted to slap together an aggregator of my own, too, but no: <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> has not made me itchy enough to do it.  The scraper might be of some use to someone though.</li>\n<li><b>Strange connectivity urges:</b>\n<br /><br />\nI've been having these strange urges lately to start playing with P2P-ish things again and build a collection of rendevous that piggyback on a number of existing infrastructures (ie. IRC, IM, NNTP, email, etc).  I want to get back on the path of investigating complete decentralization, or at least some robust thing which lies in between.  At the very least, though, I want to start doing some sort of IM-RPCish thing between behind-firewall PCs.  And this Jabber server I just installed on my new <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies\">JohnCompanies</a> system should be nice.  (It's at jabber.decafbad.com)\n</li>\n<li><b>Soaking in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a>:</b>\n<br /><br />\nBlessed be, I need help:  I've convinced them at work to let me pilot a weblog/journal system on our intranet - and I've started by installing the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a> source.  \n<br /><br />\nI've also installed LJ here on my new server from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies\">JohnCompanies</a>, but I'm not quite sure what I want to do with it beyond tweaking and personal hacking.  I've been musing at possibly enhancing some bits - particularly with regards to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> syndication and aggregation, maybe some backlink tracking.  \n<br /><br />\nMaybe I'll polish the thing up a bit and offer it up as a sister to LJ where the 15-year-olds will not reign and reciprocal connections with the outside world are encouraged and facilitated.  Would any of you pay for something like that?\n<br /><br />\nThis seems pretty ambitious, and it's likely I'll never do it, but hey.\n</li>\n<li><b>And on other fronts:</b>\n<br /><br />\nStill in the underworld with Java, trying to get this project dragged past the finish line.  Jaguar rocks and I took my girlfriend to the Apple Store opening in Novi, MI; we didn't buy anything, though it was close.    There's a second Apple Store opening in my area in Troy, MI; the danger has not passed.  And finally, I have succumbed lately to playing Grand Theft Auto 3 and it has affected my driving and given me pedestrian-smacking instincts to subdue while walking around town.\n</li>\n<li><b>That is all.

It's very, very, very rare that I see a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournaller\">LiveJournaller</a>'s posts linked into the Blogosphere at large.  Granted, I know that the median user was a 15 year old female who complains about Mom and her boyfriend, when last I checked.  But, as the adage goes: 90% of anything is crap.  There are, nevertheless, a good number of worthwhile streams of narrative in that space.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I don't see many of the people behind LJ stepping out and making noise in the Outer Blogosphere either.  I think many of them are just plain busy keeping the site afloat, or having lives, and LJ is world enough for them.</p>\n<p>But 650,000 users... that's a lot.  More than Radio and rivalling Blogger.com.  Is there a real qualitative difference in writing between the groups?  I would still imagine there's a lot of crap to be found via Blogger.com.  I'm not sure about Radio, though, since I get the impression that the 15 year olds have yet to flood into the userbase and its following seems more tilted toward professionals.</p>\n<p>But as for the software &amp; service itself...  As far as I can see, LJ is one of the easiest paths out there to starting a weblog/journal online.

My LJ tends to be less tech geeky and more personal, and my audience there is less interested in the things I do here.  Whereas I tend to assume that people who come here want to see what I'm playing with more than other musings and randomity.\nI suppose it's the culture of LJ, being that it's a tight-knit community and helped to be that way by the software.  Out here in the blogosphere at large, things seem to be more loosely flung about and less automatically connected.

It's very, very, very rare that I see a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournaller\">LiveJournaller</a>'s posts linked into the Blogosphere at large.  Granted, I know that the median user was a 15 year old female who complains about Mom and her boyfriend, when last I checked.  But, as the adage goes: 90% of anything is crap.  There are, nevertheless, a good number of worthwhile streams of narrative in that space.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, I don't see many of the people behind LJ stepping out and making noise in the Outer Blogosphere either.  I think many of them are just plain busy keeping the site afloat, or having lives, and LJ is world enough for them.</p>\r\n<p>But 650,000 users... that's a lot.  More than Radio and rivalling Blogger.com.  Is there a real qualitative difference in writing between the groups?  I would still imagine there's a lot of crap to be found via Blogger.com.  I'm not sure about Radio, though, since I get the impression that the 15 year olds have yet to flood into the userbase and its following seems more tilted toward professionals.</p>\r\n<p>But as for the software &amp; service itself...  As far as I can see, LJ is one of the easiest paths out there to starting a weblog/journal online.  And it was one of the first sites I ever encountered that had a desktop-based client app for posting to it.  And, though not prominently placed, they have <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds for every single journal on the site.  They're even working <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> aggregation features into the place by gatewaying external <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds in as special LJ users to be added like any other LJ \"friend\".</p>\r\n<p>So, to me, LJ sounds like a top competitor to every other blog/news aggregation product or service out there - yet I rarely hear about it.

My LJ tends to be less tech geeky and more personal, and my audience there is less interested in the things I do here.  Whereas I tend to assume that people who come here want to see what I'm playing with more than other musings and randomity.\r\n\r\nI suppose it's the culture of LJ, being that it's a tight-knit community and helped to be that way by the software.  Out here in the blogosphere at large, things seem to be more loosely flung about and less automatically connected.  I keep wanting to bring more LJ features to the blogs out here.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090322\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://organica.us/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3c69beb9eedff4e895809292dd7dd4cb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://organica.us/\">Ask Bjoern Hansen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090322\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-01T11:41:33\">2002-09-01T11:41:33</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Over at organica I have a lot of links from blogs.

It&apos;s very, very, very rare that I see a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournaller\">LiveJournaller</a>&apos;s posts linked into the Blogosphere at large.  Granted, I know that the median user was a 15 year old female who complains about Mom and her boyfriend, when last I checked.  But, as the adage goes: 90% of anything is crap.  There are, nevertheless, a good number of worthwhile streams of narrative in that space.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I don&apos;t see many of the people behind LJ stepping out and making noise in the Outer Blogosphere either.  I think many of them are just plain busy keeping the site afloat, or having lives, and LJ is world enough for them.</p>\n<p>But 650,000 users... that&apos;s a lot.  More than Radio and rivalling Blogger.com.  Is there a real qualitative difference in writing between the groups?  I would still imagine there&apos;s a lot of crap to be found via Blogger.com.  I&apos;m not sure about Radio, though, since I get the impression that the 15 year olds have yet to flood into the userbase and its following seems more tilted toward professionals.</p>\n<p>But as for the software &amp; service itself...  As far as I can see, LJ is one of the easiest paths out there to starting a weblog/journal online.  And it was one of the first sites I ever encountered that had a desktop-based client app for posting to it.  And, though not prominently placed, they have <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds for every single journal on the site.  They&apos;re even working <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> aggregation features into the place by gatewaying external <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds in as special LJ users to be added like any other LJ &quot;friend&quot;.</p>\n<p>So, to me, LJ sounds like a top competitor to every other blog/news aggregation product or service out there - yet I rarely hear about it.  Hrm.</p>\n<p>Anyone have a theory why?</p>\n"

Basic publish/subscribe model.  </p>\n<p>But the advantage Radio has over MT in this regard is this:  Radio is a persistently running app/server/daemon thing.  MT is a collection of scripts that does nothing until asked to run.  Radio can connect to IM and stay connected.  Something like MT would need to login to an IM service each and every time it wanted to ping.  Maybe that's not such a big deal, really.  I also have a hunch that there would be some difficulties with web hosting sites who don't really want customers emitting IMs from their CGIs.  Maybe not a big deal either.</p>\n<p>Just seems like an impedance mismatch, though.</p>\n<p>What I'd like to see is something like this:  An XML-RPC/SOAP <-> IM gateway.  And then, eventually, I'd like to see a decentrallized P2P network with XML-RPC/SOAP entry points that can smoothly replace centralized resources that have XML-RPC/SOAP entry points, maybe using IM networks as one possible rendevous point.  (Just remembered this project: <a href=\"http://relativity.yi.org/jxta-bridge/\">JXTA Bridge</a>.  Mental note - play with JXTA again and poke at SOAP some more.)</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooobfa\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090298\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://boston.conman.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=778e89305f331b88a87a94b348164df8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://boston.conman.org/\">Sean Conner</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090298\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-30T19:54:12\">2002-08-30T19:54:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Why not use IRC?

Basic publish/subscribe model.  </p>\r\n<p>But the advantage Radio has over MT in this regard is this:  Radio is a persistently running app/server/daemon thing.  MT is a collection of scripts that does nothing until asked to run.  Radio can connect to IM and stay connected.  Something like MT would need to login to an IM service each and every time it wanted to ping.  Maybe that's not such a big deal, really.  I also have a hunch that there would be some difficulties with web hosting sites who don't really want customers emitting IMs from their CGIs.  Maybe not a big deal either.</p>\r\n<p>Just seems like an impedance mismatch, though.</p>\r\n<p>What I'd like to see is something like this:  An XML-RPC/SOAP <-> IM gateway.  And then, eventually, I'd like to see a decentrallized P2P network with XML-RPC/SOAP entry points that can smoothly replace centralized resources that have XML-RPC/SOAP entry points, maybe using IM networks as one possible rendevous point.  (Just remembered this project: <a href=\"http://relativity.yi.org/jxta-bridge/\">JXTA Bridge</a>.  Mental note - play with JXTA again and poke at SOAP some more.)</p>\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=ooobfa\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090298\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://boston.conman.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=778e89305f331b88a87a94b348164df8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://boston.conman.org/\">Sean Conner</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090298\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-30T19:54:12\">2002-08-30T19:54:12</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Why not use IRC?

Basic publish/subscribe model.  </p>\n<p>But the advantage Radio has over MT in this regard is this:  Radio is a persistently running app/server/daemon thing.  MT is a collection of scripts that does nothing until asked to run.  Radio can connect to IM and stay connected.  Something like MT would need to login to an IM service each and every time it wanted to ping.  Maybe that&apos;s not such a big deal, really.  I also have a hunch that there would be some difficulties with web hosting sites who don&apos;t really want customers emitting IMs from their CGIs.  Maybe not a big deal either.</p>\n<p>Just seems like an impedance mismatch, though.</p>\n<p>What I&apos;d like to see is something like this:  An XML-RPC/SOAP &lt;-&gt; IM gateway.  And then, eventually, I&apos;d like to see a decentrallized P2P network with XML-RPC/SOAP entry points that can smoothly replace centralized resources that have XML-RPC/SOAP entry points, maybe using IM networks as one possible rendevous point.  (Just remembered this project: <a href=\"http://relativity.yi.org/jxta-bridge/\">JXTA Bridge</a>.  Mental note - play with JXTA again and poke at SOAP some more.)</p>\n"

    "summary": "<p><a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/2002/08/27.html#a766\">Sam Ruby responds</a> to <a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/whyRss10NamedRss\">Dave&apos;s question</a>:</p><blockquote><i>I am not a stakeholder in this naming issue, nor can I claim based on personal experience that any of the above references are authoritative, but based on these references alone, it seems to me that one could ask the converse to both of these questions: i.e, why is <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 0.91 called <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, and why did the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 0.91 branch use <code><rss></rss></code> instead of <code>[rdf:rdf]</code>?</i></blockquote>This is basically what I&apos;d started writing as a response the other night, but I lost it in a browser crash.<p></p>\n<p>I browsed around a bit, revisited some old links I&apos;d followed when first I started hacking with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> and frustratedly discovered the format fork.  <a href=\"http://backend.userland.com/stories/rss091\">As Dave tells it</a>, his adoption of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> started in cooperation with Netscape, and the later resulted in his continued support and development after Netscape had wandered away from it and shed the developers responsible.  So from his seat I would think that it looks like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> was abandoned in his lap and thus he felt free to continue on shaping it toward his own ends, namely those of simplicity and real dirt-under-the-nails use versus further design and planning.</p>\n<p>Then, later <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 comes into the picture.  About this point in history I&apos;m fuzzy.  Most accounts and articles I see do not mention how v1.0 came about and who birthed it.  Most of what I&apos;ve ready just basically says, &quot;And then there was v1.0&quot;  But who said so and when and why?</p>\n<p>That 1.0 has more in common with the v0.9 roots than any of Dave&apos;s v0.9x series is clear, so maybe in this respect one could say that this naturally lends v1.0 a &quot;natural&quot; claim on the name by virtue of bloodline and original intent.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, one could also say that Dave&apos;s v0.9x series has a claim on the name due to virtue of having actually been in active development directly after the original v0.9.

    "summary": "<p>Grr, shame on me for getting cheap hosting again.  For the most part, <a href=\"http://www.phpwebhosting.com\">PHPWebHosting</a> has been just fine - they give me SSH access to a shell, about 120MB of space, a few <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MySQL\">MySQL</a> databases, and generally leave me alone for US$10 per month.  But at this point, the leaving me alone bit isn&apos;t working out so well, since the server I&apos;m on over there has had its main disk fill up regularly, thus bringing down all the sites hosted on it (including mine).</p>\n<p>I&apos;d <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000245.phtml\">joked a little while ago</a> about getting myself an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XServe\">XServe</a> and finding some affordable colocation.  Now, though, I&apos;m not laughing so much.  I should probably just find another webhost, but it&apos;s tempting to have my own server.</p>\n<p>In the past, I had a few friends at an ISP, so they let me stash a little linux server on their network for occasional favors.  I miss that.  Didn&apos;t cost me anything, and my impact on their network was negligible.  Meanwhile, I had a stable, semi-reliable box on the net at which I could point a domain.  Services could catch fire and other things could tank, and no one got hurt.</p>\n<p>The problem now, though, is that shelling out for a server and colocation costs just to play around is a just a <strong>smidgen</strong> outside my budget.  As I&apos;ve pondered before, maybe I could actually host a money-making service on it with some of these hacks I&apos;m percolating through.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a co-worker put the idea in my head that it might not be unreasonable to think that I could invite some tenants onto my server to share some of the cost.  I figure I&apos;d take the burden of buying &amp; owning the server, but I&apos;d like to spread the service cost out.  I wouldn&apos;t want to make a profit, I&apos;d just like to make a kind of nerd commune.  It&apos;d be nice if I could get the cost for everyone under US$10-15, though I imagine my cost would be higher given a server payment.  If I could get mine below $40-50 a month, I think I&apos;d be happy, though this seems like a pipe dream.</p>\n<p>The devil being in the details, however, I don&apos;t really know how one would go about such a thing, considering service agreements and contracts and taxes and blah blah blah.  I&apos;m a financial moron, and I&apos;m also certainly not into being a 24/7 available customer service rep, or to perform tech help.  Basically, I&apos;d like to run a server to host mad scientist experiments performed by a relatively small cadre of mad scientists who can mostly clean up after themselves.  I&apos;d like to run an IRC server, maybe a Jabber server, maybe a few random half-baked server ideas.</p>\n<p>On the other other hand, is anyone out there doing this already and want a new tenant?  :)</p>\n"

Dave</i></blockquote>Now first of all, I too <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000191.phtml\">disagree with Dave's definition</a>, and have posted as much.  Although I did so in a less rant-mode manner, both Morbus and I pointed to the fact that the news aggregator definition served the goals of Radio 8.0 marketing, being that the definition very specifically identified the features of his own product.  Rant or not, the point is made.</p>\n<p>What disappoints me about Dave's response on-list, though, is that instead of addressing the content of the disagreement, he goes after the ranting and hits back with a smidgen of ad-hominem of his own while calling for the \"high road\".  Then, once he's tagged on the ad-hominem he unsubscribes and dismisses the list altogether, never actually acknowledging the original point made.</p>\n<p>Now, though I don't have a link, I've read several times where Dave has disparaged discussion groups and offered linked weblogs as the superior alternative.  I've read his essay on <a href=\"http://www.userland.com/whatIsStopEnergy\">Stop Energy</a>.  I'm aware of his position toward the grousings and grumblings and flamings that go on within a discussion group.  And I've nodded my head almost every time he's written about these things - freeform discussions on the net can sometimes - but not always - be a clusterfuck of morons and Stop Energy.</p>\n<p>Maybe it's just because Dave is so intolerably fed up with <i>any</i> hint of a clusterfuck that he dropped off the list.  I wouldn't put up with much shit either, especially after heart surgery.  But to me it looked like pretty defensive behavior right from the get-go.  Morbus even gave somewhat of an apology (for him :) ) and moved on to politely hit the issues.</p>\n<p>I guess this bugs me a bit, along with other <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>-related thoughts I've had lately, for this reason:  Here's a discussion group devoted to the very nature and future of one of the headline features of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a>.  And the people there are some of the most prevalent names I've seen appear time and time again in relation ot the subject.  I would think that this would be a dream group for him, in terms of driving and benefiting from innovation.  Instead, it takes only a small amount of rant to drive him away.</p>\n<p>See, I've never met him, but I think I'd like Dave personally.  Yes, I know his writings often have one foot or both feet in marketing for his products.  But, I can't recall his denying this, and I see it as the natural behavior of someone who really thinks he's got something hot.  He gives favor to his customers in his posts, and he has his own opinions.  But I know these things, and I still like his software, and I still buy it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it's clear that sometimes he doesn't give equal time to points which may be contradictory or unfavorable to his side of things, and sometimes he gets things wrong.  But he's not a journallist - he's a blogger who writes from the hip and sees what flies.  Whether he lies outright is another story I haven't the first inclination to follow up on, but the very nature of his product stands to check and balance to him there.  He can't get away with too much with his own customers calling him on things.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm starting to ramble.  What really bothers me about the quick dismissal of the list seems like a \"See?! This is what I mean!\" demonstration on-list, and I almost expect a post later again promoting weblogs over DG's altogether.  But I didn't even see him give the list a chance, and I think that's sad given the brain power in that roster.  Granted, it's his perogative to have slim thresholds for annoyance, but I'd think this would be value for his company and product.  As I said, I like his software, but he's refusing free help and consultation on the future of his product.  I see those involved in groups like this taking their products beyond his, even those that were originally direct clones of his.  Maybe this ends up tying into his grousing on Open Source versus commercial software eventually.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, maybe he just thinks he doesn't need any help of this sort and has the sheer magnitude of innovational mojo to leave us all in the dust.  If so, rock on.  :)  As for me, I just joined the list.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooobeo\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082938\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100875\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=49fee9c8389d0310cceb32653dd7fdd8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100875\">mikel</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082938\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-21T17:13:28\">2002-08-21T17:13:28</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Yes, that was a sticky start to the group.

    "summary": "<p>Scanning news today, I see in my referrers a link from the <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aggregators/\">new aggregators discussion group</a> to my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000228.phtml\">outliner </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> skin.  Curious, I go <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aggregators/message/44?threaded=1\">check it out</a> and see what looks like a bit of grumbling between <a href=\"http://www.scripting.com\">Dave Winer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com\">Morbus Iff</a>.  I make my way back to <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aggregators/message/42\">near the head of the thread</a> to see what&apos;s what, where I find a link to Morbus&apos; <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/dnn/2002/06/index.shtml#001333\">post of opinioned and somewhat ranty disagreement</a> toward <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com/whatIsANewsAggregator\">Dave&apos;s definition of the modern News Aggregator</a>.  What disturbs me is that the grumbling <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aggregators/message/48\">quickly ends</a> with:</p><blockquote><i>Bill -- I&apos;m going to unsubscribe from this list now. The neener boys are in charge. Take care. Dave</i></blockquote>Now first of all, I too <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000191.phtml\">disagree with Dave&apos;s definition</a>, and have posted as much.  Although I did so in a less rant-mode manner, both Morbus and I pointed to the fact that the news aggregator definition served the goals of Radio 8.0 marketing, being that the definition very specifically identified the features of his own product.  Rant or not, the point is made.<p></p>\n<p>What disappoints me about Dave&apos;s response on-list, though, is that instead of addressing the content of the disagreement, he goes after the ranting and hits back with a smidgen of ad-hominem of his own while calling for the &quot;high road&quot;.  Then, once he&apos;s tagged on the ad-hominem he unsubscribes and dismisses the list altogether, never actually acknowledging the original point made.</p>\n<p>Now, though I don&apos;t have a link, I&apos;ve read several times where Dave has disparaged discussion groups and offered linked weblogs as the superior alternative.  I&apos;ve read his essay on <a href=\"http://www.userland.com/whatIsStopEnergy\">Stop Energy</a>.  I&apos;m aware of his position toward the grousings and grumblings and flamings that go on within a discussion group.  And I&apos;ve nodded my head almost every time he&apos;s written about these things - freeform discussions on the net can sometimes - but not always - be a clusterfuck of morons and Stop Energy.</p>\n<p>Maybe it&apos;s just because Dave is so intolerably fed up with <i>any</i> hint of a clusterfuck that he dropped off the list.  I wouldn&apos;t put up with much shit either, especially after heart surgery.  But to me it looked like pretty defensive behavior right from the get-go.  Morbus even gave somewhat of an apology (for him :) ) and moved on to politely hit the issues.</p>\n<p>I guess this bugs me a bit, along with other <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>-related thoughts I&apos;ve had lately, for this reason:  Here&apos;s a discussion group devoted to the very nature and future of one of the headline features of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a>.

    "html": "<p><MTXMLRPCFilter url=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/twiki_xmlrpc.cgi\"></p>\n<p>Last week, after reading what <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/15.html#better_living_through_regular_expressions\">Mark Pilgrim had to say</a> about macros in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>, I made a mental note to finally circle back around to hacking together my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a> now that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> has plugin features.</p>\n<p>Turns out it was so much easier than I thought it would be.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>'s plugin scheme is dead simple, which hopefully means that plugins will flourish like mad.</p>\n<p>First, I hacked together <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTWikiFormatPlugin\">MTWikiFormatPlugin</a>.  This plugin simply implements a new container tag, MTWikiFormat, which runs the contents of the tag through <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=all&amp;query=Text::WikiFormat\" title=\"CPAN search for Text::WikiFormat\">CPAN:Text::WikiFormat</a>.  This doesn't actually integrate with any existing wiki, but it is very simple to install and does bring some wiki-ness to blog entries, including some limited formatting and <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWords\" title=\"'WikiWords' on the original 'WikiWikiWeb' site\">Wiki:WikiWords</a>.  This doesn't provide everything Mark had posted in a lil wishlist comment to me, but it's a start.  Maybe I'll look into tearing the formatting guts out of some wiki to make a Text::WikiFormat replacement, or maybe I'll submit patches to the original module.</p>\n<p>The second plugin though, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a>, is what I'm really happy about.  <br />\nWhereas <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTWikiFormatPlugin\">MTWikiFormatPlugin</a> filters content through one perl module, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> can filter content through one or more <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XmlRpcFilteringPipe</a> interfaces.  I have a handful of these filters available on my site right now, and in a little while I will catalog them in the wiki.  For now, I'm just filtering this entry through <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DecafbadWiki\">DecafbadWiki</a>.  In the future, I may get more adventurous with my content filtering pipeline.</p>\n<p>One drawback to using <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> for the purposes of a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a> is that I've only got support for TWiki so far in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\">XmlRpcToWiki</a> project.  Other wikis still need some hacking before they can provide filters.  Some assembly required, fellow <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AlphaGeek\">AlphaGeeks</a>.</p>\n<p>So, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.

I tried this lil oneliner with an undef result on your \nperl -MSOAP::Lite -MXMLRPC::Lite -MData::Dumper -e'$txt = \"This is a test foo foo foo foo WikiWord TwikiWiki\"; print Data::Dumper::Dumper(XMLRPC::Lite->proxy(\"http://www.10500bc.org/twiki/bin/twiki_xmlrpc.cgi\")->call(\"wiki.filterData\", SOAP::Data->type(base64 => $txt), \"text/html\", {})->result()).\"\\n\"'\nWhereas on my install, I get:\n$VAR1 = {\n'data' => 'This is a test foo foo foo foo ?WikiWord ?TwikiWiki',\n'contentType' => 'text/html'\n};\nHmm, I wonder if that jumble will make any swnse? :)  Does your error log say anything?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087055\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.10500bc.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2a158ec6895b9af4ce255febfe69ffee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.10500bc.org\">Josh Cooper</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087055\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-20T13:38:11\">2002-08-20T13:38:11</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Yep that makes perfect since. I finally found that XML::Parser::Lite module was missing the twiki lib. Once i added that the test returns the following result:\n$VAR1 = {\n'data' => 'This is a foo foo foo foo WikiWord? TwikiWiki?',\n'contentType' => 'text/html'\n};\nWhich should be correct or close anyway. So that part works now, but now it appears the plugin not returning any information on the entries, at least its not giving an error message so it must be running.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087056\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087056\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-20T14:22:13\">2002-08-20T14:22:13</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Hmm, well, if there are no more errors and that testing one-liner works, the thing *should* be working.

Kinda odd but could very well be related to formatting or something of that nature.\nAnyway my plan is to use the extended mode anyway, so thanks again for such a kick ass plugin, and the other stuff you do also!

    "body": "<p><MTXMLRPCFilter url=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/twiki_xmlrpc.cgi\"></p>\r\n<p>Last week, after reading what <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/15.html#better_living_through_regular_expressions\">Mark Pilgrim had to say</a> about macros in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>, I made a mental note to finally circle back around to hacking together my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a> now that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> has plugin features.</p>\r\n<p>Turns out it was so much easier than I thought it would be.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>'s plugin scheme is dead simple, which hopefully means that plugins will flourish like mad.</p>\r\n<p>First, I hacked together <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTWikiFormatPlugin\">MTWikiFormatPlugin</a>.  This plugin simply implements a new container tag, MTWikiFormat, which runs the contents of the tag through <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=all&amp;query=Text::WikiFormat\" title=\"CPAN search for Text::WikiFormat\">CPAN:Text::WikiFormat</a>.  This doesn't actually integrate with any existing wiki, but it is very simple to install and does bring some wiki-ness to blog entries, including some limited formatting and <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWords\" title=\"'WikiWords' on the original 'WikiWikiWeb' site\">Wiki:WikiWords</a>.  This doesn't provide everything Mark had posted in a lil wishlist comment to me, but it's a start.  Maybe I'll look into tearing the formatting guts out of some wiki to make a Text::WikiFormat replacement, or maybe I'll submit patches to the original module.</p>\r\n<p>The second plugin though, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a>, is what I'm really happy about.  <br />\r\nWhereas <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTWikiFormatPlugin\">MTWikiFormatPlugin</a> filters content through one perl module, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> can filter content through one or more <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XmlRpcFilteringPipe</a> interfaces.  I have a handful of these filters available on my site right now, and in a little while I will catalog them in the wiki.  For now, I'm just filtering this entry through <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DecafbadWiki\">DecafbadWiki</a>.  In the future, I may get more adventurous with my content filtering pipeline.</p>\r\n<p>One drawback to using <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> for the purposes of a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a> is that I've only got support for TWiki so far in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\">XmlRpcToWiki</a> project.  Other wikis still need some hacking before they can provide filters.  Some assembly required, fellow <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AlphaGeek\">AlphaGeeks</a>.</p>\r\n<p>So, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.

I tried this lil oneliner with an undef result on your \r\n\r\nperl -MSOAP::Lite -MXMLRPC::Lite -MData::Dumper -e'$txt = \"This is a test foo foo foo foo WikiWord TwikiWiki\"; print Data::Dumper::Dumper(XMLRPC::Lite->proxy(\"http://www.10500bc.org/twiki/bin/twiki_xmlrpc.cgi\")->call(\"wiki.filterData\", SOAP::Data->type(base64 => $txt), \"text/html\", {})->result()).\"\\n\"'\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas on my install, I get:\r\n\r\n\r\n$VAR1 = {\r\n          'data' => 'This is a test foo foo foo foo ?WikiWord ?TwikiWiki',\r\n          'contentType' => 'text/html'\r\n        };\r\n\r\nHmm, I wonder if that jumble will make any swnse? :)  Does your error log say anything?</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087055\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.10500bc.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2a158ec6895b9af4ce255febfe69ffee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.10500bc.org\">Josh Cooper</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087055\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-20T13:38:11\">2002-08-20T13:38:11</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Yep that makes perfect since. I finally found that XML::Parser::Lite module was missing the twiki lib. Once i added that the test returns the following result:\r\n\r\n$VAR1 = {\r\n          'data' => 'This is a foo foo foo foo WikiWord? TwikiWiki?',\r\n          'contentType' => 'text/html'\r\n        };\r\n\r\nWhich should be correct or close anyway. So that part works now, but now it appears the plugin not returning any information on the entries, at least its not giving an error message so it must be running.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087056\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087056\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-20T14:22:13\">2002-08-20T14:22:13</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Hmm, well, if there are no more errors and that testing one-liner works, the thing *should* be working.  Though, I noticed you put [wikiWord] in an entry.  I'm not sure if that would do much, since TWiki uses double-bracket links.  Like: [[WikiWord]] or [[Perl]] or [[Python]].\r\n\r\nI do hope it starts working for you.

I'm not sure why its not picking the others up automatically in the entries, but it is out side of the entries. Kinda odd but could very well be related to formatting or something of that nature.\r\n\r\nAnyway my plan is to use the extended mode anyway, so thanks again for such a kick ass plugin, and the other stuff you do also! Glad I could be a tester for you :)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087059\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087059\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-20T15:25:43\">2002-08-20T15:25:43</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Strange...  I don't think that extended=\"1\" actually does anything in the MTXMLRPCFilter tag.  It does in the MTWikiFormat tag though.  You should also be able to use TWiki formatting rules too, like *bold* and tables and lists and things.\r\n\r\nGlad to see it's working though, and thanks for being a tester :)  Yay!</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087061\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://stupendous.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2e0efdbe758e69dc351b92d1c255a853&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://stupendous.net/\">Nathan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087061\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-29T05:08:39\">2004-04-29T05:08:39</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Mate, your TWiki is dead:\r\n\r\nSoftware error:\r\n\r\nBad arg length for Socket::pack_sockaddr_in, length is 0, should be 4 at /usr/lib/perl/5.8/Socket.pm line 201.\r\n\r\nFor help, please send mail to the webmaster (you@your.address), giving this error message and the time and date of the error.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

    "summary": "<p><mtxmlrpcfilter url=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/twiki_xmlrpc.cgi\"></mtxmlrpcfilter></p>\n<p>Last week, after reading what <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/15.html#better_living_through_regular_expressions\">Mark Pilgrim had to say</a> about macros in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>, I made a mental note to finally circle back around to hacking together my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a> now that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> has plugin features.</p>\n<p>Turns out it was so much easier than I thought it would be.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>&apos;s plugin scheme is dead simple, which hopefully means that plugins will flourish like mad.</p>\n<p>First, I hacked together <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTWikiFormatPlugin\">MTWikiFormatPlugin</a>.  This plugin simply implements a new container tag, MTWikiFormat, which runs the contents of the tag through <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=all&amp;query=Text::WikiFormat\" title=\"CPAN search for Text::WikiFormat\">CPAN:Text::WikiFormat</a>.  This doesn&apos;t actually integrate with any existing wiki, but it is very simple to install and does bring some wiki-ness to blog entries, including some limited formatting and <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWords\" title=\"&apos;WikiWords&apos; on the original &apos;WikiWikiWeb&apos; site\">Wiki:WikiWords</a>.  This doesn&apos;t provide everything Mark had posted in a lil wishlist comment to me, but it&apos;s a start.  Maybe I&apos;ll look into tearing the formatting guts out of some wiki to make a Text::WikiFormat replacement, or maybe I&apos;ll submit patches to the original module.</p>\n<p>The second plugin though, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a>, is what I&apos;m really happy about.  <br>\nWhereas <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTWikiFormatPlugin\">MTWikiFormatPlugin</a> filters content through one perl module, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> can filter content through one or more <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XmlRpcFilteringPipe</a> interfaces.  I have a handful of these filters available on my site right now, and in a little while I will catalog them in the wiki.  For now, I&apos;m just filtering this entry through <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DecafbadWiki\">DecafbadWiki</a>.  In the future, I may get more adventurous with my content filtering pipeline.</p>\n<p>One drawback to using <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> for the purposes of a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a> is that I&apos;ve only got support for TWiki so far in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\">XmlRpcToWiki</a> project.  Other wikis still need some hacking before they can provide filters.  Some assembly required, fellow <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AlphaGeek\">AlphaGeeks</a>.</p>\n<p>So, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.  Time for bed.</p>\n<p></p>\n"

    "html": "<p>Ack.  Okay, so I started tinkering with <a href=\"http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/bml\">Bean Markup Language</a> as the configuration glue for my Java app.  So far it seems to be working very nicely and doing everything I want it to do.  The problem, though, is that as I look around for examples and things I notice that it seems as if this project is dead.  I look further, and I realize...  <i>I can't find any source code to this thing.</i>  And here I am working it into the core of my app.</p>\n<p>Well, I'd hate to start over and reinvent this wheel, since it seems to be such a nice wheel.  Between the clean definition of beans and their properties, and the ability to toss little bits of script (using the <a href=\"http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf\">BSF</a>) in there to further tweak things, it seems perfect.  But the apparent abandonment of the project and my lack of source gives me the willies.</p>\n<p>So...  Does anyone out there know anything about what's happened with the <a href=\"http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/bml\">Bean Markup Language</a> project?  Could anyone get me the source?  Or, could someone point me to an equivalent alternative?  Because, if I can't find source or an equally powerful alternative, I'm tossing around the notion of re-implementing BML with a clone project if the license doesn't prohibit it.</p>\n<p>Or am I completely crazy and barking up the wrong tree to begin with?  Is there a better, more elegant way to create and connect Java components together than this?  And is it free?</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooobcb\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083506\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9db42ab5ca7ead39c85c7efcd9569b10&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">robert</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083506\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-14T22:07:52\">2002-08-14T22:07:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">You might want to take a look at Jelly from Apache Commons (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/sandbox/jelly/index.html) where it says in part \"Jelly is a Java and XML based scripting and processing engine....

Our group moved on to doing BSF (which is what bo is referring to in the previous post, not BML) and now work on a bunch of Web services stuff.\nSome of the composition ideas in BML went into WSFL as well as its recently announced replacement BPEL4WS. However, neither of those is yet a full replacement for BML. We've always intended to get to a point where one composition language works for various models, including JavaBeans, but the underlying component model of Web services (WSDL, the IBM part of which was also developed by our group) is not yet rich enough for that.\nSo, that amounts to saying that I still believe BML has a useful role in life. We still have some of our original trusty users who periodically email us asking for status / updates etc.. \nWhat's the right thing to do? I am quite certain that we can get it open-sourced (I mean from an IBM process point of view), but I haven't yet been convinced that there'd be a willing community for it yet. \nJelly doesn't quite sound the same as BML; BML is strictly a composition language and is not a scripting language. (If you care to read more about the difference I can point you to a paper we wrote and to others' papers.)\nSo, would BML be interesting as an open-source project?

Our group moved on to doing BSF (which is what bo is referring to in the previous post, not BML) and now work on a bunch of Web services stuff.\r\n\r\nSome of the composition ideas in BML went into WSFL as well as its recently announced replacement BPEL4WS. However, neither of those is yet a full replacement for BML. We've always intended to get to a point where one composition language works for various models, including JavaBeans, but the underlying component model of Web services (WSDL, the IBM part of which was also developed by our group) is not yet rich enough for that.\r\n\r\nSo, that amounts to saying that I still believe BML has a useful role in life. We still have some of our original trusty users who periodically email us asking for status / updates etc.. \r\n\r\nWhat's the right thing to do? I am quite certain that we can get it open-sourced (I mean from an IBM process point of view), but I haven't yet been convinced that there'd be a willing community for it yet. \r\n\r\nJelly doesn't quite sound the same as BML; BML is strictly a composition language and is not a scripting language. (If you care to read more about the difference I can point you to a paper we wrote and to others' papers.)\r\n\r\nSo, would BML be interesting as an open-source project? If so, where?\r\n\r\nSanjiva.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083511\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083511\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-15T01:01:47\">2002-08-15T01:01:47</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Well, I saw this message concerning a move of the Bean Scripting Framework to Apache...

    "summary": "<p>So I&apos;ve been in the underworld these past weeks, head down in battle with this project in my return to Java, as I&apos;d written last month.  It&apos;s been great fun, and I&apos;ve not missed perl at all along the way.  (Although, I <i>did</i> miss <a href=\"http://www.cpan.org\">CPAN</a>.)  I&apos;ve raided the stocks of <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org\">Jakarta</a> and other shores, and I&apos;ve flagged <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0107789/\">a few</a> <a href=\"http://blogs.werken.com/people/bob/\">new people</a> <a href=\"http://roller.anthonyeden.com/page/rickard/\">to watch</a> <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0108103/\">on my</a> <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100190/\">daily scan</a>.</p>\n<p>These past 4 weeks or so, it&apos;s amazing to me during how many new or long-neglected (to me) technologies at which I&apos;ve thrown myself, and managed to use productively.  Among them are <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/XML/\">XML</a>, <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/index.html\">Xerces</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt\">XSLT</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath\">XPath</a>, <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/index.html\">Xalan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/\">SVG</a>, <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/batik/index.html\">Batik</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dbxml.org\">Xindice</a>, <a href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net\">JUnit</a>, <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/index.html\">Log4J</a>, <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html\">Ant</a>, <a href=\"http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/bml\">BML</a>, <a href=\"http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf\">BSF</a>, <a href=\"http://www.beanshell.org\">BeanShell</a>, <a href=\"http://www.netbeans.org\">NetBeans</a>, and a slew of others my poor sore brain won&apos;t produce at the moment.  I&apos;ve plucked each of these from the ether and carefully tied them all together into a loosely confederated beast that, surprisingly, works as I&apos;d intended thus far.</p>\n<p>My biggest regret during this voyage is that this beast will likely never roam beyond the fences of my employer&apos;s realm.  But, I still have the new experience with building the beast.  And besides, you&apos;d probably all laugh at the poor thing anyway since its the product of wobbling new steps.  Though, actually, that would be a good thing for my company and myself since some of you might tell me <i>why</i> you&apos;re laughing.</p>\n<p>But, no matter - that&apos;s a political fight I&apos;m not yet prepared to enter here at work, so maybe I can think of other things with which to tinker, out here in the open.</p>\n<p>The Java support in OS X makes me very happy, as does having Java Web Start come installed out of the box.  And so, today I was also happy when I saw <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0107789/stories/2002/08/14/thinrss.html\">ThinRSS</a> and managed to launch it with a click.

    "summary": "<p>So are any of you guys getting itchy?  I&apos;ve had a great Summer all around, but without much hacking or progress on little projects.  And I&apos;ve noticed that there&apos;s been relative quiet and little hacking amongst my reading list&apos;s authors.  Could be that I&apos;m just not looking in the right places - I did lose a few subscriptions in my bounce from Radio to Ampheta for daily use.  But I just don&apos;t see as many daily innovations as I did toward the end of Winter and beginning of Spring.</p>\n<p>As for me, as the nights get longer and things get colder, I&apos;m starting to feel an itch to start tinkering again.  Maybe it has to do with not-yet-dead back-to-school reflexes - summer vacation&apos;s over, and its time to get back to learning and experimenting.  Starting to look again at my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome\">neglected wiki</a>, and of course I&apos;ve started tinkering with my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaDesk outliner skin</a> again.  I&apos;ve also been thinking about my <a hrec=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Projects\">other little projects</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShowReferers\">referrer links</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000192.phtml\">whitelist-based spam filtering</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XML-RPC pipelines</a>, and other things I&apos;ve not touched in months.  </p>\n<p>The fact that I&apos;d not felt like playing with these toys for so long worried me a bit, so the return of the itch is reassuring.  So, I should get back to playing soon.  And, now that <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=deus_x&amp;itemid=180842&amp;nc=12\">my   financial situation has greatly improved</a>, I also need to figure out where to start and to whom I should talk on <i>really</i> heading back to school.</p>\n<p>So Summer has been just a nice, long nap in a hammock.

    "html": "<p>At last:  I had a good solid hacking session with the beast under <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a>, and I think I've flushed out the showstopper bugs.  So, here's yet <i>another</i> release (hopefully <i>zaro boogs</i>) of the thing for you to grab and try:<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/gems/AmphetaOutlines-20020806-2.tar.gz\">AmphetaOutlines-20020806-2.tar.gz</a></li></ul>Thanks for bearing with me out there and not beating me about the head and shoulders.  :)  I mean, yes, it's free and its experimental...  but it's still damn frustrating.</p>\n<p>Basically, the trouble started when I tried to use \"<code>use lib</code>\".  Seems like a reasonable enough request, <code>lib.pm</code> being very much a core part of perl.  But, Morbus hadn't used it anywhere in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, so Perl2EXE cheerfully left it out.  Well, I had to hack by other means, since I wanted this thing to be as drop-in compatible with the current release of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> as possible.</p>\n<p>And then, there were other bits I'd left out.  And also there were the bits that I'd written at 3:30 am the other night and wasn't precisely sure what made it possible for them to actually work anywhere, let alone on my iBook.  But, I think now I've got things under control.</p>\n<p>It makes me appreciate the OS X environment so much more.  OS X is like driving a nice big, fully packed RV that handles like a station wagon down the hacking highway.  On the other hand, Windows is a Ford Festiva with a hole in the floorboards and a nagging suspicion that I forgot something back at the house.  Okay, so that was a bit contrived.  I just wanted to say <i>something</i> smarmy after all this grumbling.  :)</p>\n<p>Is this thing working for anyone yet?! </p>\n<p><b>Update:</b> In case you were wondering, this release should be usable via the original instructions <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000226.phtml\">back here</a>.  Which are, basically:<ol><li>Replace <code>templates/default</code> with this archive's contents.</li><li>Create a directory named <code>channels_meta</code> in your <code>data</code> directory.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">Share and Enjoy</a></li></ol></p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooobbh\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084716\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=53617e52a0ccf29f19c750e312df0f31&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\">Steve</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084716\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-07T03:17:31\">2002-08-07T03:17:31</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Still have some trouble :( Sorry.. \nAmphetadesk opens up ok, the templates are now fine.

Suffice it to say, it'll be in the next version of AmphetaDesk (as well as most of the good stuff from these templates). \nI can't thank l.m.orchard enough for doing these hacks whilst I'm away working on other things.

    "body": "<p>At last:  I had a good solid hacking session with the beast under <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a>, and I think I've flushed out the showstopper bugs.  So, here's yet <i>another</i> release (hopefully <i>zaro boogs</i>) of the thing for you to grab and try:<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/gems/AmphetaOutlines-20020806-2.tar.gz\">AmphetaOutlines-20020806-2.tar.gz</a></li></ul>Thanks for bearing with me out there and not beating me about the head and shoulders.  :)  I mean, yes, it's free and its experimental...  but it's still damn frustrating.</p>\r\n<p>Basically, the trouble started when I tried to use \"<code>use lib</code>\".  Seems like a reasonable enough request, <code>lib.pm</code> being very much a core part of perl.  But, Morbus hadn't used it anywhere in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, so Perl2EXE cheerfully left it out.  Well, I had to hack by other means, since I wanted this thing to be as drop-in compatible with the current release of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> as possible.</p>\r\n<p>And then, there were other bits I'd left out.  And also there were the bits that I'd written at 3:30 am the other night and wasn't precisely sure what made it possible for them to actually work anywhere, let alone on my iBook.  But, I think now I've got things under control.</p>\r\n<p>It makes me appreciate the OS X environment so much more.  OS X is like driving a nice big, fully packed RV that handles like a station wagon down the hacking highway.  On the other hand, Windows is a Ford Festiva with a hole in the floorboards and a nagging suspicion that I forgot something back at the house.  Okay, so that was a bit contrived.  I just wanted to say <i>something</i> smarmy after all this grumbling.  :)</p>\r\n<p>Is this thing working for anyone yet?! </p>\r\n<p><b>Update:</b> In case you were wondering, this release should be usable via the original instructions <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000226.phtml\">back here</a>.

    "summary": "<p>At last:  I had a good solid hacking session with the beast under <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a>, and I think I&apos;ve flushed out the showstopper bugs.  So, here&apos;s yet <i>another</i> release (hopefully <i>zaro boogs</i>) of the thing for you to grab and try:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/gems/AmphetaOutlines-20020806-2.tar.gz\">AmphetaOutlines-20020806-2.tar.gz</a></li></ul>Thanks for bearing with me out there and not beating me about the head and shoulders.  :)  I mean, yes, it&apos;s free and its experimental...  but it&apos;s still damn frustrating.<p></p>\n<p>Basically, the trouble started when I tried to use &quot;<code>use lib</code>&quot;.  Seems like a reasonable enough request, <code>lib.pm</code> being very much a core part of perl.  But, Morbus hadn&apos;t used it anywhere in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, so Perl2EXE cheerfully left it out.  Well, I had to hack by other means, since I wanted this thing to be as drop-in compatible with the current release of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> as possible.</p>\n<p>And then, there were other bits I&apos;d left out.  And also there were the bits that I&apos;d written at 3:30 am the other night and wasn&apos;t precisely sure what made it possible for them to actually work anywhere, let alone on my iBook.  But, I think now I&apos;ve got things under control.</p>\n<p>It makes me appreciate the OS X environment so much more.  OS X is like driving a nice big, fully packed RV that handles like a station wagon down the hacking highway.  On the other hand, Windows is a Ford Festiva with a hole in the floorboards and a nagging suspicion that I forgot something back at the house.  Okay, so that was a bit contrived.  I just wanted to say <i>something</i> smarmy after all this grumbling.  :)</p>\n<p>Is this thing working for anyone yet?! </p>\n<p><b>Update:</b> In case you were wondering, this release should be usable via the original instructions <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000226.phtml\">back here</a>.  Which are, basically:</p><ol><li>Replace <code>templates/default</code> with this archive&apos;s contents.</li><li>Create a directory named <code>channels_meta</code> in your <code>data</code> directory.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">Share and Enjoy</a></li></ol><p></p>\n"

To change thresholds and other settings, you&apos;ll need to edit <code>default/index.html</code> directly for now.  I plan to add some fields to the settings page to manage these settings, eventually.  Also, you really want to have the <code>Digest::MD5</code> perl module installed, but I have included <code>Digest::Perl::MD5</code> in the template.  This means that things will work, but could be much faster.  As for the outlines, give thanks to Marc Barrot for his <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0104487/outlines/activeRenderer.html\">activeRenderer</a> package from which I borrowed nearly all of my outline code.  (The only <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/JavaScript?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">JavaScript</font></span> that&apos;s mine is the expand/collapse all logic.)<p></p>\n<p>Okay, I&apos;m off to lunch.  Let me know how you like it!</p>\n<p><b>Update:</b> It appears that some people are having problems with their <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> failing to find the custom modules I include with the template.  If you have trouble running the template, try copying the contents of <code>templates/default/lib</code> into the <code>lib/</code> directory of your <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> install.</p>\n<p><b>Update 2:</b> I think I&apos;ve fixed the showstoppers, as I will write <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000228.phtml#000228\">here in the future</a>.  So, I&apos;ve taken the liberty of going back in time and replacing the tarball here with the fixed one in case anyone has linked to this story.  Enjoy!</p>\n"

I think it&apos;s got to be web-based in some way.  It&apos;s about context switching, in a way I think.  If <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> channels had <i>all</i> of the content from the sites they describe, then maybe I could just twiddle around in the UI of the app...  but I always end up in the browser.  So...  Why ever leave it?</p>\n<p>So, back to Ampheta I go, I think.  I just need to start hanging out on IRC more again.  I keep doing vanishing acts.</p>\n"

The latest beta of Netbeans I'm using has a ton of Ctrl-Space completion now of classes, variables, etc.  But I'm happy to see Idea has a Mac OS X version, so I'll have to check it out.  I don't think Netbeans has any or much refactoring support, which is something I've been dreaming about while working in other languages.  :)\nThe only barrier might be price for me, since NetBeans is open/free and Idea is almost US$400.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083435\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://bwinton.latte.ca/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=441f5529f1db69e1a18cefb090e2690a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://bwinton.latte.ca/\">Blake Winton</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083435\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-07-19T16:24:37\">2002-07-19T16:24:37</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">The price is definately higher than Netbeans, although significantly lower than, say, JBuilder.  And they have an Early Access Program where you can test out betas for free.  I've been on it for a couple of years, and it's very rare that the betas are less than rock-solid.

It was originally developer by IBM and then released as open source. While it's written in Java, it doesn't use Swing. They use an API called SWT that they developed in house. SWT uses native libraries on the platforms it's been ported, too (right now includes Windows, Linux and a number of Unix variants, but not OSX, yet -- though OSX support is planned). I've found that the latest release is significantly zippier than any of the other java IDEs I've used and the features it supports are generally comparable or better than any of the others that I've tried. \nIt should be noted that Eclipse is also the basic technology underlying a number of major player products (IBM's WebSphere Studio and Rational's newest development tool, the name of which I can't recall at the moment).

The latest beta of Netbeans I'm using has a ton of Ctrl-Space completion now of classes, variables, etc.  But I'm happy to see Idea has a Mac OS X version, so I'll have to check it out.  I don't think Netbeans has any or much refactoring support, which is something I've been dreaming about while working in other languages.  :)\r\n\r\nThe only barrier might be price for me, since NetBeans is open/free and Idea is almost US$400.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083435\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://bwinton.latte.ca/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=441f5529f1db69e1a18cefb090e2690a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://bwinton.latte.ca/\">Blake Winton</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083435\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-07-19T16:24:37\">2002-07-19T16:24:37</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">The price is definately higher than Netbeans, although significantly lower than, say, JBuilder.  And they have an Early Access Program where you can test out betas for free.  I've been on it for a couple of years, and it's very rare that the betas are less than rock-solid.  Also, you get to influence the development of the product, which is always a good thing.  :)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083436\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://lockney.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e413973485c5536801d587baa1a55905&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://lockney.net\">Thomas Lockney</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083436\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-07-20T21:11:57\">2002-07-20T21:11:57</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">You might want to check out Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org), too. It was originally developer by IBM and then released as open source. While it's written in Java, it doesn't use Swing. They use an API called SWT that they developed in house. SWT uses native libraries on the platforms it's been ported, too (right now includes Windows, Linux and a number of Unix variants, but not OSX, yet -- though OSX support is planned). I've found that the latest release is significantly zippier than any of the other java IDEs I've used and the features it supports are generally comparable or better than any of the others that I've tried. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that Eclipse is also the basic technology underlying a number of major player products (IBM's WebSphere Studio and Rational's newest development tool, the name of which I can't recall at the moment). So you know the project isn't going anywhere anytime soon.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083437\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083437\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-07-21T02:39:37\">2002-07-21T02:39:37</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Yeah, I checked out Eclipse too, getting the vibe that it was a main competitor for NetBeans in the open source arena.

    "summary": "<p>So we&apos;ve managed to get the go ahead at work on what seems like it should be a nightmare project:  We&apos;re going to re-examine, re-design, and re-implement our in-house web app platform, the Toybox.  Not only that, but we&apos;re going to switch languages, from Perl to Java.  It&apos;s got me immensely excited, though this may be naive of me.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s been years since I was last knee deep in Java, and years that I&apos;ve spent up to my ears in Perl.  I&apos;d almost forgotten how much of Java I&apos;d reinvented to make my ideas work in Perl.  (This may not be so much an indictment of Perl as of the way I think.)  And the last time I worked seriously in Java, there were no IDEs yet, so starting to work with <a href=\"http://www.netbeans.org\">NetBeans</a> or even Project Builder under OS X for Java work is a dream.  I love using <a href=\"http://www.netbeans.org\">NetBeans</a> in particular, occasional hiccups aside.  Besides all the obvious integration of build, test, run, debug, etc, I love being able to highlight a keyword or class name and pop up the docs in an internal HTML browser.  I love that it makes suggested changes to classes when I change an interface they implement.</p>\n<p>Yeah, none of this is news to most of the world, but I&apos;ve been steadfastly sticking to shells and bare emacs or pico for my editing.  Maybe a web browser handy for docs.  I haven&apos;t worked very much with IDEs these past years, since a lot of them just got in my way.  Or at least, with hubris, I <i>thought</i> that they did.  Then again, I don&apos;t see very many equivalent tools for a language as free-form and multiple choice as Perl.</p>\n<p>And, though I miss <a href=\"http://www.cpan.org\">CPAN</a>, I&apos;m loving resources like the <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org\">Jakarta</a> project over at Apache.  Again, not news, but new to me.  I feel like a Rip Van Winkel-Java over here, since my last real work in Java was when the API was in 1.0 days, Servlets were this neat thing for the <a href=\"http://wwws.sun.com/software/jwebserver/index.html\">Java Web Server</a> (now at the end of its life), and the dot-com boom was just starting to stretch its wings.</p>\n<p>Now, I haven&apos;t been completely oblivious to Java over this time.  I&apos;ve poked at it, and played with a few things from time to time to at least stay somewhat current, and I&apos;ve tried to vaguely keep up with things a bit.  I have an overall sense of what does what and where to find what, but really getting it under my fingernails again now is a different experience.</p>\n"

    "summary": "<p>Cool, looks like <a href=\"http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/\">TrackBack</a> is working and starting to catch on this morning.  I caught a <a href=\"http://philringnalda.com/archives/002248.php\">nice compliment</a> about my mutant <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000187.phtml#000187\">outline skin for </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>.  Must get back around to the next iteration of that thing, add some polish and some new features.</p>\n<p>As for the MT upgrade from last night... looks like it nuked my post categories.  Grr.  That kind of blows chunks.  Might have to see what that&apos;s all about, since I sagely backed everything up first.  Another thing is that I&apos;d like to look more into this <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> feature and the concept of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> URLs and pings.  Namely:  It&apos;s a pain in the ass to cut &amp; paste the TB URL, and the bookmarklet hasn&apos;t worked for me yet.  </p>\n<p>I notice that there&apos;s some <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> embedded in my posts now, describing the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> link.  Unfortunately, I don&apos;t see where the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> explains that it is, in fact, about a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> link.  Though I haven&apos;t dug into the workings yet, I assume that this is how <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a>-enabled pages discover info about pages from which they&apos;ve been pinged.  </p>\n<p>What would be nice is if the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> also identifies itself as <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> info.  This way, I could hack <i>my</i> Movable Type to pluck URLs out of a post I&apos;m publishing, go take a visit to each URL and try to harvest the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a>, and then automatically discover the ping URL and ping it.  All I&apos;d need to do to activate the process is include a link to a page elsewhere that contains <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> hints on how/where to ping.</p>\n<p>Always looking to get more for less effort.  :)</p>\n"

If you don't have any previous experience of functional programming then XSLT will seem strange and difficult. It's just a matter of getting that experience and learning to think like a functional programmer.\nThe reason why you shouldn't use a scripting language such as Perl or Python is that XSLT handles XML really nicely, and scripting languages tend not to handle it so well. The reason you shouldn't use a template system is that none of them will be as powerful. I'm currently writing a blogging tool and (for obscure reasons) I'm restricting myself to Perl and using the HTML::Template module, so I have first-hand experience of both of these problems. I keep on wishing I could switch to XSLT.\nAs for using two-stage recursive algorithms, that's wizardry that you don't need to worry about right now. If you want the sum of a list of numbers, just use a simple recursive algorithm. Only think about alternative methods when you run into a problem with the simple method.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

    "html": "<p>Another thing to think about again: <a href=\"http://impressive.net/people/gerald/2000/12/spam-filtering.html\">Whitelist-based spam filtering</a>.  The spam is just getting heavier, raunchier, and less coherent these days.  I'd <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000129.shtml\">mused about it</a> awhile ago, along with looking at an <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/12/rubyrdf/util/foafwhite/intro.html\">application of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a></a> to share whitelists between trusted people.</p>\n<p>Then I see <a href=\"http://www.osopinion.com/perl/story/18180.html\">this article</a> up at <a href=\"http://www.osopinion.com\">osOpinion.com</a> on the subject (calling it \"reverse filtering\").  I hadn't thought of it before, but I could probably set up a quick auto-responder for unknown addresses, asking politely for a response requiring human thought, or a click by a person at a URL somewhere, to get them auto-added to my whitelist.  If the laziness/rudeness factor toward friends and acquaintences, current and potential, doesn't outweight the benefits, this might be a very good solution.  I wouldn't throw mail away outright, but it would be put in a rotating bin that I might look at every day or so, and wipe every week or so.</p>\n<p>That osOpinion.com article wraps up with a little bit of a carrot / challenge to for a business plan around a whitelist / reverse-filtering scheme for mail.  I wonder how much people <i>would</i> pay for it, and whether people would be put off by an auto-response asking for proof of humanity?

First thing:  I think this is an unfortunately limited definition.  It specifies the particular interface by which <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Radio</a> presents information.  And, as a comment on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000187.phtml\">one of my first experments</a> in tweaking <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\">AmphetaDesk</a>'s interface attests (no author link):<blockquote><i>I've been wanting to use an aggregator since I first heard of them (RU7) but have always felt that because poor information architecture/presentation they tended to make tracking a large number of sites harder rather than easier.</i></blockquote>I didn't expect my first attempt to be called \"Brilliant! Lovely! Perfect!\", but I did think that I was on to something.  Simply displaying the new bits in reverse-chronological order is too limiting - it's only one attempted solution at the problem of aggregation.  My solution isn't an ultimate one either.  </p>\n<p>Aggregators desperately need to grow toward more flexibility and scan-ability.  A few things I'd really like to see addressed:<ul><li>De-emphasis of seen &amp; older items from sites, but not complete hiding.  Context between entries on weblogs is important.</li><li>Optional grouping of items from the same or similar weblogs.  Context between entries, and between blogs is important.</li><li>Emphasis of newer items, tracking the time line and signalling attention to changes.  Radio does this, but mostly to the exclusion of other concerns.</li><li>Preventing sites with few updates from getting lost in a wash of frequently updating sites.  Some of the best sites may update once every few days with something worth reading, but simple reverse-chronological order pushes the quiet sites out in the maelstrom.</li></ul>There's more I've been musing about, but I can't remember more at the moment.  I've tried to do a few of these things with my tweak to Ampheta: varied (hopefully not obtrusive) font size &amp; weight, dependant on item age; maintaining grouping and order of items within <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds; showing enough information for a visual scan, hiding further details, but making details available within a click or two (I love outlines).  I wanted to hit the page-down button less, but it's more than that.  I want my eyes to move slow on the first few items of a channel, and then slide down off the rest, unless I intentionally want to be caught.</p>\n<p>So, while Dave's working on defining the News Aggregator, I think it's a good time to redefine it a bit while he's at it.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=oooaia\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090342\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://zymm.com/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f659bb22a2e62ccd2cd82c4b52f09ca9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://zymm.com/raster/\">Pete</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090342\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-06-11T17:28:37\">2002-06-11T17:28:37</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I agree that Dave's definition of a news aggregator  is a bit narrow, but that's the view from where Dave sits. \nI think we may be at version 0.99 when it comes to news aggregators, they currently work in the most basic form, but can do so much more. \nCategories, keyword filtering, ranking based on what you (and others) think of a source... \nWe've got a long way to go, and I must admit, I'm excited by the possibilities.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090344\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b53911af792174097e8acb282414b44c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Bill Kearney</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090344\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-06-12T13:58:15\">2002-06-12T13:58:15</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Indeed when I see a vendor, and not just the one in question, attempting to 'define' a concept I start thinking \"when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\"  Attempting to pigeon-hole the aggregator concept into strictly chronological format when that's all a product provides is disingenous at best.  \nIt's becoming apparent to more and more folks that aggregating and filtering items is a really great idea.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090345\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.perceive.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fa97eb743d4905554ef8f6a41fb2492e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.perceive.net\">Eric</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090345\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-06-12T16:10:19\">2002-06-12T16:10:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">the presentation of information is the most important part of the aggregator.  Some ideas:\n1. desktop aggregators should support keyword lists (much like Meerkat), so that the aggregator can get an idea of what is of interest to you.  Articles with these keywords could be highlighted in some fashion.\n2. the \"age\" of the item should not necessarily determine its visibility (be it a 0/1 or something in between).  It should only influence.  Other factors could include user interaction with the article (has the articlebeen viewed?  has the user told the aggregator they no longer want to see the article, etc).\n3. Articles should not necessarily be groups by channel.  This obstacle might be the most complex to solve. A more logical order of grouping needs to be found.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090346\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100364/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=132c3a4bf4f5de9b8beea0c21a0ba088&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100364/\">Eric Maynard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090346\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-06-19T10:30:52\">2002-06-19T10:30:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Ok, granted it's not a desktop application, but NewsIsFree.com does offer much of the functionality that is being discussed here relative to aggregators.\nIn fact, in my opinion, the only feature of existing desktop aggregators missing from NewsIsFree is the ability to add your own feeds.\nKeyword searching exists, but it's not automated as such.

Some ideas:\r\n\r\n1. desktop aggregators should support keyword lists (much like Meerkat), so that the aggregator can get an idea of what is of interest to you.  Articles with these keywords could be highlighted in some fashion.\r\n\r\n2. the \"age\" of the item should not necessarily determine its visibility (be it a 0/1 or something in between).  It should only influence.  Other factors could include user interaction with the article (has the articlebeen viewed?  has the user told the aggregator they no longer want to see the article, etc).\r\n\r\n3. Articles should not necessarily be groups by channel.  This obstacle might be the most complex to solve. A more logical order of grouping needs to be found.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090346\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100364/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=132c3a4bf4f5de9b8beea0c21a0ba088&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100364/\">Eric Maynard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090346\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-06-19T10:30:52\">2002-06-19T10:30:52</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Ok, granted it's not a desktop application, but NewsIsFree.com does offer much of the functionality that is being discussed here relative to aggregators.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in my opinion, the only feature of existing desktop aggregators missing from NewsIsFree is the ability to add your own feeds.\r\n\r\nKeyword searching exists, but it's not automated as such.

    "summary": "<p>Reading Dave&apos;s in-progress <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com/whatIsANewsAggregator\">What is a News Aggregator?</a>:</p><blockquote><i> A news aggregator is a piece of software that periodically reads a set of news sources, in one of several XML-based formats, finds the new bits, and displays them in reverse-chronological order on a single page.</i></blockquote>..and the rest leads from there.  First thing:  I think this is an unfortunately limited definition.  It specifies the particular interface by which <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Radio</a> presents information.  And, as a comment on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000187.phtml\">one of my first experments</a> in tweaking <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\">AmphetaDesk</a>&apos;s interface attests (no author link):<blockquote><i>I&apos;ve been wanting to use an aggregator since I first heard of them (RU7) but have always felt that because poor information architecture/presentation they tended to make tracking a large number of sites harder rather than easier.</i></blockquote>I didn&apos;t expect my first attempt to be called &quot;Brilliant! Lovely! Perfect!&quot;, but I did think that I was on to something.  Simply displaying the new bits in reverse-chronological order is too limiting - it&apos;s only one attempted solution at the problem of aggregation.  My solution isn&apos;t an ultimate one either.  <p></p>\n<p>Aggregators desperately need to grow toward more flexibility and scan-ability.  A few things I&apos;d really like to see addressed:</p><ul><li>De-emphasis of seen &amp; older items from sites, but not complete hiding.  Context between entries on weblogs is important.</li><li>Optional grouping of items from the same or similar weblogs.  Context between entries, and between blogs is important.</li><li>Emphasis of newer items, tracking the time line and signalling attention to changes.  Radio does this, but mostly to the exclusion of other concerns.</li><li>Preventing sites with few updates from getting lost in a wash of frequently updating sites.  Some of the best sites may update once every few days with something worth reading, but simple reverse-chronological order pushes the quiet sites out in the maelstrom.</li></ul>There&apos;s more I&apos;ve been musing about, but I can&apos;t remember more at the moment.  I&apos;ve tried to do a few of these things with my tweak to Ampheta: varied (hopefully not obtrusive) font size &amp; weight, dependant on item age; maintaining grouping and order of items within <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds; showing enough information for a visual scan, hiding further details, but making details available within a click or two (I love outlines).  I wanted to hit the page-down button less, but it&apos;s more than that.  I want my eyes to move slow on the first few items of a channel, and then slide down off the rest, unless I intentionally want to be caught.<p></p>\n<p>So, while Dave&apos;s working on defining the News Aggregator, I think it&apos;s a good time to redefine it a bit while he&apos;s at it.</p>\n"

    "summary": "<p>Okay, starting to poke at my referrer scripts again and produced two new things:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/recent_referers_rss.php\">Recent Referrers in </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> (<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/recent_referers_rss_php.txt\">src</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/rss_readers.phtml\">RSS Feed Readers</a> (<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/rss_readers_phtml.txt\">src</a>).  I simplified my database a bit, collapsing multiple rows into single rows with a hit count column.  Also squashed a few stupid bugs that had cropped up in the Great Site Move a month or so ago.  Realized that the counts were insanely wrong, sometimes showing a count as high as 15 for a post that might have only 3 back links.</p>\n<p>Likely the referers in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> will be of interest only to me as I obsessively watch my site (though I <i>do</i> subscribe to <a href=\"http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/xml.html\">Disenchanted&apos;s Recent Inbound</a>, since it gives me a stream of new sites to visit).  But, the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed readers list is a few steps closer to the friends-of list I want to move from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a> out into the blogosphere proper.  </p>\n<p>One of the next things I want to do is start cobbling a fairly modular &amp; general URL investigator - that is, give it a url, and have it try to track down title, author, contents page, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed, location, and any other metadata that comes up.  I could then use this to flesh out all the links everywhere, from backlinks to the friends-of list.  Basically what many other people have been doing for different semantic aspects, but all rolled into one agent.</p>\n<p>Along with that, I want to implement some manual annotation of sites known by my site.  Thinking that, between per-post backlinks and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> reader links, I could eventually build a decent database of metadata here.  With that, all kinds of nifty things could happen...</p>\n<p>Okay, time for bed.  Starting to ramble, or at least be tempted to do so.</p>\n"

    "summary": "<p>Okay, so now we&apos;ve got a bit further toward our News Aggregators leaving vapor trails.  Thanks, <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk\">Morbus</a>.  Thanks, <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Dave</a>.  There&apos;s still some more work that needs to be done, though.  In specific, how do I get to <i>you</i> via your trail?  Or, to be even more specific- how to my <i>agents</i> get to you?</p>\n<p>Sure, I can look in my referers now, and filter on my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/newslog.xml\">RSS feed</a> to see a footprints.  And for Radio users, I can pluck out the userWeblog=... param added to Radio aggregator referers.  For others, like the page <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml\">I set up</a>, or <a href=\"http://ipwebdev.com/radio/ImReadingYourRSSFeed.php\">Adam set up</a>, or <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001018/xml.aggregator.html\">Jeff set up</a>, I can try to assume that the URL leads... somewhere.</p>\n<p>But, in thinking about this further, none of this <i>actually</i> fulfills <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000124.phtml\">my wish</a>.  I originally wanted to see these referers lead directly to a reader&apos;s blog.  They don&apos;t.  But, that&apos;s fine: I kind of like the idea of the thank you / hello / I&apos;m reading your page.  However, I still want to find you.</p>\n<p>Or, rather, as I alluded to in the first paragraph, I want my <i>agents</i> to find you.  And my agents are only semi-intelligent.  So how about we set a standard by which bots can autodiscover your weblog, home page, whatever:</p><ol><li>If you don&apos;t care to put up a special page to point to as your referer when aggregating news, then point a URL somewhere, anywhere, but include a URL to your weblog in a query parameter named &quot;userWeblog&quot;.  This covers an already de facto standard set by Radio.</li><li>If you <i>do</i> care to set up an acknowledgement page for your readers, include a LINK tag in the page&apos;s HEAD pointing to the home page of your site as the table of contents: <code><link href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\" rel=\"contents\"></code></li></ol>In this way, rock bangers cobbling together their own blog spiders can tell them where to go and for what to look.  Get this meme spread, and we&apos;ll be seeing <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/06/02.html#social_networks_by_referrer\">more community crawling bots</a> very soon now.<p></p>\n<p>In fact, I like this LINK tag now.  I think it should be put on <i>all</i> of your weblog pages.  Especially as I start thinking more about revisiting referers: A LINK back to your weblog home as the table of contents would allow me to maybe enrich my backlinks, especially knowing where your site root is.  (If my eyes do not deceive, it looks like backlinks on <a href=\"http://www.diveintomark.org/\">Mark Pilgrim&apos;s blog</a> do some <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> autodiscovery right now.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, let me know what you think.</p>\n"

Anyone want to jump on this bandwagon and help push it as fast as the recent <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> autodetection meme? :)</p>\n<p>Catching up, I see that <a href=\"http://ipwebdev.com/radio/2002/06/02.php#a137\">Adam wrote</a> about what <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001018/2002/05/30.html#a1274\">Jeff Cheney wrote</a> about changing <code>aggregatorData.prefs.appSignatureUrl</code> in Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> to point to a <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001018/xml.aggregator.html\">custom page</a>.  Hey, <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Radio crew</a>, how about making this a default, eh?  Point that signature at my blog, or a canned <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001018/xml.aggregator.html\">custom page</a>?  Yay!</p>\n"

Just as she reminded me how pathetic it is to say, &quot;High school was the best time of my life,&quot; treating my college days as my Golden Age is just as pathetic.</p>\n<p>The thing I&apos;ve not been facing is exactly what grlathena writes: &quot;The future is very do-it-yourself.&quot;</p>\n</i><p><i>The world didn&apos;t run out of wonder or friends or opportunities for fulfillment after I graduated, it just got a bit more miserly in just tossing them at me. See, life in school is still very scripted. There are many choices made in advance for you, based on only a handful from you. Out here in the &quot;real world&quot;, things are much less scripted, and many fewer things are just given. It&apos;s very do-it-yourself.</i></p></blockquote>I know all my fellow rock bangers are human beings, too.  I just hesitate to waste their time with too much off the topic of rock banging and more on the topic of human beings.  Should I overlap more?  You tell me.<p></p>\n"

Last month I completed my move to Movable Type from LiveJournal. I really get tired of clicking around to see who all has updated their weblogs.. then go log in to LiveJournal to read my old friends page (there a lot of entries that are marked as friends-only). \nA big weblog directory would be very nice. Something for people to register with and connect with other people instead of just randomly clicking around (like how I found you!). You could then find people based on their interest of coffee, Radiohead, and Jabber or maybe where they live. If you liked the person's content, you'd just go back to their profile and click \"add to my friends page\" .. then the database would do all the same things that LiveJournal does. hmmm... i like this idea.....</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

Something for people to register with and connect with other people instead of just randomly clicking around (like how I found you!). You could then find people based on their interest of coffee, Radiohead, and Jabber or maybe where they live. If you liked the person's content, you'd just go back to their profile and click \"add to my friends page\" .. then the database would do all the same things that LiveJournal does. hmmm... i like this idea.....</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

I could offer it for a small fee, but then the service would probably never see widespread use.

Starting to work my mad Google skillz to find this, but having a hard time coming up with search terms that give me good results.  See, Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> demands too much CPU from any of the machines I currently own.  The desktop where I want to park it also serves as my PVR, and when it starts up to record a show, Radio keeps stealing CPU from the video encoding, and I end up with choppy and sometimes dead video.  I even tried screwing with priorities, and that only seems to help moderately.</p>\n<p>So, I want to start up Radio, let it churn free.  Then just before a show comes on, I want to quit Radio.  I was doing this manually via a VNC connection from work, but that&apos;s just stupid.  The other alternatives I&apos;ve tried are running it under Wine on my Debian Linux box, which doesn&apos;t <i>quite</i> seem to work happily, or to run Radio again on my OS X iBook, which seems to crush the poor thing.</p>\n<p>I suppose my desktop PC is due for an upgrade, containing only a 600MHz Athlon (though 512MB of RAM), but I&apos;ve been waiting on that.

You're excused for chuckling, or saying \"Why Lisp?\" Although the language can be inefficient if used without extreme caution, it has a reputation for compactness. One line of Lisp can replace 20 lines of C. ITA's programmers, who learned the language inside and out while at MIT, note that LISP is highly effective if you ditch the prefabricated data structures. \"We're something of a poster child for LISP these days,\" says Wertheimer. \"Lisp vendors love us.\"</i></blockquote>Funny, if you did an s/Lisp/Perl/g and an s/LISP/Perl/g on that text, you'd almost have a quote from me.  I've also heard Perl often compared to LISP, amongst the upper ranks of Perl wizards.  Oldest language-- hmm, no, but it's been around the block.  Inefficient without caution-- check, hand-holding is at a minimum.  Compactness-- check, many bash it for obfucation facilitation.  Effective after ditching prefab structs-- check, if you enjoy slinging hashes all over, like I have until recently.  And so far, we're a poster child for Perl here.</p>\n<p>What is it that I have in Perl?  Well, I've named it the Toybox.  It's a web application platform.  We do everything with it.  Reusable software components composed into applications with a web-based construction tool.  The components contain machine and human readable descriptions on properties and methods, to enable inspection by tool and documentation generation.  Also, the components and the framework are designed to provide predefined collaboration patterns so that one component can supplement or modify the behavior of another without that other component needing to be modified or altered.  I've also just recently added a persistent object layer for all those pesky little parameterizing trinkets we started needed to throw around.  (I really wish I could Open Source this thing. :) )</p>\n<p>So there's a continual grumble here to switch to Java, sometimes from me, and sometimes from another developer or two.  In some ways, a switch and reimplmentation is a no-brainer, considering tool support and labor pool.  But, is this overhyped?  Wherever I've gone, I've just picked up whatever was used there.  My basic computer science background lets me switch technologies pretty easily.  Is this rare?</p>\n<p>But as for the languages themselves... From the trenches, doing object-oriented stuff in perl is painful and dirty.  In a lot of other ways, it feels nice because you can jump out of the OO mindset and do some naughty things when you think you need to.  And if you're careful.

Because the \"standard\" just happens to be the buzzwordy things that a number of companies sunk money into and work hard to justify.</p>\n<p>But, hell, someone had to have started creating something alien and new to come up with what's \"standard\" today.  I seem to see stories from time to time about companies whose \"secret weapon\" is just such a \"non-standard technology\".

    "summary": "<p>Just saw <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0106046/2002/05/24.html#a48\">Gordon Weakliem mention</a>, via <a href=\"http://www.rolandtanglao.com/2002/05/21.html#a1965\">Roland Tanglao&apos;s Weblog</a>, this article over at New Architect: <a href=\"http://www.newarchitectmag.com/documents/s=2286/new1015626014044/\">Orbitz Reaches New Heights</a>.  This snags my eye for two reasons: 1) Orbitz is a client of my employer - we do a ton of web promotions for them; and 2) LISP is one of those things I keep meaning to get back into, kinda like I keep meaning to read things from that gigantic Shakespeare collection I asked for and recieved for Christmas from me mum.</p>\n<p>The quote that Ronald pulls out from the article is:</p><blockquote><i>The high-level algorithms are almost entirely in Lisp, one of the oldest programming languages. You&apos;re excused for chuckling, or saying &quot;Why Lisp?&quot; Although the language can be inefficient if used without extreme caution, it has a reputation for compactness. One line of Lisp can replace 20 lines of C. ITA&apos;s programmers, who learned the language inside and out while at MIT, note that LISP is highly effective if you ditch the prefabricated data structures. &quot;We&apos;re something of a poster child for LISP these days,&quot; says Wertheimer. &quot;Lisp vendors love us.&quot;</i></blockquote>Funny, if you did an s/Lisp/Perl/g and an s/LISP/Perl/g on that text, you&apos;d almost have a quote from me.  I&apos;ve also heard Perl often compared to LISP, amongst the upper ranks of Perl wizards.  Oldest language-- hmm, no, but it&apos;s been around the block.  Inefficient without caution-- check, hand-holding is at a minimum.  Compactness-- check, many bash it for obfucation facilitation.  Effective after ditching prefab structs-- check, if you enjoy slinging hashes all over, like I have until recently.  And so far, we&apos;re a poster child for Perl here.<p></p>\n<p>What is it that I have in Perl?  Well, I&apos;ve named it the Toybox.  It&apos;s a web application platform.  We do everything with it.  Reusable software components composed into applications with a web-based construction tool.  The components contain machine and human readable descriptions on properties and methods, to enable inspection by tool and documentation generation.  Also, the components and the framework are designed to provide predefined collaboration patterns so that one component can supplement or modify the behavior of another without that other component needing to be modified or altered.  I&apos;ve also just recently added a persistent object layer for all those pesky little parameterizing trinkets we started needed to throw around.  (I really wish I could Open Source this thing. :) )</p>\n<p>So there&apos;s a continual grumble here to switch to Java, sometimes from me, and sometimes from another developer or two.  In some ways, a switch and reimplmentation is a no-brainer, considering tool support and labor pool.  But, is this overhyped?  Wherever I&apos;ve gone, I&apos;ve just picked up whatever was used there.  My basic computer science background lets me switch technologies pretty easily.  Is this rare?</p>\n<p>But as for the languages themselves... From the trenches, doing object-oriented stuff in perl is painful and dirty.  In a lot of other ways, it feels nice because you can jump out of the OO mindset and do some naughty things when you think you need to.  And if you&apos;re careful.  But when you do, you don&apos;t get any help from the language, which I think is one of the major selling points of Java.</p>\n<p>And then occasionally, a client demands to know the specifics of our platform.  Such as, what vendor&apos;s app server are we using?  What database server?  And when we say Perl and a platform almost completely developed in-house, noses crinkle and doubts arise.  But they rarely have a complaint about the end result and the speed at which we execute it.</p>\n<p>I guess what I&apos;m getting at is this:  Having a hard time untangling politics, job market, and the right tool choice.  LISP seems to have done alright by Orbitz, and Perl&apos;s done alright by us.  So far, that is.  I always vaguely worry about the &quot;non-standard technology&quot; I use here, though.  Is that such a valid worry, or am I just swallowing vendors&apos; marketing pills like our clients?  Because the &quot;standard&quot; just happens to be the buzzwordy things that a number of companies sunk money into and work hard to justify.</p>\n<p>But, hell, someone had to have started creating something alien and new to come up with what&apos;s &quot;standard&quot; today.  I seem to see stories from time to time about companies whose &quot;secret weapon&quot; is just such a &quot;non-standard technology&quot;.  They avoid many of the pitfalls that the herd faces by taking their own path, but trade them for new ones.  There&apos;s risk in that, but then again there&apos;s risk in everything with a potential for gain.</p>\n<p>Then again, there&apos;s the argument against wheel reinvention.  I seem to like reinventing wheels sometimes for the hell of it, simply because I want to know how wheels work.  Sometimes I even feel arrogant enough to assert that I can make a better wheel.  But there is a point where just buying the thing and moving on is the smart option.</p>\n<p>Oh well...  I&apos;ve come to no conclusion.  But I&apos;m still writing Perl code in my xemacs window today, and about to get back to it when I hit the &quot;Post&quot; button.  And things seem pretty good here-- I mean this company managed to claw through the wreckage of the dot-com collapse and still edge toward a profit.  We lost more clients due to their bankruptcy than through customer dissatisfaction. </p>\n<p>I suppose I can at least say my choice of Perl, if not a secret weapon, didn&apos;t break the bank.  :)</p>\n"

So much duplication of what&apos;s already there.  Of course, there are the plusses of cross-platform goodness, integrated environment goodness, and things that just feel generally slick about it.  Eh, but I don&apos;t have to feel strange about that anymore, since I moved Radio to my Windows box.  Now Radio fights with my PVR program for CPU.  Grr.</p>\n<p>I&apos;ve been thinking about this lately, too: Cocoa GUI talking via XML-RPC or SOAP to a web app locally hosted.  It&apos;s been mused about before, though I forget where.  I seem to remember that <a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com\">Dave</a> had mentioned a company working on something like this.  Could be interesting.</p>\n<p>Seems to me that the potential and power of OS X for these sorts of apps (ie. desktop websites, networked info filters, etc...) has barely been tapped yet.</p>\n<p>Unix on the desktop.  Really.  Who woulda thunk it?</p>\n"

Now I feel cloistered in over here at my company and I don't know if my employer necessarily sees a value in me attending things like this.  Marketing and sales make heroic efforts to streak around from coast to coast-- man, I don't envy them-- but I always stay here.

In the script, test for browser resolution, make the HEIGHT value for the IFRAME correspond to the resolution.  For ex:  at 800x600, HEIGHT might equal 320, at 1024x768, HEIGHT might equal 400 and so on.  In your script, you can test for res via: resHeight=(screen.height).

I am in the process of redoing my entire site this way.  All content will be delivered via IFRAMEs to IE & NS6 users; via JS for NS4x users.\nIf you do it right, your IFRAME pages use the same content scripts.  The real saving grace is that you keep one CSS in your IFRAME pages directory for IE users and another for NS user in you primary directory.\nIn fact, CSS was the main reason I did this because, as you probably know, NS and IE just don't play that well together using the same CSS.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086196\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.dablade.nl\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9e3ba5c8dfe4b6225f1c21fe845094e0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.dablade.nl\">Maarten</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086196\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-11-10T04:06:47\">2002-11-10T04:06:47</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Actually i have had a lot of trouble properly placing an IFRAME.

But, having been reading the <a href=\"http://www.cluetrain.com\">Cluetrain Manifesto</a> and following smart blogs, I start to think this is a Good Thing.\n</li>\n<br><br>\n<li>I see that <a href=\"http://www.ecyrd.com/JSPWiki/Wiki.jsp?page=JanneJalkanen\">JanneJalkanen </a> and crew are musing out <a href=\"http://www.ecyrd.com/JSPWiki/Wiki.jsp?page=WikiRPCInterface2\">an update to the XML-RPC wiki interface</a>.  Having worked on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\">my own implementations</a> of this interface, I need to keep an eye on this, even if I can&apos;t quite be as active as I like.</li>\n<br><br>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://open-content.net/specs/draft-jchapweske-caw-03.html\">HTTP Extensions for a Content-Addressable Web</a> seems hot as hell, especially for the future decentrallized publishing world I&apos;m dreaming of.\n</li>\n<br><br>\n<li>\nI&apos;m updating my home linux box, Memoria, with <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/\">Debian</a>, defecting from <a href=\"http://linux-mandrake.com\">Mandrake Linux</a>.  Wish me luck.  Oh, and the HD in the machine has a few cranky parts from having been dropped.

I miss the BBS days.  I may bemoan the loss of local community gateways onto the &apos;net someday soon.  I&apos;m using <a href=\"http://www.synchro.net/\">Synchronet</a> on a poor overworked Pentium 70Mhz PC running Win98, on which I also inflicted Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> for the time being.  No one really calls on my BBS.  I&apos;ve been thinking of hosting <a href=\"ftp://vert.synchro.net/Synchronet/sbbsunix.txt\">the UNIX version</a> on Memoria.\n</li>\n<br><br>\n<li>\nThinking of trying out Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> on Memoria under Wine.  I&apos;ve <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$7581\">seen mutterings</a> which claim that this is possible.  Anyone?\n</li>\n<br><br>\n<li>\nI want to wax pretentious with a few musings on <a href=\"http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Singularity/\">the Singularity</a>, birth control, anti-biotics, glasses, and self-modifying code.

I'll preface my prasie by saying I'm a contributing developer to this open source project, so I have a minor stake in it.\nIt does support the blogger API, and well.  It also supports generic XML-RPC and templating, meaning you could pretty painlessly make it support other APIs (it's just adding a template file).\nIt's also modular, pluggable, and extensible.  Modules already exist for it in terms of project management and collaberation.  To support this it has a granular and adaptable security architecture.\nThe laziness threshold is insane.  If you wanted to you could have the site up with a 'tar xzvf', a mysqladmin command, and clicking through the install.php script.  I reviewed a wide scope of content management systems, and even among non-free options, PostNuke is best of breed.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088462\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2fa32f85624a61ed0ad6980a4b39a72e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Dameron Midgette</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088462\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-05-10T23:25:06\">2002-05-10T23:25:06</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Nice idea! It makes me think of BlogFace, which is mentioned here and here. Using Zope's cataloging mechanism, the blog is just a dynamic query of a part of the site (a wiki, perhaps? ;), date-organized.

I'm pretty sure its supports the BloggerAPI, but could probably be extened to support the metablogAPI (or whatever its called) that has support for multiple categories so i would work with mail in systems or IM in systems.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088458\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://datavortex.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2fb8036d2a77e870bdbb871949b6dd36&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://datavortex.net/\">Data Vortex</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088458\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-05-10T21:10:57\">2002-05-10T21:10:57</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">PostNuke is great, I have it deployed for something resemlbing your purposes here in my department in Earthlink.  I'll preface my prasie by saying I'm a contributing developer to this open source project, so I have a minor stake in it.\r\n\r\nIt does support the blogger API, and well.  It also supports generic XML-RPC and templating, meaning you could pretty painlessly make it support other APIs (it's just adding a template file).\r\n\r\nIt's also modular, pluggable, and extensible.  Modules already exist for it in terms of project management and collaberation.  To support this it has a granular and adaptable security architecture.\r\n\r\nThe laziness threshold is insane.  If you wanted to you could have the site up with a 'tar xzvf', a mysqladmin command, and clicking through the install.php script.  I reviewed a wide scope of content management systems, and even among non-free options, PostNuke is best of breed.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088462\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2fa32f85624a61ed0ad6980a4b39a72e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Dameron Midgette</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088462\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-05-10T23:25:06\">2002-05-10T23:25:06</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Nice idea!

    "summary": "<p>\nSpeaking of software I want to get deployed at work (ie. time tracking), another thing I want to take the plunge with is k-logging.  Basically, I want some software to give every person here an internal blog or journal.  Immediately, I want this to capture internal narrative.  A future subversive idea I have for it is to eventually pipe some of these internal entries out to our public company website.  (Yes, I&apos;m reading The Cluetrain Manifesto again.)\n</p>\n<p>\nI&apos;ve gotten almost everyone here on the wiki bandwagon, and we&apos;re using it regularly as a knowledge capture and collaboration tool.  So, they&apos;re used to me throwing odd new tech at them.  Unfortunately, the wiki isn&apos;t precisely suitable to what I want for the k-logs.  These are my requirements so far:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Must be dead simple to use in all aspects, so that it sits far below the laziness threshold it takes to record an idea or narrative as it occurs.</li>\n<li>Rich set of categories and metadata by which an entry can be tagged.  (ie. On what project were you working?  On what project task?  With what products?  How much time did you spend?)</li>\n<li>Arbitrary views on weblog entries, querying on category and metadata, maybe even on full-text search.  I want to be able to weave together, on the fly, the narrative of any person, project, product, or any other topic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nI&apos;m looking, hopefully, for something free.  At the moment, I&apos;d have a hard time campaigning for the purchase of a fleet of Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> subscriptions for all of us, unfortunately.  Someday, perhaps.  (I could just imagine the insane possibilities of a Radio on every employee&apos;s desktop.)  But, is there anything out there like this now?  It&apos;s simple enough that I could probably roll my own in a weekend or less, but it&apos;d be nice to jump on the bandwagon of an established k-log tool.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlso really looking at more ways to lower the laziness threshold.  We just converted the entire company over to using Jabber as our official instant messaging platform, so I thought it&apos;d be pretty keen to have the k-log system establish a presence to receive IM&apos;ed journal entries.  Along the lines of the wiki adoption, I&apos;d probably have to get everyone to embed a certain style of keywords or some other convention to get the k-log system to pick up categories.\n</p>\n<p>\nOr, to make it even lazier, could I get the k-log system to automatically discover categories by the mention of keywords?  Hmm, this could be fun.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnyone out there working at a k-logged company?\n</p>\n"

    "html": "<p>I meant to post a quick thank you to <a href=\"http://udell.roninhouse.com/\">Jon Udell</a> for the link in his recent O'Reilly Network article, <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/webservices/2002/05/03/udell.html\">Blogspace Under the Microscope</a>.  But beyond the fact that he mentions me, I really like the biological metaphor for blogspace he explores there.  </p>\n<p>In the short time I've had this blog out here, I've tossed in a few handfuls of small hacks that have incrementally connected it to others and made discovery of some connections automatic.  What I'm doing is mostly inspired by what I see other bloggers doing.  Something about all this feels very different from what's happened on the web thus far.  I don't have, nor likely will ever have, one of the more popular blogs on the block-- but for the short time I've had it, this thing has gotten more connected than anything else I've ever done on the web.  It's certainly by no genius of my own that this has happened.

The other two are 1) on <a href=\"http://deus-x.livejournal.com\">LiveJournal</a> and 2) <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/deus_x/radio\">managed by Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a></a>.</p>\n<p>My Radio blog has been pretty dormant of late, since I never quite got completely pulled into it or migrated my LJ or MT blog to it.  Instead, LJ seems not itchy enough to abandon (and I have friends there), and MT seems comfy enough for now.  So, Radio remains a place of bunsen burners and exploding beakers for me for now.  (This is not a complaint, this is a cause for gleeful and evil rubbing of hands together.)</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"http://deus-x.livejournal.com\">LiveJournal</a>, however, was my first successful blog.  And by successful, I mean that I managed to keep writing there, usually trying to babble more at length than just copying a few headlines.  My writing there is pretty random, by intention.  I'd originally started it to supplement my daily writing in my paper journal, as some other outlet for words to keep me writing and maintain my ability to string more than two words together coherently.  </p>\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a>, I'm more likely to rant about things like religion and touchy issues.  I'm also more likely to talk about <a href=\"http://missadroit.livejournal.com\">my girlfriend</a> and other events in life more interesting to my closer circle of friends.</p>\n<p>I consider 0xDECAFBAD to be my nerd-blog, or my \"professional\" blog.  It's where I'm more likely to ramble about things in my life as a geekish craftsperson.  I could draw a Venn diagram, but suffice it to say that I think there are different, but overlapping, audiences for my high-nerdity versus my more personal ramblings.</p>\n<p>Does anyone else do this?  I'm sure I'm not alone in cordoning my blog faces off from each other.  But should I feel the need to separate things like this?  Although I can't find a link to it, I seem to remember <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/\">Shelley Powers</a> writing about tearing down her cordons between her nerd-core and normal-person blog sides.  Of course, I try to thin the barriers at least by displaying my <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/customview.cgi?user=deus_x&amp;styleid=32679\">LiveJournal <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed</a> over on the side as a \"sibling\" blog.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, its a strange form of self-classification.  On the other, though, it seems to work for me.  Visit <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">0xDECAFBAD</a> to see my vaguely professional high-nerdity.  But if you want to get closer to me as a human being, come visit my <a href=\"http://deus-x.livejournal.com\">LiveJournal</a> and see me and my place in the community there.  If you <i>really</i> want to know me... well, <a href=\"mailto:deus_x@pobox.com\">email me</a> or maybe IM me.  And maybe, just maybe, if you happen to be in town, let's head down to the pub.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=oooaci\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085546\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://markpasc.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2fc977e82d9f8395a0f49e6f4958bc84&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://markpasc.org\">Mark</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085546\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-05-07T16:18:51\">2002-05-07T16:18:51</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I have my LiveJournal and my Radio blog, and they're separate kind of like yours (personal/professional), but everything I blog out of Radio's News Aggregator goes into the Radio blog too.

If you have cable this isn't an issue.\r\n3.

    "summary": "<p>Okay, so it&apos;s a given that I&apos;m not giving up my PVR soon.  So, which ones work best?  And why?</p>\n<p>So far, all of mine have been homebrew, thanks mostly to <a href=\"http://www.ati.com\">ATI</a> video cap / tuner cards.  I&apos;ve never owned a <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/TiVO?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">TiVO</font></span>, although I&apos;ve lusted over them.  But my current setup seems serviceable.  I managed to record the entire run of the third season of Buffy in rerun onto VCDs with the ATI Multimedia Center software.  (No cracks on the Buffster.  If you don&apos;t like it, try s/Buffy/Babylon 5/ or maybe s/Buffy/Nova/ in your head.)</p>\n<p>Now, I&apos;m looking to replace the Windows this runs on with a Linux install.  I already record radio shows under Linux with a PCI radio tuner, and under OS X sometimes with a USB FM tuner.  So now I see this <a href=\"http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/VCR-HOWTO.html\">VCR HOWTO</a> which claims:</p><blockquote><i> This is a guide to setting up your GNU/Linux workstation as a digital VCR using the video4linux driver and a supported tuner card. A section has been added for creating VCD&apos;s that can be played in any DVD/VCD player as well.</i></blockquote>Sounds precisely like what I&apos;m doing right now.  And I <i>think</i> that my ATI All-in-Wonder Radeon card can be supported under Linux.  If not, I have a backup <a href=\"http://www.zoltrix-int.com/products/video/8MMZXGENIE.htm\">BT848-based Zoltrix TV tuner</a> that works for sure, but that one only seems to have mono audio, unfortunately.<p></p>\n<p>Has anyone put together a working Linux setup as described in the HOWTO?  If so, how do you like it?</p>\n<p>On the other hand...  Should I still think of getting a <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/TiVo?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">TiVo</font></span>?  What&apos;s so special about it, other than dead simple ease of use?  I&apos;d want to immediately crack it open and start hacking more HD space into it, as well as <a href=\"http://www.9thtee.com/tivoairnet.htm\">TiVo <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"></span></a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/AirNET?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">AirNET</font> Ethernet Adapter Board.  But I think my Linux box will do this, and more.  Though, I&apos;m not sure if Linux supports the TV-out for my ATI card.  I&apos;ve also heard that <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/TiVo?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">TiVo</font></span> captures closed captioning.  Eh, neat, but I don&apos;t need it.  Not at the moment, anyway.  Then I hear about things like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=sonicblue+spy\">SonicBlue being ordered to spy on PVR users</a>, and I feel much safer having a home-cobbled PVR.</p>\n<p>What d&apos;you think?</p>\n"

It feels much too much like a philosophy or religion or something.\"  And I agree with this, too.  I got introduced to XML-RPC via simple toolkits and real problems solved with satisfaction, and I'm learning SOAP slowly the same way.  Gordon also captures some of my other sentiments.</p>\n<p>I think I get <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> now.  Maybe.  Between my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000127.shtml\">last post on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a></a> and finally finding and reading Paul Prescod's \"<a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/02/20/rest.html?page=1\">REST and the Real World</a>\", I feel somewhat illuminated.  </p>\n<p>I also feel very, very behind.  This has all probably been covered ad nauseum on mailing lists I haven't read yet, but this is what I thought on Paul's article:<blockquote><i>Using someone else's [RESTful] web service requires you to understand their data structures (XML vocabulary and links between documents). . . . RPC APIs merely hide the problem behind an extra layer of non-standardization. First you must figure out the method names available. Then you must still figure out the data structures that may be used as parameters. And then behind those data structures is the implicit data model of the web service.</i></blockquote>Hmm.  Yes, in an RPC API I have to supply my customer with my method definitions-- including their names, parameters, and return values.  This seems directly comparable to supplying my customer with all the URIs exposed by my app's resources, as well as the data structures used by them.</p>\n<p>How are these cases so very different?<blockquote><i>There is no free lunch. The biggest problem most will have with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> is that it requires you to rethink your problem in terms of manipulations of addressable resources instead of method calls to a component.</i></blockquote>I don't want to rethink my problem, at least not without a clear payback.  When I first learned to rethink my problems in object oriented programming, I got immense payback.  I haven't seen the clear payback case for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> yet.  So far, it looks like an interesting abstraction with a lot of vagueries, name calling, and intimations of harm and danger.</p>\n<blockquote><i>Of course you may actually implement it on the server side however you want. But the API you communicate to your clients should be in terms of HTTP manipulations on XML documents addressed by URIs, not in terms of method calls with parameters.</i></blockquote>My customer doesn't want to mess with this, and doesn't want to learn about it.\n<blockquote><i>Your customers may well prefer a component-based interface to a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> interface.</i></blockquote>Yup, they do.  My chances of altering their behavior is slim to none-- at least not without a clear case of payback to present.\n<blockquote><i>Programmers are more used to APIs and APIs are better integrated into existing programming languages. For client-side programmers, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> is somewhat of a departure although for server-side programmers it is not much different than what they have been doing for the last several years, building web sites.</i></blockquote>The server-side programmers I work with have been building CGIs and various server-side things which treat URI's as mere gateways onto their applications.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> is pretty different than what they've been doing for the last several years.\n<blockquote><i>REST is about imposing a programming discipline of many URIs and few methods. RPC allows you to structure your application however it feels best to you. Let it all hang out! If a particular problem can be solved with RPC, and future extensibility and security are not going to be issues for you, you should certainly use the looser approach.</i></blockquote>I still don't see the payoff of few methods with many resources versus many methods with few resources.  Either way, should I change my application in the future I'll need to supply my customer with new data descriptions, or with new method descriptions.  How does <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> make me magically extensible?  Am I not seeing something?\n<p>The security angle I can <i>sort of</i> see, given the already built-in ability of web servers and firewalls to control HTTP methods and URI accesses.  But, most times I want my application to manage its security and access control, not the web server or firewall.  Maybe this is a flaw in my application.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the simplicity of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> feels like a possible elegance to me, which I like.  Elegance feels warm and fuzzy, not itchy.  XML-RPC is obviously a bit of a workable hack.  Being able to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>fully reduce my app down to database-like access via a web of URI resources seems neat.  But, the whole <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> thing feels like an inside-out turn of many things.  This is not useful to me unless I can find some abstraction or toolkit to help me wire my apps up to things in the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> way.  XML-RPC was quick for me to get hooked on, since it was a mostly drop-in solution with me writing only a few wrapper methods.</p>\n<p>Now that I understand <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> better, I see that I could possibly do most of what I do with SOAP and XML-RPC in a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>ful manner with a bit of brain bending.  It reminds me of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000090.shtml#000090\">threaded versus async / event driven</a> programming.  But I don't know why I should bother: I'm still looking for the payback of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> and I'm still looking for the danger inherent in the RPC model.  </p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=oooabh\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086422\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://chris.wiw.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=41a3710dfca25cec2382a08ffb7cdba5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://chris.wiw.org/\">Christopher Heschong</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086422\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-29T18:56:25\">2002-04-29T18:56:25</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Dave's original post said something like: \"Oy, these weenies should stop talking and start writing scripts.\"</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

Maybe a new language.  I seem to remember hearing on the <a href=\"http://www.toddshow.org\">Todd Mundt Show</a> that the Turkish language has a facility for specifying whether something you're saying originates with you, or whether you heard it from someone else...)</p>\n<p>Anyway, since Ken <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/MacLeod?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">MacLeod</font></span> had taken the time to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000102.shtml\">respond in some detail</a> to a post I made asking about <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> not too long ago, I thought I should come back around to it.</p>\n<p>So I think my first confusion was with marshalling.  This is why I like XML-RPC:  I don't worry about much.  As a client, I give it a URL and a method name, and then throw a pile of parameters for the method at it.  As a server-side method, the server gives me parameters when it calls me, and I throw back a return value.  The server takes care of turning the XML into my arguments, and my return value to XML.</p>\n<p>In all the languages I've worked with it in (ie. Perl, Python, <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/UserTalk?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">UserTalk</font></span>, and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AppleScript\">AppleScript</a>), this works conveniently well.  I never actually pay much attention to the XML in XML-RPC.  So, I was very confused in reading a few things about <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> and not seeing much mention of this, other than along the lines of \"Oh, well, you could go ahead and use XML-RPC libraries to build messages if you wanted to.\"  Which begged the question for me: Why not just go the whole hog and use XML-RPC?  (Or SOAP, for that matter, but that's another holy war I'm avoiding for the present context.)</p>\n<p>Okay, so <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> isn't about marshalling parameters.  Then what is it about?  Well, I think a bit more reading and Ken's response to me have helped illuminate me a bit.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> point seems to me to be that all operations being attempted by Web Services can be distilled into a few actions:  retrieve, create, update, and delete.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> says that these fundamentals are already defined as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, respectively.  I think.  Is this right?</p>\n<p>So, I apply these verbs to URI nouns.  To concretize the concept:  I recently wrote &amp; exposed an XML-RPC API to a scorekeeping component on one of our promotions.  Some of the methods of this API were along the lines of <code>int points.get_points(string email)</code>, <code>points.award_points(string email, int points)</code>, and <code>points.create_points_account(string email)</code>.  To make myself a new account I'd call <code>points.create_points_account(\"deus_x@pobox.com\")</code> and then <code>points.award_points(\"deus_x@pobox.com\", 100)</code> to drop myself some points in the scoreboard.  Then, I would do <code>points.get_points(\"deus_x@pobox.com\")</code> to check my score.</p>\n<p>I'm afraid this example is too simple.  Jon Udell <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100887/2002/02/24.html#a92\">wrote</a> that he wanted to see the \"stock quote example\" retired for being too simplistic to stress the technology in mental experiments.  Hmm.  Oh well, let's see where it goes.</p>\n<p>So, if I were to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>ify the above example, would the sequence of things be like a POST, PUT, and GET, all to a URL that looks something like:</p>\n<p><code>http://myhost/promotion/players/deus_x@pobox.com/points</code></p>\n<p>Whereas POST does the account creation, PUT updates the points, and GET of course grabs the points total?</p>\n<p>Okay, maybe POST needs to post to <code>.../players/deus_x@pobox.com</code> with a request body specifying \"points\", to create the new URI?  The request body of the PUT should contain a points value -- positive for award, negative for debit?  And if the thing needed more complex data, I could use something like XML-RPC to encode a data structure as arguments, or as <a href=\"http://chris.wiw.org/2002/04/26.html#a16\">Chris Heschong</a> wrote, use <a href=\"http://www.openwddx.org/\">WDDX</a>?</p>\n<p>Do I get it?  Hmm...  okay, have to run to a meeting, but I wanted to post this and see if anyone could give me feedback on my understanding.  I think I see how, if all resources are manipulatable in this manner, one could envision a more abstracted and uniform interface on web resources than a pile of published web services APIs.  But...  can it really be that abstracted?</p>\n<p>Hmm.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=oooabg\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085579\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=989c4ddf929db7556b199fedf7d9a405&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">pb</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085579\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-26T18:14:55\">2002-04-26T18:14:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Why not POST/GET requests with key=value pairs as a response.

Like Christopher says, this started to fall apart when I needed richer data structures.\nAs for REST, it seems that their idea is to not make function calls.  What you do with REST is to treat URIs more like database resources, on which you perform SELECT (GET), INSERT (POST), UPDATE (PUT) and DELETE (DELETE).  So instead of calling an award_points method on my player object, I UPDATE (PUT) points on the points resource of my player (represented by URI).</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

I've decided that ultimately I agree that <a href=\"http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?LoginsAreEvil\">LoginsAreEvil</a>.  I didn't <i>really</i> want to put up fences, or raise the laziness threshold.  I mostly wanted to identify people, but I was mistaken.  Now, I'd rather <a href=\"http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?AvoidIllusion\">AvoidIllusion</a>.</p>\n<p>There still are a <i>few</i> fences, however.  My reasoning is that my use of this wiki slides into the realm of cheap content management, and I don't prefer public input on certain things.  A few pages are access controlled, such as the wiki's front page and my home page.  For this purpose, there's an alternate password-protected set of wiki commands.

I kind of drifted away from it after not too long, but got interested in wikis again after I saw a few more of them in action out there and read The Wiki Way.\nI liked UseModWiki for its simplicity.  And out of every wiki I've played with so far, I've liked UseModWiki's markup the best.  What I didn't like is that the wiki was in one monolithic script, and that modifications and \"plugins\" were just patches to the uber script.  This seemed very itchy to me, and I wanted modules and plugins so I could easily modify things and keep my mods clean and separate.\nSo I looked at TWiki again.  It's much more modular and geared toward plugins and drop-in mods.  And, it uses template files instead of HTML tangled up with the program code.  Well, sort of.  The more I played with it, the more I came to think that the modules weren't so clean yet, and the templates are a little screwy.  Eh, nothing's perfect.\nThen I started playing with Python and wandered through MoinMoin.  It seems fairly modular, and cleaner than TWiki.  It seems a little less powerful, but not by much.  And it looks like there's the beginnings of multiple output formats in MoinMoin, which is interesting to me because there's a push to try to get our wiki to produce DocBook at work.\nBut I'm starting to reconsider all of this and thinking of moving either to MoinMoin or UseModWiki.  I've found myself editing core TWiki code anyway, and so my mods are not so clean anymore.  This makes me remember what UseModWiki was like, and that monolithic script doesn't seem as bad to me now.  And I really dislike TWiki's markup.  UseModWiki seemed much more author-oriented whereas TWiki's somehow seems to want to look better as a text document.  Mainly my itch is with headers and lists.\nAs for MoinMoin, I'm not sure.  I need to play with it some more, though I seem to remember I had problems with its markup format as well.  And then there's that DocBook output push we've got at work which has me wanting to roll my own wiki-inspired system from scratch.\nIn the end, my issue is that I like wiki but I'm also trying to get a content management system out of it for free, and the two are not precisely the same thing.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083810\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SunirShah\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=959e33c2c9231c2cee8282e6192cdb4f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SunirShah\">Sunir Shah</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083810\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-26T04:30:23\">2002-04-26T04:30:23</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Most users of UseModWiki appreciate the monolithic file format because it's easy for them to configure. For non-programmers, the fewer parts the better. They're not going to patch the script at all.\nI argued with Cliff that the script itself needed to be modularized in some way because it was getting to become one gigantic spaghetti blob. My point was that for development it would be easier, even though for deployment we could repackage the entire program into one file anyway (because Perl is Light.)\nI tried to modularize it back then but I didn't get very far, but I understand the script better now. Eric and I are conspiring to do this because there is mounting pressure to make UseModWiki fit into existing weblog structures for one, and because it's a pain in the butt to patch the script as it stands. We might begin soon enough.\nHowever, I have little faith this will get very far either. For instance, in order to implement RSS, I rewrote the RecentChanges subroutine to take an set of lambdas. In the normal circumstance, these lambdas would emit HTML. In the new circumstance, they would emit RSS. These kinds of patches don't modularize well.\nThe generally philosophy for UseModWiki is in tension between simplicity and flexibility. I don't honestly believe a plug-in, module architecture like TWiki would be healthy for the development of the script. It's too complicated. If anything, I want to keep the system as simple as the original wiki, but with greater depth.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083811\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083811\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-26T10:26:57\">2002-04-26T10:26:57</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Yes, I can see the simplicity/flexibility tension.  It's in UseModWiki and all over the wiki world for that matter.\nAs for modularizing UseModWiki... This may actually be what you mean: you could work things such that during development, the script is broken up, and then another script is run which re-weaves everything into a single monolith for distribution.  Something ala literate programming and the weaver concept, but that's really different from the current state of things.\nOn the other hand, I've noticed that the mods I find myself wanting to do generally fall into two categories: new markup and new output styles.  \nIn the former, I keep leaning toward non-wiki-ish complexity-- seems sometimes I really want PHP in wiki.  Otherwise HTML is pretty much simple and covered by existing markup.  In the latter, I've managed to do this with either simple tweaks or external scripts which load in the UseModWiki script.  Though, emitting DocBook is something that would need quite a bit of work right now, maybe for good reason.  And in both cases, I find myself doing far fewer of either than I thought I would in the first place.\nBut, the simple tweaks can pile up as patches and monolithic scripts just disturb my software design sensibilities.  Of course, I keep leaning toward non-wiki things in wikis.  I'm all confused sometimes. :)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

I've decided that ultimately I agree that <a href=\"http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?LoginsAreEvil\">LoginsAreEvil</a>.  I didn't <i>really</i> want to put up fences, or raise the laziness threshold.  I mostly wanted to identify people, but I was mistaken.

My reasoning is that my use of this wiki slides into the realm of cheap content management, and I don't prefer public input on certain things.  A few pages are access controlled, such as the wiki's front page and my home page.  For this purpose, there's an alternate password-protected set of wiki commands.

Of course, I keep leaning toward non-wiki things in wikis.  I'm all confused sometimes. :)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

I&apos;ve decided that ultimately I agree that <a href=\"http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?LoginsAreEvil\">LoginsAreEvil</a>.  I didn&apos;t <i>really</i> want to put up fences, or raise the laziness threshold.  I mostly wanted to identify people, but I was mistaken.  Now, I&apos;d rather <a href=\"http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?AvoidIllusion\">AvoidIllusion</a>.</p>\n<p>There still are a <i>few</i> fences, however.  My reasoning is that my use of this wiki slides into the realm of cheap content management, and I don&apos;t prefer public input on certain things.  A few pages are access controlled, such as the wiki&apos;s front page and my home page.  For this purpose, there&apos;s an alternate password-protected set of wiki commands.  The non-authenticated are under /twiki/bin whereas the authenticated set are at /twiki/sbin.  Just as easy as putting an &apos;s&apos; in the URL.</p>\n<p>Access to the authenticated commands doesn&apos;t necessarily mean you get to edit everything though. :)  That&apos;s access control for you.</p>\n<p>Eventually, maybe I&apos;ll drop the access controls too.  I was also thinking of moving out of TWiki for another wiki implementation like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MoinMoin\">MoinMoin</a>, too.  Still tinkering.</p>\n"

The Google principle: It doesn&apos;t matter where information is because I can get to it with a keystroke.<p></p>\n</i><p><i>So what is Zoe? Think about it as a sort of librarian, tirelessly, continuously, processing, slicing, indexing, organizing, your messages. The end result is this intertwingled web of information. Messages put in context. Your very own knowledge base accessible at your fingertip. No more &quot;attending to&quot; your messages. The messages organization is done automatically for you so as to not have the need to &quot;manage&quot; your email. Because once information is available at a keystroke, it doesn&apos;t matter in which folder you happened to file it two years ago. There is no folder. The information is always there. Accessible when you need it. In context.</i></p></blockquote><p></p>\n<p>Rock on!  I&apos;m either terribly unoriginal or my mind is being read or there&apos;s just a common Alpha Geek wavelength I&apos;m tuning into.  By the description, this is <b>precisely</b> what I wanted to do with a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalMailServer\">PersonalMailServer</a>.  Getting tired of making folders, filtering rules, and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalMailServer\">MailToRSS</a> needs a bit more work and tweaking to be really useful.  </p>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/zoe_info/Education6.html\">the FAQ</a>:</p><blockquote><i>Q: On which platform does ZO? run?<p></p>\n</i><p><i>A: ZO? has been known to run on the following &quot;platforms&quot;:<br>\n...<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOSX\">MacOSX</a> 10.1.4, jre 1.3.1, Mozilla 0.9.9<br>\n...</i></p></blockquote>Rock on.<blockquote><i>Q: How much does ZO? cost?<p></p>\n</i><p><i>A: ZO? is free of charge for personal usage.

That&apos;s no fun!  I want to play!  I don&apos;t see it within 5 minutes of installation, but I think this thing really really needs IMAP.  IMAP would rock for both message import and external mail client access.<p></p>\n<p>But, from the author&apos;s terse response to this question, I&apos;m imagining there are many who&apos;ve asked it and he&apos;s tired of answering why he&apos;s not being trendy :)  I guess I&apos;ll play and see what happens.</p>\n"

    "html": "<p>Playing with a range of news aggregators once more, since <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a></a> is making me itchy again.  Pretty much the only ones I really like are Radio, <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, and sometimes <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/python/peerkat/\">Peerkat</a>.</p>\n<p>For the last week or so I've been mostly alternating between Radio and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>.  The difference in aggregation styles is interesting:  While Radio slices and dices and aggregates feeds by items and serves them up to me in an interwoven chronological order, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> serves my feeds up to me whole and in order of feed modification.  I'm not sure which I like more now.</p>\n<p>I like Radio's style, because I see what's new and only what's new.  Usually.  But, I like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>'s style because I see everything, and have realized that I miss things with the rush of new items from all my feeds.  For instance, if someone posts something once per day, I'll likely miss it with Radio unless I check every hour.  But, with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, I get to see what's new with every <i>person</i> or <i>source</i> whenever I check, and I only miss items if that feed has scrolled them off.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.burningbird.net/weblog/2002_03_01_burningbird_archive.php#75003900\">Shelley Powers of burningbird.net</a> <a href=\"http://p2psmoke.org/distributed/rss.htm\">wrote a bit about</a> the context destroying nature that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> and aggregators have on weblogs.  I agree with her somewhat, in that pulling the words out of the surrounding context of the blog and its presentation and community has an altering effect, I wouldn't say that it destroys the weblog.</p>\n<p>For me, when I see something on my news aggregator, it's as if I'm overhearing it from another room.  I don't get the whole context or see who else is listening or responding, but I hear the gist of something.  And, when subscribed to 100+ <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds, it's like I'm floating in this Nth dimensional space where I can overhear voices from hundreds of rooms without being overwhelmed.  When something triggers some of my mental filters and watchwords, I click the link and delve deeper.</p>\n<p>There's no way, without an aggregator, that I'd be able to track 100+ people and news sources in a day.  But, because I can, I've been able to learn and discover things and hear voices I never would have before.</p>\n<p>But, I think the way <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> merges these sources might be a nicer alternative.  By not chopping up the feeds, some intra-item context is maintained at least, so I can see developing trains of thought.</p>\n<p>Okay, must go back to work now.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=oooaai\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089999\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e5f046c5b46cfb3ef1089da58b2a48bb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/\">Rael</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089999\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-24T19:21:30\">2002-04-24T19:21:30</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Howdy,\nIf you like (in any way ;-) Peerkat, you might want to take a gander at the dynamic duo of Blosxom (Weblog application) and Blagg (RSS Aggregator).\nRael</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090001\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090001\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-24T19:44:13\">2002-04-24T19:44:13</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Wow.

Another haiku of code :)\nTorturing blagg with my pile of subscriptions seems to have gone alright.  I need to tweak around with the templates for blosxom (Blog Some?) to make it more pleasant to visually scan.  Also need to tweak the max # of items on the page.  Maybe some sort of \"Next/Prev 20 items\" pagination would be nice.\nAlso, templatizing how blagg constructs posts from RSS items would be hot, too.\nFirst snag I see though, which you probably already know about, is the way blagg determines whether or not an item is new.  Blagg, of course, uses the title.  However, some of my feeds' items never have titles (ie. Radio UserLand peeps who haven't turned on titles), and others often have the same titles (ie. RSS feeds from wikis).\nI've been trying to figure out the best way to do this in general, and all my solutions keep ending up at a bruteforce MD5 of the whole item.  Of course, the problem in doing that in blagg is that MD5 doesn't come out of the box with perl in OS X, which kills the whole drag-n-drop installation theme.

Keen!  Something that would be nice, though, is if the RSS feed source could be separated from the post title and passed as a separate parameter to the post() sub of the plugin.  Then I could even do something like transform the source attribute into a category or something, should I make a metaWeblog API plugin.

Yeah, MD5 would be a little slow. Perhaps the filename could include a character length count, something like \"raelity.617.title\". That should cover Wiki changes (as a same count edit would be rare, I'd hope). That'd cover RU a bit too.\nSpeaking of which, I just sent Rael a Blaggplug that pings weblogs.com with an update of your blog.

    "body": "<p>Playing with a range of news aggregators once more, since <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a></a> is making me itchy again.  Pretty much the only ones I really like are Radio, <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, and sometimes <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/python/peerkat/\">Peerkat</a>.</p>\r\n<p>For the last week or so I've been mostly alternating between Radio and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>.  The difference in aggregation styles is interesting:  While Radio slices and dices and aggregates feeds by items and serves them up to me in an interwoven chronological order, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> serves my feeds up to me whole and in order of feed modification.  I'm not sure which I like more now.</p>\r\n<p>I like Radio's style, because I see what's new and only what's new.  Usually.  But, I like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>'s style because I see everything, and have realized that I miss things with the rush of new items from all my feeds.  For instance, if someone posts something once per day, I'll likely miss it with Radio unless I check every hour.  But, with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, I get to see what's new with every <i>person</i> or <i>source</i> whenever I check, and I only miss items if that feed has scrolled them off.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.burningbird.net/weblog/2002_03_01_burningbird_archive.php#75003900\">Shelley Powers of burningbird.net</a> <a href=\"http://p2psmoke.org/distributed/rss.htm\">wrote a bit about</a> the context destroying nature that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> and aggregators have on weblogs.  I agree with her somewhat, in that pulling the words out of the surrounding context of the blog and its presentation and community has an altering effect, I wouldn't say that it destroys the weblog.</p>\r\n<p>For me, when I see something on my news aggregator, it's as if I'm overhearing it from another room.  I don't get the whole context or see who else is listening or responding, but I hear the gist of something.  And, when subscribed to 100+ <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds, it's like I'm floating in this Nth dimensional space where I can overhear voices from hundreds of rooms without being overwhelmed.  When something triggers some of my mental filters and watchwords, I click the link and delve deeper.</p>\r\n<p>There's no way, without an aggregator, that I'd be able to track 100+ people and news sources in a day.  But, because I can, I've been able to learn and discover things and hear voices I never would have before.</p>\r\n<p>But, I think the way <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> merges these sources might be a nicer alternative.  By not chopping up the feeds, some intra-item context is maintained at least, so I can see developing trains of thought.</p>\r\n<p>Okay, must go back to work now.</p>\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=oooaai\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089999\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e5f046c5b46cfb3ef1089da58b2a48bb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/\">Rael</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089999\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-24T19:21:30\">2002-04-24T19:21:30</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Howdy,\r\n\r\nIf you like (in any way ;-) Peerkat, you might want to take a gander at the dynamic duo of Blosxom (Weblog application) and Blagg (RSS Aggregator).\r\n\r\nRael</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090001\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090001\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-24T19:44:13\">2002-04-24T19:44:13</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Wow.

Another haiku of code :)\r\n\r\nTorturing blagg with my pile of subscriptions seems to have gone alright.  I need to tweak around with the templates for blosxom (Blog Some?) to make it more pleasant to visually scan.  Also need to tweak the max # of items on the page.  Maybe some sort of \"Next/Prev 20 items\" pagination would be nice.\r\n\r\nAlso, templatizing how blagg constructs posts from RSS items would be hot, too.\r\n\r\nFirst snag I see though, which you probably already know about, is the way blagg determines whether or not an item is new.  Blagg, of course, uses the title.  However, some of my feeds' items never have titles (ie. Radio UserLand peeps who haven't turned on titles), and others often have the same titles (ie. RSS feeds from wikis).\r\n\r\nI've been trying to figure out the best way to do this in general, and all my solutions keep ending up at a bruteforce MD5 of the whole item.  Of course, the problem in doing that in blagg is that MD5 doesn't come out of the box with perl in OS X, which kills the whole drag-n-drop installation theme.  (Nevermind that MD5ing everything might be a tad slow.)\r\n\r\nHrm.  Still playing.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090016\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090016\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-25T12:45:12\">2002-04-25T12:45:12</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Oh yeah, and one other blagg thing:  I see the Blaggplugs.  Keen!  Something that would be nice, though, is if the RSS feed source could be separated from the post title and passed as a separate parameter to the post() sub of the plugin.  Then I could even do something like transform the source attribute into a category or something, should I make a metaWeblog API plugin.

Yeah, MD5 would be a little slow. Perhaps the filename could include a character length count, something like \"raelity.617.title\". That should cover Wiki changes (as a same count edit would be rare, I'd hope). That'd cover RU a bit too.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, I just sent Rael a Blaggplug that pings weblogs.com with an update of your blog.

    "summary": "<p>Playing with a range of news aggregators once more, since <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Radio </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> is making me itchy again.  Pretty much the only ones I really like are Radio, <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, and sometimes <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/python/peerkat/\">Peerkat</a>.</p>\n<p>For the last week or so I&apos;ve been mostly alternating between Radio and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>.  The difference in aggregation styles is interesting:  While Radio slices and dices and aggregates feeds by items and serves them up to me in an interwoven chronological order, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> serves my feeds up to me whole and in order of feed modification.  I&apos;m not sure which I like more now.</p>\n<p>I like Radio&apos;s style, because I see what&apos;s new and only what&apos;s new.  Usually.  But, I like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>&apos;s style because I see everything, and have realized that I miss things with the rush of new items from all my feeds.  For instance, if someone posts something once per day, I&apos;ll likely miss it with Radio unless I check every hour.  But, with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, I get to see what&apos;s new with every <i>person</i> or <i>source</i> whenever I check, and I only miss items if that feed has scrolled them off.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.burningbird.net/weblog/2002_03_01_burningbird_archive.php#75003900\">Shelley Powers of burningbird.net</a> <a href=\"http://p2psmoke.org/distributed/rss.htm\">wrote a bit about</a> the context destroying nature that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> and aggregators have on weblogs.  I agree with her somewhat, in that pulling the words out of the surrounding context of the blog and its presentation and community has an altering effect, I wouldn&apos;t say that it destroys the weblog.</p>\n<p>For me, when I see something on my news aggregator, it&apos;s as if I&apos;m overhearing it from another room.  I don&apos;t get the whole context or see who else is listening or responding, but I hear the gist of something.  And, when subscribed to 100+ <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds, it&apos;s like I&apos;m floating in this Nth dimensional space where I can overhear voices from hundreds of rooms without being overwhelmed.  When something triggers some of my mental filters and watchwords, I click the link and delve deeper.</p>\n<p>There&apos;s no way, without an aggregator, that I&apos;d be able to track 100+ people and news sources in a day.  But, because I can, I&apos;ve been able to learn and discover things and hear voices I never would have before.</p>\n<p>But, I think the way <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> merges these sources might be a nicer alternative.  By not chopping up the feeds, some intra-item context is maintained at least, so I can see developing trains of thought.</p>\n<p>Okay, must go back to work now.</p>\n"

I have scripts which auto launch some SSH tunnels back to my Linux server and mount shares on my Win2K box when I switch networks.  It usually works.  I have all my current developing projects on the thing, and I do news aggregation with Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>.  Occasionally at home, the iBook is what I have with me in the living room, so with the A/V cable I use the iBook to play internet radio on my living room stereo, or I stream movies over my LAN from Win2K PC in the other room.</p>\n<p>But, what I really want is the Global from <a href=\"http://www.efc.com\">Earth: Final Conflict</a>.  I can't find a link or direct info on the thing as used in the series, but it's an amazing fictional device.  Palm-sized with a pull-out screen, clips onto the belt.  Has world-wide satellite video phone, global positioning, and seemingly endless PDA capabilities.  I think I've even seen someone drop it into a cradle and pull up their work on a desktop PC.  I've at least seen some general scenes like: \"Hey, can you drop me a couple gig of that data onto my global so I can look at it later.\"  Seems to have ubiquitous net access, even in low earth orbit. :)</p>\n<p>But until someone makes that, I'm going to eye that OQO up for awhile and see what people think.  $1000 seems like a sweet price if I can run *BSD or Linux on it.  Funny thing is, so far, I haven't spent very much money at all on all these things I have.  They've all been acquired used or on sale or for free.  Most all of it was cobbled together from scraps.</p>\n<p>Living in the future is fun. :)</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=oooaag\n",

    "summary": "<p>John Robb <a href=\"http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/04/24.html#a1621\">writes about the next generation of PCs and such</a>:</p><blockquote><i>Here is how I think the battle will evolve in the next five to ten years:...<p></p>\n<p>1)  A home server.   This PC is always on and lives in a closet.  It serves multiple users that connect to it using mobile wireless screens and keyboards.  ...</p>\n</i><p><i>2) An extremely mobile PC ala OQO.  This PC will be attached to a single individual.  ...</i></p></blockquote>This sums up much of what I&apos;ve been anticipating and have found myself building.<p></p>\n<p>In the case of the home server, I have two of them actually.</p>\n<p>One is a headless Linux box behind a cable modem that has accumulated all sorts of autonomous functions: it gathers my mail from various accounts into an IMAP server that I access from everywhere; before I was using Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>, it used to host all of my news aggregation hacks; it controls and monitors all the X10 devices in my apartment (though these are dwindling away); and until my radio reception got bad when I moved, it used to record radio shows for me using a D-Link USB FM radio.  I actually have a Mac at work that does that does that for me, and dumps the sound files to my server at home periodically.</p>\n<p>The other &quot;home server&quot; is a PC running Win2K with an ATI Radeon All-in-Wonder card.  This machine is my PVR, recording to VCD the few TV shows I actually want to keep up with.  That ends up being about 12 VCDs a week, counting all the episodes of Buffy that I capture.  (Guilty pleasures.)  I keep dumping more and more hard drive space into this machine, and use it as a general apartment-wide file server, as well as a dumping ground for stuff from remote when I&apos;m out yet have net access.  Occasionally I play Windows-based cames on the PC, but it mostly just sits there and does things.</p>\n<p>I would like to combine these boxes into one big Linux box connected wirelessly to my cable modem, sitting in my closet in my apartment, or if I had a house, across the basement from the water heater.  I want this home server to be in the same class of appliances as the furnace, washing machine, and water heater.

Not sure how much I like it yet, but at least it's a familiar tune they're playing.  The mildly annoying thing is that it's familiar, but there are just a few things I would habitually reach for in Perl that I haven't sussed out yet in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a>.  Like autovivifying data structures.  I abuse those constantly.  I really need to wean myself away from that, methinks.</p>\n<p>One thing that I <i>was</i> pleasantly surprised to find is <a href=\"http://pear.php.net\">PEAR</a>, \"a framework and distribution system for reusable <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> components\".  Hello, <a href=\"http://www.cpan.org\">CPAN</a>, my old friend. :)  Finding all kinds of things that are immediately useful, like a <a href=\"http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=40\">Cache</a> I can use to more intelligently and easily do the output caching voodoo I do in the perl CGI widgets right now.  </p>\n<p><b><Aside></b>You know, a lack of a centrallized CPAN-like system is what has kept me from leaving Perl for many other technologies.  I really wish Java (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=cjan\">CJAN</a>?) and Python (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=cpyan&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0\">CPyAN</a>?) had one supported by their respective communities.  It's just so nice to do a <code>perl -MCPAN -e\"install Date::Parse\"</code> and get what I need.  Maintaining CPAN bundles for my perl software is tasty, too.  Single-command installation of all my app's requirements, and sometimes I can roll it right into the app's installation itself.  Mmm.<b></aside></b></p>\n<p>Anyway, it's nice (to say it again) to have a running personal site to tinker with, now that I've gotten off my butt and done it.  This laboratory is letting me manufacture reasons to play with tech I hadn't bothered with before.  </p>\n<p>I mean, I've used ASP and JSP, and for most of the things I've done, I've grown a severe dislike for them both.  I left the \"Hey, you've got HTML in my code!\" paradigm behind, wandered through that \"Hey, you've got code in my HTML\" model, and eventually settled on my standard pattern now:<blockquote>A central app logic controller takes in GET/POST data, dispatches to a method which processes the form data.  That method then constructs data structures, which are in turn passed through a template engine to be rendered by a pile of templates independent from the controller.</blockquote>This, along with some very special self-assembling component-based automation sauce, is the core of what my employer's offerings run on.  But, this has crystallized as a habit for me, and I've not even considered other possibilities for a long time.  This of course has made everything look like a nail for this hammer I have.  </p>\n<p>For example, while <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> is not quite the right tool for the  things we're doing at my day job, it seems like a perfect option to quickly and easily replace <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI\">SSI</a> pages on my site with something meatier yet still simple to maintain and doesn't stink like ASP or JSP.  I've also been looking at <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/cocoon\">Cocoon</a>, which if I can ever quite get in a groove with it, looks like a highly refined instance of my standard hammer.</p>\n<p>And then there's Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>.  I love it and hate it.  The hate mostly comes from the slower iBook on which I run it, I think.  The bootstrappiness of it makes me itch sometimes, but other times that just makes it endearing.  The whole self-contained development biodome it represents is pretty sexy, too.  Speaking of autovivifying data structures...  I just have to love a system which has a live, manually tinkerable giant outline/hashtree for a persistence mechanism.</p>\n<p>Next, I really want to swing back around to playing with Flash.  Last time I did something major with it, I was making a game for my employer which really wanted to use web services but I hadn't known it yet.  The game worked pretty well, but I want to see what it can do since last we met.

It's also something one of my favorite Comp Sci professors harped on, with regards to what makes a Computer Programmer versus what makes a Computer Scientist.  A small part of his speech always pointed to the notion that a a programmer is almost always pragmatic, memorizing the patterns and greasy innards of whatever tool he or she uses daily.  On the other hand, the scientist is an explorer and finds joy in confusing him or herself by finding the universals and generalities across a range of tools.  In the end, the programmer becomes specialized in a limited domain, while the scientist knows can pick up just about anything that comes along.

    "summary": "<p>So I&apos;m starting to play with <a href=\"http://www.php.net\">PHP</a> and working on rewriting my <a href=\"http://www.movabletype.org\">Movable Type</a> templates as *.phtml.</p>\n<p>Having never really payed much attention to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a>, I&apos;m amazed at how close it is to Perl (obviously on purpose) yet how much effort has been made to sand off the rough bits.  Not sure how much I like it yet, but at least it&apos;s a familiar tune they&apos;re playing.  The mildly annoying thing is that it&apos;s familiar, but there are just a few things I would habitually reach for in Perl that I haven&apos;t sussed out yet in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a>.  Like autovivifying data structures.  I abuse those constantly.  I really need to wean myself away from that, methinks.</p>\n<p>One thing that I <i>was</i> pleasantly surprised to find is <a href=\"http://pear.php.net\">PEAR</a>, &quot;a framework and distribution system for reusable <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> components&quot;.  Hello, <a href=\"http://www.cpan.org\">CPAN</a>, my old friend. :)  Finding all kinds of things that are immediately useful, like a <a href=\"http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=40\">Cache</a> I can use to more intelligently and easily do the output caching voodoo I do in the perl CGI widgets right now.  </p>\n<p><b></b></p><aside>You know, a lack of a centrallized CPAN-like system is what has kept me from leaving Perl for many other technologies.  I really wish Java (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=cjan\">CJAN</a>?) and Python (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=cpyan&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0\">CPyAN</a>?) had one supported by their respective communities.  It&apos;s just so nice to do a <code>perl -MCPAN -e&quot;install Date::Parse&quot;</code> and get what I need.  Maintaining CPAN bundles for my perl software is tasty, too.  Single-command installation of all my app&apos;s requirements, and sometimes I can roll it right into the app&apos;s installation itself.  Mmm.<b></b></aside><p></p>\n<p>Anyway, it&apos;s nice (to say it again) to have a running personal site to tinker with, now that I&apos;ve gotten off my butt and done it.  This laboratory is letting me manufacture reasons to play with tech I hadn&apos;t bothered with before.  </p>\n<p>I mean, I&apos;ve used ASP and JSP, and for most of the things I&apos;ve done, I&apos;ve grown a severe dislike for them both.  I left the &quot;Hey, you&apos;ve got HTML in my code!&quot; paradigm behind, wandered through that &quot;Hey, you&apos;ve got code in my HTML&quot; model, and eventually settled on my standard pattern now:</p><blockquote>A central app logic controller takes in GET/POST data, dispatches to a method which processes the form data.  That method then constructs data structures, which are in turn passed through a template engine to be rendered by a pile of templates independent from the controller.</blockquote>This, along with some very special self-assembling component-based automation sauce, is the core of what my employer&apos;s offerings run on.  But, this has crystallized as a habit for me, and I&apos;ve not even considered other possibilities for a long time.  This of course has made everything look like a nail for this hammer I have.  <p></p>\n<p>For example, while <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> is not quite the right tool for the  things we&apos;re doing at my day job, it seems like a perfect option to quickly and easily replace <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI\">SSI</a> pages on my site with something meatier yet still simple to maintain and doesn&apos;t stink like ASP or JSP.  I&apos;ve also been looking at <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/cocoon\">Cocoon</a>, which if I can ever quite get in a groove with it, looks like a highly refined instance of my standard hammer.</p>\n<p>And then there&apos;s Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>.  I love it and hate it.  The hate mostly comes from the slower iBook on which I run it, I think.  The bootstrappiness of it makes me itch sometimes, but other times that just makes it endearing.  The whole self-contained development biodome it represents is pretty sexy, too.  Speaking of autovivifying data structures...  I just have to love a system which has a live, manually tinkerable giant outline/hashtree for a persistence mechanism.</p>\n<p>Next, I really want to swing back around to playing with Flash.  Last time I did something major with it, I was making a game for my employer which really wanted to use web services but I hadn&apos;t known it yet.  The game worked pretty well, but I want to see what it can do since last we met.  First thing in mind that seems mildly nifty might be a slick, live updating lil &quot;Recent Visitors&quot; app for my front page.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m really feeling what <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100887/\">Jon Udell</a> means when he writes about <a href=\"http://www.byte.com/documents/s=7031/byt1016214357418/0318_udell.html\">thinking by analogy</a>.  It&apos;s also something one of my favorite Comp Sci professors harped on, with regards to what makes a Computer Programmer versus what makes a Computer Scientist.  A small part of his speech always pointed to the notion that a a programmer is almost always pragmatic, memorizing the patterns and greasy innards of whatever tool he or she uses daily.  On the other hand, the scientist is an explorer and finds joy in confusing him or herself by finding the universals and generalities across a range of tools.  In the end, the programmer becomes specialized in a limited domain, while the scientist knows can pick up just about anything that comes along.  And sometimes, many times, the scientist <i>makes new tools</i> for programmers to specialize on.  I want to be and am working toward being a scientist.</p>\n<p>More soon.</p>\n"

I had to make a little form in a throwaway page to trick my browser into doing the hard work.  I suppose I could make a lil utility script to do the meta character escaping more easily.  But, man, if people are already making fun of the punctuation and obfuscation possible in <i>Perl</i>, imagine what they'll say about scripts on the URL-line.  (Assuming I'm not missing reams of existing ridicule already. :) )\n</p>\n<br /><br />\n<p>\nJon does make a note of this little problem, but I'm thinking it's going to be what makes me wrap up my URL-as-command-line experiments.  What would this URL look like if it had 1 or 2 more levels of pipeline? \n</p>\n<p>\nI suppose I could, as he'd also mentioned, employ a few tricks like reducing script names and parameter names down to single characters, but then I'm sacrificing one of the virtues he'd mentioned: the human readable, self-documenting nature of URL-based services.  Well, that gets scrapped at the first layer of pipelined URL indirection with the escaping of URL meta characters.

Of course there are the non-web crossovers, like <a href=\"http://www.interconnected.org/home/more/googlematic.gif\">searching in AIM via googlematic</a>, but this mostly makes me yawn.  Yes, its fun and geeky, but yawn.  This is not to say that the Google search API itself makes me yawn.</p>\n<p>What makes me yawn is anything that's just an alternative direct user interface on the service.  Search from my IDE while I program?  Eh, that's okay, but I could do that by just spawning a browser with a cooked URL and not have to re-engineer a UI do display the results.  Display some results of a canned search in my weblog?  Eh, that's cute, but I could do that with some simple HTML scraping and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI\">SSI</a>, if I really really wanted to.  Yeah, I know the web service makes that <i>so</i>much easier, but the thing it makes easier isn't something I was really interested in the first place.  Maybe I'm not interested because I don't get it yet, or maybe it really is just a novel triviality.</p>\n<p>No, what will make my overhead lightbulb spark up are applications which involve indirection.  That is, some application which makes searches to answer some other question of mine.  Search results used to spawn further churning.  Or, search results as the result of churning.  Google's suggestions are intriguing: Auto-monitor the web for new information on a subject; Glean market research insights and trends over time; Invent a catchy online game.  But, these sound disappointingly close to a corp-speak shrug.  </p>\n<p>Not that this is unexpected or a bad thing or a statement of derision.  Their Alpha Geeks made the service available, and now its up to the world Alpha Geeks to turn it into magic.  I'm just waiting and thinking though...  the AG's are churning out all permutations of language bindings, alternative interfaces, and weavings of the service into other apps.  This is the first stage of play.  I don't know that I'll feel like playing much yet.  So I'll watch, and maybe tinker a bit, but mostly be thinking about what the next stage of play will become.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=oooohf\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090292\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://IAwiki.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=92ffcf37d534a7e60938bc270f750979&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://IAwiki.net/\">Eric Scheid</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090292\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-14T01:05:34\">2002-04-14T01:05:34</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">tracerlock?\nhttp://tracerlock.com/</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090293\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090293\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-04-15T00:45:47\">2002-04-15T00:45:47</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Okay...  Just trying to think how one might do this with the Google search API.\nForget for the moment that the \"demo\" API is limited to 10 search results.  So I make a search and download all 186,000 or however many results come up for my terms.  I store these.  A specified number of minutes later I perform the search again and download the 186,123 results that come up for my search.

Grr.</p>\n<p>I just hope it hasn&apos;t slid over the cliff yet and all these bastards finally hang themselves with all the rope they&apos;ve played out.  I still hope that there&apos;s a sleeping giant of reason out amongst the sheep.</p>\n"

Maybe in listing a few headlines over there, I can entice a few readers to my other spaces.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a> is where I do most of my general blogging, link posting, and general grousing.  (I think that&apos;s my new favorite word)  The <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a> weblog is just an experiment at this point, but it may eventually consume the whole site.</p>\n<p>Basically, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a> is competing with server-side CGIs and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI\">SSI</a>s at this point.  Eventually, they will cooperate.  After that, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a> may take over.</p>\n<p>Anyway, enjoy <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RssDisplay\">RssDisplay</a> if you like-- you can either download it, or <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PipelineTheWeb\">PipelineTheWeb</a> and use it straight from my site.</p>\n"

As a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a> user, one may add other journals to one&apos;s list and see entries in those journals aggregated together in one spot, similar to what <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a> does with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>  feeds. However, the Friends feature also allows you to see who has added you as a friend to their aggregation view. Furthermore, each Friend is a link to that person&apos;s journal and list of friends, allowing one to wander through and navigate the social network of watchers and watched.\n<br><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a> , and weblogs in general, need something as slick and explicit as this. Referral logs are too ephemeral. This is away of explicitly informing each other &quot;I am watching you, and this is who watches me.&quot;</i></blockquote><p></p>\n"

It seems awfully similar to what I want to do with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster\">WeblogMulticaster</a>, and I&apos;d even considered renaming that idea to something &quot;Router&quot; before I saw Simon&apos;s app.  One of the big differences is that my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster\">WeblogMulticaster</a> would be headless, assuming a semi-stupid <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BloggerAPI\">BloggerAPI</a> GUI program on the user&apos;s end, and taking care of all the &quot;text routing&quot; in a remote server or a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer\">DesktopWebAppServer</a> installation.  But, although rough around the edges right now, and not quite usable under <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/?topic=MacOsX\">MacOsX</a> at the moment, it might be something I&apos;ll try hacking around with first.  It&apos;s mostly a matter of where the intelligence lies: In the GUI app, or in a desktop server ala <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserland\">RadioUserland</a>.\n<br><br>\nAnyway, to bring this babble to a close and full circle:  I&apos;m thinking of starting my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer\">DesktopWebAppServer</a> project as a sort of alongside companion for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserland\">RadioUserland</a>.  I <i>could</i> implement probably all of these things within Radio in <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/UserTalk?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">UserTalk</font></span> &amp; etc, but I don&apos;t like it.  I&apos;m liking <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Python\">Python</a> much better lately.\n<br><br>\nSo, it would start out as a companion, and then maybe eventually be a full replacement and competitor for Radio.  Maybe.  Then again, I might be just lazy enough to decide to stick to complementing and not replacing Radio features, especially after I bought it.  So Radio can post to a the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster\">WeblogMulticaster</a> in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer\">DesktopWebAppServer</a> project with the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BloggerAPI\">BloggerAPI</a>, and then the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster\">WeblogMulticaster</a> can take it from there.\n<br><br>\nOh and finally, where I want to go with the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster\">WeblogMulticaster</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\">XmlRpcToWiki</a> is to filter weblog entries through whatever wiki engine I&apos;m using.  For example:  You see all the links in this blog entry?  Done by hand.  Yes I&apos;m that nuts.  Mostly, I just wanted to be thorough in connecting this entry with the wiki on the site and to see how difficult it would be.  This motivates me to make a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster\">WeblogMulticaster</a> that talks to the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\">XmlRpcToWiki</a>.  For a current discussion on this sort of weblog/wiki integration I want, look here: <a href=\"http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiLog\">MeatballWiki:WikiLog</a>.\n<br><br>\nAlright...  back to work.</p>\n"
