Need to think how to make this space more interesting.\n<br /><br />\nPart of what has been holding me back is the interface.  I&#39;m used to the style of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a>, where I have a little ubiquitous client that I pop open, jot some notes as fast as I can type, and hit &quot;Post&quot;.  Here, with Movable Type, things seem a little more sluggish and raises the posting threshold just vaguely above my laziness factor.\n<br /><br />\nBut I can&#39;t quite get why.  I have a bookmarklet that seems just as easy to use as the LJ client.  I also have the Blogger API on MT to use, should I want to use one of those clients.  Hmm.\n<br /><br />\nI&#39;m also holding out a bit for the tools I&#39;ve been working on to tie my writing to my wiki.  Rather than merge the wiki and the weblog, I&#39;m working on putting the wiki into my textarea.\n<br /><br />\nHolding out is what kept me from putting this site up for years, though.\n<br /><br />\nI need to start blogging in the moment, and keep it flowing.  Even if no one&#39;s really listening yet.\n<br /><br />\nThe other thing is that I&#39;m messing with this division between this space an my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a>.  One&#39;s personal and the other is...  not personal?  This space at 0xDECAFBAD is just as personal to me, only it&#39;s less interesting to my normal group of friends over on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a>.  Seems like there needs to be a bit of a division, but maybe not the gulf between two entire sites&#39; worth of distance.\n<br /><br />\nSeems like I need a categorized UBERblog where <i>all</i> of my weblogging goes, with specialized feeds branched off from it.

Seems like I need to get a category-to-metaBlogger API tool working in Radio, along with a metaBlogger-to-LJ bridge working.\n<br /><br />\nUntil then, I just need to keep making a point to babble in here.
