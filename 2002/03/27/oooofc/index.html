My Radio weblog is sitting over here if you want to tune me in, and an explanation of the madness is over here.3/27/02; 1:25:43 AM by LMO   This is pretty swanky.  Swanky indeed.  Instant messaging meets outlining.  It seems that it&#39;s not quite there yet, but I understand that&#39;s not what this beta is about.     But as a beta, this is a swanky mind bomb indeed.  Especially if, as Dave says, we start to see who&#39;s watching whom in outliner land.  This is what I want for all the weblogs.  Hot hot hot.   Now maybe I can get off my butt and work on Arboretum some more and get it in on this action.  From what Dave&#39;s saying, anyone who can speak OPML (and I assume maybe XML-RPC and maybe Jabber) can play.3/27/02; 1:37:05 AM by LMO   Of course, one other thing:  Why didn&#39;t I pay attention to Frontier and UserLand sooner?  :)  This is what I&#39;ve been trying to make with Perl, ?MySQL and friends for years now.3/27/02; 1:57:32 AM by LMO   I really should be in bed by now, but I&#39;m subscribing to outlines like a madman:      Dave Winer, Scott Loftness, John Robb, Laurence Lee, Jake Savin, David Brown, masukomi, David Davies, and Jeremy Bowers   I&#39;m also thinking that there&#39;s some kind of unholy symmetry between me @ decafbad.com, my obsession with coffee, Dave @ userland.com, his affinity for coffee-- and of course, insomnia stemming from the fact that what you&#39;re doing at the moment is so much more fun than sleep." />
