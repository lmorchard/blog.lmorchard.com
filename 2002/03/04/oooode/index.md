Hmm.  I've mused about replacing Movable Type with Slashcode and going in one direction on the web app dynamicity scale.  What about replacing MT with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand">RadioUserLand</a>?
<br /><br />
Might think about that some more.  One thing is that it'd probably doom any multi-denizen wistful thinking I have about 0xDECAFBAD since Radio <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand">UserLand</a> is a one-person blogging machine.
<br /><br />
Or, I could just accept that MT does pretty much what I need.  I just want to get this weblog included in on some of the tracking features Radio offers.  Hmm.
