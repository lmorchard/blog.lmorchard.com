Oh yeah, and another new project idea:  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournalFriendsReplacement">LiveJournalFriendsReplacement</a><blockquote><i>One of the best features of <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> are Friends. As a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> user, one may add other journals to one's list and see entries in those journals aggregated together in one spot, similar to what <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand">RadioUserLand</a> does with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a>  feeds. However, the Friends feature also allows you to see who has added you as a friend to their aggregation view. Furthermore, each Friend is a link to that person's journal and list of friends, allowing one to wander through and navigate the social network of watchers and watched.
<br /><br />
<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand">RadioUserLand</a> , and weblogs in general, need something as slick and explicit as this. Referral logs are too ephemeral. This is away of explicitly informing each other "I am watching you, and this is who watches me."</i></blockquote>
