  <meta property="og:description" content="This was easier than I thought it would be:  XmlRpcFilterService  Basically, this is my first application of the XmlRpcFilteringPipe.  On the MacOsX side of things, I implemented a quick standalone service using Marcus Muller&amp;apos;s XMLRPC Obj-C framework.  On the filter side of things at 0xDECAFBAD, I added the filter methods to my XmlRpcToWiki interface I have running on the DecafbadWiki.  So, now there&amp;apos;s a filter named &amp;apos;wiki&amp;apos; on the DecafbadWiki that I call with the XmlRpcFilterService under MacOsX.  The nutshell version of this is:  I write something somewhere, select some of it, click &quot;Appname -&gt; Services -&gt; XmlRpcFilterService -&gt; Apply to Selection&quot; in my menu (or use the hot key), and the selected text is filtered through my remote wiki to pick up links and filtering.

Anyway, it still needs a bit of work to make it more generally useful.  It needs some preference panes to change and construct the filter pipe, support multiple pipes, and I need to bundle the XmlRpc frameworks up in the app for easy installation (or switch to Apple&amp;apos;s built-in XmlRpc API).  But the point is, it took me all of 2 hours between server and client side work to get this working, and it&amp;apos;s already useful for me.  I&amp;apos;ll see soon if the sudden population of links in all of my communication from my laptop annoys anyone.  :)  This is one solution for a WeblogWithWiki, but I still want to play around with making the WeblogMulticaster and enabling it to use XmlRpcFilteringPipes also.
