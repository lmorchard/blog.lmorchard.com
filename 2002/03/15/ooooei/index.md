Here's something I think could really benefit as an <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki">XmlRpcToWiki</a> client: <a href="http://www.touchgraph.com/">TouchGraph</a>
<br /><br />
I have it running right now on my Windows machine, playing around with navigating <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MeatballWiki">MeatballWiki</a>, seeing the linkage connections that up until now I'd only seen in my head.  It's really great to see them layed out in front of me, and to see them shift and expand an explode as I traverse from node to node.  This is cool tech.
<br /><br />
The <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki">XmlRpcToWiki</a> connection comes in where this app uses some "low tech" methods.  The <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc">XmlRpc</a> interface explicitly defines getAllPages() and getPageLinks() methods that would be perfect for this app.
