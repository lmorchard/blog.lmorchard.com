  <meta property="og:description" content="So..  What have I been working on?  Well, XmlRpcFilteringPipes via RUPipeFilters in RadioUserLand.  I&amp;apos;m soaking in it right now.  So far, the text I&amp;apos;m writing will be piped through my local RadioUserLand instance, with filters on the built-in glossary and macro system.  After that, I send my content out for a trip through the DecafbadWiki to pick up a few links from there.For example, these should be some wiki links:  BootToTheHead, ?EnlightenedSelfinterest, WebChanges, WebIndexThis should be the time via the statement clock.now(): 3/26/02; 5:46:22 PMThis should be a link to something truly evil from the bowels of my RadioUserLand glossary: Dancing HamstersI&amp;apos;ve got the whole shebang working in RadioUserLand right now.  The only thing keeping me back from a release is building a friendly-ish web interface on managing pipelines.  Maybe I should say screw it to that for now and just release it.  It&amp;apos;s useful right now, and managing pipelines is a matter of editing the preferences database, which is a breeze for early adopters.  There are even convenience methods to do it with.  And in-the-moment usage of the system is easy:  select your text, copy it into the clipboard, bring up Radio&amp;apos;s tray or dock menu, pick Pipefilters-&gt;Apply Pipeline to Clipboard, and away you go.Maybe I&amp;apos;ll do this tonight.  I think it&amp;apos;s incredibly useful, and odds are someone else will too.  Update @ 2:14am:  Ooh, Dave linked to me.  He called me weird.  This makes me blush.  If you&amp;apos;re looking for the goods of which I speak, try coming back in about 8-10 hours.  I&amp;apos;ve gotten sucked into playing with Dave&amp;apos;s Instant Outlining bomb drop and have forgotten about packaging and uploading my own.  Funny how I&amp;apos;d just posted a message to the radio-dev mailing list, jokingly demanding his goods.  I go to dinner with my girlfriend, come back to find that he  came through with it.  I&amp;apos;m going to bed now, the alarm clock rings too soon. " />
