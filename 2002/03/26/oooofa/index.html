        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Haven&amp;apos;t managed to keep blogging here much, though I have been quite busy.  Need to think how to make this space more interesting.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Part of what has been holding me back is the interface.  I&amp;apos;m used to the style of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal&quot;&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt;, where I have a little ubiquitous client that I pop open, jot some notes as fast as I can type, and hit &amp;quot;Post&amp;quot;.  Here, with Movable Type, things seem a little more sluggish and raises the posting threshold just vaguely above my laziness factor.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But I can&amp;apos;t quite get why.  I have a bookmarklet that seems just as easy to use as the LJ client.  I also have the Blogger API on MT to use, should I want to use one of those clients.  Hmm.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;apos;m also holding out a bit for the tools I&amp;apos;ve been working on to tie my writing to my wiki.  Rather than merge the wiki and the weblog, I&amp;apos;m working on putting the wiki into my textarea.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Holding out is what kept me from putting this site up for years, though.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I need to start blogging in the moment, and keep it flowing.  Even if no one&amp;apos;s really listening yet.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The other thing is that I&amp;apos;m messing with this division between this space an my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal&quot;&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt;.  One&amp;apos;s personal and the other is...  not personal?  This space at 0xDECAFBAD is just as personal to me, only it&amp;apos;s less interesting to my normal group of friends over on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal&quot;&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt;.  Seems like there needs to be a bit of a division, but maybe not the gulf between two entire sites&amp;apos; worth of distance.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Seems like I need a categorized UBERblog where &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of my weblogging goes, with specialized feeds branched off from it.  Seems to me that this is where Radio &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/a&gt; could come in, but I need some more tools to make it happen.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You see, although I want an uber-blog with categories, I don&amp;apos;t want to leave my &amp;quot;legacy&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal&quot;&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt;, so I&amp;apos;d like to turn it into a mirror of a category, maybe with abbreviated notices of postings in other categories.  Seems like I need to get a category-to-metaBlogger API tool working in Radio, along with a metaBlogger-to-LJ bridge working.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Until then, I just need to keep making a point to babble in here.  It&amp;apos;s not as if I don&amp;apos;t have things to say from moment to moment.&lt;/p&gt;
