        <meta property="og:description" content="Haven&#39;t managed to keep blogging here much, though I have been quite busy.  Need to think how to make this space more interesting.
Part of what has been holding me back is the interface.  I&#39;m used to the style of LiveJournal, where I have a little ubiquitous client that I pop open, jot some notes as fast as I can type, and hit &quot;Post&quot;.  Here, with Movable Type, things seem a little more sluggish and raises the posting threshold just vaguely above my laziness factor.
But I can&#39;t quite get why.  I have a bookmarklet that seems just as easy to use as the LJ client.  I also have the Blogger API on MT to use, should I want to use one of those clients.  Hmm.
I&#39;m also holding out a bit for the tools I&#39;ve been working on to tie my writing to my wiki.  Rather than merge the wiki and the weblog, I&#39;m working on putting the wiki into my textarea.
Holding out is what kept me from putting this site up for years, though.
I need to start blogging in the moment, and keep it flowing.  Even if no one&#39;s really listening yet.
The other thing is that I&#39;m messing with this division between this space an my LiveJournal.  One&#39;s personal and the other is...  not personal?  This space at 0xDECAFBAD is just as personal to me, only it&#39;s less interesting to my normal group of friends over on LiveJournal.  Seems like there needs to be a bit of a division, but maybe not the gulf between two entire sites&#39; worth of distance.
Seems like I need a categorized UBERblog where all of my weblogging goes, with specialized feeds branched off from it.  Seems to me that this is where Radio UserLand could come in, but I need some more tools to make it happen.
You see, although I want an uber-blog with categories, I don&#39;t want to leave my &quot;legacy&quot; LiveJournal, so I&#39;d like to turn it into a mirror of a category, maybe with abbreviated notices of postings in other categories.  Seems like I need to get a category-to-metaBlogger API tool working in Radio, along with a metaBlogger-to-LJ bridge working.
Until then, I just need to keep making a point to babble in here.  It&#39;s not as if I don&#39;t have things to say from moment to moment." />
