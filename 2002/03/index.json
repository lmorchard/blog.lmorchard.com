Here, with Movable Type, things seem a little more sluggish and raises the posting threshold just vaguely above my laziness factor.\n<br><br>\nBut I can&apos;t quite get why.  I have a bookmarklet that seems just as easy to use as the LJ client.  I also have the Blogger API on MT to use, should I want to use one of those clients.  Hmm.\n<br><br>\nI&apos;m also holding out a bit for the tools I&apos;ve been working on to tie my writing to my wiki.  Rather than merge the wiki and the weblog, I&apos;m working on putting the wiki into my textarea.\n<br><br>\nHolding out is what kept me from putting this site up for years, though.\n<br><br>\nI need to start blogging in the moment, and keep it flowing.  Even if no one&apos;s really listening yet.\n<br><br>\nThe other thing is that I&apos;m messing with this division between this space an my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a>.  One&apos;s personal and the other is...  not personal?  This space at 0xDECAFBAD is just as personal to me, only it&apos;s less interesting to my normal group of friends over on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a>.  Seems like there needs to be a bit of a division, but maybe not the gulf between two entire sites&apos; worth of distance.\n<br><br>\nSeems like I need a categorized UBERblog where <i>all</i> of my weblogging goes, with specialized feeds branched off from it.  Seems to me that this is where Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> could come in, but I need some more tools to make it happen.\n<br><br>\nYou see, although I want an uber-blog with categories, I don&apos;t want to leave my &quot;legacy&quot; <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a>, so I&apos;d like to turn it into a mirror of a category, maybe with abbreviated notices of postings in other categories.  Seems like I need to get a category-to-metaBlogger API tool working in Radio, along with a metaBlogger-to-LJ bridge working.\n<br><br>\nUntil then, I just need to keep making a point to babble in here.  It&apos;s not as if I don&apos;t have things to say from moment to moment.</p>\n",

    "html": "<p>This was easier than I thought it would be:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilterService\">XmlRpcFilterService</a>\n<br /><br />\nBasically, this is my first application of the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XmlRpcFilteringPipe</a>.  On the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOsX\">MacOsX</a> side of things, I implemented a quick standalone service using <a href=\"http://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/software/XMLRPC/\" target=\"_top\">Marcus Muller&#39;s XMLRPC Obj-C framework</a>.  On the filter side of things at 0xDECAFBAD, I added the filter methods to my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\">XmlRpcToWiki</a> interface I have running on the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DecafbadWiki\">DecafbadWiki</a>.  So, now there&#39;s a filter named &#39;wiki&#39; on the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DecafbadWiki\">DecafbadWiki</a> that I call with the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilterService\">XmlRpcFilterService</a> under <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOsX\">MacOsX</a>.\n<br /><br />\nThe nutshell version of this is:  I write something somewhere, select some of it, click &quot;Appname -&gt; Services -&gt; <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilterService\">XmlRpcFilterService</a> -&gt; Apply to Selection&quot; in my menu (or use the hot key), and the selected text is filtered through my remote wiki to pick up links and filtering.  In the context of a weblog entry, this means that what I write in the weblog is now bound to the wiki.  Hell, I can even make my postings to message boards and replies to email pick up links to my wiki.  Now that I think of this, I might want to have a selection of an alternate rendering for email, where the links appear at the end of the message as footnotes.\n<br /><br />\nAnyway, it still needs a bit of work to make it more generally useful.  It needs some preference panes to change and construct the filter pipe, support multiple pipes, and I need to bundle the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> frameworks up in the app for easy installation (or switch to Apple&#39;s built-in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> API).  But the point is, it took me all of 2 hours between server and client side work to get this working, and it&#39;s already useful for me.  I&#39;ll see soon if the sudden population of links in all of my communication from my laptop annoys anyone.  :)\n<br /><br />\nThis is one solution for a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a>, but I still want to play around with making the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster\">WeblogMulticaster</a> and enabling it to use <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XmlRpcFilteringPipes</a> also.\n<br /><br />\nAnd, somewhere, this figures into <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a>.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ooooee</p>\n",
