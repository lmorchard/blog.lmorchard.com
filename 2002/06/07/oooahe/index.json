So how about we set a standard by which bots can autodiscover your weblog, home page, whatever:<ol><li>If you don't care to put up a special page to point to as your referer when aggregating news, then point a URL somewhere, anywhere, but include a URL to your weblog in a query parameter named \"userWeblog\".  This covers an already de facto standard set by Radio.</li><li>If you <i>do</i> care to set up an acknowledgement page for your readers, include a LINK tag in the page's HEAD pointing to the home page of your site as the table of contents: <code><LINK HREF=\"http://www.decafbad.com\" REL=\"contents\"></code></li></ol>In this way, rock bangers cobbling together their own blog spiders can tell them where to go and for what to look.

I think it should be put on <i>all</i> of your weblog pages.  Especially as I start thinking more about revisiting referers: A LINK back to your weblog home as the table of contents would allow me to maybe enrich my backlinks, especially knowing where your site root is.
