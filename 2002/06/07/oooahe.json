If all the toolkits out there\nwould use it that would be good for us rock bangers.\n\nI agree on the LINK tag being on every page also. I&#39;m gonna\ngo ahead and add it to all my templates as well.\n\nOf course if a site is already using a LINK tag, then your\nagent could always pull the feed, then get the site link\ndirectly from that. This of course is only good for those\nsites that do use the LINK tag and have it on all there\npages.\n\nOver all I think its a great idea enriching the weblog community.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083052&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.10500bc.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2a158ec6895b9af4ce255febfe69ffee&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.10500bc.org&quot;&gt;Josh Cooper&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083052&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-06-07T14:42:02&quot;&gt;2002-06-07T14:42:02&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;doh! I was in a dreamland when i made the 3 statement. That has nothing todo with what your trying to solve just another problem, you still have to know where the referer is coming from. first.
