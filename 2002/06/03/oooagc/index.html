<div class="content">Just passing through and noticed this entry. I&#39;m actually in the middle of looking for a small camera as well for everyday pocket use (and for a photoblog). I already have a nice digital camera, but it&#39;s to obtrusive to take everywhere all the time, it&#39;s more for planned photo ops. One of the cameras I&#39;ve looked at online is the Benq 300mini. Only problem is the memory limitations. I&#39;m more looking for a small camera with expandable memory. Please keep us posted on your search, I&#39;m very interested.</div>
