I love it now, but when I was learning it I found myself struggling a bit. The key is to learn some functional programming (maybe using Lisp or Haskell) and then everything will become much clearer. If you don&#39;t have any previous experience of functional programming then XSLT will seem strange and difficult. It&#39;s just a matter of getting that experience and learning to think like a functional programmer.\n\nThe reason why you shouldn&#39;t use a scripting language such as Perl or Python is that XSLT handles XML really nicely, and scripting languages tend not to handle it so well. The reason you shouldn&#39;t use a template system is that none of them will be as powerful. I&#39;m currently writing a blogging tool and (for obscure reasons) I&#39;m restricting myself to Perl and using the HTML::Template module, so I have first-hand experience of both of these problems. I keep on wishing I could switch to XSLT.\n\nAs for using two-stage recursive algorithms, that&#39;s wizardry that you don&#39;t need to worry about right now. If you want the sum of a list of numbers, just use a simple recursive algorithm. Only think about alternative methods when you run into a problem with the simple method.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
