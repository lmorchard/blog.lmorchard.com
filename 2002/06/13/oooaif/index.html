Also, Adam &lt;a href=&quot;http://ipwebdev.com/radio/2002/06/11.php#a193&quot;&gt;wants to take the aggregator&lt;/a&gt; even further: &amp;quot;...I think the entire computer interface should be overhauled to be more aggregator like, events streaming by.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along these lines, has anyone played with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scopeware.com/products/prod_overview.html&quot;&gt;Scopeware&lt;/a&gt;, built from the research of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edge.org/3rd_cluture/bios/gelernter.html&quot;&gt;David Gelernter&lt;/a&gt;?    I think it used to be called &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acm.org/sigchi/chi96/proceedings/videos/Fertig/etf.htm&quot;&gt;Lifestreams&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; before it was made into a product.  I first heard of this work back when I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/046504316X/0xdecafbad-20&quot;&gt;Machine Beauty : Elegance and the Heart of Technology&lt;/a&gt;, and was very interested but haven&amp;apos;t seen anything other than screenshots and mock-ups.  From what I can tell, this interface is literally &amp;quot;events [and documents] streaming by&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little I&amp;apos;ve picked up from Gelernter&amp;apos;s work, along with a few other influences (ie. David Brin&amp;apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055329024X/0xdecafbad-20&quot;&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;), has really stuck the picture in my head of how I want my future info-sieve to work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with all of this, something else I was vaguely considering adding to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000187.phtml#000187&quot;&gt;AmphetaDesk outliner skin&lt;/a&gt; was an IFRAME attached to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; items under a collapsed node.  When the node gets expanded, the IFRAME is loaded up with the item&amp;apos;s link.  The notion is that you do all your browsing from your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds in a single window and within the same context.  Neat idea, I think, giving a hook to pull more information into the aggregator upon request.  But of course if I do it, it&amp;apos;ll likely be messy as hell for a zillion obvious reasons and catch my iBook on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably have more to ramble on about this later, but it&amp;apos;s time for the first meeting of the day...&lt;/p&gt;
