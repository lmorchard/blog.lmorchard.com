Also, Adam wants to take the aggregator even further: &quot;...I think the entire computer interface should be overhauled to be more aggregator like, events streaming by.&quot;
Along these lines, has anyone played with Scopeware, built from the research of David Gelernter?    I think it used to be called &quot;Lifestreams&quot; before it was made into a product.  I first heard of this work back when I read Machine Beauty : Elegance and the Heart of Technology, and was very interested but haven&#39;t seen anything other than screenshots and mock-ups.  From what I can tell, this interface is literally &quot;events [and documents] streaming by&quot;.
The little I&#39;ve picked up from Gelernter&#39;s work, along with a few other influences (ie. David Brin&#39;s Earth), has really stuck the picture in my head of how I want my future info-sieve to work.  
Along with all of this, something else I was vaguely considering adding to my AmphetaDesk outliner skin was an IFRAME attached to RSS items under a collapsed node.  When the node gets expanded, the IFRAME is loaded up with the item&#39;s link.  The notion is that you do all your browsing from your RSS feeds in a single window and within the same context.  Neat idea, I think, giving a hook to pull more information into the aggregator upon request.  But of course if I do it, it&#39;ll likely be messy as hell for a zillion obvious reasons and catch my iBook on fire.
Probably have more to ramble on about this later, but it&#39;s time for the first meeting of the day..." />
