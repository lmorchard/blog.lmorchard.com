I simplified my database a bit, collapsing multiple rows into single rows with a hit count column.  Also squashed a few stupid bugs that had cropped up in the Great Site Move a month or so ago.  Realized that the counts were insanely wrong, sometimes showing a count as high as 15 for a post that might have only 3 back links. Likely the referers in RSS will be of interest only to me as I obsessively watch my site (though I do subscribe to Disenchanted&amp;apos;s Recent Inbound, since it gives me a stream of new sites to visit).  But, the RSS feed readers list is a few steps closer to the friends-of list I want to move from LiveJournal out into the blogosphere proper.   One of the next things I want to do is start cobbling a fairly modular &amp; general URL investigator - that is, give it a url, and have it try to track down title, author, contents page, RSS feed, location, and any other metadata that comes up.  I could then use this to flesh out all the links everywhere, from backlinks to the friends-of list.  Basically what many other people have been doing for different semantic aspects, but all rolled into one agent. Along with that, I want to implement some manual annotation of sites known by my site.  Thinking that, between per-post backlinks and RSS reader links, I could eventually build a decent database of metadata here.  With that, all kinds of nifty things could happen... Okay, time for bed.  Starting to ramble, or at least be tempted to do so. " />

<div class="content">Heh, it&#39;s really amazing to see how a series of really simple scripts and templates leads to all sorts of unexpected associations.  The aggregator is indeed becoming much of what exists in Digital Dashboard sort of implementations.</div>
