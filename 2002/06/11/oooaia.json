Some ideas:\n</code></pre><ol>\n<li><p>desktop aggregators should support keyword lists (much like Meerkat), so that the aggregator can get an idea of what is of interest to you.  Articles with these keywords could be highlighted in some fashion.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>the &quot;age&quot; of the item should not necessarily determine its visibility (be it a 0/1 or something in between).  It should only influence.  Other factors could include user interaction with the article (has the articlebeen viewed?  has the user told the aggregator they no longer want to see the article, etc).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Articles should not necessarily be groups by channel.  This obstacle might be the most complex to solve. A more logical order of grouping needs to be found.</div></p>\n<pre><code> &lt;/li&gt;\n\n &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221090346&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n         &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n             &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0100364/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=132c3a4bf4f5de9b8beea0c21a0ba088&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n             &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0100364/&quot;&gt;Eric Maynard&lt;/a&gt;\n         &lt;/div&gt;\n         &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221090346&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-06-19T10:30:52&quot;&gt;2002-06-19T10:30:52&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n     &lt;/div&gt;\n     &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Ok, granted it&#39;s not a desktop application, but NewsIsFree.com does offer much of the functionality that is being discussed here relative to aggregators.\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In fact, in my opinion, the only feature of existing desktop aggregators missing from NewsIsFree is the ability to add your own feeds.</p>\n<p>Keyword searching exists, but it&#39;s not automated as such.
