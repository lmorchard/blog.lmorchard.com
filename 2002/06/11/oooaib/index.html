The spam is just getting heavier, raunchier, and less coherent these days.  I&amp;apos;d &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000129.shtml&quot;&gt;mused about it&lt;/a&gt; awhile ago, along with looking at an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/12/rubyrdf/util/foafwhite/intro.html&quot;&gt;application of &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt; to share whitelists between trusted people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.osopinion.com/perl/story/18180.html&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; up at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.osopinion.com&quot;&gt;osOpinion.com&lt;/a&gt; on the subject (calling it &amp;quot;reverse filtering&amp;quot;).  I hadn&amp;apos;t thought of it before, but I could probably set up a quick auto-responder for unknown addresses, asking politely for a response requiring human thought, or a click by a person at a URL somewhere, to get them auto-added to my whitelist.  If the laziness/rudeness factor toward friends and acquaintences, current and potential, doesn&amp;apos;t outweight the benefits, this might be a very good solution.  I wouldn&amp;apos;t throw mail away outright, but it would be put in a rotating bin that I might look at every day or so, and wipe every week or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That osOpinion.com article wraps up with a little bit of a carrot / challenge to for a business plan around a whitelist / reverse-filtering scheme for mail.  I wonder how much people &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; pay for it, and whether people would be put off by an auto-response asking for proof of humanity?  If it would go over well, I&amp;apos;d love to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pobox.com&quot;&gt;pobox.com&lt;/a&gt; implement something like this.  (Oh have I ever mentioned that I love &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pobox.com&quot;&gt;pobox.com&lt;/a&gt;, and think you should all sign up there?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, this seems pretty amusing to me.  Humans sending robots to mail humans.  Humans setting up robots to intercept robots.  Humans sending mail to humans again.  Oh I&amp;apos;m sure the spammers will try harder with their robots, but eventually the bastards just have to give up.  Maybe not.  But at least I can ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;
