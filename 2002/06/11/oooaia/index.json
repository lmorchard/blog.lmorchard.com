First thing:  I think this is an unfortunately limited definition.  It specifies the particular interface by which <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Radio</a> presents information.  And, as a comment on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000187.phtml\">one of my first experments</a> in tweaking <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\">AmphetaDesk</a>'s interface attests (no author link):<blockquote><i>I've been wanting to use an aggregator since I first heard of them (RU7) but have always felt that because poor information architecture/presentation they tended to make tracking a large number of sites harder rather than easier.</i></blockquote>I didn't expect my first attempt to be called \"Brilliant! Lovely! Perfect!\", but I did think that I was on to something.  Simply displaying the new bits in reverse-chronological order is too limiting - it's only one attempted solution at the problem of aggregation.  My solution isn't an ultimate one either.  </p>\n<p>Aggregators desperately need to grow toward more flexibility and scan-ability.  A few things I'd really like to see addressed:<ul><li>De-emphasis of seen &amp; older items from sites, but not complete hiding.  Context between entries on weblogs is important.</li><li>Optional grouping of items from the same or similar weblogs.  Context between entries, and between blogs is important.</li><li>Emphasis of newer items, tracking the time line and signalling attention to changes.

I've tried to do a few of these things with my tweak to Ampheta: varied (hopefully not obtrusive) font size &amp; weight, dependant on item age; maintaining grouping and order of items within <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds; showing enough information for a visual scan, hiding further details, but making details available within a click or two (I love outlines).
