<p>Checking my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feeds, I see <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">MovableType 2.2</a> has been released, and it comes with support for a feature called <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/">TrackBack</a>.  Too sleepy to fully investigate and play right now, but it looks like another very cool push toward interconnectivity between blogs.</p>
