Though I haven't dug into the workings yet, I assume that this is how <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a>-enabled pages discover info about pages from which they've been pinged.  </p>\n<p>What would be nice is if the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> also identifies itself as <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> info.
