  <meta property="og:description" content="So I broke down finally, and bought a digital camera.  The excuse ends up being that I&amp;apos;ll be needing it on my trip to Toronto this weekend.  I got a Canon ?PowerShot S200, a 128MB CF card, the belt case, and two extra batteries.  That should be enough to cover a rampant nerd photography spree. I love this little thing, and I&amp;apos;ve been going insane with it.  After some twiddling and organizing in iPhoto, I uploaded a metric ton of photos and grabbed Gallery from ?SourceForge to show them off in the new 0xDECAFBAD Gallery.  Then, I stuck a lil PHP block that rotates random thumbnail images from the gallery into my busy and crowded right-side bar.  I can hear the woefully overburdened design of this site creaking and about to fall over.  So, next project in  a week or two is to tear this place apart and make it a bit easier on the eyes. That is, after I take a few hundred more pictures.  Been thinking of joining one of those online DP clubs to play around in a photo scavenger hunt. More soon. " />
