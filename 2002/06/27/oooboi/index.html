        <meta property="og:description" content="Though I&#39;m far, far from being an &quot;artiste&quot; of a photographer, I want to do neat things with my camera.  I want to capture some moments, some feelings, try some odd things.  It&#39;s like hacking with light.  I see the kinds of things done with the Lomo cameras, warm and in-the-moment images.  Sometimes they&#39;re blurry, but that just lends them a rough handmade voice.  I read the 10 Golden Rules of Lomography and think, yeah, that&#39;s what I want to do with this new gadget.    But I hope that the lens and the digital doesn&#39;t kill too much of the warmth.  There&#39;s a certain style that the Lomo gives to things that I doubt my gadget will get, but I want to capture the moments now that I have something small enough to be omnipresent with me.
Hopefully this doesn&#39;t just degrade into 101 pictures of my cats. :)  We&#39;ll see." />
