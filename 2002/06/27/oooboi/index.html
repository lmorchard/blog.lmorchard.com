  <meta property="og:description" content="Though I&amp;apos;m far, far from being an &quot;artiste&quot; of a photographer, I want to do neat things with my camera.  I want to capture some moments, some feelings, try some odd things.  It&amp;apos;s like hacking with light.  I see the kinds of things done with the Lomo cameras, warm and in-the-moment images.  Sometimes they&amp;apos;re blurry, but that just lends them a rough handmade voice.  I read the 10 Golden Rules of Lomography and think, yeah, that&amp;apos;s what I want to do with this new gadget.    But I hope that the lens and the digital doesn&amp;apos;t kill too much of the warmth.  There&amp;apos;s a certain style that the Lomo gives to things that I doubt my gadget will get, but I want to capture the moments now that I have something small enough to be omnipresent with me. Hopefully this doesn&amp;apos;t just degrade into 101 pictures of my cats. :)  We&amp;apos;ll see. " />
