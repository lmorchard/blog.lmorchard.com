I want to capture some moments, some feelings, try some odd things.  It's like hacking with light.  I see the kinds of things done with the <a href=\"http://www.lomography.com\">Lomo cameras</a>, warm and in-the-moment images.  Sometimes they're blurry, but that just lends them a rough handmade voice.  I read the <a href=\"http://www1.lomography.com/0001/about/lomopop3.htm\">10 Golden Rules of Lomography</a> and think, yeah, that's what I want to do with this new gadget.
