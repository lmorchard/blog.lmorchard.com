<p>From the recently-returned <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/06/22#smoking">Dave</a>:<blockquote><i>I am now an ex-smoker. I want to say that in public. Of course I still really want to smoke.</i></blockquote>Me too, since January 2002.  As Dave explains, I too had a very deep, integral place in my problem solving process for a cigarette.  I also had a spot for a cigarette in my avoiding-violence-against-coworkers process.  But, many panic attacks and insanity-verge moments later, I think I'm doing quite well.  I have started strangulating more co-workers, but my problem solving skills have become mroe productive.</p>
