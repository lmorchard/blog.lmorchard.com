    "summary": "<p>Cool, looks like <a href=\"http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/\">TrackBack</a> is working and starting to catch on this morning.  I caught a <a href=\"http://philringnalda.com/archives/002248.php\">nice compliment</a> about my mutant <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000187.phtml#000187\">outline skin for </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>.  Must get back around to the next iteration of that thing, add some polish and some new features.</p>\n<p>As for the MT upgrade from last night... looks like it nuked my post categories.  Grr.  That kind of blows chunks.  Might have to see what that&apos;s all about, since I sagely backed everything up first.  Another thing is that I&apos;d like to look more into this <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> feature and the concept of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> URLs and pings.  Namely:  It&apos;s a pain in the ass to cut &amp; paste the TB URL, and the bookmarklet hasn&apos;t worked for me yet.  </p>\n<p>I notice that there&apos;s some <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> embedded in my posts now, describing the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> link.  Unfortunately, I don&apos;t see where the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> explains that it is, in fact, about a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> link.  Though I haven&apos;t dug into the workings yet, I assume that this is how <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a>-enabled pages discover info about pages from which they&apos;ve been pinged.  </p>\n<p>What would be nice is if the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> also identifies itself as <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> info.  This way, I could hack <i>my</i> Movable Type to pluck URLs out of a post I&apos;m publishing, go take a visit to each URL and try to harvest the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a>, and then automatically discover the ping URL and ping it.  All I&apos;d need to do to activate the process is include a link to a page elsewhere that contains <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> hints on how/where to ping.</p>\n<p>Always looking to get more for less effort.  :)</p>\n"

If you don't have any previous experience of functional programming then XSLT will seem strange and difficult. It's just a matter of getting that experience and learning to think like a functional programmer.\nThe reason why you shouldn't use a scripting language such as Perl or Python is that XSLT handles XML really nicely, and scripting languages tend not to handle it so well. The reason you shouldn't use a template system is that none of them will be as powerful. I'm currently writing a blogging tool and (for obscure reasons) I'm restricting myself to Perl and using the HTML::Template module, so I have first-hand experience of both of these problems. I keep on wishing I could switch to XSLT.\nAs for using two-stage recursive algorithms, that's wizardry that you don't need to worry about right now. If you want the sum of a list of numbers, just use a simple recursive algorithm. Only think about alternative methods when you run into a problem with the simple method.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

    "html": "<p>Another thing to think about again: <a href=\"http://impressive.net/people/gerald/2000/12/spam-filtering.html\">Whitelist-based spam filtering</a>.  The spam is just getting heavier, raunchier, and less coherent these days.  I'd <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000129.shtml\">mused about it</a> awhile ago, along with looking at an <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/12/rubyrdf/util/foafwhite/intro.html\">application of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a></a> to share whitelists between trusted people.</p>\n<p>Then I see <a href=\"http://www.osopinion.com/perl/story/18180.html\">this article</a> up at <a href=\"http://www.osopinion.com\">osOpinion.com</a> on the subject (calling it \"reverse filtering\").  I hadn't thought of it before, but I could probably set up a quick auto-responder for unknown addresses, asking politely for a response requiring human thought, or a click by a person at a URL somewhere, to get them auto-added to my whitelist.  If the laziness/rudeness factor toward friends and acquaintences, current and potential, doesn't outweight the benefits, this might be a very good solution.  I wouldn't throw mail away outright, but it would be put in a rotating bin that I might look at every day or so, and wipe every week or so.</p>\n<p>That osOpinion.com article wraps up with a little bit of a carrot / challenge to for a business plan around a whitelist / reverse-filtering scheme for mail.  I wonder how much people <i>would</i> pay for it, and whether people would be put off by an auto-response asking for proof of humanity?

First thing:  I think this is an unfortunately limited definition.  It specifies the particular interface by which <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Radio</a> presents information.  And, as a comment on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000187.phtml\">one of my first experments</a> in tweaking <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\">AmphetaDesk</a>'s interface attests (no author link):<blockquote><i>I've been wanting to use an aggregator since I first heard of them (RU7) but have always felt that because poor information architecture/presentation they tended to make tracking a large number of sites harder rather than easier.</i></blockquote>I didn't expect my first attempt to be called \"Brilliant! Lovely! Perfect!\", but I did think that I was on to something.  Simply displaying the new bits in reverse-chronological order is too limiting - it's only one attempted solution at the problem of aggregation.  My solution isn't an ultimate one either.  </p>\n<p>Aggregators desperately need to grow toward more flexibility and scan-ability.  A few things I'd really like to see addressed:<ul><li>De-emphasis of seen &amp; older items from sites, but not complete hiding.  Context between entries on weblogs is important.</li><li>Optional grouping of items from the same or similar weblogs.  Context between entries, and between blogs is important.</li><li>Emphasis of newer items, tracking the time line and signalling attention to changes.  Radio does this, but mostly to the exclusion of other concerns.</li><li>Preventing sites with few updates from getting lost in a wash of frequently updating sites.  Some of the best sites may update once every few days with something worth reading, but simple reverse-chronological order pushes the quiet sites out in the maelstrom.</li></ul>There's more I've been musing about, but I can't remember more at the moment.  I've tried to do a few of these things with my tweak to Ampheta: varied (hopefully not obtrusive) font size &amp; weight, dependant on item age; maintaining grouping and order of items within <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds; showing enough information for a visual scan, hiding further details, but making details available within a click or two (I love outlines).  I wanted to hit the page-down button less, but it's more than that.  I want my eyes to move slow on the first few items of a channel, and then slide down off the rest, unless I intentionally want to be caught.</p>\n<p>So, while Dave's working on defining the News Aggregator, I think it's a good time to redefine it a bit while he's at it.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=oooaia\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090342\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://zymm.com/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f659bb22a2e62ccd2cd82c4b52f09ca9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://zymm.com/raster/\">Pete</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090342\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-06-11T17:28:37\">2002-06-11T17:28:37</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I agree that Dave's definition of a news aggregator  is a bit narrow, but that's the view from where Dave sits. \nI think we may be at version 0.99 when it comes to news aggregators, they currently work in the most basic form, but can do so much more. \nCategories, keyword filtering, ranking based on what you (and others) think of a source... \nWe've got a long way to go, and I must admit, I'm excited by the possibilities.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090344\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b53911af792174097e8acb282414b44c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Bill Kearney</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090344\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-06-12T13:58:15\">2002-06-12T13:58:15</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Indeed when I see a vendor, and not just the one in question, attempting to 'define' a concept I start thinking \"when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\"  Attempting to pigeon-hole the aggregator concept into strictly chronological format when that's all a product provides is disingenous at best.  \nIt's becoming apparent to more and more folks that aggregating and filtering items is a really great idea.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090345\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.perceive.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fa97eb743d4905554ef8f6a41fb2492e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.perceive.net\">Eric</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090345\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-06-12T16:10:19\">2002-06-12T16:10:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">the presentation of information is the most important part of the aggregator.  Some ideas:\n1. desktop aggregators should support keyword lists (much like Meerkat), so that the aggregator can get an idea of what is of interest to you.  Articles with these keywords could be highlighted in some fashion.\n2. the \"age\" of the item should not necessarily determine its visibility (be it a 0/1 or something in between).  It should only influence.  Other factors could include user interaction with the article (has the articlebeen viewed?  has the user told the aggregator they no longer want to see the article, etc).\n3. Articles should not necessarily be groups by channel.  This obstacle might be the most complex to solve. A more logical order of grouping needs to be found.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090346\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100364/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=132c3a4bf4f5de9b8beea0c21a0ba088&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100364/\">Eric Maynard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090346\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-06-19T10:30:52\">2002-06-19T10:30:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Ok, granted it's not a desktop application, but NewsIsFree.com does offer much of the functionality that is being discussed here relative to aggregators.\nIn fact, in my opinion, the only feature of existing desktop aggregators missing from NewsIsFree is the ability to add your own feeds.\nKeyword searching exists, but it's not automated as such.

Some ideas:\r\n\r\n1. desktop aggregators should support keyword lists (much like Meerkat), so that the aggregator can get an idea of what is of interest to you.  Articles with these keywords could be highlighted in some fashion.\r\n\r\n2. the \"age\" of the item should not necessarily determine its visibility (be it a 0/1 or something in between).  It should only influence.  Other factors could include user interaction with the article (has the articlebeen viewed?  has the user told the aggregator they no longer want to see the article, etc).\r\n\r\n3. Articles should not necessarily be groups by channel.  This obstacle might be the most complex to solve. A more logical order of grouping needs to be found.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090346\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100364/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=132c3a4bf4f5de9b8beea0c21a0ba088&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100364/\">Eric Maynard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090346\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-06-19T10:30:52\">2002-06-19T10:30:52</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Ok, granted it's not a desktop application, but NewsIsFree.com does offer much of the functionality that is being discussed here relative to aggregators.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in my opinion, the only feature of existing desktop aggregators missing from NewsIsFree is the ability to add your own feeds.\r\n\r\nKeyword searching exists, but it's not automated as such.

    "summary": "<p>Reading Dave&apos;s in-progress <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com/whatIsANewsAggregator\">What is a News Aggregator?</a>:</p><blockquote><i> A news aggregator is a piece of software that periodically reads a set of news sources, in one of several XML-based formats, finds the new bits, and displays them in reverse-chronological order on a single page.</i></blockquote>..and the rest leads from there.  First thing:  I think this is an unfortunately limited definition.  It specifies the particular interface by which <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Radio</a> presents information.  And, as a comment on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000187.phtml\">one of my first experments</a> in tweaking <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\">AmphetaDesk</a>&apos;s interface attests (no author link):<blockquote><i>I&apos;ve been wanting to use an aggregator since I first heard of them (RU7) but have always felt that because poor information architecture/presentation they tended to make tracking a large number of sites harder rather than easier.</i></blockquote>I didn&apos;t expect my first attempt to be called &quot;Brilliant! Lovely! Perfect!&quot;, but I did think that I was on to something.  Simply displaying the new bits in reverse-chronological order is too limiting - it&apos;s only one attempted solution at the problem of aggregation.  My solution isn&apos;t an ultimate one either.  <p></p>\n<p>Aggregators desperately need to grow toward more flexibility and scan-ability.  A few things I&apos;d really like to see addressed:</p><ul><li>De-emphasis of seen &amp; older items from sites, but not complete hiding.  Context between entries on weblogs is important.</li><li>Optional grouping of items from the same or similar weblogs.  Context between entries, and between blogs is important.</li><li>Emphasis of newer items, tracking the time line and signalling attention to changes.  Radio does this, but mostly to the exclusion of other concerns.</li><li>Preventing sites with few updates from getting lost in a wash of frequently updating sites.  Some of the best sites may update once every few days with something worth reading, but simple reverse-chronological order pushes the quiet sites out in the maelstrom.</li></ul>There&apos;s more I&apos;ve been musing about, but I can&apos;t remember more at the moment.  I&apos;ve tried to do a few of these things with my tweak to Ampheta: varied (hopefully not obtrusive) font size &amp; weight, dependant on item age; maintaining grouping and order of items within <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds; showing enough information for a visual scan, hiding further details, but making details available within a click or two (I love outlines).  I wanted to hit the page-down button less, but it&apos;s more than that.  I want my eyes to move slow on the first few items of a channel, and then slide down off the rest, unless I intentionally want to be caught.<p></p>\n<p>So, while Dave&apos;s working on defining the News Aggregator, I think it&apos;s a good time to redefine it a bit while he&apos;s at it.</p>\n"

    "summary": "<p>Okay, starting to poke at my referrer scripts again and produced two new things:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/recent_referers_rss.php\">Recent Referrers in </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> (<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/recent_referers_rss_php.txt\">src</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/rss_readers.phtml\">RSS Feed Readers</a> (<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/rss_readers_phtml.txt\">src</a>).  I simplified my database a bit, collapsing multiple rows into single rows with a hit count column.  Also squashed a few stupid bugs that had cropped up in the Great Site Move a month or so ago.  Realized that the counts were insanely wrong, sometimes showing a count as high as 15 for a post that might have only 3 back links.</p>\n<p>Likely the referers in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> will be of interest only to me as I obsessively watch my site (though I <i>do</i> subscribe to <a href=\"http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/xml.html\">Disenchanted&apos;s Recent Inbound</a>, since it gives me a stream of new sites to visit).  But, the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed readers list is a few steps closer to the friends-of list I want to move from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a> out into the blogosphere proper.  </p>\n<p>One of the next things I want to do is start cobbling a fairly modular &amp; general URL investigator - that is, give it a url, and have it try to track down title, author, contents page, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed, location, and any other metadata that comes up.  I could then use this to flesh out all the links everywhere, from backlinks to the friends-of list.  Basically what many other people have been doing for different semantic aspects, but all rolled into one agent.</p>\n<p>Along with that, I want to implement some manual annotation of sites known by my site.  Thinking that, between per-post backlinks and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> reader links, I could eventually build a decent database of metadata here.  With that, all kinds of nifty things could happen...</p>\n<p>Okay, time for bed.  Starting to ramble, or at least be tempted to do so.</p>\n"

    "summary": "<p>Okay, so now we&apos;ve got a bit further toward our News Aggregators leaving vapor trails.  Thanks, <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk\">Morbus</a>.  Thanks, <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Dave</a>.  There&apos;s still some more work that needs to be done, though.  In specific, how do I get to <i>you</i> via your trail?  Or, to be even more specific- how to my <i>agents</i> get to you?</p>\n<p>Sure, I can look in my referers now, and filter on my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/newslog.xml\">RSS feed</a> to see a footprints.  And for Radio users, I can pluck out the userWeblog=... param added to Radio aggregator referers.  For others, like the page <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml\">I set up</a>, or <a href=\"http://ipwebdev.com/radio/ImReadingYourRSSFeed.php\">Adam set up</a>, or <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001018/xml.aggregator.html\">Jeff set up</a>, I can try to assume that the URL leads... somewhere.</p>\n<p>But, in thinking about this further, none of this <i>actually</i> fulfills <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000124.phtml\">my wish</a>.  I originally wanted to see these referers lead directly to a reader&apos;s blog.  They don&apos;t.  But, that&apos;s fine: I kind of like the idea of the thank you / hello / I&apos;m reading your page.  However, I still want to find you.</p>\n<p>Or, rather, as I alluded to in the first paragraph, I want my <i>agents</i> to find you.  And my agents are only semi-intelligent.  So how about we set a standard by which bots can autodiscover your weblog, home page, whatever:</p><ol><li>If you don&apos;t care to put up a special page to point to as your referer when aggregating news, then point a URL somewhere, anywhere, but include a URL to your weblog in a query parameter named &quot;userWeblog&quot;.  This covers an already de facto standard set by Radio.</li><li>If you <i>do</i> care to set up an acknowledgement page for your readers, include a LINK tag in the page&apos;s HEAD pointing to the home page of your site as the table of contents: <code><link href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\" rel=\"contents\"></code></li></ol>In this way, rock bangers cobbling together their own blog spiders can tell them where to go and for what to look.  Get this meme spread, and we&apos;ll be seeing <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/06/02.html#social_networks_by_referrer\">more community crawling bots</a> very soon now.<p></p>\n<p>In fact, I like this LINK tag now.  I think it should be put on <i>all</i> of your weblog pages.  Especially as I start thinking more about revisiting referers: A LINK back to your weblog home as the table of contents would allow me to maybe enrich my backlinks, especially knowing where your site root is.  (If my eyes do not deceive, it looks like backlinks on <a href=\"http://www.diveintomark.org/\">Mark Pilgrim&apos;s blog</a> do some <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> autodiscovery right now.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, let me know what you think.</p>\n"

Anyone want to jump on this bandwagon and help push it as fast as the recent <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> autodetection meme? :)</p>\n<p>Catching up, I see that <a href=\"http://ipwebdev.com/radio/2002/06/02.php#a137\">Adam wrote</a> about what <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001018/2002/05/30.html#a1274\">Jeff Cheney wrote</a> about changing <code>aggregatorData.prefs.appSignatureUrl</code> in Radio <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> to point to a <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001018/xml.aggregator.html\">custom page</a>.  Hey, <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Radio crew</a>, how about making this a default, eh?  Point that signature at my blog, or a canned <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001018/xml.aggregator.html\">custom page</a>?  Yay!</p>\n"

Just as she reminded me how pathetic it is to say, &quot;High school was the best time of my life,&quot; treating my college days as my Golden Age is just as pathetic.</p>\n<p>The thing I&apos;ve not been facing is exactly what grlathena writes: &quot;The future is very do-it-yourself.&quot;</p>\n</i><p><i>The world didn&apos;t run out of wonder or friends or opportunities for fulfillment after I graduated, it just got a bit more miserly in just tossing them at me. See, life in school is still very scripted. There are many choices made in advance for you, based on only a handful from you. Out here in the &quot;real world&quot;, things are much less scripted, and many fewer things are just given. It&apos;s very do-it-yourself.</i></p></blockquote>I know all my fellow rock bangers are human beings, too.  I just hesitate to waste their time with too much off the topic of rock banging and more on the topic of human beings.  Should I overlap more?  You tell me.<p></p>\n"
