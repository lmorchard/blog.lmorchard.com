<p>In case anyone's been wondering where I've been, here's the story: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/talkpost.bml?journal=deus_x&amp;itemid=173919">Clawing my way back to the land of the living</a></p>
<p>Briefly: Been bedridden with something nasty.  Too wiped out to do much besides read &amp; stare.  Working on getting healthy and productive again.</p>
<p>Be back soon.</p>
