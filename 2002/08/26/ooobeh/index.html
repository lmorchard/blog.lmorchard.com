This is why I threw this site together, and why I have a link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ReleaseEarlyReleaseOften&quot;&gt;ReleaseEarlyReleaseOften&lt;/a&gt; on the front page.  
&lt;p&gt;Before this, I would spend years working on something in silence, only to have it fall over on top of me and end with me never wanting to touch it again.  For almost 2 years, I was working on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/iaido&quot;&gt;Zope replacement in Perl called Iaido&lt;/a&gt; before I finally created a &lt;span style=&quot;background : #FFFFCE;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/SourceForge?topicparent=Main.FilterData&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;SourceForge&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; project for it and invited some people in to play.  By then, I was already disgusted with my ugly code, wanted to scrap it and restart, but wasn&amp;apos;t nearly enthusiastic enough to do that.  And by then, there was just too much code - and yet too little documentation - for anyone I invited in to really dive in and muck about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; project was to be the core of a community site for coders, web designers, and general all around mad scientists.  It would be named &lt;span style=&quot;background : #FFFFCE;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/NinjaCode?topicparent=Main.FilterData&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;NinjaCode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ninjacode.com&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;http://www.ninjacode.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Well, you can see, the community never got off the ground, and I don&amp;apos;t even have a hold on the domain anymore.  It coulda been a contenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can see now, on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Projects&quot;&gt;Projects&lt;/a&gt; page, that I&amp;apos;ve been gradually working up and spinning out little hacks and widgets.  Eventually, they combine into bigger widgets, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin&quot;&gt;MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;apos;m thinking that this is the way to go.  And, even if/when I do get a grandiose idea, I need to start off releasing the widgets early and show the build up process here in this weblog.  Then, there&amp;apos;s some documentation from the start and maybe even some enthusiastic co-conspirators from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
