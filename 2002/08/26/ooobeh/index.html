Stop talking about it an just build it. Don&#39;t make it too complicated. Don&#39;t spend so much time planning on events that will never happen. Programmers, good programmers, are known for over-engineering to save time later down the road. The problem is that you can over-engineer yourself out of wanting to do the site... [Andre Torrez, Even You Can Do It]Just found this post today, via Danny O&#39;Brien.  This is why I threw this site together, and why I have a link to ReleaseEarlyReleaseOften on the front page.  
Before this, I would spend years working on something in silence, only to have it fall over on top of me and end with me never wanting to touch it again.  For almost 2 years, I was working on a Zope replacement in Perl called Iaido before I finally created a ?SourceForge project for it and invited some people in to play.  By then, I was already disgusted with my ugly code, wanted to scrap it and restart, but wasn&#39;t nearly enthusiastic enough to do that.  And by then, there was just too much code - and yet too little documentation - for anyone I invited in to really dive in and muck about.
And this project was to be the core of a community site for coders, web designers, and general all around mad scientists.  It would be named ?NinjaCode, at http://www.ninjacode.com.  Well, you can see, the community never got off the ground, and I don&#39;t even have a hold on the domain anymore.  It coulda been a contenda.
But you can see now, on my Projects page, that I&#39;ve been gradually working up and spinning out little hacks and widgets.  Eventually, they combine into bigger widgets, like MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin.  I&#39;m thinking that this is the way to go.  And, even if/when I do get a grandiose idea, I need to start off releasing the widgets early and show the build up process here in this weblog.  Then, there&#39;s some documentation from the start and maybe even some enthusiastic co-conspirators from the start." />
