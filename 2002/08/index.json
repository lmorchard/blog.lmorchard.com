It's very, very, very rare that I see a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournaller\">LiveJournaller</a>'s posts linked into the Blogosphere at large.  Granted, I know that the median user was a 15 year old female who complains about Mom and her boyfriend, when last I checked.  But, as the adage goes: 90% of anything is crap.  There are, nevertheless, a good number of worthwhile streams of narrative in that space.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I don't see many of the people behind LJ stepping out and making noise in the Outer Blogosphere either.  I think many of them are just plain busy keeping the site afloat, or having lives, and LJ is world enough for them.</p>\n<p>But 650,000 users... that's a lot.  More than Radio and rivalling Blogger.com.  Is there a real qualitative difference in writing between the groups?  I would still imagine there's a lot of crap to be found via Blogger.com.  I'm not sure about Radio, though, since I get the impression that the 15 year olds have yet to flood into the userbase and its following seems more tilted toward professionals.</p>\n<p>But as for the software &amp; service itself...  As far as I can see, LJ is one of the easiest paths out there to starting a weblog/journal online.  And it was one of the first sites I ever encountered that had a desktop-based client app for posting to it.  And, though not prominently placed, they have <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds for every single journal on the site.  They're even working <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> aggregation features into the place by gatewaying external <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds in as special LJ users to be added like any other LJ \"friend\".</p>\n<p>So, to me, LJ sounds like a top competitor to every other blog/news aggregation product or service out there - yet I rarely hear about it.

My LJ tends to be less tech geeky and more personal, and my audience there is less interested in the things I do here.  Whereas I tend to assume that people who come here want to see what I'm playing with more than other musings and randomity.\nI suppose it's the culture of LJ, being that it's a tight-knit community and helped to be that way by the software.  Out here in the blogosphere at large, things seem to be more loosely flung about and less automatically connected.  I keep wanting to bring more LJ features to the blogs out here.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090322\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://organica.us/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3c69beb9eedff4e895809292dd7dd4cb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://organica.us/\">Ask Bjoern Hansen</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090322\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-01T11:41:33\">2002-09-01T11:41:33</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Over at organica I have a lot of links from blogs.

My LJ tends to be less tech geeky and more personal, and my audience there is less interested in the things I do here.  Whereas I tend to assume that people who come here want to see what I'm playing with more than other musings and randomity.\r\n\r\nI suppose it's the culture of LJ, being that it's a tight-knit community and helped to be that way by the software.  Out here in the blogosphere at large, things seem to be more loosely flung about and less automatically connected.  I keep wanting to bring more LJ features to the blogs out here.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090322\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://organica.us/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3c69beb9eedff4e895809292dd7dd4cb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://organica.us/\">Ask Bjoern Hansen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090322\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-01T11:41:33\">2002-09-01T11:41:33</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Over at organica I have a lot of links from blogs.

It&apos;s very, very, very rare that I see a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournaller\">LiveJournaller</a>&apos;s posts linked into the Blogosphere at large.  Granted, I know that the median user was a 15 year old female who complains about Mom and her boyfriend, when last I checked.  But, as the adage goes: 90% of anything is crap.  There are, nevertheless, a good number of worthwhile streams of narrative in that space.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I don&apos;t see many of the people behind LJ stepping out and making noise in the Outer Blogosphere either.  I think many of them are just plain busy keeping the site afloat, or having lives, and LJ is world enough for them.</p>\n<p>But 650,000 users... that&apos;s a lot.  More than Radio and rivalling Blogger.com.  Is there a real qualitative difference in writing between the groups?  I would still imagine there&apos;s a lot of crap to be found via Blogger.com.  I&apos;m not sure about Radio, though, since I get the impression that the 15 year olds have yet to flood into the userbase and its following seems more tilted toward professionals.</p>\n<p>But as for the software &amp; service itself...  As far as I can see, LJ is one of the easiest paths out there to starting a weblog/journal online.  And it was one of the first sites I ever encountered that had a desktop-based client app for posting to it.  And, though not prominently placed, they have <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds for every single journal on the site.  They&apos;re even working <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> aggregation features into the place by gatewaying external <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds in as special LJ users to be added like any other LJ &quot;friend&quot;.</p>\n<p>So, to me, LJ sounds like a top competitor to every other blog/news aggregation product or service out there - yet I rarely hear about it.  Hrm.</p>\n<p>Anyone have a theory why?</p>\n"

Basic publish/subscribe model.  </p>\n<p>But the advantage Radio has over MT in this regard is this:  Radio is a persistently running app/server/daemon thing.  MT is a collection of scripts that does nothing until asked to run.  Radio can connect to IM and stay connected.  Something like MT would need to login to an IM service each and every time it wanted to ping.  Maybe that's not such a big deal, really.  I also have a hunch that there would be some difficulties with web hosting sites who don't really want customers emitting IMs from their CGIs.  Maybe not a big deal either.</p>\n<p>Just seems like an impedance mismatch, though.</p>\n<p>What I'd like to see is something like this:  An XML-RPC/SOAP <-> IM gateway.  And then, eventually, I'd like to see a decentrallized P2P network with XML-RPC/SOAP entry points that can smoothly replace centralized resources that have XML-RPC/SOAP entry points, maybe using IM networks as one possible rendevous point.  (Just remembered this project: <a href=\"http://relativity.yi.org/jxta-bridge/\">JXTA Bridge</a>.  Mental note - play with JXTA again and poke at SOAP some more.)</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooobfa\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090298\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://boston.conman.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=778e89305f331b88a87a94b348164df8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://boston.conman.org/\">Sean Conner</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090298\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-30T19:54:12\">2002-08-30T19:54:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Why not use IRC?

Basic publish/subscribe model.  </p>\r\n<p>But the advantage Radio has over MT in this regard is this:  Radio is a persistently running app/server/daemon thing.  MT is a collection of scripts that does nothing until asked to run.  Radio can connect to IM and stay connected.  Something like MT would need to login to an IM service each and every time it wanted to ping.  Maybe that's not such a big deal, really.  I also have a hunch that there would be some difficulties with web hosting sites who don't really want customers emitting IMs from their CGIs.  Maybe not a big deal either.</p>\r\n<p>Just seems like an impedance mismatch, though.</p>\r\n<p>What I'd like to see is something like this:  An XML-RPC/SOAP <-> IM gateway.  And then, eventually, I'd like to see a decentrallized P2P network with XML-RPC/SOAP entry points that can smoothly replace centralized resources that have XML-RPC/SOAP entry points, maybe using IM networks as one possible rendevous point.  (Just remembered this project: <a href=\"http://relativity.yi.org/jxta-bridge/\">JXTA Bridge</a>.  Mental note - play with JXTA again and poke at SOAP some more.)</p>\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=ooobfa\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090298\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://boston.conman.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=778e89305f331b88a87a94b348164df8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://boston.conman.org/\">Sean Conner</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090298\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-30T19:54:12\">2002-08-30T19:54:12</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Why not use IRC?

Basic publish/subscribe model.  </p>\n<p>But the advantage Radio has over MT in this regard is this:  Radio is a persistently running app/server/daemon thing.  MT is a collection of scripts that does nothing until asked to run.  Radio can connect to IM and stay connected.  Something like MT would need to login to an IM service each and every time it wanted to ping.  Maybe that&apos;s not such a big deal, really.  I also have a hunch that there would be some difficulties with web hosting sites who don&apos;t really want customers emitting IMs from their CGIs.  Maybe not a big deal either.</p>\n<p>Just seems like an impedance mismatch, though.</p>\n<p>What I&apos;d like to see is something like this:  An XML-RPC/SOAP &lt;-&gt; IM gateway.  And then, eventually, I&apos;d like to see a decentrallized P2P network with XML-RPC/SOAP entry points that can smoothly replace centralized resources that have XML-RPC/SOAP entry points, maybe using IM networks as one possible rendevous point.  (Just remembered this project: <a href=\"http://relativity.yi.org/jxta-bridge/\">JXTA Bridge</a>.  Mental note - play with JXTA again and poke at SOAP some more.)</p>\n"

    "summary": "<p><a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/2002/08/27.html#a766\">Sam Ruby responds</a> to <a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/whyRss10NamedRss\">Dave&apos;s question</a>:</p><blockquote><i>I am not a stakeholder in this naming issue, nor can I claim based on personal experience that any of the above references are authoritative, but based on these references alone, it seems to me that one could ask the converse to both of these questions: i.e, why is <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 0.91 called <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, and why did the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 0.91 branch use <code><rss></rss></code> instead of <code>[rdf:rdf]</code>?</i></blockquote>This is basically what I&apos;d started writing as a response the other night, but I lost it in a browser crash.<p></p>\n<p>I browsed around a bit, revisited some old links I&apos;d followed when first I started hacking with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> and frustratedly discovered the format fork.  <a href=\"http://backend.userland.com/stories/rss091\">As Dave tells it</a>, his adoption of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> started in cooperation with Netscape, and the later resulted in his continued support and development after Netscape had wandered away from it and shed the developers responsible.  So from his seat I would think that it looks like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> was abandoned in his lap and thus he felt free to continue on shaping it toward his own ends, namely those of simplicity and real dirt-under-the-nails use versus further design and planning.</p>\n<p>Then, later <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 comes into the picture.  About this point in history I&apos;m fuzzy.  Most accounts and articles I see do not mention how v1.0 came about and who birthed it.  Most of what I&apos;ve ready just basically says, &quot;And then there was v1.0&quot;  But who said so and when and why?</p>\n<p>That 1.0 has more in common with the v0.9 roots than any of Dave&apos;s v0.9x series is clear, so maybe in this respect one could say that this naturally lends v1.0 a &quot;natural&quot; claim on the name by virtue of bloodline and original intent.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, one could also say that Dave&apos;s v0.9x series has a claim on the name due to virtue of having actually been in active development directly after the original v0.9.

    "summary": "<p>Grr, shame on me for getting cheap hosting again.  For the most part, <a href=\"http://www.phpwebhosting.com\">PHPWebHosting</a> has been just fine - they give me SSH access to a shell, about 120MB of space, a few <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MySQL\">MySQL</a> databases, and generally leave me alone for US$10 per month.  But at this point, the leaving me alone bit isn&apos;t working out so well, since the server I&apos;m on over there has had its main disk fill up regularly, thus bringing down all the sites hosted on it (including mine).</p>\n<p>I&apos;d <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000245.phtml\">joked a little while ago</a> about getting myself an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XServe\">XServe</a> and finding some affordable colocation.  Now, though, I&apos;m not laughing so much.  I should probably just find another webhost, but it&apos;s tempting to have my own server.</p>\n<p>In the past, I had a few friends at an ISP, so they let me stash a little linux server on their network for occasional favors.  I miss that.  Didn&apos;t cost me anything, and my impact on their network was negligible.  Meanwhile, I had a stable, semi-reliable box on the net at which I could point a domain.  Services could catch fire and other things could tank, and no one got hurt.</p>\n<p>The problem now, though, is that shelling out for a server and colocation costs just to play around is a just a <strong>smidgen</strong> outside my budget.  As I&apos;ve pondered before, maybe I could actually host a money-making service on it with some of these hacks I&apos;m percolating through.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a co-worker put the idea in my head that it might not be unreasonable to think that I could invite some tenants onto my server to share some of the cost.  I figure I&apos;d take the burden of buying &amp; owning the server, but I&apos;d like to spread the service cost out.  I wouldn&apos;t want to make a profit, I&apos;d just like to make a kind of nerd commune.  It&apos;d be nice if I could get the cost for everyone under US$10-15, though I imagine my cost would be higher given a server payment.  If I could get mine below $40-50 a month, I think I&apos;d be happy, though this seems like a pipe dream.</p>\n<p>The devil being in the details, however, I don&apos;t really know how one would go about such a thing, considering service agreements and contracts and taxes and blah blah blah.  I&apos;m a financial moron, and I&apos;m also certainly not into being a 24/7 available customer service rep, or to perform tech help.  Basically, I&apos;d like to run a server to host mad scientist experiments performed by a relatively small cadre of mad scientists who can mostly clean up after themselves.  I&apos;d like to run an IRC server, maybe a Jabber server, maybe a few random half-baked server ideas.</p>\n<p>On the other other hand, is anyone out there doing this already and want a new tenant?  :)</p>\n"

Dave</i></blockquote>Now first of all, I too <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000191.phtml\">disagree with Dave's definition</a>, and have posted as much.  Although I did so in a less rant-mode manner, both Morbus and I pointed to the fact that the news aggregator definition served the goals of Radio 8.0 marketing, being that the definition very specifically identified the features of his own product.  Rant or not, the point is made.</p>\n<p>What disappoints me about Dave's response on-list, though, is that instead of addressing the content of the disagreement, he goes after the ranting and hits back with a smidgen of ad-hominem of his own while calling for the \"high road\".  Then, once he's tagged on the ad-hominem he unsubscribes and dismisses the list altogether, never actually acknowledging the original point made.</p>\n<p>Now, though I don't have a link, I've read several times where Dave has disparaged discussion groups and offered linked weblogs as the superior alternative.  I've read his essay on <a href=\"http://www.userland.com/whatIsStopEnergy\">Stop Energy</a>.  I'm aware of his position toward the grousings and grumblings and flamings that go on within a discussion group.  And I've nodded my head almost every time he's written about these things - freeform discussions on the net can sometimes - but not always - be a clusterfuck of morons and Stop Energy.</p>\n<p>Maybe it's just because Dave is so intolerably fed up with <i>any</i> hint of a clusterfuck that he dropped off the list.  I wouldn't put up with much shit either, especially after heart surgery.  But to me it looked like pretty defensive behavior right from the get-go.  Morbus even gave somewhat of an apology (for him :) ) and moved on to politely hit the issues.</p>\n<p>I guess this bugs me a bit, along with other <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>-related thoughts I've had lately, for this reason:  Here's a discussion group devoted to the very nature and future of one of the headline features of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a>.  And the people there are some of the most prevalent names I've seen appear time and time again in relation ot the subject.  I would think that this would be a dream group for him, in terms of driving and benefiting from innovation.  Instead, it takes only a small amount of rant to drive him away.</p>\n<p>See, I've never met him, but I think I'd like Dave personally.  Yes, I know his writings often have one foot or both feet in marketing for his products.  But, I can't recall his denying this, and I see it as the natural behavior of someone who really thinks he's got something hot.  He gives favor to his customers in his posts, and he has his own opinions.  But I know these things, and I still like his software, and I still buy it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it's clear that sometimes he doesn't give equal time to points which may be contradictory or unfavorable to his side of things, and sometimes he gets things wrong.  But he's not a journallist - he's a blogger who writes from the hip and sees what flies.  Whether he lies outright is another story I haven't the first inclination to follow up on, but the very nature of his product stands to check and balance to him there.  He can't get away with too much with his own customers calling him on things.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm starting to ramble.  What really bothers me about the quick dismissal of the list seems like a \"See?! This is what I mean!\" demonstration on-list, and I almost expect a post later again promoting weblogs over DG's altogether.  But I didn't even see him give the list a chance, and I think that's sad given the brain power in that roster.  Granted, it's his perogative to have slim thresholds for annoyance, but I'd think this would be value for his company and product.  As I said, I like his software, but he's refusing free help and consultation on the future of his product.  I see those involved in groups like this taking their products beyond his, even those that were originally direct clones of his.  Maybe this ends up tying into his grousing on Open Source versus commercial software eventually.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, maybe he just thinks he doesn't need any help of this sort and has the sheer magnitude of innovational mojo to leave us all in the dust.  If so, rock on.  :)  As for me, I just joined the list.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooobeo\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082938\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100875\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=49fee9c8389d0310cceb32653dd7fdd8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100875\">mikel</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082938\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-21T17:13:28\">2002-08-21T17:13:28</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Yes, that was a sticky start to the group.

    "summary": "<p>Scanning news today, I see in my referrers a link from the <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aggregators/\">new aggregators discussion group</a> to my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000228.phtml\">outliner </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> skin.  Curious, I go <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aggregators/message/44?threaded=1\">check it out</a> and see what looks like a bit of grumbling between <a href=\"http://www.scripting.com\">Dave Winer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com\">Morbus Iff</a>.  I make my way back to <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aggregators/message/42\">near the head of the thread</a> to see what&apos;s what, where I find a link to Morbus&apos; <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/dnn/2002/06/index.shtml#001333\">post of opinioned and somewhat ranty disagreement</a> toward <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com/whatIsANewsAggregator\">Dave&apos;s definition of the modern News Aggregator</a>.  What disturbs me is that the grumbling <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aggregators/message/48\">quickly ends</a> with:</p><blockquote><i>Bill -- I&apos;m going to unsubscribe from this list now. The neener boys are in charge. Take care. Dave</i></blockquote>Now first of all, I too <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000191.phtml\">disagree with Dave&apos;s definition</a>, and have posted as much.  Although I did so in a less rant-mode manner, both Morbus and I pointed to the fact that the news aggregator definition served the goals of Radio 8.0 marketing, being that the definition very specifically identified the features of his own product.  Rant or not, the point is made.<p></p>\n<p>What disappoints me about Dave&apos;s response on-list, though, is that instead of addressing the content of the disagreement, he goes after the ranting and hits back with a smidgen of ad-hominem of his own while calling for the &quot;high road&quot;.  Then, once he&apos;s tagged on the ad-hominem he unsubscribes and dismisses the list altogether, never actually acknowledging the original point made.</p>\n<p>Now, though I don&apos;t have a link, I&apos;ve read several times where Dave has disparaged discussion groups and offered linked weblogs as the superior alternative.  I&apos;ve read his essay on <a href=\"http://www.userland.com/whatIsStopEnergy\">Stop Energy</a>.  I&apos;m aware of his position toward the grousings and grumblings and flamings that go on within a discussion group.  And I&apos;ve nodded my head almost every time he&apos;s written about these things - freeform discussions on the net can sometimes - but not always - be a clusterfuck of morons and Stop Energy.</p>\n<p>Maybe it&apos;s just because Dave is so intolerably fed up with <i>any</i> hint of a clusterfuck that he dropped off the list.  I wouldn&apos;t put up with much shit either, especially after heart surgery.  But to me it looked like pretty defensive behavior right from the get-go.  Morbus even gave somewhat of an apology (for him :) ) and moved on to politely hit the issues.</p>\n<p>I guess this bugs me a bit, along with other <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>-related thoughts I&apos;ve had lately, for this reason:  Here&apos;s a discussion group devoted to the very nature and future of one of the headline features of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a>.

    "html": "<p><MTXMLRPCFilter url=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/twiki_xmlrpc.cgi\"></p>\n<p>Last week, after reading what <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/15.html#better_living_through_regular_expressions\">Mark Pilgrim had to say</a> about macros in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>, I made a mental note to finally circle back around to hacking together my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a> now that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> has plugin features.</p>\n<p>Turns out it was so much easier than I thought it would be.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>'s plugin scheme is dead simple, which hopefully means that plugins will flourish like mad.</p>\n<p>First, I hacked together <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTWikiFormatPlugin\">MTWikiFormatPlugin</a>.  This plugin simply implements a new container tag, MTWikiFormat, which runs the contents of the tag through <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=all&amp;query=Text::WikiFormat\" title=\"CPAN search for Text::WikiFormat\">CPAN:Text::WikiFormat</a>.  This doesn't actually integrate with any existing wiki, but it is very simple to install and does bring some wiki-ness to blog entries, including some limited formatting and <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWords\" title=\"'WikiWords' on the original 'WikiWikiWeb' site\">Wiki:WikiWords</a>.  This doesn't provide everything Mark had posted in a lil wishlist comment to me, but it's a start.  Maybe I'll look into tearing the formatting guts out of some wiki to make a Text::WikiFormat replacement, or maybe I'll submit patches to the original module.</p>\n<p>The second plugin though, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a>, is what I'm really happy about.  <br />\nWhereas <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTWikiFormatPlugin\">MTWikiFormatPlugin</a> filters content through one perl module, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> can filter content through one or more <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XmlRpcFilteringPipe</a> interfaces.  I have a handful of these filters available on my site right now, and in a little while I will catalog them in the wiki.  For now, I'm just filtering this entry through <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DecafbadWiki\">DecafbadWiki</a>.  In the future, I may get more adventurous with my content filtering pipeline.</p>\n<p>One drawback to using <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> for the purposes of a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a> is that I've only got support for TWiki so far in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\">XmlRpcToWiki</a> project.  Other wikis still need some hacking before they can provide filters.  Some assembly required, fellow <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AlphaGeek\">AlphaGeeks</a>.</p>\n<p>So, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.

I tried this lil oneliner with an undef result on your \nperl -MSOAP::Lite -MXMLRPC::Lite -MData::Dumper -e'$txt = \"This is a test foo foo foo foo WikiWord TwikiWiki\"; print Data::Dumper::Dumper(XMLRPC::Lite->proxy(\"http://www.10500bc.org/twiki/bin/twiki_xmlrpc.cgi\")->call(\"wiki.filterData\", SOAP::Data->type(base64 => $txt), \"text/html\", {})->result()).\"\\n\"'\nWhereas on my install, I get:\n$VAR1 = {\n'data' => 'This is a test foo foo foo foo ?WikiWord ?TwikiWiki',\n'contentType' => 'text/html'\n};\nHmm, I wonder if that jumble will make any swnse? :)  Does your error log say anything?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087055\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.10500bc.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2a158ec6895b9af4ce255febfe69ffee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.10500bc.org\">Josh Cooper</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087055\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-20T13:38:11\">2002-08-20T13:38:11</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Yep that makes perfect since. I finally found that XML::Parser::Lite module was missing the twiki lib. Once i added that the test returns the following result:\n$VAR1 = {\n'data' => 'This is a foo foo foo foo WikiWord? TwikiWiki?',\n'contentType' => 'text/html'\n};\nWhich should be correct or close anyway. So that part works now, but now it appears the plugin not returning any information on the entries, at least its not giving an error message so it must be running.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087056\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087056\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-20T14:22:13\">2002-08-20T14:22:13</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Hmm, well, if there are no more errors and that testing one-liner works, the thing *should* be working.

Kinda odd but could very well be related to formatting or something of that nature.\nAnyway my plan is to use the extended mode anyway, so thanks again for such a kick ass plugin, and the other stuff you do also!

    "body": "<p><MTXMLRPCFilter url=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/twiki_xmlrpc.cgi\"></p>\r\n<p>Last week, after reading what <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/15.html#better_living_through_regular_expressions\">Mark Pilgrim had to say</a> about macros in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>, I made a mental note to finally circle back around to hacking together my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a> now that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> has plugin features.</p>\r\n<p>Turns out it was so much easier than I thought it would be.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>'s plugin scheme is dead simple, which hopefully means that plugins will flourish like mad.</p>\r\n<p>First, I hacked together <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTWikiFormatPlugin\">MTWikiFormatPlugin</a>.  This plugin simply implements a new container tag, MTWikiFormat, which runs the contents of the tag through <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=all&amp;query=Text::WikiFormat\" title=\"CPAN search for Text::WikiFormat\">CPAN:Text::WikiFormat</a>.  This doesn't actually integrate with any existing wiki, but it is very simple to install and does bring some wiki-ness to blog entries, including some limited formatting and <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWords\" title=\"'WikiWords' on the original 'WikiWikiWeb' site\">Wiki:WikiWords</a>.  This doesn't provide everything Mark had posted in a lil wishlist comment to me, but it's a start.  Maybe I'll look into tearing the formatting guts out of some wiki to make a Text::WikiFormat replacement, or maybe I'll submit patches to the original module.</p>\r\n<p>The second plugin though, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a>, is what I'm really happy about.  <br />\r\nWhereas <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTWikiFormatPlugin\">MTWikiFormatPlugin</a> filters content through one perl module, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> can filter content through one or more <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XmlRpcFilteringPipe</a> interfaces.  I have a handful of these filters available on my site right now, and in a little while I will catalog them in the wiki.  For now, I'm just filtering this entry through <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DecafbadWiki\">DecafbadWiki</a>.  In the future, I may get more adventurous with my content filtering pipeline.</p>\r\n<p>One drawback to using <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> for the purposes of a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a> is that I've only got support for TWiki so far in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\">XmlRpcToWiki</a> project.  Other wikis still need some hacking before they can provide filters.  Some assembly required, fellow <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AlphaGeek\">AlphaGeeks</a>.</p>\r\n<p>So, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.

I tried this lil oneliner with an undef result on your \r\n\r\nperl -MSOAP::Lite -MXMLRPC::Lite -MData::Dumper -e'$txt = \"This is a test foo foo foo foo WikiWord TwikiWiki\"; print Data::Dumper::Dumper(XMLRPC::Lite->proxy(\"http://www.10500bc.org/twiki/bin/twiki_xmlrpc.cgi\")->call(\"wiki.filterData\", SOAP::Data->type(base64 => $txt), \"text/html\", {})->result()).\"\\n\"'\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas on my install, I get:\r\n\r\n\r\n$VAR1 = {\r\n          'data' => 'This is a test foo foo foo foo ?WikiWord ?TwikiWiki',\r\n          'contentType' => 'text/html'\r\n        };\r\n\r\nHmm, I wonder if that jumble will make any swnse? :)  Does your error log say anything?</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087055\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.10500bc.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2a158ec6895b9af4ce255febfe69ffee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.10500bc.org\">Josh Cooper</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087055\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-20T13:38:11\">2002-08-20T13:38:11</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Yep that makes perfect since. I finally found that XML::Parser::Lite module was missing the twiki lib. Once i added that the test returns the following result:\r\n\r\n$VAR1 = {\r\n          'data' => 'This is a foo foo foo foo WikiWord? TwikiWiki?',\r\n          'contentType' => 'text/html'\r\n        };\r\n\r\nWhich should be correct or close anyway. So that part works now, but now it appears the plugin not returning any information on the entries, at least its not giving an error message so it must be running.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087056\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087056\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-20T14:22:13\">2002-08-20T14:22:13</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Hmm, well, if there are no more errors and that testing one-liner works, the thing *should* be working.  Though, I noticed you put [wikiWord] in an entry.  I'm not sure if that would do much, since TWiki uses double-bracket links.  Like: [[WikiWord]] or [[Perl]] or [[Python]].\r\n\r\nI do hope it starts working for you.

I'm not sure why its not picking the others up automatically in the entries, but it is out side of the entries. Kinda odd but could very well be related to formatting or something of that nature.\r\n\r\nAnyway my plan is to use the extended mode anyway, so thanks again for such a kick ass plugin, and the other stuff you do also! Glad I could be a tester for you :)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087059\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087059\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-20T15:25:43\">2002-08-20T15:25:43</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Strange...  I don't think that extended=\"1\" actually does anything in the MTXMLRPCFilter tag.  It does in the MTWikiFormat tag though.  You should also be able to use TWiki formatting rules too, like *bold* and tables and lists and things.\r\n\r\nGlad to see it's working though, and thanks for being a tester :)  Yay!</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087061\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://stupendous.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2e0efdbe758e69dc351b92d1c255a853&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://stupendous.net/\">Nathan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087061\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-29T05:08:39\">2004-04-29T05:08:39</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Mate, your TWiki is dead:\r\n\r\nSoftware error:\r\n\r\nBad arg length for Socket::pack_sockaddr_in, length is 0, should be 4 at /usr/lib/perl/5.8/Socket.pm line 201.\r\n\r\nFor help, please send mail to the webmaster (you@your.address), giving this error message and the time and date of the error.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

    "summary": "<p><mtxmlrpcfilter url=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/twiki_xmlrpc.cgi\"></mtxmlrpcfilter></p>\n<p>Last week, after reading what <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/15.html#better_living_through_regular_expressions\">Mark Pilgrim had to say</a> about macros in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>, I made a mental note to finally circle back around to hacking together my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a> now that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> has plugin features.</p>\n<p>Turns out it was so much easier than I thought it would be.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>&apos;s plugin scheme is dead simple, which hopefully means that plugins will flourish like mad.</p>\n<p>First, I hacked together <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTWikiFormatPlugin\">MTWikiFormatPlugin</a>.  This plugin simply implements a new container tag, MTWikiFormat, which runs the contents of the tag through <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=all&amp;query=Text::WikiFormat\" title=\"CPAN search for Text::WikiFormat\">CPAN:Text::WikiFormat</a>.  This doesn&apos;t actually integrate with any existing wiki, but it is very simple to install and does bring some wiki-ness to blog entries, including some limited formatting and <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWords\" title=\"&apos;WikiWords&apos; on the original &apos;WikiWikiWeb&apos; site\">Wiki:WikiWords</a>.  This doesn&apos;t provide everything Mark had posted in a lil wishlist comment to me, but it&apos;s a start.  Maybe I&apos;ll look into tearing the formatting guts out of some wiki to make a Text::WikiFormat replacement, or maybe I&apos;ll submit patches to the original module.</p>\n<p>The second plugin though, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a>, is what I&apos;m really happy about.  <br>\nWhereas <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTWikiFormatPlugin\">MTWikiFormatPlugin</a> filters content through one perl module, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> can filter content through one or more <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XmlRpcFilteringPipe</a> interfaces.  I have a handful of these filters available on my site right now, and in a little while I will catalog them in the wiki.  For now, I&apos;m just filtering this entry through <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DecafbadWiki\">DecafbadWiki</a>.  In the future, I may get more adventurous with my content filtering pipeline.</p>\n<p>One drawback to using <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> for the purposes of a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a> is that I&apos;ve only got support for TWiki so far in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\">XmlRpcToWiki</a> project.  Other wikis still need some hacking before they can provide filters.  Some assembly required, fellow <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AlphaGeek\">AlphaGeeks</a>.</p>\n<p>So, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.  Time for bed.</p>\n<p></p>\n"

    "html": "<p>Ack.  Okay, so I started tinkering with <a href=\"http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/bml\">Bean Markup Language</a> as the configuration glue for my Java app.  So far it seems to be working very nicely and doing everything I want it to do.  The problem, though, is that as I look around for examples and things I notice that it seems as if this project is dead.  I look further, and I realize...  <i>I can't find any source code to this thing.</i>  And here I am working it into the core of my app.</p>\n<p>Well, I'd hate to start over and reinvent this wheel, since it seems to be such a nice wheel.  Between the clean definition of beans and their properties, and the ability to toss little bits of script (using the <a href=\"http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf\">BSF</a>) in there to further tweak things, it seems perfect.  But the apparent abandonment of the project and my lack of source gives me the willies.</p>\n<p>So...  Does anyone out there know anything about what's happened with the <a href=\"http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/bml\">Bean Markup Language</a> project?  Could anyone get me the source?  Or, could someone point me to an equivalent alternative?  Because, if I can't find source or an equally powerful alternative, I'm tossing around the notion of re-implementing BML with a clone project if the license doesn't prohibit it.</p>\n<p>Or am I completely crazy and barking up the wrong tree to begin with?  Is there a better, more elegant way to create and connect Java components together than this?  And is it free?</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooobcb\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083506\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9db42ab5ca7ead39c85c7efcd9569b10&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">robert</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083506\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-14T22:07:52\">2002-08-14T22:07:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">You might want to take a look at Jelly from Apache Commons (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/sandbox/jelly/index.html) where it says in part \"Jelly is a Java and XML based scripting and processing engine....

Our group moved on to doing BSF (which is what bo is referring to in the previous post, not BML) and now work on a bunch of Web services stuff.\nSome of the composition ideas in BML went into WSFL as well as its recently announced replacement BPEL4WS. However, neither of those is yet a full replacement for BML. We've always intended to get to a point where one composition language works for various models, including JavaBeans, but the underlying component model of Web services (WSDL, the IBM part of which was also developed by our group) is not yet rich enough for that.\nSo, that amounts to saying that I still believe BML has a useful role in life. We still have some of our original trusty users who periodically email us asking for status / updates etc.. \nWhat's the right thing to do? I am quite certain that we can get it open-sourced (I mean from an IBM process point of view), but I haven't yet been convinced that there'd be a willing community for it yet. \nJelly doesn't quite sound the same as BML; BML is strictly a composition language and is not a scripting language. (If you care to read more about the difference I can point you to a paper we wrote and to others' papers.)\nSo, would BML be interesting as an open-source project?

Our group moved on to doing BSF (which is what bo is referring to in the previous post, not BML) and now work on a bunch of Web services stuff.\r\n\r\nSome of the composition ideas in BML went into WSFL as well as its recently announced replacement BPEL4WS. However, neither of those is yet a full replacement for BML. We've always intended to get to a point where one composition language works for various models, including JavaBeans, but the underlying component model of Web services (WSDL, the IBM part of which was also developed by our group) is not yet rich enough for that.\r\n\r\nSo, that amounts to saying that I still believe BML has a useful role in life. We still have some of our original trusty users who periodically email us asking for status / updates etc.. \r\n\r\nWhat's the right thing to do? I am quite certain that we can get it open-sourced (I mean from an IBM process point of view), but I haven't yet been convinced that there'd be a willing community for it yet. \r\n\r\nJelly doesn't quite sound the same as BML; BML is strictly a composition language and is not a scripting language. (If you care to read more about the difference I can point you to a paper we wrote and to others' papers.)\r\n\r\nSo, would BML be interesting as an open-source project? If so, where?\r\n\r\nSanjiva.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083511\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083511\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-15T01:01:47\">2002-08-15T01:01:47</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Well, I saw this message concerning a move of the Bean Scripting Framework to Apache...

    "summary": "<p>So I&apos;ve been in the underworld these past weeks, head down in battle with this project in my return to Java, as I&apos;d written last month.  It&apos;s been great fun, and I&apos;ve not missed perl at all along the way.  (Although, I <i>did</i> miss <a href=\"http://www.cpan.org\">CPAN</a>.)  I&apos;ve raided the stocks of <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org\">Jakarta</a> and other shores, and I&apos;ve flagged <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0107789/\">a few</a> <a href=\"http://blogs.werken.com/people/bob/\">new people</a> <a href=\"http://roller.anthonyeden.com/page/rickard/\">to watch</a> <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0108103/\">on my</a> <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100190/\">daily scan</a>.</p>\n<p>These past 4 weeks or so, it&apos;s amazing to me during how many new or long-neglected (to me) technologies at which I&apos;ve thrown myself, and managed to use productively.  Among them are <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/XML/\">XML</a>, <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/index.html\">Xerces</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt\">XSLT</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath\">XPath</a>, <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/index.html\">Xalan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/\">SVG</a>, <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/batik/index.html\">Batik</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dbxml.org\">Xindice</a>, <a href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net\">JUnit</a>, <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/index.html\">Log4J</a>, <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html\">Ant</a>, <a href=\"http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/bml\">BML</a>, <a href=\"http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf\">BSF</a>, <a href=\"http://www.beanshell.org\">BeanShell</a>, <a href=\"http://www.netbeans.org\">NetBeans</a>, and a slew of others my poor sore brain won&apos;t produce at the moment.  I&apos;ve plucked each of these from the ether and carefully tied them all together into a loosely confederated beast that, surprisingly, works as I&apos;d intended thus far.</p>\n<p>My biggest regret during this voyage is that this beast will likely never roam beyond the fences of my employer&apos;s realm.  But, I still have the new experience with building the beast.  And besides, you&apos;d probably all laugh at the poor thing anyway since its the product of wobbling new steps.  Though, actually, that would be a good thing for my company and myself since some of you might tell me <i>why</i> you&apos;re laughing.</p>\n<p>But, no matter - that&apos;s a political fight I&apos;m not yet prepared to enter here at work, so maybe I can think of other things with which to tinker, out here in the open.</p>\n<p>The Java support in OS X makes me very happy, as does having Java Web Start come installed out of the box.  And so, today I was also happy when I saw <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0107789/stories/2002/08/14/thinrss.html\">ThinRSS</a> and managed to launch it with a click.

    "summary": "<p>So are any of you guys getting itchy?  I&apos;ve had a great Summer all around, but without much hacking or progress on little projects.  And I&apos;ve noticed that there&apos;s been relative quiet and little hacking amongst my reading list&apos;s authors.  Could be that I&apos;m just not looking in the right places - I did lose a few subscriptions in my bounce from Radio to Ampheta for daily use.  But I just don&apos;t see as many daily innovations as I did toward the end of Winter and beginning of Spring.</p>\n<p>As for me, as the nights get longer and things get colder, I&apos;m starting to feel an itch to start tinkering again.  Maybe it has to do with not-yet-dead back-to-school reflexes - summer vacation&apos;s over, and its time to get back to learning and experimenting.  Starting to look again at my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome\">neglected wiki</a>, and of course I&apos;ve started tinkering with my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaDesk outliner skin</a> again.  I&apos;ve also been thinking about my <a hrec=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Projects\">other little projects</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShowReferers\">referrer links</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000192.phtml\">whitelist-based spam filtering</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XML-RPC pipelines</a>, and other things I&apos;ve not touched in months.  </p>\n<p>The fact that I&apos;d not felt like playing with these toys for so long worried me a bit, so the return of the itch is reassuring.  So, I should get back to playing soon.  And, now that <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=deus_x&amp;itemid=180842&amp;nc=12\">my   financial situation has greatly improved</a>, I also need to figure out where to start and to whom I should talk on <i>really</i> heading back to school.</p>\n<p>So Summer has been just a nice, long nap in a hammock.

    "html": "<p>At last:  I had a good solid hacking session with the beast under <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a>, and I think I've flushed out the showstopper bugs.  So, here's yet <i>another</i> release (hopefully <i>zaro boogs</i>) of the thing for you to grab and try:<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/gems/AmphetaOutlines-20020806-2.tar.gz\">AmphetaOutlines-20020806-2.tar.gz</a></li></ul>Thanks for bearing with me out there and not beating me about the head and shoulders.  :)  I mean, yes, it's free and its experimental...  but it's still damn frustrating.</p>\n<p>Basically, the trouble started when I tried to use \"<code>use lib</code>\".  Seems like a reasonable enough request, <code>lib.pm</code> being very much a core part of perl.  But, Morbus hadn't used it anywhere in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, so Perl2EXE cheerfully left it out.  Well, I had to hack by other means, since I wanted this thing to be as drop-in compatible with the current release of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> as possible.</p>\n<p>And then, there were other bits I'd left out.  And also there were the bits that I'd written at 3:30 am the other night and wasn't precisely sure what made it possible for them to actually work anywhere, let alone on my iBook.  But, I think now I've got things under control.</p>\n<p>It makes me appreciate the OS X environment so much more.  OS X is like driving a nice big, fully packed RV that handles like a station wagon down the hacking highway.  On the other hand, Windows is a Ford Festiva with a hole in the floorboards and a nagging suspicion that I forgot something back at the house.  Okay, so that was a bit contrived.  I just wanted to say <i>something</i> smarmy after all this grumbling.  :)</p>\n<p>Is this thing working for anyone yet?! </p>\n<p><b>Update:</b> In case you were wondering, this release should be usable via the original instructions <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000226.phtml\">back here</a>.  Which are, basically:<ol><li>Replace <code>templates/default</code> with this archive's contents.</li><li>Create a directory named <code>channels_meta</code> in your <code>data</code> directory.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">Share and Enjoy</a></li></ol></p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooobbh\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084716\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=53617e52a0ccf29f19c750e312df0f31&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\">Steve</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084716\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-07T03:17:31\">2002-08-07T03:17:31</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Still have some trouble :( Sorry.. \nAmphetadesk opens up ok, the templates are now fine.

Suffice it to say, it'll be in the next version of AmphetaDesk (as well as most of the good stuff from these templates). \nI can't thank l.m.orchard enough for doing these hacks whilst I'm away working on other things.

    "body": "<p>At last:  I had a good solid hacking session with the beast under <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a>, and I think I've flushed out the showstopper bugs.  So, here's yet <i>another</i> release (hopefully <i>zaro boogs</i>) of the thing for you to grab and try:<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/gems/AmphetaOutlines-20020806-2.tar.gz\">AmphetaOutlines-20020806-2.tar.gz</a></li></ul>Thanks for bearing with me out there and not beating me about the head and shoulders.  :)  I mean, yes, it's free and its experimental...  but it's still damn frustrating.</p>\r\n<p>Basically, the trouble started when I tried to use \"<code>use lib</code>\".  Seems like a reasonable enough request, <code>lib.pm</code> being very much a core part of perl.  But, Morbus hadn't used it anywhere in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, so Perl2EXE cheerfully left it out.  Well, I had to hack by other means, since I wanted this thing to be as drop-in compatible with the current release of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> as possible.</p>\r\n<p>And then, there were other bits I'd left out.  And also there were the bits that I'd written at 3:30 am the other night and wasn't precisely sure what made it possible for them to actually work anywhere, let alone on my iBook.  But, I think now I've got things under control.</p>\r\n<p>It makes me appreciate the OS X environment so much more.  OS X is like driving a nice big, fully packed RV that handles like a station wagon down the hacking highway.  On the other hand, Windows is a Ford Festiva with a hole in the floorboards and a nagging suspicion that I forgot something back at the house.  Okay, so that was a bit contrived.  I just wanted to say <i>something</i> smarmy after all this grumbling.  :)</p>\r\n<p>Is this thing working for anyone yet?! </p>\r\n<p><b>Update:</b> In case you were wondering, this release should be usable via the original instructions <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000226.phtml\">back here</a>.

    "summary": "<p>At last:  I had a good solid hacking session with the beast under <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a>, and I think I&apos;ve flushed out the showstopper bugs.  So, here&apos;s yet <i>another</i> release (hopefully <i>zaro boogs</i>) of the thing for you to grab and try:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/gems/AmphetaOutlines-20020806-2.tar.gz\">AmphetaOutlines-20020806-2.tar.gz</a></li></ul>Thanks for bearing with me out there and not beating me about the head and shoulders.  :)  I mean, yes, it&apos;s free and its experimental...  but it&apos;s still damn frustrating.<p></p>\n<p>Basically, the trouble started when I tried to use &quot;<code>use lib</code>&quot;.  Seems like a reasonable enough request, <code>lib.pm</code> being very much a core part of perl.  But, Morbus hadn&apos;t used it anywhere in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, so Perl2EXE cheerfully left it out.  Well, I had to hack by other means, since I wanted this thing to be as drop-in compatible with the current release of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> as possible.</p>\n<p>And then, there were other bits I&apos;d left out.  And also there were the bits that I&apos;d written at 3:30 am the other night and wasn&apos;t precisely sure what made it possible for them to actually work anywhere, let alone on my iBook.  But, I think now I&apos;ve got things under control.</p>\n<p>It makes me appreciate the OS X environment so much more.  OS X is like driving a nice big, fully packed RV that handles like a station wagon down the hacking highway.  On the other hand, Windows is a Ford Festiva with a hole in the floorboards and a nagging suspicion that I forgot something back at the house.  Okay, so that was a bit contrived.  I just wanted to say <i>something</i> smarmy after all this grumbling.  :)</p>\n<p>Is this thing working for anyone yet?! </p>\n<p><b>Update:</b> In case you were wondering, this release should be usable via the original instructions <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000226.phtml\">back here</a>.  Which are, basically:</p><ol><li>Replace <code>templates/default</code> with this archive&apos;s contents.</li><li>Create a directory named <code>channels_meta</code> in your <code>data</code> directory.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">Share and Enjoy</a></li></ol><p></p>\n"

To change thresholds and other settings, you&apos;ll need to edit <code>default/index.html</code> directly for now.  I plan to add some fields to the settings page to manage these settings, eventually.  Also, you really want to have the <code>Digest::MD5</code> perl module installed, but I have included <code>Digest::Perl::MD5</code> in the template.  This means that things will work, but could be much faster.  As for the outlines, give thanks to Marc Barrot for his <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0104487/outlines/activeRenderer.html\">activeRenderer</a> package from which I borrowed nearly all of my outline code.  (The only <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/JavaScript?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">JavaScript</font></span> that&apos;s mine is the expand/collapse all logic.)<p></p>\n<p>Okay, I&apos;m off to lunch.  Let me know how you like it!</p>\n<p><b>Update:</b> It appears that some people are having problems with their <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> failing to find the custom modules I include with the template.  If you have trouble running the template, try copying the contents of <code>templates/default/lib</code> into the <code>lib/</code> directory of your <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> install.</p>\n<p><b>Update 2:</b> I think I&apos;ve fixed the showstoppers, as I will write <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000228.phtml#000228\">here in the future</a>.  So, I&apos;ve taken the liberty of going back in time and replacing the tarball here with the fixed one in case anyone has linked to this story.  Enjoy!</p>\n"
