    "summary": "Caught this snippet on tweeney.com via JOHO: \"...LiveJournal.com (which most weblog news stories overlook for some reason) boasts more than 650,000 [users]...\"\nWhy does everyone seem to ignore LiveJournal?  It's very, very, very rare that I see a LiveJournaller's posts linked into the Blogosphere at large.  Granted, I know that the median user was a 15 year old female who complains about Mom and her boyfriend, when last I checked.  But, as the adage goes: 90% of anything is crap.  There are, nevertheless, a good number of worthwhile streams of narrative in that space.\nOn the other hand, I don't see many of the people behind LJ stepping out and making noise in the Outer Blogosphere either.  I think many of them are just plain busy keeping the site afloat, or having lives, and LJ is world enough for them.\nBut 650,000 users... that's a lot.  More than Radio and rivalling Blogger.com.  Is there a real qualitative difference in writing between the groups?  I would still imagine there's a lot of crap to be found via Blogger.com.  I'm not sure about Radio, though, since I get the impression that the 15 year olds have yet to flood into the userbase and its following seems more tilted toward professionals.\nBut as for the software & service itself...  As far as I can see, LJ is one of the easiest paths out there to starting a weblog/journal online.  And it was one of the first sites I ever encountered that had a desktop-based client app for posting to it.  And, though not prominently placed, they have RSS feeds for every single journal on the site.  They're even working RSS aggregation features into the place by gatewaying external RSS feeds in as special LJ users to be added like any other LJ \"friend\".\nSo, to me, LJ sounds like a top competitor to every other blog/news aggregation product or service out there - yet I rarely hear about it.  Hrm.\nAnyone have a theory why?",

Basic publish/subscribe model.  \nBut the advantage Radio has over MT in this regard is this:  Radio is a persistently running app/server/daemon thing.  MT is a collection of scripts that does nothing until asked to run.  Radio can connect to IM and stay connected.  Something like MT would need to login to an IM service each and every time it wanted to ping.  Maybe that's not such a big deal, really.  I also have a hunch that there would be some difficulties with web hosting sites who don't really want customers emitting IMs from their CGIs.  Maybe not a big deal either.\nJust seems like an impedance mismatch, though.\nWhat I'd like to see is something like this:  An XML-RPC/SOAP <-> IM gateway.  And then, eventually, I'd like to see a decentrallized P2P network with XML-RPC/SOAP entry points that can smoothly replace centralized resources that have XML-RPC/SOAP entry points, maybe using IM networks as one possible rendevous point.

As Dave tells it, his adoption of RSS started in cooperation with Netscape, and the later resulted in his continued support and development after Netscape had wandered away from it and shed the developers responsible.  So from his seat I would think that it looks like RSS was abandoned in his lap and thus he felt free to continue on shaping it toward his own ends, namely those of simplicity and real dirt-under-the-nails use versus further design and planning.\nThen, later RSS 1.0 comes into the picture.  About this point in history I'm fuzzy.  Most accounts and articles I see do not mention how v1.0 came about and who birthed it.  Most of what I've ready just basically says, \"And then there was v1.0\"  But who said so and when and why?\nThat 1.0 has more in common with the v0.9 roots than any of Dave's v0.9x series is clear, so maybe in this respect one could say that this naturally lends v1.0 a \"natural\" claim on the name by virtue of bloodline and original intent.\nOn the other hand, one could also say that Dave's v0.9x series has a claim on the name due to virtue of having actually been in active development directly after the original v0.9.  Call this a claim by virtue of squatting rights?  By virtue of principles of Do-ocracy, as Sam wrote about Apache?\nBut then, on another set of hands belonging to another body altogether, why did Dave keep the RSS name if he was so radically changing the nature of the format by ditching RDF?  (But the history confuses me - I seem to remember that change started when it was still in the hands of Netscape.)\nSo where does that leave things?  Ugh.  Seems like Dave's RSS should be so because he kept the torch burning in the Dark Times.  But it seems like the Other RSS should be so because it's the heir to the original throne.\nThen again, I could have the whole history mixed up.\nI say, everybody get up!  I'll start the music, you all run around, and pick new format names before I hit stop on the CD player.",

This is why I threw this site together, and why I have a link to ReleaseEarlyReleaseOften on the front page.  \nBefore this, I would spend years working on something in silence, only to have it fall over on top of me and end with me never wanting to touch it again.  For almost 2 years, I was working on a Zope replacement in Perl called Iaido before I finally created a ?SourceForge project for it and invited some people in to play.  By then, I was already disgusted with my ugly code, wanted to scrap it and restart, but wasn't nearly enthusiastic enough to do that.  And by then, there was just too much code - and yet too little documentation - for anyone I invited in to really dive in and muck about.\nAnd this project was to be the core of a community site for coders, web designers, and general all around mad scientists.  It would be named ?NinjaCode, at http://www.ninjacode.com.  Well, you can see, the community never got off the ground, and I don't even have a hold on the domain anymore.  It coulda been a contenda.\nBut you can see now, on my Projects page, that I've been gradually working up and spinning out little hacks and widgets.  Eventually, they combine into bigger widgets, like MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin.  I'm thinking that this is the way to go.  And, even if/when I do get a grandiose idea, I need to start off releasing the widgets early and show the build up process here in this weblog.  Then, there's some documentation from the start and maybe even some enthusiastic co-conspirators from the start.",

For the most part, PHPWebHosting has been just fine - they give me SSH access to a shell, about 120MB of space, a few MySQL databases, and generally leave me alone for US$10 per month.  But at this point, the leaving me alone bit isn't working out so well, since the server I'm on over there has had its main disk fill up regularly, thus bringing down all the sites hosted on it (including mine).\nI'd joked a little while ago about getting myself an XServe and finding some affordable colocation.  Now, though, I'm not laughing so much.  I should probably just find another webhost, but it's tempting to have my own server.\nIn the past, I had a few friends at an ISP, so they let me stash a little linux server on their network for occasional favors.  I miss that.  Didn't cost me anything, and my impact on their network was negligible.  Meanwhile, I had a stable, semi-reliable box on the net at which I could point a domain.  Services could catch fire and other things could tank, and no one got hurt.\nThe problem now, though, is that shelling out for a server and colocation costs just to play around is a just a smidgen outside my budget.  As I've pondered before, maybe I could actually host a money-making service on it with some of these hacks I'm percolating through.\nOn the other hand, a co-worker put the idea in my head that it might not be unreasonable to think that I could invite some tenants onto my server to share some of the cost.  I figure I'd take the burden of buying & owning the server, but I'd like to spread the service cost out.  I wouldn't want to make a profit, I'd just like to make a kind of nerd commune.  It'd be nice if I could get the cost for everyone under US$10-15, though I imagine my cost would be higher given a server payment.  If I could get mine below $40-50 a month, I think I'd be happy, though this seems like a pipe dream.\nThe devil being in the details, however, I don't really know how one would go about such a thing, considering service agreements and contracts and taxes and blah blah blah.  I'm a financial moron, and I'm also certainly not into being a 24/7 available customer service rep, or to perform tech help.  Basically, I'd like to run a server to host mad scientist experiments performed by a relatively small cadre of mad scientists who can mostly clean up after themselves.  I'd like to run an IRC server, maybe a Jabber server, maybe a few random half-baked server ideas.\nOn the other other hand, is anyone out there doing this already and want a new tenant?  :)",

What disturbs me is that the grumbling quickly ends with:Bill -- I'm going to unsubscribe from this list now. The neener boys are in charge. Take care. DaveNow first of all, I too disagree with Dave's definition, and have posted as much.  Although I did so in a less rant-mode manner, both Morbus and I pointed to the fact that the news aggregator definition served the goals of Radio 8.0 marketing, being that the definition very specifically identified the features of his own product.  Rant or not, the point is made.\nWhat disappoints me about Dave's response on-list, though, is that instead of addressing the content of the disagreement, he goes after the ranting and hits back with a smidgen of ad-hominem of his own while calling for the \"high road\".  Then, once he's tagged on the ad-hominem he unsubscribes and dismisses the list altogether, never actually acknowledging the original point made.\nNow, though I don't have a link, I've read several times where Dave has disparaged discussion groups and offered linked weblogs as the superior alternative.  I've read his essay on Stop Energy.  I'm aware of his position toward the grousings and grumblings and flamings that go on within a discussion group.  And I've nodded my head almost every time he's written about these things - freeform discussions on the net can sometimes - but not always - be a clusterfuck of morons and Stop Energy.\nMaybe it's just because Dave is so intolerably fed up with any hint of a clusterfuck that he dropped off the list.  I wouldn't put up with much shit either, especially after heart surgery.  But to me it looked like pretty defensive behavior right from the get-go.  Morbus even gave somewhat of an apology (for him :) ) and moved on to politely hit the issues.\nI guess this bugs me a bit, along with other UserLand-related thoughts I've had lately, for this reason:  Here's a discussion group devoted to the very nature and future of one of the headline features of RadioUserLand.  And the people there are some of the most prevalent names I've seen appear time and time again in relation ot the subject.  I would think that this would be a dream group for him, in terms of driving and benefiting from innovation.  Instead, it takes only a small amount of rant to drive him away.\nSee, I've never met him, but I think I'd like Dave personally.  Yes, I know his writings often have one foot or both feet in marketing for his products.  But, I can't recall his denying this, and I see it as the natural behavior of someone who really thinks he's got something hot.  He gives favor to his customers in his posts, and he has his own opinions.  But I know these things, and I still like his software, and I still buy it.\nOn the other hand, it's clear that sometimes he doesn't give equal time to points which may be contradictory or unfavorable to his side of things, and sometimes he gets things wrong.  But he's not a journallist - he's a blogger who writes from the hip and sees what flies.  Whether he lies outright is another story I haven't the first inclination to follow up on, but the very nature of his product stands to check and balance to him there.  He can't get away with too much with his own customers calling him on things.\nAnyway, I'm starting to ramble.  What really bothers me about the quick dismissal of the list seems like a \"See?! This is what I mean!\" demonstration on-list, and I almost expect a post later again promoting weblogs over DG's altogether.  But I didn't even see him give the list a chance, and I think that's sad given the brain power in that roster.  Granted, it's his perogative to have slim thresholds for annoyance, but I'd think this would be value for his company and product.  As I said, I like his software, but he's refusing free help and consultation on the future of his product.  I see those involved in groups like this taking their products beyond his, even those that were originally direct clones of his.  Maybe this ends up tying into his grousing on Open Source versus commercial software eventually.\nOn the other hand, maybe he just thinks he doesn't need any help of this sort and has the sheer magnitude of innovational mojo to leave us all in the dust.  If so, rock on.  :)  As for me, I just joined the list.",

    "summary": "Last week, after reading what Mark Pilgrim had to say about macros in MovableType, I made a mental note to finally circle back around to hacking together my WeblogWithWiki now that MovableType has plugin features.\nTurns out it was so much easier than I thought it would be.  MovableType's plugin scheme is dead simple, which hopefully means that plugins will flourish like mad.\nFirst, I hacked together MTWikiFormatPlugin.  This plugin simply implements a new container tag, MTWikiFormat, which runs the contents of the tag through CPAN:Text::WikiFormat.  This doesn't actually integrate with any existing wiki, but it is very simple to install and does bring some wiki-ness to blog entries, including some limited formatting and Wiki:WikiWords.  This doesn't provide everything Mark had posted in a lil wishlist comment to me, but it's a start.  Maybe I'll look into tearing the formatting guts out of some wiki to make a Text::WikiFormat replacement, or maybe I'll submit patches to the original module.\nThe second plugin though, MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin, is what I'm really happy about.  \nWhereas MTWikiFormatPlugin filters content through one perl module, MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin can filter content through one or more XmlRpcFilteringPipe interfaces.  I have a handful of these filters available on my site right now, and in a little while I will catalog them in the wiki.  For now, I'm just filtering this entry through DecafbadWiki.  In the future, I may get more adventurous with my content filtering pipeline.\nOne drawback to using MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin for the purposes of a WeblogWithWiki is that I've only got support for TWiki so far in my XmlRpcToWiki project.  Other wikis still need some hacking before they can provide filters.  Some assembly required, fellow AlphaGeeks.\nSo, ShareAndEnjoy.  Time for bed.",

I am quite certain that we can get it open-sourced (I mean from an IBM process point of view), but I haven't yet been convinced that there'd be a willing community for it yet.This tells me that there's still some life left in the project, so I certainly won't be running off to release my unauthorized decompilation.  Besides respect of ownership and authorship, it'd be nice to see a sanctioned release of the real code, comments and all.  \nSanjiva asks what to do and who wants it.  I say:  Gimme, and I want it!  But of course there's more, in terms of effort and consideration, to an Open Source project than that.  So, where's the interest (besides me) to make it worth doing?\nI'm not sure.  Seems very nifty to me, but again, I see barely a mention on Google.  But, I look at Thinlet buzz that recently bubbled through my news scan, with raves about the XML wiring for GUI and quickness in assembling apps.  It's very cool.

Pretty much what I expected, given that Mocha is a relic these days.\nBut then, I noticed JODE, a few search results down the page.  Google's description said, \"Java decompiler with full source code. Supports inner/anonymous classes...\"  Well, inner/anonymous classes are new to me since I was last very active with Java.  (Yes, I know, that's been awhile.)  So I figured I'd check JODE out.  Besides, the last release of JODE looked newer than the last release of BML.\nMuch to my surprise, JODE consumed the BML jar file directly and gave me a directory full of source without a complaint.  For the hell of it, I compiled everything there, and made a new jar file from the results.  I cleaned my project out, replaced the original BML jar with my new decompiled-recompiled archive and...  everything worked just fine.\nSkimming through the various source files JODE gave me, things look surprisingly less ugly than I'd expected.  Of course comments are nowhere to be seen, and variable names are nothing like the original would have been, but the source was is still readable and I can follow it.  So this means I have the source code to BML now, after a fashion.\nSo my question now is... I read the IBM ALPHAWORKS COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT which came with the original download, and I see these paragraphs:Permission to reproduce and create derivative works from the Software (\"Software Derivative Works\") is hereby granted to you under the copyrights of International Business Machines Corporation (\"IBM\"). IBM also grants you the right to distribute the Software and Software Derivative Works.\nYou grant IBM a world-wide, royalty-free right to use, copy, distribute, sublicense and prepare derivative works based upon any feedback, including materials, error corrections, Software Derivatives, enhancements, suggestions and the like that you provide to IBM relating to the Software.Does this mean, basically, that it's okay for me to distribute this source as a derivative work, with various potential enhancements, &etc, as long as IBM is still able to grab a copy of it back from me with no strings attached?  If so, that's great.\nMy only other question remaining, though, is whether or not my naivete toward Java has me yet to find what the community at large considers the Right Way to work with ?JavaBeans.  Because, this BML thing seems great to me, but it seems to have gotten next to zero attention.  This usually tells me that I'm missing something, but the thing itself works nicely.\nAny thoughts out there in the blogosphere?",

    "summary": "Ack.  Okay, so I started tinkering with Bean Markup Language as the configuration glue for my Java app.  So far it seems to be working very nicely and doing everything I want it to do.  The problem, though, is that as I look around for examples and things I notice that it seems as if this project is dead.  I look further, and I realize...  I can't find any source code to this thing.  And here I am working it into the core of my app.\nWell, I'd hate to start over and reinvent this wheel, since it seems to be such a nice wheel.  Between the clean definition of beans and their properties, and the ability to toss little bits of script (using the BSF) in there to further tweak things, it seems perfect.  But the apparent abandonment of the project and my lack of source gives me the willies.\nSo...  Does anyone out there know anything about what's happened with the Bean Markup Language project?  Could anyone get me the source?  Or, could someone point me to an equivalent alternative?  Because, if I can't find source or an equally powerful alternative, I'm tossing around the notion of re-implementing BML with a clone project if the license doesn't prohibit it.\nOr am I completely crazy and barking up the wrong tree to begin with?  Is there a better, more elegant way to create and connect Java components together than this?  And is it free?",

    "summary": "So I've been in the underworld these past weeks, head down in battle with this project in my return to Java, as I'd written last month.  It's been great fun, and I've not missed perl at all along the way.  (Although, I did miss CPAN.)  I've raided the stocks of Jakarta and other shores, and I've flagged a few new people to watch on my daily scan.\nThese past 4 weeks or so, it's amazing to me during how many new or long-neglected (to me) technologies at which I've thrown myself, and managed to use productively.  Among them are XML, Xerces, XSLT, XPath, Xalan, SVG, Batik, Xindice, JUnit, Log4J, Ant, BML, BSF, BeanShell, NetBeans, and a slew of others my poor sore brain won't produce at the moment.  I've plucked each of these from the ether and carefully tied them all together into a loosely confederated beast that, surprisingly, works as I'd intended thus far.\nMy biggest regret during this voyage is that this beast will likely never roam beyond the fences of my employer's realm.  But, I still have the new experience with building the beast.  And besides, you'd probably all laugh at the poor thing anyway since its the product of wobbling new steps.  Though, actually, that would be a good thing for my company and myself since some of you might tell me why you're laughing.\nBut, no matter - that's a political fight I'm not yet prepared to enter here at work, so maybe I can think of other things with which to tinker, out here in the open.\nThe Java support in OS X makes me very happy, as does having Java Web Start come installed out of the box.  And so, today I was also happy when I saw ThinRSS and managed to launch it with a click.  I'd been musing about maybe doing a news aggregator in Java, but AmphetaDesk works fine and I've got some hack time invested in the fun outliner skin.  But this really makes me want to do something with Thinlet.  Possibilities abound.\nI've also started toying with an XPath-to-RSS scraper to replace my ?RssDistiller usage.  I know that there's a Python-based one out there, xpath2rss, but I've yet to quite figure it out and I feel like tinkering on my own anyway.  So far I've pulled in JTidy, Xalan, Xerces, and JUnit to help.  Amazingly, to me, everything seems to be working pretty well.\nAnyway, back to the day's work, but I figured I'd ramble a bit and share my recent fun since I've been largely quiet around here.  Hopefully I'll be back soon with updates to the AmphetaDesk outline skin, and with a new toy scraper project.",

    "summary": "So are any of you guys getting itchy?  I've had a great Summer all around, but without much hacking or progress on little projects.  And I've noticed that there's been relative quiet and little hacking amongst my reading list's authors.  Could be that I'm just not looking in the right places - I did lose a few subscriptions in my bounce from Radio to Ampheta for daily use.  But I just don't see as many daily innovations as I did toward the end of Winter and beginning of Spring.\nAs for me, as the nights get longer and things get colder, I'm starting to feel an itch to start tinkering again.  Maybe it has to do with not-yet-dead back-to-school reflexes - summer vacation's over, and its time to get back to learning and experimenting.  Starting to look again at my neglected wiki, and of course I've started tinkering with my AmphetaDesk outliner skin again.  I've also been thinking about my other little projects, referrer links, whitelist-based spam filtering, XML-RPC pipelines, and other things I've not touched in months.  \nThe fact that I'd not felt like playing with these toys for so long worried me a bit, so the return of the itch is reassuring.  So, I should get back to playing soon.  And, now that my   financial situation has greatly improved, I also need to figure out where to start and to whom I should talk on really heading back to school.\nSo Summer has been just a nice, long nap in a hammock.  Time to start making the coffee.  (Not decaf, of course.)",

    "summary": "At last:  I had a good solid hacking session with the beast under WinXP, and I think I've flushed out the showstopper bugs.  So, here's yet another release (hopefully zaro boogs) of the thing for you to grab and try:AmphetaOutlines-20020806-2.tar.gzThanks for bearing with me out there and not beating me about the head and shoulders.  :)  I mean, yes, it's free and its experimental...  but it's still damn frustrating.\nBasically, the trouble started when I tried to use \"use lib\".  Seems like a reasonable enough request, lib.pm being very much a core part of perl.  But, Morbus hadn't used it anywhere in AmphetaDesk, so Perl2EXE cheerfully left it out.  Well, I had to hack by other means, since I wanted this thing to be as drop-in compatible with the current release of AmphetaDesk as possible.\nAnd then, there were other bits I'd left out.  And also there were the bits that I'd written at 3:30 am the other night and wasn't precisely sure what made it possible for them to actually work anywhere, let alone on my iBook.  But, I think now I've got things under control.\nIt makes me appreciate the OS X environment so much more.  OS X is like driving a nice big, fully packed RV that handles like a station wagon down the hacking highway.  On the other hand, Windows is a Ford Festiva with a hole in the floorboards and a nagging suspicion that I forgot something back at the house.  Okay, so that was a bit contrived.  I just wanted to say something smarmy after all this grumbling.  :)\nIs this thing working for anyone yet?! \nUpdate: In case you were wondering, this release should be usable via the original instructions back here.

To change thresholds and other settings, you'll need to edit default/index.html directly for now.  I plan to add some fields to the settings page to manage these settings, eventually.  Also, you really want to have the Digest::MD5 perl module installed, but I have included Digest::Perl::MD5 in the template.  This means that things will work, but could be much faster.  As for the outlines, give thanks to Marc Barrot for his activeRenderer package from which I borrowed nearly all of my outline code.  (The only ?JavaScript that's mine is the expand/collapse all logic.)\nOkay, I'm off to lunch.  Let me know how you like it!\nUpdate: It appears that some people are having problems with their AmphetaDesk failing to find the custom modules I include with the template.  If you have trouble running the template, try copying the contents of templates/default/lib into the lib/ directory of your AmphetaDesk install.\nUpdate 2: I think I've fixed the showstoppers, as I will write here in the future.  So, I've taken the liberty of going back in time and replacing the tarball here with the fixed one in case anyone has linked to this story.  Enjoy!",
