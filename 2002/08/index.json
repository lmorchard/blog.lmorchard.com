It's very, very, very rare that I see a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournaller\">LiveJournaller</a>'s posts linked into the Blogosphere at large.  Granted, I know that the median user was a 15 year old female who complains about Mom and her boyfriend, when last I checked.  But, as the adage goes: 90% of anything is crap.  There are, nevertheless, a good number of worthwhile streams of narrative in that space.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I don't see many of the people behind LJ stepping out and making noise in the Outer Blogosphere either.  I think many of them are just plain busy keeping the site afloat, or having lives, and LJ is world enough for them.</p>\n<p>But 650,000 users... that's a lot.  More than Radio and rivalling Blogger.com.  Is there a real qualitative difference in writing between the groups?  I would still imagine there's a lot of crap to be found via Blogger.com.  I'm not sure about Radio, though, since I get the impression that the 15 year olds have yet to flood into the userbase and its following seems more tilted toward professionals.</p>\n<p>But as for the software &amp; service itself...  As far as I can see, LJ is one of the easiest paths out there to starting a weblog/journal online.  And it was one of the first sites I ever encountered that had a desktop-based client app for posting to it.  And, though not prominently placed, they have <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds for every single journal on the site.  They're even working <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> aggregation features into the place by gatewaying external <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds in as special LJ users to be added like any other LJ \"friend\".</p>\n<p>So, to me, LJ sounds like a top competitor to every other blog/news aggregation product or service out there - yet I rarely hear about it.  Hrm.</p>\n<p>Anyone have a theory why?</p>\n",

MT is a collection of scripts that does nothing until asked to run.  Radio can connect to IM and stay connected.  Something like MT would need to login to an IM service each and every time it wanted to ping.  Maybe that's not such a big deal, really.  I also have a hunch that there would be some difficulties with web hosting sites who don't really want customers emitting IMs from their CGIs.  Maybe not a big deal either.</p>\n<p>Just seems like an impedance mismatch, though.</p>\n<p>What I'd like to see is something like this:  An XML-RPC/SOAP &lt;-&gt; IM gateway.  And then, eventually, I'd like to see a decentrallized P2P network with XML-RPC/SOAP entry points that can smoothly replace centralized resources that have XML-RPC/SOAP entry points, maybe using IM networks as one possible rendevous point.

So from his seat I would think that it looks like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> was abandoned in his lap and thus he felt free to continue on shaping it toward his own ends, namely those of simplicity and real dirt-under-the-nails use versus further design and planning.</p>\n<p>Then, later <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 comes into the picture.  About this point in history I'm fuzzy.  Most accounts and articles I see do not mention how v1.0 came about and who birthed it.  Most of what I've ready just basically says, \"And then there was v1.0\"  But who said so and when and why?</p>\n<p>That 1.0 has more in common with the v0.9 roots than any of Dave's v0.9x series is clear, so maybe in this respect one could say that this naturally lends v1.0 a \"natural\" claim on the name by virtue of bloodline and original intent.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, one could also say that Dave's v0.9x series has a claim on the name due to virtue of having actually been in active development directly after the original v0.9.  Call this a claim by virtue of squatting rights?  By virtue of principles of <a href=\"http://www.libertyforall.net/2002/archive/do-ocracy.html\">Do-ocracy</a>, as <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/2002/05/07.html#a454\">Sam wrote about Apache</a>?</p>\n<p>But then, on another set of hands belonging to another body altogether, why did Dave keep the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> name if he was so radically changing the nature of the format by ditching <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a>?  (But the history confuses me - I seem to remember that change started when it was still in the hands of Netscape.)</p>\n<p>So where does that leave things?  Ugh.  Seems like Dave's <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> should be so because he kept the torch burning in the Dark Times.  But it seems like the Other <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> should be so because it's the heir to the original throne.</p>\n<p>Then again, I could have the whole history mixed up.</p>\n<p>I say, everybody get up!  I'll start the music, you all run around, and pick new format names before I hit stop on the CD player.<br>\n</p>\n",

For almost 2 years, I was working on a <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/iaido\">Zope replacement in Perl called Iaido</a> before I finally created a <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/SourceForge?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">SourceForge</font></span> project for it and invited some people in to play.  By then, I was already disgusted with my ugly code, wanted to scrap it and restart, but wasn't nearly enthusiastic enough to do that.  And by then, there was just too much code - and yet too little documentation - for anyone I invited in to really dive in and muck about.</p>\n<p>And <strong>this</strong> project was to be the core of a community site for coders, web designers, and general all around mad scientists.  It would be named <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/NinjaCode?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">NinjaCode</font></span>, at <a href=\"http://www.ninjacode.com\" target=\"_top\">http://www.ninjacode.com</a>.  Well, you can see, the community never got off the ground, and I don't even have a hold on the domain anymore.  It coulda been a contenda.</p>\n<p>But you can see now, on my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Projects\">Projects</a> page, that I've been gradually working up and spinning out little hacks and widgets.  Eventually, they combine into bigger widgets, like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a>.  I'm thinking that this is the way to go.  And, even if/when I do get a grandiose idea, I need to start off releasing the widgets early and show the build up process here in this weblog.  Then, there's some documentation from the start and maybe even some enthusiastic co-conspirators from the start.</p>\n",

For the most part, <a href=\"http://www.phpwebhosting.com\">PHPWebHosting</a> has been just fine - they give me SSH access to a shell, about 120MB of space, a few <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MySQL\">MySQL</a> databases, and generally leave me alone for US$10 per month.  But at this point, the leaving me alone bit isn't working out so well, since the server I'm on over there has had its main disk fill up regularly, thus bringing down all the sites hosted on it (including mine).</p>\n<p>I'd <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000245.phtml\">joked a little while ago</a> about getting myself an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XServe\">XServe</a> and finding some affordable colocation.  Now, though, I'm not laughing so much.  I should probably just find another webhost, but it's tempting to have my own server.</p>\n<p>In the past, I had a few friends at an ISP, so they let me stash a little linux server on their network for occasional favors.  I miss that.  Didn't cost me anything, and my impact on their network was negligible.  Meanwhile, I had a stable, semi-reliable box on the net at which I could point a domain.  Services could catch fire and other things could tank, and no one got hurt.</p>\n<p>The problem now, though, is that shelling out for a server and colocation costs just to play around is a just a <strong>smidgen</strong> outside my budget.  As I've pondered before, maybe I could actually host a money-making service on it with some of these hacks I'm percolating through.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a co-worker put the idea in my head that it might not be unreasonable to think that I could invite some tenants onto my server to share some of the cost.  I figure I'd take the burden of buying &amp; owning the server, but I'd like to spread the service cost out.  I wouldn't want to make a profit, I'd just like to make a kind of nerd commune.  It'd be nice if I could get the cost for everyone under US$10-15, though I imagine my cost would be higher given a server payment.  If I could get mine below $40-50 a month, I think I'd be happy, though this seems like a pipe dream.</p>\n<p>The devil being in the details, however, I don't really know how one would go about such a thing, considering service agreements and contracts and taxes and blah blah blah.  I'm a financial moron, and I'm also certainly not into being a 24/7 available customer service rep, or to perform tech help.  Basically, I'd like to run a server to host mad scientist experiments performed by a relatively small cadre of mad scientists who can mostly clean up after themselves.  I'd like to run an IRC server, maybe a Jabber server, maybe a few random half-baked server ideas.</p>\n<p>On the other other hand, is anyone out there doing this already and want a new tenant?  :)</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>Scanning news today, I see in my referrers a link from the <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aggregators/\">new aggregators discussion group</a> to my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000228.phtml\">outliner </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> skin.  Curious, I go <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aggregators/message/44?threaded=1\">check it out</a> and see what looks like a bit of grumbling between <a href=\"http://www.scripting.com\">Dave Winer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com\">Morbus Iff</a>.  I make my way back to <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aggregators/message/42\">near the head of the thread</a> to see what's what, where I find a link to Morbus' <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/dnn/2002/06/index.shtml#001333\">post of opinioned and somewhat ranty disagreement</a> toward <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com/whatIsANewsAggregator\">Dave's definition of the modern News Aggregator</a>.  What disturbs me is that the grumbling <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aggregators/message/48\">quickly ends</a> with:</p><blockquote><i>Bill -- I'm going to unsubscribe from this list now. The neener boys are in charge. Take care. Dave</i></blockquote>Now first of all, I too <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000191.phtml\">disagree with Dave's definition</a>, and have posted as much.  Although I did so in a less rant-mode manner, both Morbus and I pointed to the fact that the news aggregator definition served the goals of Radio 8.0 marketing, being that the definition very specifically identified the features of his own product.  Rant or not, the point is made.<p></p>\n<p>What disappoints me about Dave's response on-list, though, is that instead of addressing the content of the disagreement, he goes after the ranting and hits back with a smidgen of ad-hominem of his own while calling for the \"high road\".  Then, once he's tagged on the ad-hominem he unsubscribes and dismisses the list altogether, never actually acknowledging the original point made.</p>\n<p>Now, though I don't have a link, I've read several times where Dave has disparaged discussion groups and offered linked weblogs as the superior alternative.  I've read his essay on <a href=\"http://www.userland.com/whatIsStopEnergy\">Stop Energy</a>.  I'm aware of his position toward the grousings and grumblings and flamings that go on within a discussion group.  And I've nodded my head almost every time he's written about these things - freeform discussions on the net can sometimes - but not always - be a clusterfuck of morons and Stop Energy.</p>\n<p>Maybe it's just because Dave is so intolerably fed up with <i>any</i> hint of a clusterfuck that he dropped off the list.  I wouldn't put up with much shit either, especially after heart surgery.  But to me it looked like pretty defensive behavior right from the get-go.  Morbus even gave somewhat of an apology (for him :) ) and moved on to politely hit the issues.</p>\n<p>I guess this bugs me a bit, along with other <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>-related thoughts I've had lately, for this reason:  Here's a discussion group devoted to the very nature and future of one of the headline features of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand\">RadioUserLand</a>.  And the people there are some of the most prevalent names I've seen appear time and time again in relation ot the subject.  I would think that this would be a dream group for him, in terms of driving and benefiting from innovation.  Instead, it takes only a small amount of rant to drive him away.</p>\n<p>See, I've never met him, but I think I'd like Dave personally.  Yes, I know his writings often have one foot or both feet in marketing for his products.  But, I can't recall his denying this, and I see it as the natural behavior of someone who really thinks he's got something hot.  He gives favor to his customers in his posts, and he has his own opinions.  But I know these things, and I still like his software, and I still buy it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it's clear that sometimes he doesn't give equal time to points which may be contradictory or unfavorable to his side of things, and sometimes he gets things wrong.  But he's not a journallist - he's a blogger who writes from the hip and sees what flies.  Whether he lies outright is another story I haven't the first inclination to follow up on, but the very nature of his product stands to check and balance to him there.  He can't get away with too much with his own customers calling him on things.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm starting to ramble.  What really bothers me about the quick dismissal of the list seems like a \"See?! This is what I mean!\" demonstration on-list, and I almost expect a post later again promoting weblogs over DG's altogether.  But I didn't even see him give the list a chance, and I think that's sad given the brain power in that roster.  Granted, it's his perogative to have slim thresholds for annoyance, but I'd think this would be value for his company and product.  As I said, I like his software, but he's refusing free help and consultation on the future of his product.  I see those involved in groups like this taking their products beyond his, even those that were originally direct clones of his.  Maybe this ends up tying into his grousing on Open Source versus commercial software eventually.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, maybe he just thinks he doesn't need any help of this sort and has the sheer magnitude of innovational mojo to leave us all in the dust.  If so, rock on.  :)  As for me, I just joined the list.</p>\n",

This plugin simply implements a new container tag, MTWikiFormat, which runs the contents of the tag through <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=all&amp;query=Text::WikiFormat\" title=\"CPAN search for Text::WikiFormat\">CPAN:Text::WikiFormat</a>.  This doesn't actually integrate with any existing wiki, but it is very simple to install and does bring some wiki-ness to blog entries, including some limited formatting and <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWords\" title=\"'WikiWords' on the original 'WikiWikiWeb' site\">Wiki:WikiWords</a>.  This doesn't provide everything Mark had posted in a lil wishlist comment to me, but it's a start.  Maybe I'll look into tearing the formatting guts out of some wiki to make a Text::WikiFormat replacement, or maybe I'll submit patches to the original module.</p>\n<p>The second plugin though, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a>, is what I'm really happy about.  <br>\nWhereas <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTWikiFormatPlugin\">MTWikiFormatPlugin</a> filters content through one perl module, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> can filter content through one or more <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XmlRpcFilteringPipe</a> interfaces.  I have a handful of these filters available on my site right now, and in a little while I will catalog them in the wiki.  For now, I'm just filtering this entry through <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DecafbadWiki\">DecafbadWiki</a>.  In the future, I may get more adventurous with my content filtering pipeline.</p>\n<p>One drawback to using <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin\">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> for the purposes of a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a> is that I've only got support for TWiki so far in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\">XmlRpcToWiki</a> project.  Other wikis still need some hacking before they can provide filters.  Some assembly required, fellow <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AlphaGeek\">AlphaGeeks</a>.</p>\n<p>So, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.

I got a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000232.phtml#comments\">direct response</a> from one of the two original creators of BML, Sanjiva Weerawarana:</p><blockquote><i>...I still believe BML has a useful role in life.

I am quite certain that we can get it open-sourced (I mean from an IBM process point of view), but I haven't yet been convinced that there'd be a willing community for it yet.</i></p></blockquote>This tells me that there's still some life left in the project, so I certainly won't be running off to release my unauthorized decompilation.  Besides respect of ownership and authorship, it'd be nice to see a sanctioned release of the real code, comments and all.  <p></p>\n<p>Sanjiva asks what to do and who wants it.

But, I look at <a href=\"http://www.thinlet.com/\">Thinlet</a> buzz that recently bubbled through my news scan, with raves about the XML wiring for GUI and quickness in assembling apps.  It's very cool.  And then I wonder how cool might it be to combine the two, or use BML <i>instead</i> of Thinlet.</p>\n<p>Is the lack of interest a product of a lack of word getting out?

    "summary": "<p>Hmm...  The plot thickens a bit for me with regard to the <a href=\"http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/bml\">Bean Markup Language</a> project.  On a whim, I Google'd for a Java decompiler, having remembered that I'd gotten some use and enlightenment back in the day from <a href=\"http://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/computers/mocha.html\">Mocha</a>.  So I found, downloaded, and tried Mocha on the BML class files.  It choked a bit, produced some source files, but the collection as a whole was not trivially easy to recompile.  Pretty much what I expected, given that Mocha is a relic these days.</p>\n<p>But then, I noticed <a href=\"http://jode.sourceforge.net/usage.php\">JODE</a>, a few search results down the page.  Google's description said, \"Java decompiler with full source code. Supports inner/anonymous classes...\"  Well, inner/anonymous classes are new to me since I was last very active with Java.  (Yes, I know, that's been awhile.)  So I figured I'd check JODE out.  Besides, the last release of JODE looked newer than the last release of BML.</p>\n<p>Much to my surprise, JODE consumed the BML jar file directly and gave me a directory full of source without a complaint.  For the hell of it, I compiled everything there, and made a new jar file from the results.  I cleaned my project out, replaced the original BML jar with my new decompiled-recompiled archive and...  <i>everything worked just fine.</i></p>\n<p>Skimming through the various source files JODE gave me, things look surprisingly less ugly than I'd expected.  Of course comments are nowhere to be seen, and variable names are nothing like the original would have been, but the source was is still readable and I can follow it.  So this means I have the source code to BML now, after a fashion.</p>\n<p>So my question now is... I read the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/gems/ibm-alphaworks-license.txt\">IBM ALPHAWORKS COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT</a> which came with the original download, and I see these paragraphs:</p><blockquote><i>Permission to reproduce and create derivative works from the Software (\"Software Derivative Works\") is hereby granted to you under the copyrights of International Business Machines Corporation (\"IBM\"). IBM also grants you the right to distribute the Software and Software Derivative Works.<p></p>\n</i><p><i>You grant IBM a world-wide, royalty-free right to use, copy, distribute, sublicense and prepare derivative works based upon any feedback, including materials, error corrections, Software Derivatives, enhancements, suggestions and the like that you provide to IBM relating to the Software.</i></p></blockquote>Does this mean, basically, that it's okay for me to distribute this source as a derivative work, with various potential enhancements, &amp;etc, as long as IBM is still able to grab a copy of it back from me with no strings attached?  If so, that's great.<p></p>\n<p>My only other question remaining, though, is whether or not my naivete toward Java has me yet to find what the community at large considers the Right Way to work with <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/JavaBeans?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">JavaBeans</font></span>.  Because, this BML thing seems great to me, but it seems to have gotten next to zero attention.  This usually tells me that <i>I'm</i> missing something, but the thing itself works nicely.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts out there in the blogosphere?</p>\n",

Okay, so I started tinkering with <a href=\"http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/bml\">Bean Markup Language</a> as the configuration glue for my Java app.  So far it seems to be working very nicely and doing everything I want it to do.  The problem, though, is that as I look around for examples and things I notice that it seems as if this project is dead.  I look further, and I realize...  <i>I can't find any source code to this thing.</i>  And here I am working it into the core of my app.</p>\n<p>Well, I'd hate to start over and reinvent this wheel, since it seems to be such a nice wheel.  Between the clean definition of beans and their properties, and the ability to toss little bits of script (using the <a href=\"http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf\">BSF</a>) in there to further tweak things, it seems perfect.

    "summary": "<p>So I've been in the underworld these past weeks, head down in battle with this project in my return to Java, as I'd written last month.  It's been great fun, and I've not missed perl at all along the way.  (Although, I <i>did</i> miss <a href=\"http://www.cpan.org\">CPAN</a>.)  I've raided the stocks of <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org\">Jakarta</a> and other shores, and I've flagged <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0107789/\">a few</a> <a href=\"http://blogs.werken.com/people/bob/\">new people</a> <a href=\"http://roller.anthonyeden.com/page/rickard/\">to watch</a> <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0108103/\">on my</a> <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0100190/\">daily scan</a>.</p>\n<p>These past 4 weeks or so, it's amazing to me during how many new or long-neglected (to me) technologies at which I've thrown myself, and managed to use productively.  Among them are <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/XML/\">XML</a>, <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/index.html\">Xerces</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt\">XSLT</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath\">XPath</a>, <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/index.html\">Xalan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/\">SVG</a>, <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/batik/index.html\">Batik</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dbxml.org\">Xindice</a>, <a href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net\">JUnit</a>, <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/index.html\">Log4J</a>, <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html\">Ant</a>, <a href=\"http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/bml\">BML</a>, <a href=\"http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf\">BSF</a>, <a href=\"http://www.beanshell.org\">BeanShell</a>, <a href=\"http://www.netbeans.org\">NetBeans</a>, and a slew of others my poor sore brain won't produce at the moment.  I've plucked each of these from the ether and carefully tied them all together into a loosely confederated beast that, surprisingly, works as I'd intended thus far.</p>\n<p>My biggest regret during this voyage is that this beast will likely never roam beyond the fences of my employer's realm.  But, I still have the new experience with building the beast.  And besides, you'd probably all laugh at the poor thing anyway since its the product of wobbling new steps.  Though, actually, that would be a good thing for my company and myself since some of you might tell me <i>why</i> you're laughing.</p>\n<p>But, no matter - that's a political fight I'm not yet prepared to enter here at work, so maybe I can think of other things with which to tinker, out here in the open.</p>\n<p>The Java support in OS X makes me very happy, as does having Java Web Start come installed out of the box.  And so, today I was also happy when I saw <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0107789/stories/2002/08/14/thinrss.html\">ThinRSS</a> and managed to launch it with a click.  I'd been musing about maybe doing a news aggregator in Java, but <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> works fine and I've got some hack time invested in the fun outliner skin.  But this really makes me want to do something with <a href=\"http://www.thinlet.com\">Thinlet</a>.  Possibilities abound.</p>\n<p>I've also started toying with an XPath-to-RSS scraper to replace my <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/RssDistiller?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">RssDistiller</font></span> usage.  I know that there's a Python-based one out there, <a href=\"http://www.mnot.net/xpath2rss/\">xpath2rss</a>, but I've yet to quite figure it out and I feel like tinkering on my own anyway.  So far I've pulled in <a href=\"http://lempinen.net/sami/jtidy/\">JTidy</a>, Xalan, Xerces, and JUnit to help.  Amazingly, to me, everything seems to be working pretty well.</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to the day's work, but I figured I'd ramble a bit and share my recent fun since I've been largely quiet around here.  Hopefully I'll be back soon with updates to the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> outline skin, and with a new toy scraper project.</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>So are any of you guys getting itchy?  I've had a great Summer all around, but without much hacking or progress on little projects.  And I've noticed that there's been relative quiet and little hacking amongst my reading list's authors.  Could be that I'm just not looking in the right places - I did lose a few subscriptions in my bounce from Radio to Ampheta for daily use.  But I just don't see as many daily innovations as I did toward the end of Winter and beginning of Spring.</p>\n<p>As for me, as the nights get longer and things get colder, I'm starting to feel an itch to start tinkering again.  Maybe it has to do with not-yet-dead back-to-school reflexes - summer vacation's over, and its time to get back to learning and experimenting.  Starting to look again at my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome\">neglected wiki</a>, and of course I've started tinkering with my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaDesk outliner skin</a> again.  I've also been thinking about my <a hrec=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Projects\">other little projects</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShowReferers\">referrer links</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000192.phtml\">whitelist-based spam filtering</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XML-RPC pipelines</a>, and other things I've not touched in months.  </p>\n<p>The fact that I'd not felt like playing with these toys for so long worried me a bit, so the return of the itch is reassuring.  So, I should get back to playing soon.  And, now that <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=deus_x&amp;itemid=180842&amp;nc=12\">my   financial situation has greatly improved</a>, I also need to figure out where to start and to whom I should talk on <i>really</i> heading back to school.</p>\n<p>So Summer has been just a nice, long nap in a hammock.  Time to start making the coffee.  (Not decaf, of course.)</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>At last:  I had a good solid hacking session with the beast under <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a>, and I think I've flushed out the showstopper bugs.  So, here's yet <i>another</i> release (hopefully <i>zaro boogs</i>) of the thing for you to grab and try:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/gems/AmphetaOutlines-20020806-2.tar.gz\">AmphetaOutlines-20020806-2.tar.gz</a></li></ul>Thanks for bearing with me out there and not beating me about the head and shoulders.  :)  I mean, yes, it's free and its experimental...  but it's still damn frustrating.<p></p>\n<p>Basically, the trouble started when I tried to use \"<code>use lib</code>\".  Seems like a reasonable enough request, <code>lib.pm</code> being very much a core part of perl.  But, Morbus hadn't used it anywhere in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, so Perl2EXE cheerfully left it out.  Well, I had to hack by other means, since I wanted this thing to be as drop-in compatible with the current release of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> as possible.</p>\n<p>And then, there were other bits I'd left out.  And also there were the bits that I'd written at 3:30 am the other night and wasn't precisely sure what made it possible for them to actually work anywhere, let alone on my iBook.  But, I think now I've got things under control.</p>\n<p>It makes me appreciate the OS X environment so much more.  OS X is like driving a nice big, fully packed RV that handles like a station wagon down the hacking highway.  On the other hand, Windows is a Ford Festiva with a hole in the floorboards and a nagging suspicion that I forgot something back at the house.  Okay, so that was a bit contrived.  I just wanted to say <i>something</i> smarmy after all this grumbling.  :)</p>\n<p>Is this thing working for anyone yet?! </p>\n<p><b>Update:</b> In case you were wondering, this release should be usable via the original instructions <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000226.phtml\">back here</a>.  Which are, basically:</p><ol><li>Replace <code>templates/default</code> with this archive's contents.</li><li>Create a directory named <code>channels_meta</code> in your <code>data</code> directory.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">Share and Enjoy</a></li></ol><p></p>\n",

To change thresholds and other settings, you'll need to edit <code>default/index.html</code> directly for now.  I plan to add some fields to the settings page to manage these settings, eventually.

This means that things will work, but could be much faster.  As for the outlines, give thanks to Marc Barrot for his <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0104487/outlines/activeRenderer.html\">activeRenderer</a> package from which I borrowed nearly all of my outline code.

If you have trouble running the template, try copying the contents of <code>templates/default/lib</code> into the <code>lib/</code> directory of your <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> install.</p>\n<p><b>Update 2:</b> I think I've fixed the showstoppers, as I will write <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000228.phtml#000228\">here in the future</a>.  So, I've taken the liberty of going back in time and replacing the tarball here with the fixed one in case anyone has linked to this story.  Enjoy!</p>\n",
