I got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000232.phtml#comments&quot;&gt;direct response&lt;/a&gt; from one of the two original creators of BML, Sanjiva Weerawarana:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;...I still believe BML has a useful role in life. We still have some of our original trusty users who periodically email us asking for status / updates etc..&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What&amp;apos;s the right thing to do? I am quite certain that we can get it open-sourced (I mean from an IBM process point of view), but I haven&amp;apos;t yet been convinced that there&amp;apos;d be a willing community for it yet.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This tells me that there&amp;apos;s still some life left in the project, so I certainly won&amp;apos;t be running off to release my unauthorized decompilation.  Besides respect of ownership and authorship, it&amp;apos;d be nice to see a sanctioned release of the real code, comments and all.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanjiva asks what to do and who wants it.  I say:  Gimme, and I want it!  But of course there&amp;apos;s more, in terms of effort and consideration, to an Open Source project than that.  So, where&amp;apos;s the interest (besides me) to make it worth doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;m not sure.  Seems very nifty to me, but again, I see barely a mention on Google.  But, I look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinlet.com/&quot;&gt;Thinlet&lt;/a&gt; buzz that recently bubbled through my news scan, with raves about the XML wiring for GUI and quickness in assembling apps.  It&amp;apos;s very cool.  And then I wonder how cool might it be to combine the two, or use BML &lt;i&gt;instead&lt;/i&gt; of Thinlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the lack of interest a product of a lack of word getting out?  Or, again, have I missed something in my return to the world of Java?&lt;/p&gt;

<div class="content">I agree that BML was very interesting when I last looked at it...
As an aside, I have noticed that quite a few "very cool" projects at IBM AlphaWorks don't get the tech buzz they deserve... I'm thinking specifically of http://sash.alphaworks.com</div>

<div class="content">You might wonna check out Luxor - a GPL'ed XUL toolkit in Java - that is more ambitious than Thinlets or BeanML. 
Luxor goal is to make building cross-platform desktop apps as easy as web pages. Find out more at http://luxor-xul.sourceforge.net
I also keep a XUL blog entitled "The Richmond Post" - Chronicle of the XUL Revolution - online at http://luxor-xul.sourceforge.net/post/</div>
