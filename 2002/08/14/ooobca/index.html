        <meta property="og:description" content="So I&#39;ve been in the underworld these past weeks, head down in battle with this project in my return to Java, as I&#39;d written last month.  It&#39;s been great fun, and I&#39;ve not missed perl at all along the way.  (Although, I did miss CPAN.)  I&#39;ve raided the stocks of Jakarta and other shores, and I&#39;ve flagged a few new people to watch on my daily scan.
These past 4 weeks or so, it&#39;s amazing to me during how many new or long-neglected (to me) technologies at which I&#39;ve thrown myself, and managed to use productively.  Among them are XML, Xerces, XSLT, XPath, Xalan, SVG, Batik, Xindice, JUnit, Log4J, Ant, BML, BSF, BeanShell, NetBeans, and a slew of others my poor sore brain won&#39;t produce at the moment.  I&#39;ve plucked each of these from the ether and carefully tied them all together into a loosely confederated beast that, surprisingly, works as I&#39;d intended thus far.
My biggest regret during this voyage is that this beast will likely never roam beyond the fences of my employer&#39;s realm.  But, I still have the new experience with building the beast.  And besides, you&#39;d probably all laugh at the poor thing anyway since its the product of wobbling new steps.  Though, actually, that would be a good thing for my company and myself since some of you might tell me why you&#39;re laughing.
But, no matter - that&#39;s a political fight I&#39;m not yet prepared to enter here at work, so maybe I can think of other things with which to tinker, out here in the open.
The Java support in OS X makes me very happy, as does having Java Web Start come installed out of the box.  And so, today I was also happy when I saw ThinRSS and managed to launch it with a click.  I&#39;d been musing about maybe doing a news aggregator in Java, but AmphetaDesk works fine and I&#39;ve got some hack time invested in the fun outliner skin.  But this really makes me want to do something with Thinlet.  Possibilities abound.
I&#39;ve also started toying with an XPath-to-RSS scraper to replace my ?RssDistiller usage.  I know that there&#39;s a Python-based one out there, xpath2rss, but I&#39;ve yet to quite figure it out and I feel like tinkering on my own anyway.  So far I&#39;ve pulled in JTidy, Xalan, Xerces, and JUnit to help.  Amazingly, to me, everything seems to be working pretty well.
Anyway, back to the day&#39;s work, but I figured I&#39;d ramble a bit and share my recent fun since I&#39;ve been largely quiet around here.  Hopefully I&#39;ll be back soon with updates to the AmphetaDesk outline skin, and with a new toy scraper project." />
