        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Grr again.  As a few of you have told me in email, and as I noticed toward the end of yesterday, my comments feature here is dead.  Seems that as the disk filled up on this server, someone tried leaving a comment, and as Murphy came into play, the comments DB file got corrupted.  The odd thing, and fortunate thing for me anyway, is that I&amp;apos;m still getting the comments emailled to me.  So if/when I get this DB file recovered, or if I wipe it and start over (not happy about that option), I might try re-posting the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got some good pointers on some hosting options and may be checking out one or another of them soon.  Also looks like there are still issues with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines&quot;&gt;AmphetaOutlines&lt;/a&gt;, even after a re-release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More soon.&lt;/p&gt;
