I managed to get an all but complete dump of my &lt;code&gt;comments.db&lt;/code&gt; file with &lt;code&gt;db_dump&lt;/code&gt; on my server, but then nothing would parse or load that file after that.  Banged around with it for awhile until I finally realized how to parse the dump file myself with a perl one-liner and rebuilt the comments DBM file that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after that, I migrated everything to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MySQL&quot;&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt;.  Not a silver bullet, but it seems a better idea than relying on those DBM files.  They seemed neat &amp;amp; clever at first - but now that I have a bit invested here, they&amp;apos;re an annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I managed to recover the last few comments I got while things went wonky, but if I happened to miss one of yours, I&amp;apos;m sorry.  I&amp;apos;m glad I recovered the comments, though, because I tend to think that comments left here are often more valuable than whatever dross I may have spewed in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
