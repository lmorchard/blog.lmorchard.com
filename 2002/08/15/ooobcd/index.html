But, I look at Thinlet buzz that recently bubbled through my news scan, with raves about the XML wiring for GUI and quickness in assembling apps.  It&amp;apos;s very cool.

<div class="content">I agree that BML was very interesting when I last looked at it...
As an aside, I have noticed that quite a few &quot;very cool&quot; projects at IBM AlphaWorks don&#39;t get the tech buzz they deserve... I&#39;m thinking specifically of <a href="http://sash.alphaworks.com">http://sash.alphaworks.com</a></div>

<div class="content">You might wonna check out Luxor - a GPL&#39;ed XUL toolkit in Java - that is more ambitious than Thinlets or BeanML. 
Luxor goal is to make building cross-platform desktop apps as easy as web pages. Find out more at <a href="http://luxor-xul.sourceforge.net">http://luxor-xul.sourceforge.net</a>
I also keep a XUL blog entitled &quot;The Richmond Post&quot; - Chronicle of the XUL Revolution - online at <a href="http://luxor-xul.sourceforge.net/post/">http://luxor-xul.sourceforge.net/post/</a></div>
