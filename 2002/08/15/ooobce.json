Make Movable Type understand wiki-style syntax.  Like complete wiki style.  Structured text.  * for lists.  === for headers.  [] for links.  Auto-paragraphs that actually work (and validate afterwards).  The whole works.

But of course, that leaves users of other wikiclones out.Use Text::WikiFormat  from CPAN, which seems like a nifty self-contained implementation of classic wiki formatting.  This choice, though, leaves MT unconnected to the content in an existing wiki.Use a combination of two of my pet projects: XmlRpcFilteringPipe and XmlRpcToWiki.  I&#39;m not sure how MT tags work yet, but I suppose I could make a tag that filters its contents through an XML-RPC-based filter service that happens to run it through an XML-RPC-enabled wiki.I&#39;m leaning toward #3, since with the XML-RPC pipeline concept I&#39;ve been tinkering with, you could line up a series of transformations (not just wikification) on your blog entries, some of which could be performed via services offered at other websites.\n</code></pre><p>Of course, #2 is the probably the simplest, if all you want is just wiki formatting in MT.</p>\n<p>Hmm.  I think I&#39;ll have to tinker with this.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
