I think that&#39;s they&#39;re main use.\n\nSome reasons they&#39;re still disconnected from the weblog world might be 1) although they do have RSS feeds, almost no one knows about them; 2) they don&#39;t alert services like weblogs.com and blo.gs when they update (and if they did, I can imagine LJ bringing those services to their knees); and 3) it&#39;s not that easy to search through the LJ users to find similar interests.. unless you&#39;re a paid user.\n\nSometimes on MetaTalk, when the subject of blogging tools, or blogging in general comes up, insomnia from LJ will chime in trying to get LJ some respect, but he never quite succeeds.\n\nUnless there&#39;s something that comes along, or LJ steps up, to try and integrate them into the blogosphere (ahem), I think they&#39;ll continue to remain separate. Sorry to ramble on so long. :)</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221090314&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://markpasc.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7e91c7ddf6c6db73665d8df9bb55d0d9&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://markpasc.org/&quot;&gt;Mark Paschal&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221090314&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-08-30T15:15:53&quot;&gt;2002-08-30T15:15:53&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;I have seen several weblogs recently with LiveJournals in their blogrolls, which is a notable increase from... well, zero. There is something of a gap, but I think that&#39;ll decrease even more when any paid user can add a syndicated journal.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221090315&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.ezoons.com/~gblake/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02282997efb410c2e815cacf7319dbc3&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.ezoons.com/~gblake/&quot;&gt;Gregory Blake&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221090315&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-08-30T15:32:21&quot;&gt;2002-08-30T15:32:21&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;I think it&#39;s closed nature is very much part of it.  Most people who use LJ have no idea what a blog is.  I was at a BBQ this last weekend and there were a number of LJ users there and I said, &quot;I don&#39;t really use LJ much, I&#39;ve got my own blog.&quot; and just got a blank stare back and then was asked &quot;what&#39;s a blog?&quot;\n</code></pre><p>(I made some more comments on this over on my web page.)</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221090316&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://fozbaca.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0f1a4196273ddac2c2ba9a1bb7e0c100&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://fozbaca.org&quot;&gt;fozbaca&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221090316&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-08-30T17:06:26&quot;&gt;2002-08-30T17:06:26&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;It is really about the communities and cultures. LJ is about journaling, very internal and personal. Blogging is about the link, very external and public.   \n</code></pre><p>And a question for you, why did you not try to do the blog of decafbad via your LJ? Also a similar question to ask is why did things like pitas and diarland not really take off in the blog world, they were around before Blogger?</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221090317&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.badhop.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=574e1e3822cb0e7188b12a05261b0bd7&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.badhop.com&quot;&gt;F.

McSweeny&#39;s comment is simple slander and can be neglected.  I think fozbaca is closest -- most LJers I know, including myself, focus on the content of the journal itself, and an external link is an occasional thing rather than the raison d&#39;etre of the journal.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221090320&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221090320&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-08-31T14:53:55&quot;&gt;2002-08-31T14:53:55&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;fozbaca:  Well, I think you are pretty close to identifying the difference between decafbad and my LJ.  My LJ tends to be less tech geeky and more personal, and my audience there is less interested in the things I do here.  Whereas I tend to assume that people who come here want to see what I&#39;m playing with more than other musings and randomity.\n</code></pre><p>I suppose it&#39;s the culture of LJ, being that it&#39;s a tight-knit community and helped to be that way by the software.  Out here in the blogosphere at large, things seem to be more loosely flung about and less automatically connected.  I keep wanting to bring more LJ features to the blogs out here.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221090322&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://organica.us/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3c69beb9eedff4e895809292dd7dd4cb&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://organica.us/&quot;&gt;Ask Bjoern Hansen&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221090322&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-09-01T11:41:33&quot;&gt;2002-09-01T11:41:33&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Over at organica I have a lot of links from blogs.
