It's very, very, very rare that I see a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournaller\">LiveJournaller</a>'s posts linked into the Blogosphere at large.  Granted, I know that the median user was a 15 year old female who complains about Mom and her boyfriend, when last I checked.  But, as the adage goes: 90% of anything is crap.  There are, nevertheless, a good number of worthwhile streams of narrative in that space.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I don't see many of the people behind LJ stepping out and making noise in the Outer Blogosphere either.  I think many of them are just plain busy keeping the site afloat, or having lives, and LJ is world enough for them.</p>\n<p>But 650,000 users... that's a lot.  More than Radio and rivalling Blogger.com.  Is there a real qualitative difference in writing between the groups?  I would still imagine there's a lot of crap to be found via Blogger.com.  I'm not sure about Radio, though, since I get the impression that the 15 year olds have yet to flood into the userbase and its following seems more tilted toward professionals.</p>\n<p>But as for the software &amp; service itself...  As far as I can see, LJ is one of the easiest paths out there to starting a weblog/journal online.  And it was one of the first sites I ever encountered that had a desktop-based client app for posting to it.  And, though not prominently placed, they have <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds for every single journal on the site.  They're even working <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> aggregation features into the place by gatewaying external <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds in as special LJ users to be added like any other LJ \"friend\".</p>\n<p>So, to me, LJ sounds like a top competitor to every other blog/news aggregation product or service out there - yet I rarely hear about it.

My LJ tends to be less tech geeky and more personal, and my audience there is less interested in the things I do here.  Whereas I tend to assume that people who come here want to see what I'm playing with more than other musings and randomity.\nI suppose it's the culture of LJ, being that it's a tight-knit community and helped to be that way by the software.  Out here in the blogosphere at large, things seem to be more loosely flung about and less automatically connected.  I keep wanting to bring more LJ features to the blogs out here.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090322\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://organica.us/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3c69beb9eedff4e895809292dd7dd4cb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://organica.us/\">Ask Bjoern Hansen</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090322\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-01T11:41:33\">2002-09-01T11:41:33</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Over at organica I have a lot of links from blogs.

Also a similar question to ask is why did things like pitas and diarland not really take off in the blog world, they were around before Blogger?</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090317\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.badhop.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=574e1e3822cb0e7188b12a05261b0bd7&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.badhop.com\">F.

McSweeny's comment is simple slander and can be neglected.  I think fozbaca is closest -- most LJers I know, including myself, focus on the content of the journal itself, and an external link is an occasional thing rather than the raison d'etre of the journal.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090320\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090320\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-08-31T14:53:55\">2002-08-31T14:53:55</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">fozbaca:  Well, I think you are pretty close to identifying the difference between decafbad and my LJ.  My LJ tends to be less tech geeky and more personal, and my audience there is less interested in the things I do here.  Whereas I tend to assume that people who come here want to see what I'm playing with more than other musings and randomity.\r\n\r\nI suppose it's the culture of LJ, being that it's a tight-knit community and helped to be that way by the software.  Out here in the blogosphere at large, things seem to be more loosely flung about and less automatically connected.  I keep wanting to bring more LJ features to the blogs out here.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090322\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://organica.us/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3c69beb9eedff4e895809292dd7dd4cb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://organica.us/\">Ask Bjoern Hansen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090322\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-01T11:41:33\">2002-09-01T11:41:33</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Over at organica I have a lot of links from blogs.

It's very, very, very rare that I see a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournaller\">LiveJournaller</a>'s posts linked into the Blogosphere at large.  Granted, I know that the median user was a 15 year old female who complains about Mom and her boyfriend, when last I checked.  But, as the adage goes: 90% of anything is crap.  There are, nevertheless, a good number of worthwhile streams of narrative in that space.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I don't see many of the people behind LJ stepping out and making noise in the Outer Blogosphere either.  I think many of them are just plain busy keeping the site afloat, or having lives, and LJ is world enough for them.</p>\n<p>But 650,000 users... that's a lot.  More than Radio and rivalling Blogger.com.  Is there a real qualitative difference in writing between the groups?  I would still imagine there's a lot of crap to be found via Blogger.com.  I'm not sure about Radio, though, since I get the impression that the 15 year olds have yet to flood into the userbase and its following seems more tilted toward professionals.</p>\n<p>But as for the software &amp; service itself...  As far as I can see, LJ is one of the easiest paths out there to starting a weblog/journal online.  And it was one of the first sites I ever encountered that had a desktop-based client app for posting to it.  And, though not prominently placed, they have <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds for every single journal on the site.  They're even working <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> aggregation features into the place by gatewaying external <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds in as special LJ users to be added like any other LJ \"friend\".</p>\n<p>So, to me, LJ sounds like a top competitor to every other blog/news aggregation product or service out there - yet I rarely hear about it.  Hrm.</p>\n<p>Anyone have a theory why?</p>\n",
