        <meta property="og:description" content="So are any of you guys getting itchy?  I&#39;ve had a great Summer all around, but without much hacking or progress on little projects.  And I&#39;ve noticed that there&#39;s been relative quiet and little hacking amongst my reading list&#39;s authors.  Could be that I&#39;m just not looking in the right places - I did lose a few subscriptions in my bounce from Radio to Ampheta for daily use.  But I just don&#39;t see as many daily innovations as I did toward the end of Winter and beginning of Spring.
As for me, as the nights get longer and things get colder, I&#39;m starting to feel an itch to start tinkering again.  Maybe it has to do with not-yet-dead back-to-school reflexes - summer vacation&#39;s over, and its time to get back to learning and experimenting.  Starting to look again at my neglected wiki, and of course I&#39;ve started tinkering with my AmphetaDesk outliner skin again.  I&#39;ve also been thinking about my other little projects, referrer links, whitelist-based spam filtering, XML-RPC pipelines, and other things I&#39;ve not touched in months.  
The fact that I&#39;d not felt like playing with these toys for so long worried me a bit, so the return of the itch is reassuring.  So, I should get back to playing soon.  And, now that my   financial situation has greatly improved, I also need to figure out where to start and to whom I should talk on really heading back to school.
So Summer has been just a nice, long nap in a hammock.  Time to start making the coffee.  (Not decaf, of course.)" />
