        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;So are any of you guys getting itchy?  I&amp;apos;ve had a great Summer all around, but without much hacking or progress on little projects.  And I&amp;apos;ve noticed that there&amp;apos;s been relative quiet and little hacking amongst my reading list&amp;apos;s authors.  Could be that I&amp;apos;m just not looking in the right places - I did lose a few subscriptions in my bounce from Radio to Ampheta for daily use.  But I just don&amp;apos;t see as many daily innovations as I did toward the end of Winter and beginning of Spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, as the nights get longer and things get colder, I&amp;apos;m starting to feel an itch to start tinkering again.  Maybe it has to do with not-yet-dead back-to-school reflexes - summer vacation&amp;apos;s over, and its time to get back to learning and experimenting.  Starting to look again at my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome&quot;&gt;neglected wiki&lt;/a&gt;, and of course I&amp;apos;ve started tinkering with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines&quot;&gt;AmphetaDesk outliner skin&lt;/a&gt; again.  I&amp;apos;ve also been thinking about my &lt;a hrec=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Projects&quot;&gt;other little projects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShowReferers&quot;&gt;referrer links&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000192.phtml&quot;&gt;whitelist-based spam filtering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe&quot;&gt;XML-RPC pipelines&lt;/a&gt;, and other things I&amp;apos;ve not touched in months.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that I&amp;apos;d not felt like playing with these toys for so long worried me a bit, so the return of the itch is reassuring.  So, I should get back to playing soon.  And, now that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=deus_x&amp;amp;itemid=180842&amp;amp;nc=12&quot;&gt;my   financial situation has greatly improved&lt;/a&gt;, I also need to figure out where to start and to whom I should talk on &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; heading back to school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Summer has been just a nice, long nap in a hammock.  Time to start making the coffee.  (Not decaf, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;
