I should probably just find another webhost, but it's tempting to have my own server.\nIn the past, I had a few friends at an ISP, so they let me stash a little linux server on their network for occasional favors.  I miss that.  Didn't cost me anything, and my impact on their network was negligible.  Meanwhile, I had a stable, semi-reliable box on the net at which I could point a domain.  Services could catch fire and other things could tank, and no one got hurt.\nThe problem now, though, is that shelling out for a server and colocation costs just to play around is a just a smidgen outside my budget.  As I've pondered before, maybe I could actually host a money-making service on it with some of these hacks I'm percolating through.\nOn the other hand, a co-worker put the idea in my head that it might not be unreasonable to think that I could invite some tenants onto my server to share some of the cost.  I figure I'd take the burden of buying & owning the server, but I'd like to spread the service cost out.  I wouldn't want to make a profit, I'd just like to make a kind of nerd commune.  It'd be nice if I could get the cost for everyone under US$10-15, though I imagine my cost would be higher given a server payment.  If I could get mine below $40-50 a month, I think I'd be happy, though this seems like a pipe dream.\nThe devil being in the details, however, I don't really know how one would go about such a thing, considering service agreements and contracts and taxes and blah blah blah.  I'm a financial moron, and I'm also certainly not into being a 24/7 available customer service rep, or to perform tech help.  Basically, I'd like to run a server to host mad scientist experiments performed by a relatively small cadre of mad scientists who can mostly clean up after themselves.  I'd like to run an IRC server, maybe a Jabber server, maybe a few random half-baked server ideas.\nOn the other other hand, is anyone out there doing this already and want a new tenant?  :)",
