I could be wrong. That could also change quickly if OSAF/Chandler sticks with RDF.\n\nCould you give an example of a benefit such a system would provide beyond what you might accomplish through a combo similar to this very site using blog, wiki, and a file server (for excel files, etc., no text allowed there)?\n\nStill, if you want to go with RDF, I&#39;d be inclined to use 4suite, which supports some &quot;real&quot; backends.\n\nYou might also want to chat with AaronSwartz, with a focus on what&#39;s practical <em>now</em>...\n\n<a href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/RDF\">http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/RDF</a>\n<a href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/RDF/backlinks\">http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/RDF/backlinks</a></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
