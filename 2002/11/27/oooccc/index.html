  <meta property="og:description" content="So, my little off the cuff case study with XmlRpc from yesterday got a ton of flow from Dave.  Got some comments and some email, and a very good response / rebuttal from Paul Prescod.  Thanks to everyone for reading &amp; responding!  I think a few things from that case study, the response to it, and Paul&amp;apos;s comments need some more consideration.  And, I think some more clarification of my situation would work as well.  So I&amp;apos;ll start with that:  The first thing is that I think the quote Dave pulled from my case study nails my situation: &quot;I get it, my boss gets it, his boss gets it, the sales guys get it, and the marketing guy who&amp;apos;s always our first contact at a client gets it.&quot;  I work at a promotions company.  Because we act as a sort of application service provider and host everything ourselves, we can do and have done some pretty nifty things within our walls.  On our clients&amp;apos; side, though, they&amp;apos;re hiring us to do nifty things that don&amp;apos;t require them to do much at all.  In fact, the vast majority of the time, our direct client contact is a marketing/PR person who has little, if any, access to technical resources.  It&amp;apos;s a major undertaking for this person to get an image tag or a javascript pop-up window slipped into an HTML page somewhere on the company website - anything further than that leads down a trail of tears and a week&amp;apos;s worth of conference calls with grumpy people.  We&amp;apos;ve spent more than 4 years streamlining everything down to the acceptance of this fact.  So then, in walks the client who wants a lot more, like the aforementioned client for whom XmlRpc worked swimmingly for integration between their site, their commerce vendor, and us.  Our direct contact is still a marketing person, but she has a bit more technical support behind her.  She might be able to get up to 4 hours&amp;apos; time from a junior engineer over there to whip up a CGI or JSP, assuming that the team in charge of the website approves permission to do so. As part of that junior engineer&amp;apos;s time, I have one half-hour conference call to explain our points of integration, how everything&amp;apos;s going to work, and where to go for resources on how to do it.  I barrage the person with email, offer availability on at least 3 different instant messaging networks, but when it comes down to it this 1/2 hour phone call is all anyone remembers.  We&amp;apos;ve been working on improving this situation, but the only traction comes from where we&amp;apos;ve been able to gain the confidence of a client as a long term strategy partner.  Otherwise, we&amp;apos;re just some random vendor who gets tossed away if we make too much noise.  What this all boils down to is that I&amp;apos;ve needed to develop a scheme of integration between web apps that can be explained mainly in 30 minutes to a developer of unknown competence to whom I&amp;apos;m barely a priority.  This is my situation at present.  The situation has room for improvement - but the power to make those improvements are largely beyond my influence - so I&amp;apos;ve applied XmlRpc successfully so far as a solution.  So, I&amp;apos;ll post this, and in the next installment (if you&amp;apos;re still with me), I&amp;apos;ll voice my concerns with the solution I&amp;apos;ve chosen, and consider what Paul&amp;apos;s written.  As always, I encourage you to tell me where I&amp;apos;m full of it, and why. " />

I think a few things from that case study, the response to it, and <a href="http://www.blogstream.com/pauls/1038403139">Paul&#39;s comments</a> need some more consideration.  And, I think some more clarification of my situation would work as well.  So I&#39;ll start with that:

I work at <a href="http://www.eprize.net">a promotions company</a>.  Because we act as a sort of application service provider and host everything ourselves, we can do and have done some pretty nifty things within our walls.

On our clients&#39; side, though, they&#39;re hiring us to do nifty things that don&#39;t require them to do much at all.  In fact, the vast majority of the time, our direct client contact is a marketing/PR person who has little, if any, access to technical resources.
