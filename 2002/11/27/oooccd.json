So, I know that my chosen solution has its blemishes and land mines awaiting my step.  But, none of them have bitten me yet, nor do I expect them to for some time.  On the contrary, for every practical application of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> we&apos;ve deployed, we&apos;ve had happy clients.  While working in this industry, the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=80/20%20rule\">80/20 rule</a> has been beaten into me - so if a solution that&apos;s 20% complete solves 80% of our problems, it&apos;s time to move onto the next problem.\n<br><br>\nThis, however, is a dangerous thing to become complacent about - there&apos;re still 20% worth of problems out there for which this solution falls down.  And each one will become a work-till-3-am nightmare when they hit.  And besides, I&apos;m a perfectionist and a purist at heart, so the dirtiness of this solution will never fail to irk me.  It may be simple, but simple is not necessarily elegant.  So what about the rest of Paul&apos;s points?\n<br><br></p>\n<p><blockquote><i>The first axis of flexibility you&apos;ve given up is in character set.

That doesn&#39;t mean that I accept that REST is &quot;ivory tower&quot; because it requires an understanding of XML and HTTP. These are two technologies that most real network application developers already know and will need to know going into the future. The gist of your story is that the people consuming your application are not network application developers and do not need the extensibility, flexibility and XML-integration of the REST model. REST may be ivory tower-ish compared to XML-RPC as Visual Basic is ivory-towerish to the Excel &quot;programmer&quot; and Python to the Visual Basic programmer and Lisp to the Python programmer and Mercury to the Lisp programmer.\n\nIf XML-RPC solved 80% of the data integration problems out there, then I would agree that it would be ivory towerish to spend too much effort on the remaining 20%. But that is not true. Web Services have made such a miniscule impact in our day to day lives because they solve less than 20% of the integration problems they were supposed to solve (rough guess). Conversely, the Blog world would crash to a halt without REST (in its HTML,  RSS and Trackback incarnations).\n\nFor the 20% that XML-RPC solves, by all means use it! I have.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
