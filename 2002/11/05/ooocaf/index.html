        <meta property="og:description" content="Hmm, stevenf gives Zoe some love.  I want to like Zoe, and I think I might try it again.  But ever since I first found and later tried Zoe, I&#39;ve not had much luck with any release.  I think at one point I had a single email appear, but I&#39;m just not getting the mojo.  I think I sorta figured out what I&#39;m supposed to do, but mostly it just sits there munching CPU quietly.  Hrm.  Not that my setup is exotic - I use Mail.app to access an IMAP server on my iBook.  I see others manage to work it.  Trying again...

Update: It appears that my setup is exotic enough - I&#39;m foolishly using UW IMAP as a quick &amp; dirty install.  As-is, it points to the root of my home directory for email, and I set the IMAP folder prefix to mail/ in Mail.app.  Well apparently, Zoe doesn&#39;t support this and instead tries spidering my entire home directory via IMAP.  It appears that there may be hope in a future release, but not for now.  I suppose I might switch IMAP servers, since UW has always given me the willies.  And, I&#39;m assuming that while I&#39;m using IMAP, Mail.app doesn&#39;t have any mbox files for Zoe to auto-import." />

<div class="content">Incidentally, that's also one of the reasons I can't use it.  :)
There are icky things you can do with fetchmail to pipe your incoming IMAP email into Zoe's mail server, but they're... well...  icky.</div>
