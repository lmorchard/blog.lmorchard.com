I think at one point I had a single email appear, but I&#39;m just not getting the mojo.  I think I sorta figured out what I&#39;m supposed to do, but mostly it just sits there munching CPU quietly.  Hrm.  Not that my setup is exotic - I use Mail.app to access an IMAP server on my iBook.  I see others manage to work it.  Trying again...\n<br /><br />\n<b>Update:</b> It appears that my setup <i>is</i> exotic enough - I&#39;m foolishly using UW IMAP as a quick &amp; dirty install.  As-is, it points to the root of my home directory for email, and I set the IMAP folder prefix to <code>mail/</code> in Mail.app.  Well apparently, <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1183967&amp;forum_id=9709\">Zoe doesn&#39;t support this</a> and instead tries spidering my entire home directory via IMAP.  <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1259689&amp;forum_id=9709\">It appears</a> that there may be hope in a future release, but not for now.  I suppose I might switch IMAP servers, since UW has always given me the willies.
