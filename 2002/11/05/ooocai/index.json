And I think it&#39;s on the mark with what I&#39;ve been thinking lately.<br><br /><br />\nI&#39;ve yet to really have time to dunk my head into the Semantic Web barrel for the apples yet, play with the tools, get some results, but I think I get the mojo.  And it excites me.  But, I&#39;ve yet to really see any flowers bloom or any heads pop off.  I hate to criticize or critique, not having walked the walk yet, but I worry that the present state of things Semantic Web and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> are walking similar cathedral paths that <a href=\"http://xanadu.com/\">Xanadu</a> wandered decades ago.  I say this in the sense that there seems to be a lot of heavy design up in the clouds, and not enough improvisation down on the ground.  And it&#39;s the improvisation that kicked the web off to its heights.\n<br /><br />\nOn the other hand, it&#39;s not like one company has the Semantic Web in a stranglehold.  There are groups which, had I the spare time and inclination, I could probably join and pitch in a hand.  It seems an open and friendly group, normal birthing struggles and conflicts notwithstanding.  So I&#39;d say this thing seems more a bazaar than a cathedral.\n<br /><br />\nBut from my occasional stops by the farm, looking over the fence, I see equipment and activity, but no loam or topsoil tilled with things blooming.  I don&#39;t see the mushrooms popping up in the moist dirt.  I see lots of work on the tractors, but I don&#39;t see the ground getting into condition for all the little fungi to spontaneously appear.  And that&#39;s what I see with the web now, and with the blogosphere.  The dirt&#39;s nice and warm and space aplenty, so things are burbling up all the time.  And it feels like I&#39;m getting some neat things done without the need to <i>commit</i> a slab of time to a group or a process other than my own jazz on my own time at the keyboard.\n<br /><br />\nI guess what I&#39;m getting at is that the Semantic Web just doesn&#39;t yet seem to me to be sufficiently dirty enough for the grassroots to grow.  But I&#39;m still unsure about this assertion.  Need to play more.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ooocai</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083414\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.teledyn.com/mt/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2a79113935d97d5a47d3b54e01be3347&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.teledyn.com/mt/\">mrG</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083414\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-11-05T17:38:53\">2002-11-05T17:38:53</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Actually, I don't see semantic mycelia all over the place!</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083415\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0113759/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1d82ae1013529b2c68607d77d2626ec1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0113759/\">Seth Russell</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083415\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-11-06T18:02:56\">2002-11-06T18:02:56</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I made a posting in my blog re your posting above.
