        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;My referrer log harvester and stats were down last week, so I missed out on just how much traffic and flow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000315.phtml&quot;&gt;my Semantic Web ramble&lt;/a&gt; had gotten.  But, I followed the paths back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teledyn.com/mt/archives/000267.html#000267&quot;&gt;a riff on the Semantic Web by mrG of &lt;span style=&quot;background : #FFFFCE;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/TeledyN?topicparent=Main.FilterData&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;TeledyN&lt;/font&gt;, perhaps more appropriately predicting &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Semantic Mycelia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.  And I think it&#39;s on the mark with what I&#39;ve been thinking lately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;ve yet to really have time to dunk my head into the Semantic Web barrel for the apples yet, play with the tools, get some results, but I think I get the mojo.  And it excites me.  But, I&#39;ve yet to really see any flowers bloom or any heads pop off.  I hate to criticize or critique, not having walked the walk yet, but I worry that the present state of things Semantic Web and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt; are walking similar cathedral paths that &lt;a href=&quot;http://xanadu.com/&quot;&gt;Xanadu&lt;/a&gt; wandered decades ago.  I say this in the sense that there seems to be a lot of heavy design up in the clouds, and not enough improvisation down on the ground.  And it&#39;s the improvisation that kicked the web off to its heights.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, it&#39;s not like one company has the Semantic Web in a stranglehold.  There are groups which, had I the spare time and inclination, I could probably join and pitch in a hand.  It seems an open and friendly group, normal birthing struggles and conflicts notwithstanding.  So I&#39;d say this thing seems more a bazaar than a cathedral.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But from my occasional stops by the farm, looking over the fence, I see equipment and activity, but no loam or topsoil tilled with things blooming.  I don&#39;t see the mushrooms popping up in the moist dirt.  I see lots of work on the tractors, but I don&#39;t see the ground getting into condition for all the little fungi to spontaneously appear.  And that&#39;s what I see with the web now, and with the blogosphere.  The dirt&#39;s nice and warm and space aplenty, so things are burbling up all the time.  And it feels like I&#39;m getting some neat things done without the need to &lt;i&gt;commit&lt;/i&gt; a slab of time to a group or a process other than my own jazz on my own time at the keyboard.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I guess what I&#39;m getting at is that the Semantic Web just doesn&#39;t yet seem to me to be sufficiently dirty enough for the grassroots to grow.  But I&#39;m still unsure about this assertion.  Need to play more.&lt;/p&gt;
