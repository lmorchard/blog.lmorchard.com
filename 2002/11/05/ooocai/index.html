  <meta property="og:description" content="My referrer log harvester and stats were down last week, so I missed out on just how much traffic and flow my Semantic Web ramble had gotten.  But, I followed the paths back to a riff on the Semantic Web by mrG of ?TeledyN, perhaps more appropriately predicting The Semantic Mycelia.  And I think it&amp;apos;s on the mark with what I&amp;apos;ve been thinking lately. I&amp;apos;ve yet to really have time to dunk my head into the Semantic Web barrel for the apples yet, play with the tools, get some results, but I think I get the mojo.  And it excites me.  But, I&amp;apos;ve yet to really see any flowers bloom or any heads pop off.  I hate to criticize or critique, not having walked the walk yet, but I worry that the present state of things Semantic Web and RDF are walking similar cathedral paths that Xanadu wandered decades ago.  I say this in the sense that there seems to be a lot of heavy design up in the clouds, and not enough improvisation down on the ground.  And it&amp;apos;s the improvisation that kicked the web off to its heights.  On the other hand, it&amp;apos;s not like one company has the Semantic Web in a stranglehold.  There are groups which, had I the spare time and inclination, I could probably join and pitch in a hand.  It seems an open and friendly group, normal birthing struggles and conflicts notwithstanding.  So I&amp;apos;d say this thing seems more a bazaar than a cathedral.  But from my occasional stops by the farm, looking over the fence, I see equipment and activity, but no loam or topsoil tilled with things blooming.  I don&amp;apos;t see the mushrooms popping up in the moist dirt.  I see lots of work on the tractors, but I don&amp;apos;t see the ground getting into condition for all the little fungi to spontaneously appear.  And that&amp;apos;s what I see with the web now, and with the blogosphere.  The dirt&amp;apos;s nice and warm and space aplenty, so things are burbling up all the time.  And it feels like I&amp;apos;m getting some neat things done without the need to commit a slab of time to a group or a process other than my own jazz on my own time at the keyboard.  I guess what I&amp;apos;m getting at is that the Semantic Web just doesn&amp;apos;t yet seem to me to be sufficiently dirty enough for the grassroots to grow.  But I&amp;apos;m still unsure about this assertion.  Need to play more. " />
