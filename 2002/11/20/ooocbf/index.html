Boring, yawn, inventory management, who cares?  Well, imagine if those things, along with their readers, got so ludicrously cheap and small that mothers would stick &amp;apos;em to kids&amp;apos; underwear as they went off to camp, and readers came standard in watches and cell phones.  Imagine that, somehow, the range was improved to at least 20 feet - your reader sends out a radio ping (MARCO!) and back comes a list of the contents of the room as every object responds (POLO!).  Assume as well that your reader can work out the location of each of these objects.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ignore the big brother fears for now - everyone will have this stuff, not just the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MiB&quot;&gt;MiBs&lt;/a&gt;.  Also, ignore my ignorance - many of these enhanced tricks are likely impossible or at least very hard for these little gadgets.  For now.  Until someone does something clever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But, imagine!  Never lose your keys again!  Find the cat!  Owners manuals to everything you own - should you ever actually have the impulse to read one - are available with a tag ping and a lookup.  Imagine the games &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SmartMobs&quot;&gt;SmartMobs&lt;/a&gt; will find for this stuff!  Handle the tag code on objects in the world with a URI scheme - the Semantic Web reaches out to help create the Semantic World!  It&amp;apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/CueCat&quot;&gt;CueCat&lt;/a&gt; on super steroids!  Facial recognition in your PDA to remember my name?  Bah - I&amp;apos;ve got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RFID&quot;&gt;RFID&lt;/a&gt; business card in my pocket.  Consider the combination of this with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WearableComputer&quot;&gt;WearableComputer&lt;/a&gt;, and the world becomes just a bit more active as previously inanimate objects can tell you their stories and stories told about them.  High tech &lt;a href=&quot;animism&quot;&gt;animism&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Okay, I&amp;apos;m winding down on this.  I know I&amp;apos;m going wonky with this idea, but this is along a theme I&amp;apos;ve been playing with in my head: My favorite sci-fi stories and meditations on the future involve little clever bits of tech that get tweaked and leveraged in powerful ways few could have guessed at.  Maybe this tagging tech I&amp;apos;m hyping won&amp;apos;t be it, but it&amp;apos;s one of the ideas that tweaked me in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/VernorVinge&quot;&gt;VernorVinge&lt;/a&gt;&amp;apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook4380.htm&quot;&gt;Fast Times at Fairmont High&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Trying to stretch my brane more along these lines - squinting at the knee of the curve of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TheSingularity&quot;&gt;TheSingularity&lt;/a&gt;.  What else is on the verge of emergence, how much of it is crap and how much of it is the real thing?  Will things like this and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WearableComputer&quot;&gt;WearableComputer&lt;/a&gt; and ubiquitous internet actually cause major change, or will it just turn into more chuckles for my grandkids when they ask me what it was like in the 90&amp;apos;s and double-naughts, when I was living it up at conventions on the company tab, sipping a stout while getting my whites washed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://cuisinenet.com/info/?v=237&amp;amp;/san_francisco/rest/5133.shtml&quot;&gt;a whacky laundry/bar in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
