And while I&#39;ll admit that extensions are lousy conventions -- they work.  If I see a url that&#39;s PDF then I know it might crash my browser, take longer, etc.  So for me at least (and there are lots of geeky folks out there) extensions work.\n</code></pre><p>The Boston Diaries stuff is cool, imho.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083392&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://boston.conman.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=778e89305f331b88a87a94b348164df8&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://boston.conman.org/&quot;&gt;Sean Conner&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083392&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-11-27T19:45:53&quot;&gt;2002-11-27T19:45:53&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;But part of the HTTProtocol is content negotiation (which includes language preference)---the client says &amp;#8220;I can accept the following resource types ... &amp;#8221; and the server can then determine the best type to send.  Ideally, if a client says &amp;#8220;only plain text please,&amp;#8221; then the server can convert from HTML to text (now it can wimp out and send nothing).  Extentions can be completely hidden.\n</code></pre><p>I also don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be seeing dynamically generated PDF files ala The Electric King James any time soon.
