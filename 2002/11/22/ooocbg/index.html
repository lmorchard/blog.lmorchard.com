<div class="content">Then you might want to check out some work I&#39;ve done, mixing TBL&#39;s &quot;Cool URLs don&#39;t change&quot; with Ted Nelson&#39;s tumblers (my take on the idea):
About the Boston Diaries
The Electric King James Bible
Also, I&#39;ve kept the same structure to my website since I started it in 1993 or 1994 or there abouts.  I&#39;ve found that both the stability and longevity of the site has help my search engine rankings tremendously.</div>

<div class="content">One of my problems with this style of url is it doesn&#39;t seem to allow for alternate representations of the same info i.e. file.html versus file.pdf.  And while I&#39;ll admit that extensions are lousy conventions -- they work.  If I see a url that&#39;s PDF then I know it might crash my browser, take longer, etc.  So for me at least (and there are lots of geeky folks out there) extensions work.
The Boston Diaries stuff is cool, imho.</div>

<div class="content">But part of the HTTProtocol is content negotiation (which includes language preference)---the client says &#8220;I can accept the following resource types ... &#8221; and the server can then determine the best type to send.  Ideally, if a client says &#8220;only plain text please,&#8221; then the server can convert from HTML to text (now it can wimp out and send nothing).  Extentions can be completely hidden.
I also don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be seeing dynamically generated PDF files ala The Electric King James any time soon.  Heck, I&#39;ve yet to see any other site send down dynamically generated HTML like I&#39;ve done ...</div>
