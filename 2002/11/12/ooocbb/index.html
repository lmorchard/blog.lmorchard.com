        <meta property="og:description" content="I&#39;ve gotten some interesting comments and emails with regard to yesterday&#39;s semi-rant, Bitterness in the halls of Xanadu, that further expose some itches I felt after writing it.  Two main things:Ideas are not completely worthless, and I have a certain adoration for sprawling cathedrals of vapor.Sometimes the best implementations from the best ideas go unremarked or unnoticed due to obscurity or a lack of understanding.
My recent and vehement attachment to the meme of ideas are fucking worthless is a reaction to my own time spent working on projects that seem to me, in small ways, to resemble what I&#39;ve read about Xanadu - in terms of long development arcs and seeing similar (but flawed) systems released before my work is done.  This presumes a lot - I&#39;ve not published anything (besides this weblog), probably influenced less than a handful, and these projects of mine are more than likely nothing in comparison to Nelson&#39;s work.  They certainly haven&#39;t consumed as much of my lifetime as his, by an order of magnitude.  But still, it felt like some of the scenery along my road matched his.  And I don&#39;t want to end up down that road, frustrated or bitter that my visions or work had been misread and appropriated by others.  (Again, this presumes I have visions or work worth stealing! :) I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve demonstrated such, as of yet.)
And then there is the addictive quick fix a hacker like me can get in the blogosphere, with just a brief and clever twist of code one can improve the neighborhood and take in some brief praise.  Spend a bit more time working, maybe a few weeks or months, and introduce a slightly more useful or complex contribution - you might receive kudos for some time running.  But, work for too long, plan too far, build too high, and the blogosphere likely passes you by - unless you really have a deep grasp on what&#39;s going on, and your projects meet the blogophere where it later arrives.  So I see the techie bazaar of the blogosphere as a kind of fun cauldron of hackers, throwing in ingredients and taking others out, kind of a hivemind without design evolving toward higher connectivity.
So where&#39;s there a place for longer-term design?
Okay... more to think about and write, but for now, I&#39;m leaving for surgery.  Plenty of time for babble while recovering. Wish me luck!" />
