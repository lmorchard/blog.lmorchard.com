        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;ve gotten some interesting comments and emails with regard to yesterday&amp;apos;s semi-rant, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000321.phtml&quot;&gt;Bitterness in the halls of Xanadu&lt;/a&gt;, that further expose some itches I felt after writing it.  Two main things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ideas are not completely worthless, and I have a certain adoration for sprawling cathedrals of vapor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes the best implementations from the best ideas go unremarked or unnoticed due to obscurity or a lack of understanding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;My recent and vehement attachment to the meme of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000258.phtml#000258&quot;&gt;ideas are fucking worthless&lt;/a&gt; is a reaction to my own time spent working &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/iaido&quot;&gt;on projects&lt;/a&gt; that seem to me, in small ways, to resemble what I&amp;apos;ve read about Xanadu - in terms of long development arcs and seeing similar (but flawed) systems released before my work is done.  This presumes a lot - I&amp;apos;ve not published anything (besides this weblog), probably influenced less than a handful, and these projects of mine are more than likely nothing in comparison to Nelson&amp;apos;s work.  They certainly haven&amp;apos;t consumed as much of my lifetime as his, by an order of magnitude.  But still, it felt like some of the scenery along my road matched his.  And I don&amp;apos;t want to end up down that road, frustrated or bitter that my visions or work had been misread and appropriated by others.  (Again, this presumes I have visions or work worth stealing! :) I can&amp;apos;t say that I&amp;apos;ve demonstrated such, as of yet.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And then there is the addictive quick fix a hacker like me can get in the blogosphere, with just a brief and clever twist of code one can improve the neighborhood and take in some brief praise.  Spend a bit more time working, maybe a few weeks or months, and introduce a slightly more useful or complex contribution - you might receive kudos for some time running.  But, work for too long, plan too far, build too high, and the blogosphere likely passes you by - unless you really have a deep grasp on what&amp;apos;s going on, and your projects &lt;i&gt;meet the blogophere where it later arrives&lt;/i&gt;.  So I see the techie bazaar of the blogosphere as a kind of fun cauldron of hackers, throwing in ingredients and taking others out, kind of a hivemind without design evolving toward higher connectivity.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So where&amp;apos;s there a place for longer-term design?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Okay... more to think about and write, but for now, I&amp;apos;m leaving for surgery.  Plenty of time for babble while recovering. Wish me luck!&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
