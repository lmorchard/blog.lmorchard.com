OTOH, I think I can understand why he sees XML-RPC based design is more appropriate (for his goal) than REST-style design.</p>\n<p>While REST focuses on defining set of accessible resources, XML-RPC focuses on defining set of callable interfaces.</p>\n<p>Traditional programming is about &quot;programming by contract&quot;, and in many languages, that means defining set of interfaces (API). Many developers are just so much trained to have this API-centric world view, and adopting REST means there&#39;s a need to tweak their heads a little.</p>\n<p>I think it could be argued that this use of &quot;set of resources&quot; is almost same as using multiple objects in OO language. Whole service is constructed by interaction of multiple live objects (resources), and each object (resource) has set of interfaces to be called. I believe REST principle requires you to break up service into smaller set of objects until eash object only needs to implement minimal set of standard interface. But what&#39;s puzzling me right now is the way to &quot;expose&quot; selected micro-objects as URI-addressable resource. This is probably more of a problem of toolkit implementation, but it&#39;s currently just awkward to me.</p>\n<p>Unless RESTful implementation brings easy way to do it, XML-RPC will be understood <em>much</em> faster by developers than REST-style programming model. I&#39;m wondering if this is going to be a typical &quot;worse-is-better&quot; case.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
