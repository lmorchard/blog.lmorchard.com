Another way I think it could be looked at is like virtual memory systems - swap long unused content out to a tarball, use a potential 404 as a sort of page fault to swap content back in and server the content to the client as if it's always been there, not just swapped in from storage.\nKinda funky, probably gratuitous.

Thousands of products, few of which actually get looked at in detail. The database server was slow so first we tried just baking ... except that produced umpteen zillions of little files. Then we simply inserted a server rule that checked for wanted page and if missing (and matching a pattern) the request was re-written to extract from the database (and simultaneously write to disk).

Then, delete some key known changed pages, and updates happen upon visitor demand.\nThis might be easier to manage with some web hosting accounts that allow 404 handler CGIs, but not databases or other software installation.  Then again, it could just all be more work than ever necessary, but it sounds like a nifty idea.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

Weblog archives can consume a great deal of space, yet those pages are infrequently requested. Why not GZip entries from previous months and use a 404 handler to extract pages as-needed?</i></blockquote>The funky caching to which he refers involves implementing a 404 (page not found) handler that, instead of just supplying condolences for a missing page, actually digs the page up out of cold storage if it can.  I think I need to look into this for my site - throw all the old blog entries away into gzipped files, or maybe a tarball per month, and have a funky 404 handler dig them out when needed.\n<br><br>\nThere are issues with this - such as what happens if I want to edit old content, or I change templates, or what not - but I think there could be decent solutions for those.  Hell, maybe this is an easier way to blog locally and publish globally - don&apos;t rsync directories of files, just publish locally and upload a new tarball.  Then, on the remote site, delete the index, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> files, and other affected files and watch happy updates ensue.  If a massive site change is made, rebuild locally, re-tarball every thing, upload the new tarballs, and delete all remote content to trigger revivification.  Scary but possibly nifty.<p></p>\n"

    "html": "<p>So, from my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000333.phtml\">last installment</a>, I left off with this:  My daily situation with regards to integrating the web-based services of various parties boils down to what I can explain in 30 minutes to a developer of unknown competence to whom I&#39;m barely a priority.  So far, I&#39;ve been able to apply <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> as a solution to this problem with a great degree of success.\n<br /><br />\nAbout this, endulging me although I&#39;m sure issues like mine have been hashed out a million times already on various mailing lists, <a href=\"http://www.blogstream.com/pauls/1038403139\">Paul Prescod writes</a>:<blockquote><i>There&#39;s nothing wrong with the way you&#39;ve used XML-RPC and I&#39;ve used it that way myself. I only write to ensure that you (and anyone reading) understands the costs and benefits of this approach. You&#39;ve given up on many of the feature of the underlying XML and HTTP technologies. If you don&#39;t need the features, then amen, let her rip. But people building more substantial apps do need them.</i></blockquote>\n<br /><br />\nYes.  So, I know that my chosen solution has its blemishes and land mines awaiting my step.  But, none of them have bitten me yet, nor do I expect them to for some time.  On the contrary, for every practical application of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> we&#39;ve deployed, we&#39;ve had happy clients.  While working in this industry, the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=80/20%20rule\">80/20 rule</a> has been beaten into me - so if a solution that&#39;s 20% complete solves 80% of our problems, it&#39;s time to move onto the next problem.\n<br /><br />\nThis, however, is a dangerous thing to become complacent about - there&#39;re still 20% worth of problems out there for which this solution falls down.  And each one will become a work-till-3-am nightmare when they hit.  And besides, I&#39;m a perfectionist and a purist at heart, so the dirtiness of this solution will never fail to irk me.  It may be simple, but simple is not necessarily elegant.  So what about the rest of Paul&#39;s points?\n<br /><br /></p>\n<blockquote><i>The first axis of flexibility you've given up is in character set. XML-RPC disallows Unicode character strings.</i></blockquote>On one hand, my impulse is to respond to this by invoking <a href=\"http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?String=exact&amp;Acronym=YAGNI\">YAGNI</a> - since our use of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> involves messages between machines, I don't care about localizing those.  I'll just keep to language neutral data in there.  But, I'm naive.  With a bit of pondering, I can identify at least one area where user-supplied input needs to be traded - shared registration and login for global promotions.

Our industry is neither mature nor organized enough to conceive of any sort of schema.  Our products and the concepts involved in our work are in constant change, not to mention the conditions of the market and what will continue to work.\n<br /><br />\n<blockquote><i>Another way of attacking your interoperability problem would be to start from that point of view, defining the XML and then working back to the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> system.

No XML strategy.  More like: \"Make a GET to this URL with these query parameters, documented here.

Of course, this begs the question of my effort and competence in explaining <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> to others, which I feel is lacking thus far.  Because, well, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> is also their boxes talking to my boxes.

They have a web site, and maybe a team maintaining it if we&apos;re lucky.  \n<br><br>\n<blockquote><i>You depicted the situation as SOAP on one side (grungy), <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> on the other (ivory tower) and XML-RPC in the middle. <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> is basically the same old CGI-ish stuff we&apos;ve been doing for a decade so I don&apos;t see how it is very ivory towerish.</i></blockquote>Well, I&apos;m mixing audiences here.  SOAP, to me and my lack of time with it, seems grungy and in flux.  To my clients, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> seems out there, especially if I ever try to explain to them what the letters stand for.  :)\n<br><br>\n&quot;What&apos;s a siggy?&quot;  \n<br><br>\n&quot;You mean a C-G-I?&quot;\n<br><br>\nIn explaining <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>, I usually say something long the lines of &quot;your people&apos;s boxes talk to my people&apos;s boxes,&quot; then point them at the website that says largely the same thing.  Of course, this begs the question of my effort and competence in explaining <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> to others, which I feel is lacking thus far.  Because, well, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> is also their boxes talking to my boxes.  And, I haven&apos;t found a website at which to point both techie and non-techie audiences to &quot;get it&quot;.\n<br><br>\n<blockquote><i>...perhaps <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> doesn&apos;t apply to you. Yet. ... You say that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> doesn&apos;t &quot;feel finished&quot; to you. Nor to me. Our industry is in the middle of a huge migration to extensible formats like <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> which builds on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> which builds on XML.</i></blockquote>I don&apos;t think <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> quite applies to us yet.  I&apos;d like it to.  Maybe once we, as a company, have formed much stronger partnerships I can get past the 30 minute barrier and get to some real discussions and establish things like XML schema.\n<br><br>\n<blockquote><i>When people are comfortable with extensible, hyperlinked formats, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> will seem like a no-brainer.</i></blockquote>The more I read and think about <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>, the more I agree with this.  It&apos;s just that I find it very hard to sell the idea yet.  Again, this may be the nature of the beast for whom I work, and it may be my lack of ability to describe this simply.  \n<br><br>\nBut for now, it seems that the ability to throw a random unknown web developer an API and a URL with less than 30 minutes&apos; accompanying discussion, and get results, seems to work for us.\n"

If they use a SOAP encoding, you get some of that. But there just is nothing simpler than saying &quot;Here&#39;s the XML-RPC interface, and some sample code in a few of the popular scripting languages.&quot; If you want developers to get going quickly, avoid the religious wars, just support XML-RPC. Now even this isn&#39;t bluster-free. Think of it as evangelism. Have a nice day.</i></blockquote>Though I don&#39;t like his remarks on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>, I gotta give Dave an <i>amen</i> here and thank him for having <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> out there for me to stumble upon.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> seems shiny and neat to me but incomplete - I&#39;m pulling for it because it seems warm and fuzzy to my ivory tower branes.  SOAP seems to try to be nice &amp; clean, but feels grungy and toxic to me and I&#39;ve always felt a vague sense of unease when walking past its house on the block.  In the middle, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> seems to be the right balance of dirt and acidity to grow things in.\n<br /><br />\nAbout <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>, I can speak with some experience now.  I first started tinkering with it a few months shy of a year ago, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000020.phtml#000020\">when I first launched this blog</a>.  I went to <a href=\"http://www.xmlrpc.com\" target=\"_top\">http://www.xmlrpc.com</a> and learned it in less than an afternoon.  Cobbled together a few <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Projects\">Projects</a> with it, and saw an opportunity to introduce <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> as a new tech at work.<br><br /><br />\n(In case you don&#39;t know about my job, I&#39;m the guy who does most of the research &amp; development, tool building, and overall platform architecture at a promotions company called <a href=\"http://www.eprize.net\">ePrize</a>.  I grumble about the place from time to time, but on the whole they let me do an amazing amount of wandering around in finding new things.)\n<br /><br />\nAnyway, we&#39;d been poking around with a few different means of integrating our promotions into clients&#39; websites.  You see, we host the web part of all promotions on our servers, and work toward making inclusion of those promotions not much harder than slipping in a banner.  But sometimes, there&#39;s just no avoiding more complex integration.  And sometimes, it&#39;s exactly what you want with things like shared sign-up &amp; login, awarding tokens &amp; coupons, and coordinating between vendors&#39; services.  So, we had a few different <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>-esque URL-based schemes, some FTP-and-PGP-based things, and even managed to convince one client to use a one-off protocol between two perl net daemons.  Every time, it was something new, and we could seem to get no two clients happy with the same integration scheme.\n<br /><br />\nThen one day I bring <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> into the office, and weave it into our app platform at the ground floor.  Overnight, just about every aspect of every promotion we do can be accessed via <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>, given the proper switches thrown and the right access controls set.  Producing an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> API spec for potential clients took mostly a bit of cut &amp; paste massaging of our internal API docs.<br><br /><br />\n(Your mileage may vary greatly, but our homegrown platform seemed pre-designed to fit with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>.  This point right here may be what makes this anecdote fall on its face for you and your experiences.  But, based on the success we have with it on the client end of things, I suspect that we&#39;re not that much an outlier.)\n<br /><br />\nThe next day, we had a meeting with a giant customer whose name I&#39;m not sure I can mention, but suffice it to say you&#39;ve heard of them and It&#39;s very, very likely that you&#39;ve used their gadgets.  We helped them put together a customer referral and rewards program, using <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> as the glue between an online store vendor, the client&#39;s site, and us.  It was a great success, and since then we&#39;ve done another dozen or so cool promotions involving <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>.\n<br /><br />\nWhat makes this tech so successful here is that it&#39;s so simple and decently understood.  I get it, my boss gets it, his boss gets it, the sales guys get it, and the marketing guy who&#39;s always our first contact at a client gets it.  And when we finally drill down to a tech guy on the client&#39;s side, we just tell him, &quot;Here&#39;s the API for your promotion, and visit <a href=\"http://www.xmlrpc.com\" target=\"_top\">http://www.xmlrpc.com</a> for details on how to call it.&quot;  And that&#39;s it - 75% of the time they get it and implement it.  The rest of the time, we have to spend some time proving the tech and answering doubts, but it&#39;s always a pleasant experience from our end having all the answers.\n<br /><br />\nI&#39;ll adore <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> if/when it gets to this point in helping me get mine and my client counterparts&#39; jobs done.\n<br /><br />\nAnyway, this is sounding like a bad infomercial and I need to get back to work.  But I had to toss out this bit of anecdotal dross in favor of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=oooccb</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085436\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f62aedd5a22327cb4b3d8cc7f94022a4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Joh</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085436\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-11-26T23:55:01\">2002-11-26T23:55:01</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">...unless your client is in China and oops, Dave forgot to mention that since Radio can't do Unicode, the XmlRpc spec only uses ASCII strings.

Have a nice day.</i></blockquote>Though I don't like his remarks on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>, I gotta give Dave an <i>amen</i> here and thank him for having <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> out there for me to stumble upon.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> seems shiny and neat to me but incomplete - I'm pulling for it because it seems warm and fuzzy to my ivory tower branes.  SOAP seems to try to be nice &amp; clean, but feels grungy and toxic to me and I've always felt a vague sense of unease when walking past its house on the block.  In the middle, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> seems to be the right balance of dirt and acidity to grow things in.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAbout <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>, I can speak with some experience now.  I first started tinkering with it a few months shy of a year ago, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000020.phtml#000020\">when I first launched this blog</a>.  I went to <a href=\"http://www.xmlrpc.com\" target=\"_top\">http://www.xmlrpc.com</a> and learned it in less than an afternoon.  Cobbled together a few <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Projects\">Projects</a> with it, and saw an opportunity to introduce <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> as a new tech at work.  \r\n<br /><br />\r\n(In case you don't know about my job, I'm the guy who does most of the research &amp; development, tool building, and overall platform architecture at a promotions company called <a href=\"http://www.eprize.net\">ePrize</a>.  I grumble about the place from time to time, but on the whole they let me do an amazing amount of wandering around in finding new things.)\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAnyway, we'd been poking around with a few different means of integrating our promotions into clients' websites.  You see, we host the web part of all promotions on our servers, and work toward making inclusion of those promotions not much harder than slipping in a banner.  But sometimes, there's just no avoiding more complex integration.  And sometimes, it's exactly what you want with things like shared sign-up &amp; login, awarding tokens &amp; coupons, and coordinating between vendors' services.  So, we had a few different <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>-esque URL-based schemes, some FTP-and-PGP-based things, and even managed to convince one client to use a one-off protocol between two perl net daemons.  Every time, it was something new, and we could seem to get no two clients happy with the same integration scheme.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThen one day I bring <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> into the office, and weave it into our app platform at the ground floor.  Overnight, just about every aspect of every promotion we do can be accessed via <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>, given the proper switches thrown and the right access controls set.  Producing an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> API spec for potential clients took mostly a bit of cut &amp; paste massaging of our internal API docs.  \r\n<br /><br />\r\n(Your mileage may vary greatly, but our homegrown platform seemed pre-designed to fit with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>.  This point right here may be what makes this anecdote fall on its face for you and your experiences.  But, based on the success we have with it on the client end of things, I suspect that we're not that much an outlier.)\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe next day, we had a meeting with a giant customer whose name I'm not sure I can mention, but suffice it to say you've heard of them and It's very, very likely that you've used their gadgets.  We helped them put together a customer referral and rewards program, using <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> as the glue between an online store vendor, the client's site, and us.  It was a great success, and since then we've done another dozen or so cool promotions involving <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhat makes this tech so successful here is that it's so simple and decently understood.  I get it, my boss gets it, his boss gets it, the sales guys get it, and the marketing guy who's always our first contact at a client gets it.  And when we finally drill down to a tech guy on the client's side, we just tell him, \"Here's the API for your promotion, and visit <a href=\"http://www.xmlrpc.com\" target=\"_top\">http://www.xmlrpc.com</a> for details on how to call it.\"  And that's it - 75% of the time they get it and implement it.  The rest of the time, we have to spend some time proving the tech and answering doubts, but it's always a pleasant experience from our end having all the answers.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nI'll adore <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> if/when it gets to this point in helping me get mine and my client counterparts' jobs done.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAnyway, this is sounding like a bad infomercial and I need to get back to work.  But I had to toss out this bit of anecdotal dross in favor of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=oooccb\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085436\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f62aedd5a22327cb4b3d8cc7f94022a4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Joh</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085436\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-11-26T23:55:01\">2002-11-26T23:55:01</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">...unless your client is in China and oops, Dave forgot to mention that since Radio can't do Unicode, the XmlRpc spec only uses ASCII strings.

Now even this isn&apos;t bluster-free. Think of it as evangelism. Have a nice day.</i></blockquote>Though I don&apos;t like his remarks on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>, I gotta give Dave an <i>amen</i> here and thank him for having <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> out there for me to stumble upon.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> seems shiny and neat to me but incomplete - I&apos;m pulling for it because it seems warm and fuzzy to my ivory tower branes.  SOAP seems to try to be nice &amp; clean, but feels grungy and toxic to me and I&apos;ve always felt a vague sense of unease when walking past its house on the block.  In the middle, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> seems to be the right balance of dirt and acidity to grow things in.\n<br><br>\nAbout <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>, I can speak with some experience now.  I first started tinkering with it a few months shy of a year ago, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000020.phtml#000020\">when I first launched this blog</a>.  I went to <a href=\"http://www.xmlrpc.com\" target=\"_top\">http://www.xmlrpc.com</a> and learned it in less than an afternoon.  Cobbled together a few <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Projects\">Projects</a> with it, and saw an opportunity to introduce <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> as a new tech at work.<br><br><br>\n(In case you don&apos;t know about my job, I&apos;m the guy who does most of the research &amp; development, tool building, and overall platform architecture at a promotions company called <a href=\"http://www.eprize.net\">ePrize</a>.  I grumble about the place from time to time, but on the whole they let me do an amazing amount of wandering around in finding new things.)\n<br><br>\nAnyway, we&apos;d been poking around with a few different means of integrating our promotions into clients&apos; websites.  You see, we host the web part of all promotions on our servers, and work toward making inclusion of those promotions not much harder than slipping in a banner.  But sometimes, there&apos;s just no avoiding more complex integration.  And sometimes, it&apos;s exactly what you want with things like shared sign-up &amp; login, awarding tokens &amp; coupons, and coordinating between vendors&apos; services.  So, we had a few different <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>-esque URL-based schemes, some FTP-and-PGP-based things, and even managed to convince one client to use a one-off protocol between two perl net daemons.  Every time, it was something new, and we could seem to get no two clients happy with the same integration scheme.\n<br><br>\nThen one day I bring <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> into the office, and weave it into our app platform at the ground floor.  Overnight, just about every aspect of every promotion we do can be accessed via <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>, given the proper switches thrown and the right access controls set.  Producing an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> API spec for potential clients took mostly a bit of cut &amp; paste massaging of our internal API docs.<br><br><br>\n(Your mileage may vary greatly, but our homegrown platform seemed pre-designed to fit with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>.  This point right here may be what makes this anecdote fall on its face for you and your experiences.  But, based on the success we have with it on the client end of things, I suspect that we&apos;re not that much an outlier.)\n<br><br>\nThe next day, we had a meeting with a giant customer whose name I&apos;m not sure I can mention, but suffice it to say you&apos;ve heard of them and It&apos;s very, very likely that you&apos;ve used their gadgets.  We helped them put together a customer referral and rewards program, using <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> as the glue between an online store vendor, the client&apos;s site, and us.  It was a great success, and since then we&apos;ve done another dozen or so cool promotions involving <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>.\n<br><br>\nWhat makes this tech so successful here is that it&apos;s so simple and decently understood.  I get it, my boss gets it, his boss gets it, the sales guys get it, and the marketing guy who&apos;s always our first contact at a client gets it.  And when we finally drill down to a tech guy on the client&apos;s side, we just tell him, &quot;Here&apos;s the API for your promotion, and visit <a href=\"http://www.xmlrpc.com\" target=\"_top\">http://www.xmlrpc.com</a> for details on how to call it.&quot;  And that&apos;s it - 75% of the time they get it and implement it.  The rest of the time, we have to spend some time proving the tech and answering doubts, but it&apos;s always a pleasant experience from our end having all the answers.\n<br><br>\nI&apos;ll adore <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a> if/when it gets to this point in helping me get mine and my client counterparts&apos; jobs done.\n<br><br>\nAnyway, this is sounding like a bad infomercial and I need to get back to work.  But I had to toss out this bit of anecdotal dross in favor of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a>.<p></p>\n"

    "summary": "<p>Okay, so I&apos;m probably the only one who didn&apos;t know this, but I&apos;ve been wondering why it seems that every website owned by someone within a few degrees of separation from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TimBL\">TimBL</a> tend to use URLs of the form:\n<br><br>\n<code><a href=\"http://www.example.org/2002/11/nifty-thing\">http://www.example.org/2002/11/nifty-thing</a></code>\n<br><br>\nJust one of those things I figured kinda made sense, but was never sure why for.  Then, today after a bit of wandering while researching things <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SemanticWeb\">SemanticWeb</a>, I found a link from <a href=\"http://infomesh.net/sbp/\" target=\"_top\">Sean B. Palmer</a> pointing to <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html\" target=\"_top\">Hypertext Style: Cool URIs don&apos;t change</a> by <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TimBL\">TimBL</a> himself.  Seems the example of this pattern is layed out there by the man himself.\n<br><br>\nSeems like it would work like a limited sort of concurrent versioning scheme, but it just looked wonky the first time I saw it.  I mean - date-based website layout?  I&apos;d been raised on the high falutin&apos; directory trees made by very well (overly?) paid Information Architect types.  <code>/2000/10/stuff</code>?  What about <code>/about-us/corporate/ceo.html</code>?\n<br><br>\nOf course, this is ignoring the fact that some webservers need not directly tie physical disk layout to URL layout.  Or that site architecture is best presented via links in the documents themselves.  It&apos;s just that plain vanilla Apache uses a 1:1 match between file path and URL path, and that&apos;s what most everyone uses.\n<br><br>\nHmm..  Might play with it a bit around here.</p>\n"

The history of Xanadu and Nelson&#39;s work with hypertext systems looks to me to be yet another proof that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000258.phtml#000258\">ideas are fucking worthless</a>, and another vote in favor of bazaar- over cathedral-style development.\n<br /><br />\nMaybe it&#39;s the fault of the interviewer, but Nelson comes across as a bit self-aggrandizing in trying to puff up how creative and multi-talented and immersed in media - I mean, he made his own rock opera for cripes sake!  So I guess this should set the stage for his authority when he dismisses HTML as &quot;a degenerate form of [hypertext] that has been standardised by people who, I think, do not understand the real problems&quot; and the web as &quot;... trivially simple ... massively successful like karaoke - anybody can do it.&quot;\n<br /><br />\nBut y&#39;know, for all his criticism of systems here and now, and claiming that the people involved with the web don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing - he has a surprising lack of working software out in the world.

From what I've read (not having been there in the mid-70's), Nelson's been influential like crazy.\nHe'd envisioned so many of the things taken for granted today - but every time I read an interview with him, he seems so bitter with all the imperfect renditions of his ideas.  Seems like he just can't get around to accepting that \"pretty good\" implementations are good enough.\nBut, I could have him all wrong, having gotten all my impressions from mostly second- and third-hand sources.\nThanks for the book reference, though - must read that someday, although a cursory search seems to show that it's a rare find.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088518\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5272443429a5812b961abfb0d1ceeb81&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">John Dougan</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088518\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-11-12T06:15:10\">2002-11-12T06:15:10</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">While there is bitterness there, I read it more as long term frustration. It looks similar to the attitudes I think I've seen in Jef Raskin and Doug Engelbart. These are people with a clear personal vision of some aspect of computing that they feel is radically better that the existing (flawed) practice. This happens all of the time, you say? No big deal?  Sure, but in their cases there are factors that make it much more frustrating. In no particular order:\nTheir vision predates and was the _misunderstood_ inspiration for the existing models. Sometimes it predates them by a lot. Can you imagine thinking of this stuff in 1962 then having to wait 25 years for people to start getting it?  Or to give a demonstration in 1968 of a working intelligence augmentation system (http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/1968Demo.html)...and then being best known for the mouse. Or to be best known for creating the Macintosh, which was then ripped from you while your better later work is marginalized.\nDoug and Jef _have_ produced working systems. They've usually been misunderstood, or ignored.\nOne of the hallmarks I've noticed in all their works is that they are systems thinkers, whose vision works best if it's taken altogether, not piecemeal. TBL's Semantic Web fits into this category as well.  There are synergistic effects between the components that should make their total effect much more than the linear sum. I suspect that this is why they tend to see 'pretty good' versions as not good enough. There is a threshold level that has to be exceeded before it is truly good enough.\nThey all seem to see their visions as fundamentally simple and often it is a source of great confusion as to how others can continue to not understand.\nIn the past they haven't received much credit for their work outside a narrow group of insiders. This has changed to some extent but it's hard to become all happy happy after 30 years of being disregarded or called impractical. Or after being dissed by people who haven't studied the actual design and the practical issues that lead to it.\nIn Ted's case there is a history of implementation attempts that have failed. Ted is a designer, not a builder, and it looks to be a source of never-ending frustration to him that he just can't go and build it himself. He appears to have built small software projects himself, but he doesn't have the implementation talent for larger ones.\nTaking the above a bit further, Ted is fundamentally a liberal arts guy whoses progression into computers was because he wanted to use the systems he saw as possible, and the only way was to direct it himself. *Bazzar style development wasn't available back then* as it really requires Internet availability on a large scale. He's trying the bazzar now, but the other issues and the old history get in the way.\nTed also has the Cassandra problem: 20 years ago he predicted many of the problems we have with the current hypertext systems, and he designed solutions. You can guess what happened next.\nTed and Doug are also getting old, and I'm certain that is a contributing factor to their attitude. They want to see somthing happen in their lifetimes, and they don't have many more chances so they have to be more forceful. This can be taken the wrong way.\nThe good news is that Jef Raskin is young enough to continue persuing his vision over at sourceforge with a Bazzar style project.\nUltimately what they want is their visions to be implemented and deliver their promised benefits.\nhttp://www.bootstrap.org/\nhttp://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/MouseSitePg1.html\nhttp://mxmora.best.vwh.net/JefRaskin.html\nhttp://humane.sourceforge.net/home/index.html\nhttp://www.sunless-sea.net/forum\nhttp://www.abora.org/\nhttp://www.unrealities.com/robj/xancurs.htm\nhttp://xanadu.com.au/ararat\nhttp://www.nongnu.org/gzz/\nDisclosure: I have met and taken a UI design course from Ted and had some fascinating discussion with him.

From what I've read (not having been there in the mid-70's), Nelson's been influential like crazy.\r\n\r\nHe'd envisioned so many of the things taken for granted today - but every time I read an interview with him, he seems so bitter with all the imperfect renditions of his ideas.  Seems like he just can't get around to accepting that \"pretty good\" implementations are good enough.\r\n\r\nBut, I could have him all wrong, having gotten all my impressions from mostly second- and third-hand sources.\r\n\r\nThanks for the book reference, though - must read that someday, although a cursory search seems to show that it's a rare find.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088518\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5272443429a5812b961abfb0d1ceeb81&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">John Dougan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088518\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-11-12T06:15:10\">2002-11-12T06:15:10</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">While there is bitterness there, I read it more as long term frustration. It looks similar to the attitudes I think I've seen in Jef Raskin and Doug Engelbart. These are people with a clear personal vision of some aspect of computing that they feel is radically better that the existing (flawed) practice. This happens all of the time, you say? No big deal?  Sure, but in their cases there are factors that make it much more frustrating. In no particular order:\r\n\r\nTheir vision predates and was the _misunderstood_ inspiration for the existing models. Sometimes it predates them by a lot. Can you imagine thinking of this stuff in 1962 then having to wait 25 years for people to start getting it?  Or to give a demonstration in 1968 of a working intelligence augmentation system (http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/1968Demo.html)...and then being best known for the mouse. Or to be best known for creating the Macintosh, which was then ripped from you while your better later work is marginalized.\r\n\r\nDoug and Jef _have_ produced working systems. They've usually been misunderstood, or ignored.\r\n\r\nOne of the hallmarks I've noticed in all their works is that they are systems thinkers, whose vision works best if it's taken altogether, not piecemeal. TBL's Semantic Web fits into this category as well.  There are synergistic effects between the components that should make their total effect much more than the linear sum. I suspect that this is why they tend to see 'pretty good' versions as not good enough. There is a threshold level that has to be exceeded before it is truly good enough.\r\n\r\nThey all seem to see their visions as fundamentally simple and often it is a source of great confusion as to how others can continue to not understand.\r\n\r\nIn the past they haven't received much credit for their work outside a narrow group of insiders. This has changed to some extent but it's hard to become all happy happy after 30 years of being disregarded or called impractical. Or after being dissed by people who haven't studied the actual design and the practical issues that lead to it.\r\n\r\nIn Ted's case there is a history of implementation attempts that have failed. Ted is a designer, not a builder, and it looks to be a source of never-ending frustration to him that he just can't go and build it himself. He appears to have built small software projects himself, but he doesn't have the implementation talent for larger ones.\r\n\r\nTaking the above a bit further, Ted is fundamentally a liberal arts guy whoses progression into computers was because he wanted to use the systems he saw as possible, and the only way was to direct it himself. *Bazzar style development wasn't available back then* as it really requires Internet availability on a large scale. He's trying the bazzar now, but the other issues and the old history get in the way.\r\n\r\nTed also has the Cassandra problem: 20 years ago he predicted many of the problems we have with the current hypertext systems, and he designed solutions. You can guess what happened next.\r\n\r\nTed and Doug are also getting old, and I'm certain that is a contributing factor to their attitude. They want to see somthing happen in their lifetimes, and they don't have many more chances so they have to be more forceful. This can be taken the wrong way.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that Jef Raskin is young enough to continue persuing his vision over at sourceforge with a Bazzar style project.\r\n\r\nUltimately what they want is their visions to be implemented and deliver their promised benefits.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bootstrap.org/\r\nhttp://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/MouseSitePg1.html\r\nhttp://mxmora.best.vwh.net/JefRaskin.html\r\nhttp://humane.sourceforge.net/home/index.html\r\nhttp://www.sunless-sea.net/forum\r\nhttp://www.abora.org/\r\nhttp://www.unrealities.com/robj/xancurs.htm\r\nhttp://xanadu.com.au/ararat\r\nhttp://www.nongnu.org/gzz/\r\n\r\nDisclosure: I have met and taken a UI design course from Ted and had some fascinating discussion with him.

    "summary": "<p>I&apos;m a little late on this, but I just read an <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1581891.stm\">BBC interview with Ted Nelson</a> this weekend.  I don&apos;t know the man, and am familiar with his work in only the most cursory way - I&apos;ve read a bit about Xanadu, skimmed some articles on its history, but I&apos;ve yet to download the code finally released a few years ago and see what&apos;s what.  Having said that, this interview reads like the bitter mutterings of a guy who wants to slug <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TimBL\">TimBL</a> and the rest of us web hackers for making him all but obsolete.\n<br><br>\nFrom what I&apos;ve read, the body of work surrounding Xanadu seems to have a lot to say for itself, though some of that - the assorted collection of almost psychedelic jargon invented to describe its convolutions - seems almost self parodying.  The history of Xanadu and Nelson&apos;s work with hypertext systems looks to me to be yet another proof that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000258.phtml#000258\">ideas are fucking worthless</a>, and another vote in favor of bazaar- over cathedral-style development.\n<br><br>\nMaybe it&apos;s the fault of the interviewer, but Nelson comes across as a bit self-aggrandizing in trying to puff up how creative and multi-talented and immersed in media - I mean, he made his own rock opera for cripes sake!  So I guess this should set the stage for his authority when he dismisses HTML as &quot;a degenerate form of [hypertext] that has been standardised by people who, I think, do not understand the real problems&quot; and the web as &quot;... trivially simple ... massively successful like karaoke - anybody can do it.&quot;\n<br><br>\nBut y&apos;know, for all his criticism of systems here and now, and claiming that the people involved with the web don&apos;t know what they&apos;re doing - he has a surprising lack of working software out in the world.  That&apos;s what I consider success - working and well used implementation.  Who doesn&apos;t understand the real problems?  One can only build architectures of vapor for so long up in the ivory tower before one must pit it against the world.  I don&apos;t suppose he&apos;s ever tossed around the idea that maybe, just maybe, Xanadu hasn&apos;t stormed the world because it&apos;s too big and cumbersome and amazingly convoluted for anyone who hasn&apos;t worked with it for 30 years to put into use?  There is much to be said for the benefits of Karaoke-simple technology.\n<br><br>\nSo yeah, maybe on some Platonic plane of ideal forms, compared to The One True Hypertext, HTML is crap.  Okay, maybe right here on my hard drive, HTML is crap.  But it&apos;s on my hard drive, and I use it.  It&apos;s been learned from, and attempts are being made to improve upon it.  As far as I know, Nelson&apos;s ideas of perfection have never seen a pounding from the world of imperfection.  That&apos;s the crucible in which things are really formed.  You get your software in reasonable shape, toss it to the wolves, and see how it fares.  Realize that some of your prized pet theories and designs were bullshit, and rework the thing for the next time around.\n<br><br>\nOkay, that&apos;s my rant.  Now I&apos;m back to work, and possibly maybe off to check out more things Xanadu and Nelson on my lunch break.</p>\n"

But then the topic of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> came up, and the discussion really caught on fire as everyone came to understand what <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> is - at least insofar as I understand it, since I seem to have become the local domain expert.\n<br><br>\nSo, first thing is:  I hope I really do grok this stuff, at least at a gut mojo level.  No one&apos;s called me clueless about it yet.  But the second thing is:  Any practical tool suggestions, case studies, prior art, etc that I should be looking at?  I&apos;ve started with a Google search for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> and I&apos;ve been wandering W3C documents - but I need a Busy Developer&apos;s Guide.  My ultimate hope through all of this, is that even if things are still baking, that there&apos;s enough out there with which to make something practical.<br><br><br>\nThe goals are gigantic, but my intuition is that using <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SemanticWeb\">SemanticWeb</a> tech will let us start out small and simple and then add vocabularies and items as needed without massive tool rebuilding.  This is the key thing - the ability to do some initial, fairly easy things that show early results without a heavy, multi-month process to get the thing providing value.  My gut tells me it&apos;s possible.  Am I mad?</p>\n"

But, I tried explaining what I think I understand in a comment on his blog and I figure it&#39;s worth reposting here for ridicule and correction:\n<br /><br />\nDid you happen to catch <a href=\"http://www.sciencefriday.com/pages/2002/Nov/hour2_110102.html\">Tim Berners-Lee on NPR Science Friday</a> today? Not sure if you get the broadcast there, or listen to the stream.

Likely I&#39;ll fail miserably, but here goes.\n<br /><br />\nFirst simple thing: Look at your weblog page. What would it take to extract the list of people from your blogroll, just given your URL? What about the titles of all the weblog posts on that page?\n<br /><br />\nYou, personally, can extract that information very easily since you, as a learned human, grasp the semantics of the page quite quickly. (The semantics are, basically, what&#39;s what and what&#39;s where and what does it all describe.)\n<br /><br />\nImagine a document containing exactly all of the same info your weblog page presents - only the data is completely, easily accessible to a robot in a universal, easily handled format.\n<br /><br />\nFurthermore, imagine that the schema describing the data to be found on your page is in that same format. And then, imagine that the document describing the construction of schema is in that same format. And then imagine that the decomposition continues, all of the way down to base data types and relationships. Eventually, the whole thing rests on the back of a turtle - er I mean a sort of universal client.\n<br /><br />\nNow, what if every single page on the web were available in this manner? No scraping, no regex, no tricks. I could use the entire web as database and execute queries that draw from data available on a myriad of disparate URLs. My client can figure out what to do with whatever it finds at a URL by chasing descriptions and meta-descriptions until it reaches the level of understanding implemented in the client.\n<br /><br />\nGoing out on a limb here, but imagine a practical example: &quot;Hello computer, find me 2 roundtrip tickets for 7 days anytime in the next 10 weeks, for under US$300 each, to a vacation spot where the weather this time of year is usually warm and sunny, the exchange rate is better than 3 to 1 US dollar, and is rated as better than average by Ann Arbor, MI bloggers.&quot;\n<br /><br />\nAssume my semantic web client knows some URLs to airlines, to international weather services, to exchange rates, and to vacation spot reviews in weblogs in Ann Arbor, MI. Assume that there are schema available for the things these URLs describe. Assume that my semantic web client can parse my natural language query.\n<br /><br />\nSo, it takes my request, goes out and snags the URLs appropriate to the various topics involved. Once it has all it need to process the data in each URL, it can find me the answer to my query, based on data pulled from all over the place.\n<br /><br />\nNow, get nuttier and bring in some intelligence with robots that can do some inference and reasoning. Say I throw out some facts: Mammals breathe oxygen. Men are mammals. Joe is a man. With the right client, the query &quot;Give me all oxygen breathers,&quot; will include Joe in its results.\n<br /><br />\nWhew. There.

And I'm not facing financial hardships, just minor budgeting dilemmas.  Personally, I've only just turned 27 last week.  I have a wonderful love and a mostly whole family.  And other than some minor surgery approaching, I have my health.\n<br /><br />\nSo, in general, life's peachy.  But, it only takes one solo <a href=\"http://www.yourdon.com/books/coolbooks/notes/dmsummary.html\">death march project</a> and a bit too much personal investment in one's work to lose perspective and make things taste sour.  You can see the beginnings of it and my enthusiasm (and perhaps some of my trepidations) <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000216.phtml#000216\">back in mid-July</a>.  The current project in question is not the web app platform rewrite I'd mentioned then, though, but rather a new major tool that seemed a good candidate as a \"rev up for Java before the rewrite\" and a break with Perl as the established in-house development language.  So, despite <a href=\"http://www.monokromatik.com/veethree/index.php?viewNewsItem=1&amp;newsitemid=327\">a concerned trackback</a> at the time from Brian Donovan of <a href=\"http://www.monokromatik.com/veethree/index.php\">MONOKROMATIK</a>, I've managed to avoid descent into that level of hell thus far.  (This may still be naivete - but I'm not yet convinced that starting this over in Java is a bad thing.)\n<br /><br />\nSo, my project at present started off as a new venture, with new technologies and techniques, and a planned end product of immense value and demand for the company.  But now, it's ending in a vague cloud of missed deadlines and frustrated expectations.  A slew of \"missing\" features have been added far beyond the woefully incomplete original scope, yet features expected from the start have dropped, leaving a sum impression of a diminished result.  Initial deadlines have been blown by months, leading to an abandonment of testing and documentation just to sprint to the next already unrealistic due date.\n<br /><br />\nWith whom does the blame lie?  With everyone - with no one - but no matter: I'm a perfectionist, so I choose myself.  I tell myself that I should have known better than to have agreed to that timeline - I should have better forseen the unexpected.  I should have never let go of my pristine test-driven development for perceived speed - mystery bugs and instabilities are biting me now.  And I didn't stick to my guns on feature creep - the \"wouldn't it be nice if\" genie is out of the bottle now.\n<br /><br />\nAll I wanted was to be accomodating - to deliver an affordable, massively flexible product in a perceivably reasonable timeline that satisfies all parties concerned.  And as I write that somewhat convoluted sentence, I realize both that that really <strong>has</strong> been my motivating goal, and that the goal is unlikely to impossible.  Infinitely more so for just one guy, left mostly to his own devices, to pull everything into order.  Funny, at the time, I didn't feel like a one of the \"hotshot programmers who are convinced that they can run barefoot all the way to the top [of Mount Everest].\" (See: <a href=\"http://www.yourdon.com/books/coolbooks/notes/dmsummary.html\">Yourdon</a>.)\n<br /><br />\nSo what mystifies me now is this: I'm a smart guy, I've been through a few trying times and I read a lot and I try to pay attention.  The development pattern I've just described is neither new nor unknown to me - I've been here before and I've read the accounts of others who've been here before.  And I know the benefits in sticking to a clean test-driven dev cycle, and keeping a stern check on scope creep.  I know these things, and I try to practice these things - I'm normally known as the guy who pees in the happy idea cheerios - so what hit me this time?\n<br /><br />\nI'm carefully trying to steer clear from writing a rant or a whine - I know that my angst comes from a loss of perspective in being nose-to-nose with this project.  I know it will get better once this is done, and I know from recent developments that this project can and will be rescued unlike many doomed projects.  It will be good and well used and the disappointments will fade.  But for the life of this project, the late nights and my absence from life online and off have been real, as have been the doubts and fears.\n<br /><br />\nThat said, what the hell happened?  And how can I prevent it in the future?  Is it just a matter of guts, principles, and discipline?  I don't think I'm personally in the wrong line of work - but this sort of thing puts me in an unfortunate mood to question everything.  Hmm, I know I've intimated that I'm well read - but I've yet to actually read <a href=\"http://www.yourdon.com/books/coolbooks/notes/dmsummary.html\">Yourdon's <u>Death March</u></a>.  I think it's time to dig into a pile of his works.\n<br /><br />\nAnyway, it'll work out in the end.  In the future, I need to learn how to steer clear of these rocks - though it seems Yourdon asserts that the rocks are unavoidable.  So, even with the knowledge that this is not the end of the world, contemplating doors 1, 2, and 3 seems peculiarly attractive.  I'm leaning toward #2 as the more healthy alternative, but it might be fun to pursue some combination of all three.  \n<br /><br />\nI'll let everyone know which I choose, when the time comes - but the message may come entirely encoded in non-alphanumeric ASCII.\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooocac\n",
