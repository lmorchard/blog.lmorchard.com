(Though it shouldn&#39;t be too hard, given a few round tuits.)

(ie. Ping my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF\">FOAF</a> file when you add me to yours, and I might add you to mine.  That might be pushing the spec a bit, though.)\n</li>\n<li> The XML-RPC server is not tied to any sites it may serve.

It says nothing much about titles or excerpts or comment bodies.  The spec suggests that a Pingback server <strong>might</strong> retrieve \"other data required from the content of Alice's new post,\" but makes no statement on how this is to happen.

I want to take a shot at implementing Pingback very soon - but I might also try taking a shot at implementing a unified comment system that accepts comments for any URI from any of the aforementioned sources.  I'd also like something that scans a blog entry I post for links, then investigate those links for Pingback/TrackBack availability - all to make the system even <strong>more</strong> automatic.  I doubt that it would be very difficult, though I am notoriously naive.

It should escape things like a title tag while allowing a bold tag.\nIan:  No need to redefine all the above - just specify it.  State that in the spec, strongly suggest it or require some subset of DC in meta tags.  I want to know that, when I send a ping at a supporting (X)HTML page, I can expect to find some metadata in an agreed upon way.  If that's DC in meta tags, great.\nJust a matter of saying \"this is what's done\" rather than \"you kinda could do this\".</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090114\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ln.hixie.ch/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=415e6b05a1e7e278ba8dedae90df8d8d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ln.hixie.ch/\">Ian Hickson</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090114\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-28T19:03:13\">2002-09-28T19:03:13</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I don't think it's the place of the pingback spec to specify what metadata a document should contain. It would be like the URI or XLink specs requiring documents to contain metadata, or the PNG spec to require that images not contain red flowers -- it's not their place to worry about it.\nIf the pingback spec required DC metadata, then it would just be adding one more dependency, one more spec that we'd have to monitor in case it affected pingback in some way.\nWhen you ping a page, you can expect to find all the metadata that the HTML spec says you can expect to find. If you want documents to have more, speak to the HTML working group. :-)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090115\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090115\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-29T04:06:16\">2002-09-29T04:06:16</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Yup - right you are.  The HTML spec is where metadata declaration belongs, and the DC-in-HTML spec I found today is the suggestion I was looking for.

It should escape things like a title tag while allowing a bold tag.\r\n\r\nIan:  No need to redefine all the above - just specify it.  State that in the spec, strongly suggest it or require some subset of DC in meta tags.  I want to know that, when I send a ping at a supporting (X)HTML page, I can expect to find some metadata in an agreed upon way.  If that's DC in meta tags, great.\r\n\r\nJust a matter of saying \"this is what's done\" rather than \"you kinda could do this\".</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090114\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://ln.hixie.ch/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=415e6b05a1e7e278ba8dedae90df8d8d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://ln.hixie.ch/\">Ian Hickson</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090114\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-28T19:03:13\">2002-09-28T19:03:13</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I don't think it's the place of the pingback spec to specify what metadata a document should contain. It would be like the URI or XLink specs requiring documents to contain metadata, or the PNG spec to require that images not contain red flowers -- it's not their place to worry about it.\r\n\r\nIf the pingback spec required DC metadata, then it would just be adding one more dependency, one more spec that we'd have to monitor in case it affected pingback in some way.\r\n\r\nWhen you ping a page, you can expect to find all the metadata that the HTML spec says you can expect to find. If you want documents to have more, speak to the HTML working group. :-)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090115\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090115\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-29T04:06:16\">2002-09-29T04:06:16</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Yup - right you are.

  "summary": "<p>I&apos;ve got some further thoughts on <a href=\"http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback-1.0\">Pingback</a>, provided that my server humors me.<br><br><br>\nDavid Watson says, &quot;<a href=\"http://davidwatson.org:8086/archives/000610.html\">uh, no</a>,&quot; citing a horrible experience in actually trying to see the spec in the first place, and a lack of working code.  Not to mention that my site was having a seizure last night - not good things to recommend that one check out a new technology. \n<br><br>\nWell, I did manage to see the spec, but haven&apos;t tried implementing it yet.  (Though it shouldn&apos;t be too hard, given a few round tuits.)  A few things, in particular that I like about <a href=\"http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback-1.0\">Pingback</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> URIs are used to specify the source and target of the ping, no other information is involved in setting up the relation (ie. arbitrary IDs, etc).  This makes site-wide integration of Pingback drop-dead simple - everything&apos;s already identifiable via URI.\n</li>\n<li> If one implements Pingback HTTP headers, one can allow non-HTML resources to be pinged.  (ie. Ping my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF\">FOAF</a> file when you add me to yours, and I might add you to mine.  That might be pushing the spec a bit, though.)\n</li>\n<li> The XML-RPC server is not tied to any sites it may serve.  I could offer one here, and you could point to it from your site, and if I allowed it I could record pings for you as a service.\n</li>\n</ul>\nAll-in-all, Pingback just seems like a more direct, intentional form of referrer log.\n<br><br>\nOne thing I don&apos;t like about Pingback, though (and the same for referrer logs):  It&apos;s just about URIs and links between them.  It says nothing much about titles or excerpts or comment bodies.  The spec suggests that a Pingback server <strong>might</strong> retrieve &quot;other data required from the content of Alice&apos;s new post,&quot; but makes no statement on how this is to happen.  I like that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> sets down how to provide a bit more information.\n<br><br>\nI&apos;ve got a vague idea in my little head, and I think it&apos;s something <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net\">Sam Ruby</a> touched on:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShowReferers\">ShowReferers</a>, form-submitted comments, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a>, and Pingback are all just different on-ramps to inviting open participation in discussion on one&apos;s blog.  I want to take a shot at implementing Pingback very soon - but I might also try taking a shot at implementing a unified comment system that accepts comments for any URI from any of the aforementioned sources.  I&apos;d also like something that scans a blog entry I post for links, then investigate those links for Pingback/TrackBack availability - all to make the system even <strong>more</strong> automatic.  I doubt that it would be very difficult, though I am notoriously naive.  On the other hand, I&apos;ve been on a run of making hard things simple lately.  :)\n<br><br>\nBut I sense my round tuits slipping away - back to work!\n",
