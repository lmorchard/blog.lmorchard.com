It should escape things like a title tag while allowing a bold tag.\n\nIan:  No need to redefine all the above - just specify it.  State that in the spec, strongly suggest it or require some subset of DC in meta tags.  I want to know that, when I send a ping at a supporting (X)HTML page, I can expect to find some metadata in an agreed upon way.  If that&#39;s DC in meta tags, great.\n\nJust a matter of saying &quot;this is what&#39;s done&quot; rather than &quot;you kinda could do this&quot;.</div>\n\n        </li>\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090114\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ln.hixie.ch/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=415e6b05a1e7e278ba8dedae90df8d8d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ln.hixie.ch/\">Ian Hickson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090114\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-28T19:03:13\">2002-09-28T19:03:13</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the place of the pingback spec to specify what metadata a document should contain. It would be like the URI or XLink specs requiring documents to contain metadata, or the PNG spec to require that images not contain red flowers -- it&#39;s not their place to worry about it.\n\nIf the pingback spec required DC metadata, then it would just be adding one more dependency, one more spec that we&#39;d have to monitor in case it affected pingback in some way.\n\nWhen you ping a page, you can expect to find all the metadata that the HTML spec says you can expect to find. If you want documents to have more, speak to the HTML working group. :-)</div>\n\n        </li>\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090115\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090115\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-29T04:06:16\">2002-09-29T04:06:16</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Yup - right you are.  The HTML spec is where metadata declaration belongs, and the DC-in-HTML spec I found today is the suggestion I was looking for.  I was just looking for love in all the wrong places, but the simplicity in Pingback is nice.</div>\n\n        </li>\n\n        </ul>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
