  "summary": "I just discovered and integrated MTSearch into DecafbadWiki by using a TWiki include to pull in a search constructed with the current wiki topic's name.  It took all of 15 minutes, including the time to login and download MTSearch to my server.  This, along with my MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin, completes a simple but effective automatic loop between blog and wiki.  I think this pretty much satisfies my original goal of a WeblogWithWiki.  \nThat was so much easier than I'd thought it would be.  One of those things I kept thinking \"Wouldn't it be nice if?\" but kept procrastinating because I thought it'd be so much harder.\nI'm still amazed that ItJustWorks.",
