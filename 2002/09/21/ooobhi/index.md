So I was just reminded by <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0100629/2002/09/01.html#a243">Mike James</a>  about this tip on <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20020901083220804">running Classic from a disk image on OS X</a> that I'd previously found <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/09/01.html#more_secure_classic_environment">via Mark Pilgrim</a>.  I think I need to try this the next time I feel like wiping and reinstalling my iBook.  I've been meaning to try a different file system under OS X - like, you know, one that's case-sensitive so that something like <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/macosx/perl.html">/usr/bin/HEAD doesn't overwrite /usr/bin/head</a>.  That, and I just don't have very much use for Classic anyway, other than for 2 or 3 apps.
