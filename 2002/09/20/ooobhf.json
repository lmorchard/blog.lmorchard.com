I&#39;d say it&#39;s at least 90% accurate for my handwriting.  And of the errors, the vast majority can be fixed with a double-tap on the incorrect word and a pick from the alternatives list.  And that was in 1998.  I&#39;ve yet to see anyone do it better since.\n\nYour mileage may vary.  :)</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221089835&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221089835&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-09-21T03:16:40&quot;&gt;2002-09-21T03:16:40&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Yeah, mileage varies, and that&#39;s why sound bites suck :)\n</code></pre><p>As for myself, I could never get a Newton to reliably understand my writing, which consists of printing with tall and short capital letters.  Whereas I was up and speeding along with Graffiti in the first day.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve also heard many similar stories, and there were jokes about it, so I figured it&#39;d be a good sound bite.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221089836&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.syndic8.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b53911af792174097e8acb282414b44c&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.syndic8.com&quot;&gt;Bill Kearney&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221089836&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-09-21T19:33:49&quot;&gt;2002-09-21T19:33:49&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Having done Newton development I could offer some commentary here.  One thing many users didn&#39;t appreciate was how various decisions were being made by the software.  Granted, they shouldn&#39;t have to care in most situations.  But for the recognizer once you understood what it was trying to do you could do a select few things to &#39;help&#39; it avoid screwing things up.  For example, take just a little extra care to start your writing of word would greatly increase it&#39;s accuracy.  But for various reasons this little step wasn&#39;t shared with the users.  So while the HWR had it&#39;s own defects, leaving out how to avoid the most fundamental of them meant it was a downhill slide and the users had no idea why.\n</code></pre><p>One other staggering problem was/is shortsightedness for the sake of being stingy.  There was a wealth of rich metadata that could be collected as users created data.  But since there were serious memory/cpu/power limitations it wasn&#39;t practical to &#39;keep everything&#39;.  Couple this with the fact that programmers don&#39;t generally work in &#39;real world&#39; conditions, you end up with arbitrary decisions being made early that harm the later long term versatilty.</p>\n<p>What end up happening is the machine can&#39;t make the sort of insightful guesses the user wants because the earlier programmers didn&#39;t think it was necessary to let the earliest parts of the system collect the data needed.  As a result, the later efforts try to synthetically guess what was intended and those guesses are often wrong (or terribly complicated to implement).  </p>\n<p>For some reason developers vehemently fight metadata as if it was something horrible.  The continue to do so and the users suffer.  Sound bites only make it worse.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
