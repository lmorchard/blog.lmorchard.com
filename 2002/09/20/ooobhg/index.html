<div class="content">I hate to throw rain on the parade, but I have moved everything over and they were down for 9 hours today.  It was the upstream fault of Sprint, but I&#39;m blown away that John Companies doesn&#39;t have redundant links.  I&#39;m still awaiting the full autopsy report.  I&#39;m loving the service otherwise, but 9 hours is insane.  Here&#39;s hoping this was an once-in-a-lifetime occurance.</div>

<div class="content">Oof.  Well, this is why I&#39;m glad I have comments here.  That does indeed suck.
Like I said, most of my stuff&#39;s not there, so I didn&#39;t see anything of mine break.  On the other hand, noe of my past hosting services had a two day outage, and still never answered for it.</div>

<div class="content">I hear you, l.m., and the prior emails were very encouraging.  I WANT them to be solid and to stay with them, as the price/feature ratio is excellent.  I just hope they strengthen their network architecture considerably.</div>
