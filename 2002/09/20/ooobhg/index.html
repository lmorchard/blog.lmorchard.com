<div class="content">I hate to throw rain on the parade, but I have moved everything over and they were down for 9 hours today.  It was the upstream fault of Sprint, but I'm blown away that John Companies doesn't have redundant links.  I'm still awaiting the full autopsy report.  I'm loving the service otherwise, but 9 hours is insane.  Here's hoping this was an once-in-a-lifetime occurance.</div>

<div class="content">Oof.  Well, this is why I'm glad I have comments here.  That does indeed suck.
Like I said, most of my stuff's not there, so I didn't see anything of mine break.  On the other hand, noe of my past hosting services had a two day outage, and still never answered for it.</div>

<div class="content">I hear you, l.m., and the prior emails were very encouraging.  I WANT them to be solid and to stay with them, as the price/feature ratio is excellent.  I just hope they strengthen their network architecture considerably.</div>
