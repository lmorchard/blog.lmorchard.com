It was the upstream fault of Sprint, but I&#39;m blown away that John Companies doesn&#39;t have redundant links.  I&#39;m still awaiting the full autopsy report.  I&#39;m loving the service otherwise, but 9 hours is insane.  Here&#39;s hoping this was an once-in-a-lifetime occurance.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221089844&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221089844&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-09-20T19:50:16&quot;&gt;2002-09-20T19:50:16&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Oof.
