One thing many users didn't appreciate was how various decisions were being made by the software.  Granted, they shouldn't have to care in most situations.  But for the recognizer once you understood what it was trying to do you could do a select few things to 'help' it avoid screwing things up.  For example, take just a little extra care to start your writing of word would greatly increase it's accuracy.  But for various reasons this little step wasn't shared with the users.  So while the HWR had it's own defects, leaving out how to avoid the most fundamental of them meant it was a downhill slide and the users had no idea why.\nOne other staggering problem was/is shortsightedness for the sake of being stingy.  There was a wealth of rich metadata that could be collected as users created data.  But since there were serious memory/cpu/power limitations it wasn't practical to 'keep everything'.  Couple this with the fact that programmers don't generally work in 'real world' conditions, you end up with arbitrary decisions being made early that harm the later long term versatilty.\nWhat end up happening is the machine can't make the sort of insightful guesses the user wants because the earlier programmers didn't think it was necessary to let the earliest parts of the system collect the data needed.  As a result, the later efforts try to synthetically guess what was intended and those guesses are often wrong (or terribly complicated to implement).  \nFor some reason developers vehemently fight metadata as if it was something horrible.  The continue to do so and the users suffer.  Sound bites only make it worse.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
