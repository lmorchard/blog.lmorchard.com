        <meta property="og:description" content="I completely disagree with Ray Ozzie (&quot;I&#39;m thinking right now that I&#39;d prefer to stick with human talkback rather than automated pingback&quot;), John Robb (&quot;I don&#39;t want pingback, trackback, or refererback.&quot;), and Sam Gentile (&quot;Amen to that.&quot;).
I want as much automated and intervention-free invitation to participation in my blog as I can provide.  I want manufactured serendipty to operate here while I&#39;m away or asleep.  I want this site to help me discover connections and uncover links, whether by automated agent or by friendly visitor.  I want to lower the thresholds to interaction as far as I can.  I love it when I&#39;ve seen a few visitors to my site talk amongst themselves while I was on my drive to work.
Of course, I&#39;ve never been cracked or assaulted by an exploit of my systems.  I don&#39;t have unwanted stalkers or abusive anti-fans or malicious kids or babbling spammers after me in this space.  Perhaps if I did, my systems might not tend toward such openness.  I think this is a statement on many things beyond blogs, but that&#39;s a post for other days.  Maybe some day I&#39;ll have these negative elements facing me, and I&#39;ll have to revise my systems and their direction to account for them.
On the other hand, I&#39;ve got a naive notion that the openness itself can counteract much of the reason to become closed in the first place.  Should the need arise, I think I can come up with some measures to deflect inane and juvenile attacks.  As for spammers, I tend to think that their days are numbered anyway - but if they do arrive on my weblog I think I can leverage many of the technologies I use right now with great effectiveness on my email inbox.  But, to defuse real frustration behind attacks, I tend to think that more communication, not less, is what&#39;s needed.
But I&#39;m not sure at all, though, whether or not the threat of abuse is what motivates Ray and John to leave automated discussion channels closed.  It&#39;s just one motive I&#39;ve seen discussed before.  I think they want more &quot;human&quot; and personal contact.
With regards to that:  The irony in my life is that, with my lack of much free time,  automated agents, aggregators, and weblogs have given me more personal contact with human beings than I might have been able to achieve without them.  I&#39;m trying to remember the thread a few months ago between DaveWiner, JonUdell, and others concerning humans with the uncanny ability to connect other people together.  This very thing was supposed:  That aggregators and weblogs could augment one&#39;s ability to act as such a superconnector.  In that regard, I consider my agents, aggregators, and weblogs as integral to me as the new and improved pair of glasses I picked up last week.  Just as I can&#39;t see road signs without my glasses, I can&#39;t keep track of people without my agents.
ShareAndEnjoy.
Update: And happily, Greg Graham, someone I&#39;ve not met before, sends me an unexpected TrackBack ping and invites me to another blog I&#39;ve never visited." />

<div class="content">I agree with you strongly, l.m.  I believe the cries of "those others" you mentioned stink of elitism and a "let them eat cake" kind of attitude.  The more connected and in the most automated fashion, the better.  It's about self-expression yes, but isn't it also about discovery?</div>

<div class="content">The trackback ping doesn't seem to be working from my MT either. I pinged this entry but I don't see it after several minutes. I'm assuming that's the server migration problem that you mentioned. Good luck with the move, that's rough.</div>

<div class="content">Forget what I just said, after posting this comment, the trackback appeared. Weird. I'm assuming no causal connection, only possible explanation I can muster is some proxy caching issue or the like.</div>
