        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I completely disagree with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ozzie.net/blog/2002/09/25.html#a65&quot;&gt;Ray Ozzie&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;quot;I&amp;apos;m thinking right now that I&amp;apos;d prefer to stick with human talkback rather than automated pingback&amp;quot;), &lt;a href=&quot;http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/09/25.html#a2597&quot;&gt;John Robb&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;quot;I don&amp;apos;t want pingback, trackback, or refererback.&amp;quot;), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/2002/09/25.html#a1192&quot;&gt;Sam Gentile&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;quot;Amen to that.&amp;quot;).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I want as much automated and intervention-free invitation to participation in my blog as I can provide.  I want &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/03/13/manufacturedSerendipity.html&quot;&gt;manufactured serendipty&lt;/a&gt; to operate here while I&amp;apos;m away or asleep.  I want this site to help me discover connections and uncover links, whether by automated agent or by friendly visitor.  I want to lower the thresholds to interaction as far as I can.  I love it when I&amp;apos;ve seen a few visitors to my site talk amongst themselves while I was on my drive to work.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Of course, I&amp;apos;ve never been cracked or assaulted by an exploit of my systems.  I don&amp;apos;t have unwanted stalkers or abusive anti-fans or malicious kids or babbling spammers after me in this space.  Perhaps if I did, my systems might not tend toward such openness.  I think this is a statement on many things beyond blogs, but that&amp;apos;s a post for other days.  Maybe some day I&amp;apos;ll have these negative elements facing me, and I&amp;apos;ll have to revise my systems and their direction to account for them.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, I&amp;apos;ve got a naive notion that the openness itself can counteract much of the reason to become closed in the first place.  Should the need arise, I think I can come up with some measures to deflect inane and juvenile attacks.  As for spammers, I tend to think that their days are numbered anyway - but if they do arrive on my weblog I think I can leverage many of the technologies I use right now with great effectiveness on my email inbox.  But, to defuse real frustration behind attacks, I tend to think that &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; communication, not less, is what&amp;apos;s needed.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But I&amp;apos;m not sure at all, though, whether or not the threat of abuse is what motivates Ray and John to leave automated discussion channels closed.  It&amp;apos;s just one motive I&amp;apos;ve seen discussed before.  I think they want more &amp;quot;human&amp;quot; and personal contact.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With regards to that:  The irony in my life is that, with my lack of much free time,  automated agents, aggregators, and weblogs have given me more personal contact with human beings than I might have been able to achieve without them.  I&amp;apos;m trying to remember the thread a few months ago between &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner&quot;&gt;DaveWiner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JonUdell&quot;&gt;JonUdell&lt;/a&gt;, and others concerning humans with the uncanny ability to connect other people together.  This very thing was supposed:  That aggregators and weblogs could augment one&amp;apos;s ability to act as such a superconnector.  In that regard, I consider my agents, aggregators, and weblogs as integral to me as the new and improved pair of glasses I picked up last week.  Just as I can&amp;apos;t see road signs without my glasses, I can&amp;apos;t keep track of people without my agents.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; And happily, Greg Graham, someone I&amp;apos;ve not met before, sends me an &lt;a href=&quot;http://theologynotes.org/archives/000013.html#000013&quot;&gt;unexpected &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack&quot;&gt;TrackBack&lt;/a&gt; ping and invites me to another blog I&amp;apos;ve never visited.&lt;/p&gt;

<div class="content">I agree with you strongly, l.m.  I believe the cries of "those others" you mentioned stink of elitism and a "let them eat cake" kind of attitude.  The more connected and in the most automated fashion, the better.  It's about self-expression yes, but isn't it also about discovery?</div>

<div class="content">The trackback ping doesn't seem to be working from my MT either. I pinged this entry but I don't see it after several minutes. I'm assuming that's the server migration problem that you mentioned. Good luck with the move, that's rough.</div>
