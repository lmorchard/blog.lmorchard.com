I want <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/03/13/manufacturedSerendipity.html\">manufactured serendipty</a> to operate here while I&#39;m away or asleep.  I want this site to help me discover connections and uncover links, whether by automated agent or by friendly visitor.  I want to lower the thresholds to interaction as far as I can.  I love it when I&#39;ve seen a few visitors to my site talk amongst themselves while I was on my drive to work.\n<br /><br />\nOf course, I&#39;ve never been cracked or assaulted by an exploit of my systems.  I don&#39;t have unwanted stalkers or abusive anti-fans or malicious kids or babbling spammers after me in this space.  Perhaps if I did, my systems might not tend toward such openness.  I think this is a statement on many things beyond blogs, but that&#39;s a post for other days.  Maybe some day I&#39;ll have these negative elements facing me, and I&#39;ll have to revise my systems and their direction to account for them.\n<br /><br />\nOn the other hand, I&#39;ve got a naive notion that the openness itself can counteract much of the reason to become closed in the first place.  Should the need arise, I think I can come up with some measures to deflect inane and juvenile attacks.  As for spammers, I tend to think that their days are numbered anyway - but if they do arrive on my weblog I think I can leverage many of the technologies I use right now with great effectiveness on my email inbox.  But, to defuse real frustration behind attacks, I tend to think that <strong>more</strong> communication, not less, is what&#39;s needed.\n<br /><br />\nBut I&#39;m not sure at all, though, whether or not the threat of abuse is what motivates Ray and John to leave automated discussion channels closed.  It&#39;s just one motive I&#39;ve seen discussed before.  I think they want more &quot;human&quot; and personal contact.\n<br /><br />\nWith regards to that:  The irony in my life is that, with my lack of much free time,  automated agents, aggregators, and weblogs have given me more personal contact with human beings than I might have been able to achieve without them.  I&#39;m trying to remember the thread a few months ago between <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner\">DaveWiner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JonUdell\">JonUdell</a>, and others concerning humans with the uncanny ability to connect other people together.  This very thing was supposed:  That aggregators and weblogs could augment one&#39;s ability to act as such a superconnector.  In that regard, I consider my agents, aggregators, and weblogs as integral to me as the new and improved pair of glasses I picked up last week.  Just as I can&#39;t see road signs without my glasses, I can&#39;t keep track of people without my agents.\n<br /><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.\n<br /><br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> And happily, Greg Graham, someone I&#39;ve not met before, sends me an <a href=\"http://theologynotes.org/archives/000013.html#000013\">unexpected <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> ping</a> and invites me to another blog I&#39;ve never visited.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ooobie</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090630\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=89410ff704c02b63e1ab39fe07d54905&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/\">Sam Ruby</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090630\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-25T22:18:43\">2002-09-25T22:18:43</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I'm not sure what is going on..

  "summary": "<p>I completely disagree with <a href=\"http://www.ozzie.net/blog/2002/09/25.html#a65\">Ray Ozzie</a> (&quot;I&apos;m thinking right now that I&apos;d prefer to stick with human talkback rather than automated pingback&quot;), <a href=\"http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/09/25.html#a2597\">John Robb</a> (&quot;I don&apos;t want pingback, trackback, or refererback.&quot;), and <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/2002/09/25.html#a1192\">Sam Gentile</a> (&quot;Amen to that.&quot;).\n<br><br>\nI want as much automated and intervention-free invitation to participation in my blog as I can provide.  I want <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/03/13/manufacturedSerendipity.html\">manufactured serendipty</a> to operate here while I&apos;m away or asleep.  I want this site to help me discover connections and uncover links, whether by automated agent or by friendly visitor.  I want to lower the thresholds to interaction as far as I can.  I love it when I&apos;ve seen a few visitors to my site talk amongst themselves while I was on my drive to work.\n<br><br>\nOf course, I&apos;ve never been cracked or assaulted by an exploit of my systems.  I don&apos;t have unwanted stalkers or abusive anti-fans or malicious kids or babbling spammers after me in this space.  Perhaps if I did, my systems might not tend toward such openness.  I think this is a statement on many things beyond blogs, but that&apos;s a post for other days.  Maybe some day I&apos;ll have these negative elements facing me, and I&apos;ll have to revise my systems and their direction to account for them.\n<br><br>\nOn the other hand, I&apos;ve got a naive notion that the openness itself can counteract much of the reason to become closed in the first place.  Should the need arise, I think I can come up with some measures to deflect inane and juvenile attacks.  As for spammers, I tend to think that their days are numbered anyway - but if they do arrive on my weblog I think I can leverage many of the technologies I use right now with great effectiveness on my email inbox.  But, to defuse real frustration behind attacks, I tend to think that <strong>more</strong> communication, not less, is what&apos;s needed.\n<br><br>\nBut I&apos;m not sure at all, though, whether or not the threat of abuse is what motivates Ray and John to leave automated discussion channels closed.  It&apos;s just one motive I&apos;ve seen discussed before.  I think they want more &quot;human&quot; and personal contact.\n<br><br>\nWith regards to that:  The irony in my life is that, with my lack of much free time,  automated agents, aggregators, and weblogs have given me more personal contact with human beings than I might have been able to achieve without them.  I&apos;m trying to remember the thread a few months ago between <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner\">DaveWiner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JonUdell\">JonUdell</a>, and others concerning humans with the uncanny ability to connect other people together.  This very thing was supposed:  That aggregators and weblogs could augment one&apos;s ability to act as such a superconnector.  In that regard, I consider my agents, aggregators, and weblogs as integral to me as the new and improved pair of glasses I picked up last week.  Just as I can&apos;t see road signs without my glasses, I can&apos;t keep track of people without my agents.\n<br><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Update:</strong> And happily, Greg Graham, someone I&apos;ve not met before, sends me an <a href=\"http://theologynotes.org/archives/000013.html#000013\">unexpected </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> ping and invites me to another blog I&apos;ve never visited.</p>\n"
