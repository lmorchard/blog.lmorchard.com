I believe the cries of &quot;those others&quot; you mentioned stink of elitism and a &quot;let them eat cake&quot; kind of attitude.  The more connected and in the most automated fashion, the better.

I pinged this entry but I don&#39;t see it after several minutes. I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s the server migration problem that you mentioned.

Weird.
