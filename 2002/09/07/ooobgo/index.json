I wonder how much it can really run at one time before hitting memory constraints? (Python? Medusa?

  "summary": "A strange little idea I had on the way home today:  Movable Type on a Sharp Zaurus equipped with wireless ethernet?  Or maybe Bloxsom if/when it has static publishing?  Just use rsync to publish whenever the thing finds itself on a network, wireless or otherwise.  Maybe that happens while you're out Warwalking - better yet, maybe that wireless network detector you cobbled together autoblogs what it finds while in your pocket.  \nBut, beyond that, I wonder what else having your blog in your pocket might give you?  Toss in a GPS unit somehow, maybe some other things like a thermometer device?  A compass?  Thinking about ways to automatically capture metadata about your present environment.  Why?  Why not, I'm sure if I thought longer, that stuff would seem useful.  \nAnd then there's the non-automatic writing you might do: jot down thoughts occuring on the spur of the moment; capture the scene as you sit in the park; report on the scene of an accident - or a disaster?  If you have a digital camera, and if both the PDA and camera had bluetooth, integrate the two so that you can easily combine the picture and 1000 words while they're fresh in your mind.\nBut what about the other end of things - aggregation and reading?  Install AmphetaDesk along with, maybe, a web cache and spider that proactively slurps down new news items when it's near a firehose net connection.  If you're in a town with frequent dips into the bandwidth pool as you wander around, maybe you'll catch another BlogWalker in your referrers, linking to what you just posted.  Meet up and have some coffee.  Hell, become a smart mob with a few other BlogWalkers.\nEh, I think I'm starting to ramble and get carried away, but in between reading VernorVinge and RayKurzweil books lately, I'm in a mood to immanentize the eschaton and tinker my way on into the Singularity.\n(And, oh yeah, I'm in a pretentiously linky mood.  (And could that be a valid mood in these days?))",
