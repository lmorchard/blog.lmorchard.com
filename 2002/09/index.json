These parsers are often cheaper to deal with when you know that the format you&#39;re expecting doesn&#39;t involve namespaces.  You trade some flexibility for some ease of development.<blockquote><i>For these guys, just introducing an xmlns attribute is enough to make them reject the feed. So while they could handle a 0.92 feed, as soon as we introduced the xmlns attribute, they gave up.</i></blockquote>Yes, because they weren&#39;t expecting to be fed something with namespaces, since they&#39;d been designed around v0.92 and family, and had been fed v2.0 with the expectation that it was 100% backward-compatible.<blockquote><i>...Presumably <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 doesn&#39;t have the same problem we tripped over yesterday with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0. So I looked at a few <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 feeds, and guess what, they do the same thing we were doing with the 2.0 feeds. ...  I conclude that the same broken parsers that didn&#39;t like the 2.0 feeds with the xmlns attributes, must also not like the 1.0 feeds.</i></blockquote>And your conclusion would likely be correct - because those parsers weren&#39;t expecting to consume namespace-using XML, and they shouldn&#39;t be expecting <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> v1.0.  If an application is designed with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 in mind, then the author should be using a namespace-aware parser and correctly handle the namespaces, since that&#39;s the nature of the beast.  To neglect or mishandle namespaces in consuming <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 is a mistake.<br><br /><br />\nAdmittedly, some applications which apparently consume <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> v1.0 feeds correctly may be broken in this way - this is not unique to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> v2.0.  If they&#39;re broken, they need fixing.   But that&#39;s another story...\n<br /><br />\nSo, on to the conclusion:<blockquote><i>If this is true, we can&#39;t design using namespaces until:\n<br /><br /></p>\n<ol>\n<li>All the parsers are fixed, or\n<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Users/content providers expect and accept this kind of breakage (I don&#39;t want to be the one delivering that bit of bad news, got burned not only by the users, but by developers too, people generally don&#39;t know about this problem, or if they do know are not being responsible with the info).\n<br /><br />\nAnyway it looks to me like there&#39;s a big problem in the strategy of formats that intend to organize around namespaces.</blockquote></i>Well, of course, end users should not expect breakage.  This is obvious to me.  No one really wants that.<br><br /><br />\nThe big problem I see in the strategy, though, is this:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 claims to be backward-compatible with the 0.9x family, but the addition of namespaces in XML is enough of a fundamental change to break this.  I think <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/message/4115\">what Shelly wrote in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>-DEV</a> is correct:  &quot;Namespace support is NOT a\ntrivial change, and will break several technologies, including <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> if\nnamespace support isn&#39;t compiled in. This isn&#39;t something that can be\nhacked out.&quot;\n<br /><br />\nWhen I originally read about the emergence of something called <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0, I said &quot;<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000268.phtml#000268\">Go man, go</a>!&quot;  But I also said, &quot;What&#39;s the catch?&quot;  Well, this appears to be a catch.  But I think it can be worked through.  This is not a <strong>fundamental</strong> problem with namespaces themselves.  This is a versioning problem, and a problem with anticipating all the implications the new version brings to the table.  This goes for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0, <strong>as well as</strong> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0.\n<br /><br />\nThe first thing is to nail a few things down about version numbers and reverse-compatibility.  It&#39;s been my experience that, when some thing experiences an increment to its major version number, reverse-compatibility is not guaranteed.  So, I would assume that from a v0.94 to a v2.0, things are sufficiently different that using it would require that, indeed, &quot;All the parsers are fixed&quot; to support the new major version.  So for the most part, v2.0 follows the v0.94 tradition faithfully, but on this issue it parts ways - and yes, potential consumers of v2.0 feeds will need to adjust from their v0.94 code.  Thems the breaks, I&#39;ve been told, when it comes to major version upgrades.\n<br /><br />\nSo, again, I don&#39;t think that this is a fundamental flaw with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0, or namespaces.  This is an issue of versioning, understanding the technology&#39;s implications, and reverse-compatibility.<!--more-->\nshortname=ooobii</li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089859\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scripting.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=dc59c5ba9a8aa0a6225d9959eea3b7f3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scripting.com/\">Dave Winer</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089859\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-28T16:18:26\">2002-09-28T16:18:26</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Very interesting and thanks for the thoughtful comments. So the problem could be nailed by adding a comment to the 2.0 spec saying something like this (not an attempt at spec text):\nRSS 2.0 feeds are compatible with 0.91 and 0.92 in that every 0.91 or 0.92 source is also a 2.0 source (modulo the version attribute on the rss element), with the exception that, if it uses namespaces, it may not work with some aggregators that do not correctly parse sources that use namespaces. As of Fall 2002, there are enough incompatible parsers to make this advisory necessary. If you wish to be fully backward compatible, do not use namespaces in your feeds.\nDoes this basically sum up your post?? If so, I think that serves as enough of a red flag for non-namespace aware parsers that some feeds at some time in the future will break (maybe now) and that they should test with 2.0 feeds that do use the namespace compatibility, the sooner the better.\nDave</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089861\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9c49b9a4f6b6f35c422a05921bd41ad5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Charles Cook</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089861\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-28T16:36:58\">2002-09-28T16:36:58</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">The problem is nothing to do with parsers.

So the problem could be nailed by adding a comment to the 2.0 spec saying something like this (not an attempt at spec text):\r\n\r\nRSS 2.0 feeds are compatible with 0.91 and 0.92 in that every 0.91 or 0.92 source is also a 2.0 source (modulo the version attribute on the rss element), with the exception that, if it uses namespaces, it may not work with some aggregators that do not correctly parse sources that use namespaces. As of Fall 2002, there are enough incompatible parsers to make this advisory necessary. If you wish to be fully backward compatible, do not use namespaces in your feeds.\r\n\r\nDoes this basically sum up your post?? If so, I think that serves as enough of a red flag for non-namespace aware parsers that some feeds at some time in the future will break (maybe now) and that they should test with 2.0 feeds that do use the namespace compatibility, the sooner the better.\r\n\r\nDave</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089861\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9c49b9a4f6b6f35c422a05921bd41ad5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Charles Cook</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089861\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-28T16:36:58\">2002-09-28T16:36:58</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">The problem is nothing to do with parsers.

    "summary": "<p>Dave writes on &quot;<a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1766\">RSS and Namespaces</a>&quot;:</p><blockquote><i>... there are some XML parsers that don&apos;t properly deal with namespace attributes on the top-level element of a source.</i></blockquote>Agreed.  These parsers are often cheaper to deal with when you know that the format you&apos;re expecting doesn&apos;t involve namespaces.  You trade some flexibility for some ease of development.<blockquote><i>For these guys, just introducing an xmlns attribute is enough to make them reject the feed. So while they could handle a 0.92 feed, as soon as we introduced the xmlns attribute, they gave up.</i></blockquote>Yes, because they weren&apos;t expecting to be fed something with namespaces, since they&apos;d been designed around v0.92 and family, and had been fed v2.0 with the expectation that it was 100% backward-compatible.<blockquote><i>...Presumably <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 doesn&apos;t have the same problem we tripped over yesterday with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0. So I looked at a few <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 feeds, and guess what, they do the same thing we were doing with the 2.0 feeds. ...  I conclude that the same broken parsers that didn&apos;t like the 2.0 feeds with the xmlns attributes, must also not like the 1.0 feeds.</i></blockquote>And your conclusion would likely be correct - because those parsers weren&apos;t expecting to consume namespace-using XML, and they shouldn&apos;t be expecting <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> v1.0.  If an application is designed with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 in mind, then the author should be using a namespace-aware parser and correctly handle the namespaces, since that&apos;s the nature of the beast.  To neglect or mishandle namespaces in consuming <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 is a mistake.<br><br><br>\nAdmittedly, some applications which apparently consume <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> v1.0 feeds correctly may be broken in this way - this is not unique to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> v2.0.  If they&apos;re broken, they need fixing.   But that&apos;s another story...\n<br><br>\nSo, on to the conclusion:<blockquote><i>If this is true, we can&apos;t design using namespaces until:\n<br><br><p></p>\n<ol>\n<li>All the parsers are fixed, or\n<br><br></li>\n<li>Users/content providers expect and accept this kind of breakage (I don&apos;t want to be the one delivering that bit of bad news, got burned not only by the users, but by developers too, people generally don&apos;t know about this problem, or if they do know are not being responsible with the info).\n<br><br>\nAnyway it looks to me like there&apos;s a big problem in the strategy of formats that intend to organize around namespaces.</li></ol></i></blockquote>Well, of course, end users should not expect breakage.  This is obvious to me.  No one really wants that.<br><br><br>\nThe big problem I see in the strategy, though, is this:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 claims to be backward-compatible with the 0.9x family, but the addition of namespaces in XML is enough of a fundamental change to break this.  I think <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/message/4115\">what Shelly wrote in </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>-DEV is correct:  &quot;Namespace support is NOT a\ntrivial change, and will break several technologies, including <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> if\nnamespace support isn&apos;t compiled in. This isn&apos;t something that can be\nhacked out.&quot;\n<br><br>\nWhen I originally read about the emergence of something called <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0, I said &quot;<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000268.phtml#000268\">Go man, go</a>!&quot;  But I also said, &quot;What&apos;s the catch?&quot;  Well, this appears to be a catch.  But I think it can be worked through.  This is not a <strong>fundamental</strong> problem with namespaces themselves.  This is a versioning problem, and a problem with anticipating all the implications the new version brings to the table.  This goes for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0, <strong>as well as</strong> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0.\n<br><br>\nThe first thing is to nail a few things down about version numbers and reverse-compatibility.  It&apos;s been my experience that, when some thing experiences an increment to its major version number, reverse-compatibility is not guaranteed.  So, I would assume that from a v0.94 to a v2.0, things are sufficiently different that using it would require that, indeed, &quot;All the parsers are fixed&quot; to support the new major version.  So for the most part, v2.0 follows the v0.94 tradition faithfully, but on this issue it parts ways - and yes, potential consumers of v2.0 feeds will need to adjust from their v0.94 code.  Thems the breaks, I&apos;ve been told, when it comes to major version upgrades.\n<br><br>\nSo, again, I don&apos;t think that this is a fundamental flaw with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0, or namespaces.

If you don't have an MT subdir in there then you can just create one, then another subdir called decafbad. Also if you don't have the plugins directory in your root MT folder you'll have to create that one as well.

If you don't have an MT subdir in there then you can just create one, then another subdir called decafbad. Also if you don't have the plugins directory in your root MT folder you'll have to create that one as well.

I want <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/03/13/manufacturedSerendipity.html\">manufactured serendipty</a> to operate here while I&#39;m away or asleep.  I want this site to help me discover connections and uncover links, whether by automated agent or by friendly visitor.  I want to lower the thresholds to interaction as far as I can.  I love it when I&#39;ve seen a few visitors to my site talk amongst themselves while I was on my drive to work.\n<br /><br />\nOf course, I&#39;ve never been cracked or assaulted by an exploit of my systems.  I don&#39;t have unwanted stalkers or abusive anti-fans or malicious kids or babbling spammers after me in this space.  Perhaps if I did, my systems might not tend toward such openness.  I think this is a statement on many things beyond blogs, but that&#39;s a post for other days.  Maybe some day I&#39;ll have these negative elements facing me, and I&#39;ll have to revise my systems and their direction to account for them.\n<br /><br />\nOn the other hand, I&#39;ve got a naive notion that the openness itself can counteract much of the reason to become closed in the first place.  Should the need arise, I think I can come up with some measures to deflect inane and juvenile attacks.  As for spammers, I tend to think that their days are numbered anyway - but if they do arrive on my weblog I think I can leverage many of the technologies I use right now with great effectiveness on my email inbox.  But, to defuse real frustration behind attacks, I tend to think that <strong>more</strong> communication, not less, is what&#39;s needed.\n<br /><br />\nBut I&#39;m not sure at all, though, whether or not the threat of abuse is what motivates Ray and John to leave automated discussion channels closed.  It&#39;s just one motive I&#39;ve seen discussed before.  I think they want more &quot;human&quot; and personal contact.\n<br /><br />\nWith regards to that:  The irony in my life is that, with my lack of much free time,  automated agents, aggregators, and weblogs have given me more personal contact with human beings than I might have been able to achieve without them.  I&#39;m trying to remember the thread a few months ago between <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner\">DaveWiner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JonUdell\">JonUdell</a>, and others concerning humans with the uncanny ability to connect other people together.  This very thing was supposed:  That aggregators and weblogs could augment one&#39;s ability to act as such a superconnector.  In that regard, I consider my agents, aggregators, and weblogs as integral to me as the new and improved pair of glasses I picked up last week.  Just as I can&#39;t see road signs without my glasses, I can&#39;t keep track of people without my agents.\n<br /><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.\n<br /><br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> And happily, Greg Graham, someone I&#39;ve not met before, sends me an <a href=\"http://theologynotes.org/archives/000013.html#000013\">unexpected <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> ping</a> and invites me to another blog I&#39;ve never visited.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ooobie</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090630\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=89410ff704c02b63e1ab39fe07d54905&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/\">Sam Ruby</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090630\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-25T22:18:43\">2002-09-25T22:18:43</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I'm not sure what is going on..

    "html": "<p>I&#39;ve got some further thoughts on <a href=\"http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback-1.0\">Pingback</a>, provided that my server humors me.<br><br /><br />\nDavid Watson says, &quot;<a href=\"http://davidwatson.org:8086/archives/000610.html\">uh, no</a>,&quot; citing a horrible experience in actually trying to see the spec in the first place, and a lack of working code.  Not to mention that my site was having a seizure last night - not good things to recommend that one check out a new technology. \n<br /><br />\nWell, I did manage to see the spec, but haven&#39;t tried implementing it yet.  (Though it shouldn&#39;t be too hard, given a few round tuits.)  A few things, in particular that I like about <a href=\"http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback-1.0\">Pingback</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> URIs are used to specify the source and target of the ping, no other information is involved in setting up the relation (ie. arbitrary IDs, etc).  This makes site-wide integration of Pingback drop-dead simple - everything's already identifiable via URI.\n</li>\n<li> If one implements Pingback HTTP headers, one can allow non-HTML resources to be pinged.  (ie. Ping my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF\">FOAF</a> file when you add me to yours, and I might add you to mine.  That might be pushing the spec a bit, though.)\n</li>\n<li> The XML-RPC server is not tied to any sites it may serve.  I could offer one here, and you could point to it from your site, and if I allowed it I could record pings for you as a service.\n</li>\n</ul>\nAll-in-all, Pingback just seems like a more direct, intentional form of referrer log.\n<br /><br />\nOne thing I don't like about Pingback, though (and the same for referrer logs):  It's just about URIs and links between them.  It says nothing much about titles or excerpts or comment bodies.  The spec suggests that a Pingback server <strong>might</strong> retrieve \"other data required from the content of Alice's new post,\" but makes no statement on how this is to happen.  I like that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> sets down how to provide a bit more information.\n<br /><br />\nI've got a vague idea in my little head, and I think it's something <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net\">Sam Ruby</a> touched on:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShowReferers\">ShowReferers</a>, form-submitted comments, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a>, and Pingback are all just different on-ramps to inviting open participation in discussion on one's blog.  I want to take a shot at implementing Pingback very soon - but I might also try taking a shot at implementing a unified comment system that accepts comments for any URI from any of the aforementioned sources.  I'd also like something that scans a blog entry I post for links, then investigate those links for Pingback/TrackBack availability - all to make the system even <strong>more</strong> automatic.  I doubt that it would be very difficult, though I am notoriously naive.  On the other hand, I've been on a run of making hard things simple lately.  :)\n<br /><br />\nBut I sense my round tuits slipping away - back to work!\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooobib\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090107\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ln.hixie.ch/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=415e6b05a1e7e278ba8dedae90df8d8d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ln.hixie.ch/\">Ian Hickson</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090107\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-24T14:05:20\">2002-09-24T14:05:20</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\"something that scans a blog entry I post for links, then investigate those links for Pingback/TrackBack availability\" is exactly how most pingback clients work at the moment.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090109\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://mort.mine.nu:8080/b2/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=754d13c6eb258724a2137feb3ee1bad3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://mort.mine.nu:8080/b2/\">mort</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090109\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-26T14:14:30\">2002-09-26T14:14:30</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\" The spec suggests that a Pingback server might retrieve \"other data required from the content of Alice's new post,\" but makes no statement on how this is to happen.\"\nWell, as the server scans the referrer for checking the authenticity of the ping, etc.. it can grab pretty much what it wants: lang attributes, page title, excerpts...</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090110\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090110\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-26T15:44:55\">2002-09-26T15:44:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">it can grab pretty much what it wants: lang attributes, page title, excerpts...\nHow and where does the server scan the referrer for things?

    "body": "I've got some further thoughts on <a href=\"http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback-1.0\">Pingback</a>, provided that my server humors me.  \r\n<br /><br />\r\nDavid Watson says, \"<a href=\"http://davidwatson.org:8086/archives/000610.html\">uh, no</a>,\" citing a horrible experience in actually trying to see the spec in the first place, and a lack of working code.  Not to mention that my site was having a seizure last night - not good things to recommend that one check out a new technology. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nWell, I did manage to see the spec, but haven't tried implementing it yet.  (Though it shouldn't be too hard, given a few round tuits.)  A few things, in particular that I like about <a href=\"http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback-1.0\">Pingback</a>:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> URIs are used to specify the source and target of the ping, no other information is involved in setting up the relation (ie. arbitrary IDs, etc).  This makes site-wide integration of Pingback drop-dead simple - everything's already identifiable via URI.\r\n</li>\r\n<li> If one implements Pingback HTTP headers, one can allow non-HTML resources to be pinged.  (ie. Ping my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF\">FOAF</a> file when you add me to yours, and I might add you to mine.  That might be pushing the spec a bit, though.)\r\n</li>\r\n<li> The XML-RPC server is not tied to any sites it may serve.  I could offer one here, and you could point to it from your site, and if I allowed it I could record pings for you as a service.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAll-in-all, Pingback just seems like a more direct, intentional form of referrer log.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOne thing I don't like about Pingback, though (and the same for referrer logs):  It's just about URIs and links between them.  It says nothing much about titles or excerpts or comment bodies.  The spec suggests that a Pingback server <strong>might</strong> retrieve \"other data required from the content of Alice's new post,\" but makes no statement on how this is to happen.  I like that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> sets down how to provide a bit more information.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nI've got a vague idea in my little head, and I think it's something <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net\">Sam Ruby</a> touched on:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShowReferers\">ShowReferers</a>, form-submitted comments, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a>, and Pingback are all just different on-ramps to inviting open participation in discussion on one's blog.  I want to take a shot at implementing Pingback very soon - but I might also try taking a shot at implementing a unified comment system that accepts comments for any URI from any of the aforementioned sources.  I'd also like something that scans a blog entry I post for links, then investigate those links for Pingback/TrackBack availability - all to make the system even <strong>more</strong> automatic.  I doubt that it would be very difficult, though I am notoriously naive.  On the other hand, I've been on a run of making hard things simple lately.  :)\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBut I sense my round tuits slipping away - back to work!\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=ooobib\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090107\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://ln.hixie.ch/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=415e6b05a1e7e278ba8dedae90df8d8d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://ln.hixie.ch/\">Ian Hickson</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090107\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-24T14:05:20\">2002-09-24T14:05:20</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">\"something that scans a blog entry I post for links, then investigate those links for Pingback/TrackBack availability\" is exactly how most pingback clients work at the moment.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090109\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://mort.mine.nu:8080/b2/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=754d13c6eb258724a2137feb3ee1bad3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://mort.mine.nu:8080/b2/\">mort</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090109\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-26T14:14:30\">2002-09-26T14:14:30</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">\" The spec suggests that a Pingback server might retrieve \"other data required from the content of Alice's new post,\" but makes no statement on how this is to happen.\"\r\n\r\nWell, as the server scans the referrer for checking the authenticity of the ping, etc.. it can grab pretty much what it wants: lang attributes, page title, excerpts...</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090110\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090110\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-26T15:44:55\">2002-09-26T15:44:55</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">it can grab pretty much what it wants: lang attributes, page title, excerpts...\r\n\r\nHow and where does the server scan the referrer for things?

Not to mention that my site was having a seizure last night - not good things to recommend that one check out a new technology. \n<br><br>\nWell, I did manage to see the spec, but haven&apos;t tried implementing it yet.  (Though it shouldn&apos;t be too hard, given a few round tuits.)  A few things, in particular that I like about <a href=\"http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback-1.0\">Pingback</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> URIs are used to specify the source and target of the ping, no other information is involved in setting up the relation (ie. arbitrary IDs, etc).  This makes site-wide integration of Pingback drop-dead simple - everything&apos;s already identifiable via URI.\n</li>\n<li> If one implements Pingback HTTP headers, one can allow non-HTML resources to be pinged.  (ie. Ping my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF\">FOAF</a> file when you add me to yours, and I might add you to mine.  That might be pushing the spec a bit, though.)\n</li>\n<li> The XML-RPC server is not tied to any sites it may serve.  I could offer one here, and you could point to it from your site, and if I allowed it I could record pings for you as a service.\n</li>\n</ul>\nAll-in-all, Pingback just seems like a more direct, intentional form of referrer log.\n<br><br>\nOne thing I don&apos;t like about Pingback, though (and the same for referrer logs):  It&apos;s just about URIs and links between them.  It says nothing much about titles or excerpts or comment bodies.  The spec suggests that a Pingback server <strong>might</strong> retrieve &quot;other data required from the content of Alice&apos;s new post,&quot; but makes no statement on how this is to happen.  I like that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> sets down how to provide a bit more information.\n<br><br>\nI&apos;ve got a vague idea in my little head, and I think it&apos;s something <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net\">Sam Ruby</a> touched on:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShowReferers\">ShowReferers</a>, form-submitted comments, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a>, and Pingback are all just different on-ramps to inviting open participation in discussion on one&apos;s blog.  I want to take a shot at implementing Pingback very soon - but I might also try taking a shot at implementing a unified comment system that accepts comments for any URI from any of the aforementioned sources.  I&apos;d also like something that scans a blog entry I post for links, then investigate those links for Pingback/TrackBack availability - all to make the system even <strong>more</strong> automatic.  I doubt that it would be very difficult, though I am notoriously naive.  On the other hand, I&apos;ve been on a run of making hard things simple lately.  :)\n<br><br>\nBut I sense my round tuits slipping away - back to work!\n",

As long as each item in the comment RSS feed references a URL that exists in the article RSS feed, aggregators should have little trouble matching one to the other. Having a separate RSS feed for comments per article means that aggregators would have to first get the RSS feed for the articles, then use RSS auto-discovery (as there would be NO other way) to locate the comment feed for each new article, then go get the comment RSS feed.

As long as each item in the comment RSS feed references a URL that exists in the article RSS feed, aggregators should have little trouble matching one to the other. Having a separate RSS feed for comments per article means that aggregators would have to first get the RSS feed for the articles, then use RSS auto-discovery (as there would be NO other way) to locate the comment feed for each new article, then go get the comment RSS feed. This is a lot more work, not to mention more network bandwidth.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

    "summary": "<p>After following the <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/836.html\">thread on Sam Ruby&apos;s blog</a> about <a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/09/20#When:8:39:43AM\">Dave&apos;s  comment tracking feature request</a>, I figured I&apos;d try <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>-izing comments on each of my posts.  As things seem to have been going lately, I&apos;d underestimated <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>, and it turned out <strong>so</strong> much easier than I&apos;d thought.  :)  I&apos;d had an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/recent_comments_rss.xml\">RSS feed for comments overall</a> on my site, but now I have individual <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds for each post.  (Notice the <img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/images/xml.gif\"> in the comments section now.)  The <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed is also linked in the head as per <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/31.html#more_on_rss_autodiscovery\">RSS autodiscovery</a> discussions.\n<br><br>\nI don&apos;t think aggregators are really ready yet for these per-post comment <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds, but the availability of the data gives food for hacking.  Being that they&apos;re pretty disposable and of interest for a very short time, aggregators will likely need to implement expiry times for feeds, or watch for a period of inactivity before unsubbing.  Grouing feeds would be nice too, in case I wanted to round up all my points of weblog discussion participation.  I&apos;ve got a few things of this sort in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlinesWishList\">AmphetaOutlinesWishList</a>, with which I hope to play with further aggregator ideas.\n<br><br>\nIf you use <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> and you&apos;re interested in trying this, check out these two templates:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/recent_comments_rss.xml.tmpl\">recent_comments_rss.xml.tmpl</a>, for blog-wide comments; and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/archive_entry.rss.tmpl\">archive_entry.rss.tmpl</a>, for per-post comments.  The former template is added as an index template in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>, whereas the latter is an archive template.  Also, the per-post archive template will need to be added to the list of individual archive templates in the <strong>Archiving</strong> section of your blog config.  You&apos;ll want to give it a template for the filename, perhaps something like <code>&lt;$MTEntryID pad=&quot;1&quot;$&gt;.rss</code>.\n<br><br>\nAt present, I&apos;m publishing in what I think is vaguely <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 0.92 format.  Whether it complies with the spec, I&apos;m not quite sure because I was lazy.  I plan to revisit this soon to make it at least comply with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.</p>\n",

I guess it would be reasonable to have your public throwdown address in clear text, ready for yet another spambot to grab, with everything else hashed.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089869\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.redmonk.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f5d280e17d5f7340d7d1dc6728c5a335&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.redmonk.net\">Steve Ivy</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089869\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-20T14:01:58\">2002-09-20T14:01:58</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">As much as I like RDF and FOAF, isn't this whht LDAP (and OpenDirectory) are for?

And I don't think they should.\nWhat appeals to me about something like FOAF (or something better) is that it's a file you can throw up at a URL.  It's dumb.  Everyone can get cheap hosting these days.  The smarts go into your address book, or maybe a centrallized contact info aggregation server somewhere that polls your registered URL.  Maybe *that* aggregation server has an LDAP interface to use as a bridge.\nThis appeals to me as a nice compromise between centralization and decentralization</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089872\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fab5bffa5622f63e6b0ff81a2b0e3956&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net\">Burningbird</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089872\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-20T15:49:12\">2002-09-20T15:49:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">LDAP is an implementation of identification control rather than a generic, \"here's who I am\" statement. One could easily incorporate FOAF into LDAP, but one couldn't easily incorporate LDAP into anything else (unless one stripped out the data structures and incorporate them -- interesting idea worth exploring further).\nI think there needs to be more discussion of FOAF and what type of information should be recorded to 'identify' oneself.\nAlso, I think the important thing to start focusing on is the focus of the vocabularies and implementations, such as FOAF, rather than the fact that they use RDF. RDF is a model, and RDF/XML is a serialization, but the real business is FOAF (or whatever is being discussed).\nBTW, there was effort to translate vCard into RDF at http://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf. I don't believe it reflects recent activities associated with RDF.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089873\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.kunekt.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=394ffdd7ae0ffb1f121f07765d1f83e8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.kunekt.com\">Ian Bruk</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089873\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-10-05T05:37:19\">2002-10-05T05:37:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">We've implemented a tool that converts vCards to RSS and RDF.

And I don't think they should.\r\n\r\nWhat appeals to me about something like FOAF (or something better) is that it's a file you can throw up at a URL.  It's dumb.  Everyone can get cheap hosting these days.  The smarts go into your address book, or maybe a centrallized contact info aggregation server somewhere that polls your registered URL.  Maybe *that* aggregation server has an LDAP interface to use as a bridge.\r\n\r\nThis appeals to me as a nice compromise between centralization and decentralization</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089872\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fab5bffa5622f63e6b0ff81a2b0e3956&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net\">Burningbird</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089872\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-20T15:49:12\">2002-09-20T15:49:12</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">LDAP is an implementation of identification control rather than a generic, \"here's who I am\" statement. One could easily incorporate FOAF into LDAP, but one couldn't easily incorporate LDAP into anything else (unless one stripped out the data structures and incorporate them -- interesting idea worth exploring further).\r\n\r\nI think there needs to be more discussion of FOAF and what type of information should be recorded to 'identify' oneself.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think the important thing to start focusing on is the focus of the vocabularies and implementations, such as FOAF, rather than the fact that they use RDF. RDF is a model, and RDF/XML is a serialization, but the real business is FOAF (or whatever is being discussed).\r\n\r\nBTW, there was effort to translate vCard into RDF at http://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf. I don't believe it reflects recent activities associated with RDF.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089873\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.kunekt.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=394ffdd7ae0ffb1f121f07765d1f83e8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.kunekt.com\">Ian Bruk</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089873\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-10-05T05:37:19\">2002-10-05T05:37:19</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">We've implemented a tool that converts vCards to RSS and RDF.

    "summary": "<p>A very interesting side-effect I hadn&apos;t thought of yesterday when I integrated MT-Search into my wiki is that every wiki page is a mini-content index to my weblog.  Even the really sparse wiki pages where I&apos;ve only blurbed a sentence or so about a topic - now they have some decent content in their pointers back to the weblog where I mentioned them.</p>\n<p>One idea that immediately strikes me is that I need this at work.  I&apos;ve got a barely attended-to experiment in journalling started there, using a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a> installation.  If I could get a similar search hacked into LJ, or scrap LJ and give everyone a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> weblog...  we could very easily integrate up-to-date topic indexes into our existing company wiki.  </p>\n<p>For instance, wiki-word-ize a client&apos;s name, and create a short wiki topic page for that client.  Or, refer to the wiki words belonging to our products.  Then, be sure to include those topic strings in any weblog entries you post internally, and those wiki page will pull in your contributions.  The cross-threading of this seems great to me.  Show me all mutterings about <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/ClientAlpha?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">ClientAlpha</font></span>, and then show me all mutterings about our <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/InstantWin?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">InstantWin</font></span> product.  In some cases, a particular weblog post will appear in both.</p>\n<p>Wow.  That&apos;s getting very close to what I wanted.<br>\n</p>\n",

This resulted in multi-megabyte XML files which <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> happily munched through for each channel to which I'm subscribed.

Upon the first run, the new code will wipe old data from the files.  If your poor, battered machine can't survive another run in the current circumstances, then wipe the contents of <code>data/channels_meta</code> and start again.

But what about blogs like instapundit (at http://www.carlsoncarlson.com/dane/RssDistillerChannels/instapundit.xml) or scripingNews2 feeds, that don't have link tags?

Yeah, that's something I've been thinking about too.  Not quite sure how to address it.  At one point I thought maybe I could do a search-and-replace on href=\"\" to wrap URLs with the click count redirect page.  But that sounds like it could be messy.  \nI was also thinking of counting outline expansions somehow add positive feedback toward a channel.  In the next iteration of this, I want to give the channel a \"score\" that's based on clicks, manual karma rating, and maybe some other things.  And I'd want to give each source of feedback a weight - ie. manual rating carries more importance than clicks perhaps.\nHmm... off to make that wishlist page.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082705\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1f311d2ae9cd3f0e02d56b15924519ca&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\">Ehud Lamm</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082705\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-21T18:09:29\">2002-09-21T18:09:29</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I thought about these ideas too. Exapnding an item, shows you care, doesn't it? :-)\nI think the bigger problem is that we need to make the list hierarchical  (i.e., a tree). For example, there are thread that update regularly, and I read daily. But others, near the bottom of the page, update only once in a while, but when they do, I almost always want to read the full item. I am not sure a linear (1d) scale is what you need. Since I am a fan of machine learning, I can see how this becomes a multi-dimensional problem.\nThinking from the user interface pov, I see a tree widget somewhere in the near future...</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082706\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1f311d2ae9cd3f0e02d56b15924519ca&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\">Ehud Lamm</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082706\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-21T18:14:48\">2002-09-21T18:14:48</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">there are thread that update regularly\n^^^^^^^\nfeeds\nSorry</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

In a second pass I could open all the remaining links.  \r\n\r\nSomething to think about.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082702\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082702\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-20T19:12:48\">2002-09-20T19:12:48</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Ooh, and how are you using Mozilla gestures with AmphetaDesk, might I ask?\r\n\r\nAs for your suggestions...  very good.

Yeah, that's something I've been thinking about too.  Not quite sure how to address it.  At one point I thought maybe I could do a search-and-replace on href=\"\" to wrap URLs with the click count redirect page.  But that sounds like it could be messy.  \r\n\r\nI was also thinking of counting outline expansions somehow add positive feedback toward a channel.  In the next iteration of this, I want to give the channel a \"score\" that's based on clicks, manual karma rating, and maybe some other things.  And I'd want to give each source of feedback a weight - ie. manual rating carries more importance than clicks perhaps.\r\n\r\nHmm... off to make that wishlist page.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082705\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1f311d2ae9cd3f0e02d56b15924519ca&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\">Ehud Lamm</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082705\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-21T18:09:29\">2002-09-21T18:09:29</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I thought about these ideas too. Exapnding an item, shows you care, doesn't it? :-)\r\nI think the bigger problem is that we need to make the list hierarchical  (i.e., a tree). For example, there are thread that update regularly, and I read daily. But others, near the bottom of the page, update only once in a while, but when they do, I almost always want to read the full item. I am not sure a linear (1d) scale is what you need. Since I am a fan of machine learning, I can see how this becomes a multi-dimensional problem.\r\nThinking from the user interface pov, I see a tree widget somewhere in the near future...</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082706\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1f311d2ae9cd3f0e02d56b15924519ca&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\">Ehud Lamm</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082706\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-21T18:14:48\">2002-09-21T18:14:48</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">there are thread that update regularly\r\n         ^^^^^^^\r\n          feeds\r\n\r\nSorry</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

And then, very recently, the thing became insatiable with desire for my CPU and memory.</p>\n<p>Turns out, in my spiffy new XML channel/item metadata files, I wasn&apos;t deleting data associated with old and no longer available items.  This resulted in multi-megabyte XML files which <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> happily munched through for each channel to which I&apos;m subscribed.  Well, this update now regularly cleanses those files, leaving metadata stored only for those items that appeared in the current update of the channel.</p>\n<p>So, if <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> has been becoming a dog for you, you might want to give this a shot.  Upon the first run, the new code will wipe old data from the files.  If your poor, battered machine can&apos;t survive another run in the current circumstances, then wipe the contents of <code>data/channels_meta</code> and start again.  (But don&apos;t wipe your subscriptions or channel data!  Just the <code>channels_meta</code> data.)</p>\n<p>Let me know if this does good things for you.  In the meantime, I&apos;m thinking about what I could do by applying these <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/BayesianAlgorithms?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">BayesianAlgorithms</font></span> (and those not-quite-so-BayesianAlgorithms) people have been tinkering with for use against spam.  What if I could have <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> initially sort my news items into ordered buckets of interest, according to my past viewing and scoring behavior?  I really need to do some machine learning research.</p>\n<p>Hell, what if I could go further and have a spider crawl blogrolls, looking for weblogs that seem to match other things I find interesting?  Seems promising, though I think I&apos;m still too naive about the subject.</p>\n<p>Okay.  Time for bed.</p>\n",

Okay, here's what I did:\r\n\r\n1) I installed MT-Search, which is pretty much just unpacking it and copying a few things around.\r\n\r\n2) I made an alternate template for search results, which I stripped down to nothing but an unordered list.  This basically entailed copying the default.tmpl in the search_templates directory and deleting most of the file.\r\n\r\n3) I added this toward the bottom of my view.tmpl in TWiki:\r\n\r\n---++ Related weblog entries\r\n%INCLUDE{\"http://www.decafbad.com/mt/mt-search.cgi?Template=wikiblog&search=%TOPIC%\"}%\r\n\r\nIt was really easy to get going for me.  I'm using MT with MySQL, so I'm not sure if the old non-MySQL installs would have a different experience installing MT-Search, but I doubt it.\r\n\r\nHope that helps :)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082681\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.10500bc.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=6492f173a7059ece309f7d670ff44e95&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.10500bc.org\">nf0</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082681\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-18T17:54:23\">2002-09-18T17:54:23</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Cool stuff got it going.

For some reason it was causing the RSS feed to render way slow, slowing down the whole site. At least that what i suspect. I know there are sepearte templates for RSS, but maybe it was reading in each topic when it displays it? I'm not sure i'll have to poke around with it some more. Once i removed the includes in the view template things were back to normal.

I wonder if the TWiki search functions render the view.tmpl, and if there's some conditional to throw in to not render certain things during a search.  I seem to remember seeing something like that, and I seem to remember that the RSS feed uses that search.\r\n\r\nI could be completely wrong though</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082684\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.10500bc.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=6492f173a7059ece309f7d670ff44e95&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.10500bc.org\">nf0</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082684\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-20T22:05:41\">2002-09-20T22:05:41</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I've done some more looking around, and it doesn't appear that rendering the RSS feed makes any search calls. So i'm not exactly sure why that includes slow it down so much. It could very well just be my host. Yours seems to load just as fast as always, guess thats another reason to look at moving to a new host soon.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082685\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.10500bc.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=6492f173a7059ece309f7d670ff44e95&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.10500bc.org\">nf0</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082685\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-12-11T23:13:05\">2002-12-11T23:13:05</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I know its been a while since we discussed this, but i just had a brain fart.

He was originally a customer of yours.  Then, just for the fun of it, he made his own implementation of the news aggregation features of your software, and <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/history.html\">even acknowledged his source of inspiration</a> when he released <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, calling Radio \"<i>a wonderful piece of work</i>\".  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> isn't for sale - it's free and open source.  If that makes him a competitor to your selling product, I think you need to work harder or smarter.<blockquote><i>...explains on his weblog how he intends to kill me. Even he says it's too harsh; and it may be a joke, if so, it's not funny. I don't see the humor in my own death, esp at the hands of a person like Hemenway. (He also coined the term Jewgregator,</blockquote></i>Morbus is over the top on a frequent basis, and sometimes too far over the top.  This is a known fact - his sense of humor is obviously dark and a bit off kilter.  He also produces good working software, and writes useful articles.  But three obvious things:  1) He didn't state any intention to kill you - it's just that it seems his mere presence would be enough to set you a-boil.  2) He referred to <a href=\"http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/1031728134.shtml\">Kevin Burton's account</a> of meeting you, which depicts you as someone very easily set a-boil.  3) You're providing an example in support of the account.<blockquote><i>and calls <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 \"Hitler\" for some reason.)</blockquote></i>The \"some reason\" to which you alude is this bit Morbus said in IRC: \"I say 'proposed' rather innocently - its more 'shoved down everyone's throat by nazi dictator'... we should code name rss 2.0 'hitler'\".  There's frustration in there, and his wasn't the only head nodding in the room.  Morbus is over the top and says charged things I'd choose not to, but the frustration is real and genuine, and shared by more than one member of the community out here.  Yet, you always seem to \"take the high road\" by focusing on the over-the-top aspect, no matter the degree, ignoring the genuine gripe.<blockquote><i>...Bill Kearney has sent me private email about my deathbed, and what he hopes to teach me there, so I've chosen to filter his mail to a place where I never see it.</blockquote></i>Referring to private email is cheap - it's your word and his.<blockquote><i>I tried to come up with a word to describe how I feel about these people, this is what I came up with: monster.</blockquote></i>What a nasty thing to call potential collaborators and customers.  And what a viral, contagious thing, as you later demonstrate with Ben.  This doesn't seem very cluetrain-ish.<blockquote><i>...Hemenway has crossed that line. What happens next is stuff that will involve the police. I won't stand for these kinds of threats.</blockquote></i>What threat was made, and when will you be calling the police?  And how seriously will they take you?  You said yourself that you knew he wasn't seriously threatening you.  What stuff \"happens next\"?<blockquote><i>None of this means that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 will be delayed by even one moment.</blockquote></i>Thus, you avoid having to address the concerns all the \"monsters\" raise.<blockquote><i>I thought competition in the software business in the 80s was rough, but this is so much worse. Competition used to require a certain collegiality and professionalism. It's not true today. Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their way. Their perversion may even be the reason they're involved.</blockquote></i>But the funny thing about all of this is that most of this isn't business - it's hobby.  You've got a business, he's got a hobby, yet somehow he's competing with you.  I'm not a businessman by any stretch, but this comparison seems very odd.  (Hint:  Morbus is not acting as a professional in this context.  He can correct me if I've mistakenly assumed this.)</p>\n<p>These are people screwing around, trying things, playing with code.  And in order for these people to \"get their way\", they have to be nice to people and convince them to help out.  Otherwise, the cats wander off in search of fatter mice.  It becomes apparent rather quickly what sort of people they are from just a short bit of interaction with them.  And I've seen them \"triangulated\" as very nice people.<blockquote><i>Mr. Hemenway goes by the name Morbus Iff on his weblog, and writes for O'Reilly Associates, and for Ben Hammersley's syndication weblog. Mr. Hammersley is a reporter for the UK Guardian newspaper.</blockquote></i><blockquote><i>Postscript: Ben Hammersley threatened to sue me if I don't remove the previous paragraph. But every statement is true...</blockquote></i><a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=specious\">Specious</a> reasoning, at best.  Yes, Mr. Hammersley invited Morbus to write with him.  So, you feel free to splash him with the monster paint by association?<blockquote><i>The Guardian requests an apology. For what? They ran a tainted review.</blockquote></i>Oh, now we see the reason: He didn't plug your product in his review.  Though, he did say in the article, \"Did you notice how all those programs are free to use?\"  Perhaps he should have made that more a focus of the article, but he was writing about <i>free</i> programs.  I'm neither in his head, nor in the head of any Guardian editor, but maybe they didn't want the article to become free advertising for a commercial product?  Who knows.  He didn't mention you.  So that makes him a monster?<blockquote><i>Hammersley is a participant in the debate over the future of syndication technology, yet he wrote a review for the Guardian where that was not disclosed.</blockquote></i>This is obvious:  Many people who write about technology are involved with technology, even helping shape its direction.  It's what makes them most qualified to write about it.  This argument is starting to sound like politics - from whom did he get his funding?  I don't see you complaining when a \"participant in the debate\" <i>does</i> mention your product in an article.<blockquote><i>Now, either Hammersley didn't tell them, or they don't care, or British newspapers run ads without saying they're ads.</blockquote></i>Or maybe they didn't want to run <i>unpaid ads</i>?</p>\n<p>Okay.

First off, \"RSS 2.0: Hitler\" came first - it was, as l.m.orchard mentions, frustration at the RSS 2.0 spec, and the dictator like quality of Winer and his handling of it.\n\"Jewgregator\" came later, and is metaphoric in nature. With Dave being the dictator of RSS 2.0, there are all these other aggregator users, developers of RSS, and lovers of syndication who are being shafted with no respite. Dave thinks he has a wonderful spec, much like Hitler thought he was doing a \"good thing\" by cultural cleansing. The Jews suffered at the hands of Hitler, much like users will suffer at the hands of Winer.\nOf course, I do realize the inbred triviliazing of life based on this comparison - I'm not condoning, nor wiping away the deaths that occurred. It's merely another over-the-top metaphor that is ruder than necessary on a closer examination.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084174\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1f311d2ae9cd3f0e02d56b15924519ca&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\">Ehud Lamm</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084174\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-17T19:10:39\">2002-09-17T19:10:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Humor with reference to Jewish people is quite all right.

Let me be completely clear, at no time have I expressed any desire to see any form of harm be brought upon any of the individuals involved.  \nIt's most troubling to see someone trying to have people think that.  I find such behavior despicable and most certainly actionable.  It smacks of them wanting to plant some seed that would allow escalating it into some sort larger threat or conspiracy.  Given California's stalking laws and past posts about it, one can't help being left to wonder if this isn't an attempt to garner some sort of defense that would justify filing a such a claim.  \nWhipping up the old mob sympathy to support outrageous claims has certainly happened many times before, is that what we're seeing here?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084181\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084181\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-17T19:39:39\">2002-09-17T19:39:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Ehud:  Yeah, I phrased that wrong.

It seems the truth is starting to come crawling out of it's dark corners.  \nI'm likewise dumbfounded by Winer's arrogance and abuse.  The pleas of false sympathy are staggeringly ridiculous.  \nI have been a paying customer of Userland (small albeit, but one nonetheless).  This whole episode arose after receiving several obscene e-mails from him in reply to serious issues raised about said purchase.  At one point I was verbally offered a refund from Dave.  It has never materialized, perhaps being a welcher is another unexpected facet of his psychoses.\nWhile I'll make no arguments as to my use of, shall we say, pointedly direct style, I find it continuously appalling to hear in discussions with others that my experiences with him are nearly duplicates of theirs.  I'm shocked to see a vendor behaving in such a patently ridiculous manner.\nI have tremendous sympathies for anyone suffering from physical difficulties, cardiac or otherwise.  My dearly departed parents both suffered from heart ailments; they died three weeks apart.  I had to run two miles as a 14yr old kid to get help as my mother suffered her first myocardial infarction.  Now do I flail that about as some sort of shield to deflect culpability?  Hardly.  I've seen up close the agonies people suffer.  I've also seen the results of a lifetime of bad behavior and it's contributory influences.  So please, shut your pie hole you newbie.\nHis twisting of my comments is plain for all to see by reading the text of the original message.  And his slanderous attempts to conflate my actions with any form of violence or ill-will are utterly despicable.  \nShame on us?  Shame on US?&nbsp;  You hypocritical idiot!

    "body": "<p>I don't really want to add noise to the signal and would really rather just see some work get done, but I'm still disgusted by <a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1744#monsters\">what Dave is writing</a>:<blockquote><i>...One of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a>'s competitors Kevin Hemenway, the author of Amphetadesk</blockquote></i>Competitor?  He was originally a customer of yours.  Then, just for the fun of it, he made his own implementation of the news aggregation features of your software, and <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/history.html\">even acknowledged his source of inspiration</a> when he released <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, calling Radio \"<i>a wonderful piece of work</i>\".  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> isn't for sale - it's free and open source.  If that makes him a competitor to your selling product, I think you need to work harder or smarter.<blockquote><i>...explains on his weblog how he intends to kill me. Even he says it's too harsh; and it may be a joke, if so, it's not funny. I don't see the humor in my own death, esp at the hands of a person like Hemenway. (He also coined the term Jewgregator,</blockquote></i>Morbus is over the top on a frequent basis, and sometimes too far over the top.  This is a known fact - his sense of humor is obviously dark and a bit off kilter.  He also produces good working software, and writes useful articles.  But three obvious things:  1) He didn't state any intention to kill you - it's just that it seems his mere presence would be enough to set you a-boil.  2) He referred to <a href=\"http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/1031728134.shtml\">Kevin Burton's account</a> of meeting you, which depicts you as someone very easily set a-boil.  3) You're providing an example in support of the account.<blockquote><i>and calls <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 \"Hitler\" for some reason.)</blockquote></i>The \"some reason\" to which you alude is this bit Morbus said in IRC: \"I say 'proposed' rather innocently - its more 'shoved down everyone's throat by nazi dictator'... we should code name rss 2.0 'hitler'\".  There's frustration in there, and his wasn't the only head nodding in the room.  Morbus is over the top and says charged things I'd choose not to, but the frustration is real and genuine, and shared by more than one member of the community out here.  Yet, you always seem to \"take the high road\" by focusing on the over-the-top aspect, no matter the degree, ignoring the genuine gripe.<blockquote><i>...Bill Kearney has sent me private email about my deathbed, and what he hopes to teach me there, so I've chosen to filter his mail to a place where I never see it.</blockquote></i>Referring to private email is cheap - it's your word and his.<blockquote><i>I tried to come up with a word to describe how I feel about these people, this is what I came up with: monster.</blockquote></i>What a nasty thing to call potential collaborators and customers.  And what a viral, contagious thing, as you later demonstrate with Ben.  This doesn't seem very cluetrain-ish.<blockquote><i>...Hemenway has crossed that line. What happens next is stuff that will involve the police. I won't stand for these kinds of threats.</blockquote></i>What threat was made, and when will you be calling the police?  And how seriously will they take you?  You said yourself that you knew he wasn't seriously threatening you.  What stuff \"happens next\"?<blockquote><i>None of this means that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 will be delayed by even one moment.</blockquote></i>Thus, you avoid having to address the concerns all the \"monsters\" raise.<blockquote><i>I thought competition in the software business in the 80s was rough, but this is so much worse. Competition used to require a certain collegiality and professionalism. It's not true today. Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their way. Their perversion may even be the reason they're involved.</blockquote></i>But the funny thing about all of this is that most of this isn't business - it's hobby.  You've got a business, he's got a hobby, yet somehow he's competing with you.  I'm not a businessman by any stretch, but this comparison seems very odd.  (Hint:  Morbus is not acting as a professional in this context.  He can correct me if I've mistakenly assumed this.)</p>\r\n<p>These are people screwing around, trying things, playing with code.  And in order for these people to \"get their way\", they have to be nice to people and convince them to help out.  Otherwise, the cats wander off in search of fatter mice.  It becomes apparent rather quickly what sort of people they are from just a short bit of interaction with them.  And I've seen them \"triangulated\" as very nice people.<blockquote><i>Mr. Hemenway goes by the name Morbus Iff on his weblog, and writes for O'Reilly Associates, and for Ben Hammersley's syndication weblog. Mr. Hammersley is a reporter for the UK Guardian newspaper.</blockquote></i><blockquote><i>Postscript: Ben Hammersley threatened to sue me if I don't remove the previous paragraph. But every statement is true...</blockquote></i><a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=specious\">Specious</a> reasoning, at best.  Yes, Mr. Hammersley invited Morbus to write with him.  So, you feel free to splash him with the monster paint by association?<blockquote><i>The Guardian requests an apology. For what? They ran a tainted review.</blockquote></i>Oh, now we see the reason: He didn't plug your product in his review.  Though, he did say in the article, \"Did you notice how all those programs are free to use?\"  Perhaps he should have made that more a focus of the article, but he was writing about <i>free</i> programs.  I'm neither in his head, nor in the head of any Guardian editor, but maybe they didn't want the article to become free advertising for a commercial product?  Who knows.  He didn't mention you.  So that makes him a monster?<blockquote><i>Hammersley is a participant in the debate over the future of syndication technology, yet he wrote a review for the Guardian where that was not disclosed.</blockquote></i>This is obvious:  Many people who write about technology are involved with technology, even helping shape its direction.  It's what makes them most qualified to write about it.  This argument is starting to sound like politics - from whom did he get his funding?  I don't see you complaining when a \"participant in the debate\" <i>does</i> mention your product in an article.<blockquote><i>Now, either Hammersley didn't tell them, or they don't care, or British newspapers run ads without saying they're ads.</blockquote></i>Or maybe they didn't want to run <i>unpaid ads</i>?</p>\r\n<p>Okay.  I'm done.   This has distracted me from work for long enough today.</p>\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=ooobgh\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084163\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://shawnyeager.com/monolog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=546b2f1947278db93fa8f7c734876111&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://shawnyeager.com/monolog/\">Shawn</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084163\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-17T15:58:55\">2002-09-17T15:58:55</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Now that's a hell of a post.

With Dave being the dictator of RSS 2.0, there are all these other aggregator users, developers of RSS, and lovers of syndication who are being shafted with no respite. Dave thinks he has a wonderful spec, much like Hitler thought he was doing a \"good thing\" by cultural cleansing. The Jews suffered at the hands of Hitler, much like users will suffer at the hands of Winer.\r\n\r\nOf course, I do realize the inbred triviliazing of life based on this comparison - I'm not condoning, nor wiping away the deaths that occurred. It's merely another over-the-top metaphor that is ruder than necessary on a closer examination.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084174\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1f311d2ae9cd3f0e02d56b15924519ca&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://gulliver.weblogs.com\">Ehud Lamm</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084174\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2002-09-17T19:10:39\">2002-09-17T19:10:39</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Humor with reference to Jewish people is quite all right.

The pleas of false sympathy are staggeringly ridiculous.  \r\n\r\nI have been a paying customer of Userland (small albeit, but one nonetheless).  This whole episode arose after receiving several obscene e-mails from him in reply to serious issues raised about said purchase.  At one point I was verbally offered a refund from Dave.  It has never materialized, perhaps being a welcher is another unexpected facet of his psychoses.\r\n\r\nWhile I'll make no arguments as to my use of, shall we say, pointedly direct style, I find it continuously appalling to hear in discussions with others that my experiences with him are nearly duplicates of theirs.  I'm shocked to see a vendor behaving in such a patently ridiculous manner.\r\n\r\nI have tremendous sympathies for anyone suffering from physical difficulties, cardiac or otherwise.  My dearly departed parents both suffered from heart ailments; they died three weeks apart.  I had to run two miles as a 14yr old kid to get help as my mother suffered her first myocardial infarction.  Now do I flail that about as some sort of shield to deflect culpability?  Hardly.  I've seen up close the agonies people suffer.  I've also seen the results of a lifetime of bad behavior and it's contributory influences.

He was originally a customer of yours.  Then, just for the fun of it, he made his own implementation of the news aggregation features of your software, and <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/history.html\">even acknowledged his source of inspiration</a> when he released <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, calling Radio &quot;<i>a wonderful piece of work</i>&quot;.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> isn&apos;t for sale - it&apos;s free and open source.  If that makes him a competitor to your selling product, I think you need to work harder or smarter.<blockquote><i>...explains on his weblog how he intends to kill me. Even he says it&apos;s too harsh; and it may be a joke, if so, it&apos;s not funny. I don&apos;t see the humor in my own death, esp at the hands of a person like Hemenway. (He also coined the term Jewgregator,</i></blockquote>Morbus is over the top on a frequent basis, and sometimes too far over the top.  This is a known fact - his sense of humor is obviously dark and a bit off kilter.  He also produces good working software, and writes useful articles.  But three obvious things:  1) He didn&apos;t state any intention to kill you - it&apos;s just that it seems his mere presence would be enough to set you a-boil.  2) He referred to <a href=\"http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/1031728134.shtml\">Kevin Burton&apos;s account</a> of meeting you, which depicts you as someone very easily set a-boil.  3) You&apos;re providing an example in support of the account.<blockquote><i>and calls <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 &quot;Hitler&quot; for some reason.)</i></blockquote>The &quot;some reason&quot; to which you alude is this bit Morbus said in IRC: &quot;I say &apos;proposed&apos; rather innocently - its more &apos;shoved down everyone&apos;s throat by nazi dictator&apos;... we should code name rss 2.0 &apos;hitler&apos;&quot;.  There&apos;s frustration in there, and his wasn&apos;t the only head nodding in the room.  Morbus is over the top and says charged things I&apos;d choose not to, but the frustration is real and genuine, and shared by more than one member of the community out here.  Yet, you always seem to &quot;take the high road&quot; by focusing on the over-the-top aspect, no matter the degree, ignoring the genuine gripe.<blockquote><i>...Bill Kearney has sent me private email about my deathbed, and what he hopes to teach me there, so I&apos;ve chosen to filter his mail to a place where I never see it.</i></blockquote>Referring to private email is cheap - it&apos;s your word and his.<blockquote><i>I tried to come up with a word to describe how I feel about these people, this is what I came up with: monster.</i></blockquote>What a nasty thing to call potential collaborators and customers.  And what a viral, contagious thing, as you later demonstrate with Ben.  This doesn&apos;t seem very cluetrain-ish.<blockquote><i>...Hemenway has crossed that line. What happens next is stuff that will involve the police. I won&apos;t stand for these kinds of threats.</i></blockquote>What threat was made, and when will you be calling the police?  And how seriously will they take you?  You said yourself that you knew he wasn&apos;t seriously threatening you.  What stuff &quot;happens next&quot;?<blockquote><i>None of this means that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 will be delayed by even one moment.</i></blockquote>Thus, you avoid having to address the concerns all the &quot;monsters&quot; raise.<blockquote><i>I thought competition in the software business in the 80s was rough, but this is so much worse. Competition used to require a certain collegiality and professionalism. It&apos;s not true today. Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their way. Their perversion may even be the reason they&apos;re involved.</i></blockquote>But the funny thing about all of this is that most of this isn&apos;t business - it&apos;s hobby.  You&apos;ve got a business, he&apos;s got a hobby, yet somehow he&apos;s competing with you.  I&apos;m not a businessman by any stretch, but this comparison seems very odd.  (Hint:  Morbus is not acting as a professional in this context.  He can correct me if I&apos;ve mistakenly assumed this.)<p></p>\n<p>These are people screwing around, trying things, playing with code.  And in order for these people to &quot;get their way&quot;, they have to be nice to people and convince them to help out.  Otherwise, the cats wander off in search of fatter mice.  It becomes apparent rather quickly what sort of people they are from just a short bit of interaction with them.  And I&apos;ve seen them &quot;triangulated&quot; as very nice people.</p><blockquote><i>Mr. Hemenway goes by the name Morbus Iff on his weblog, and writes for O&apos;Reilly Associates, and for Ben Hammersley&apos;s syndication weblog. Mr. Hammersley is a reporter for the UK Guardian newspaper.</i></blockquote><blockquote><i>Postscript: Ben Hammersley threatened to sue me if I don&apos;t remove the previous paragraph. But every statement is true...</i></blockquote><a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=specious\">Specious</a> reasoning, at best.  Yes, Mr. Hammersley invited Morbus to write with him.  So, you feel free to splash him with the monster paint by association?<blockquote><i>The Guardian requests an apology. For what? They ran a tainted review.</i></blockquote>Oh, now we see the reason: He didn&apos;t plug your product in his review.  Though, he did say in the article, &quot;Did you notice how all those programs are free to use?&quot;  Perhaps he should have made that more a focus of the article, but he was writing about <i>free</i> programs.  I&apos;m neither in his head, nor in the head of any Guardian editor, but maybe they didn&apos;t want the article to become free advertising for a commercial product?  Who knows.  He didn&apos;t mention you.  So that makes him a monster?<blockquote><i>Hammersley is a participant in the debate over the future of syndication technology, yet he wrote a review for the Guardian where that was not disclosed.</i></blockquote>This is obvious:  Many people who write about technology are involved with technology, even helping shape its direction.  It&apos;s what makes them most qualified to write about it.  This argument is starting to sound like politics - from whom did he get his funding?  I don&apos;t see you complaining when a &quot;participant in the debate&quot; <i>does</i> mention your product in an article.<blockquote><i>Now, either Hammersley didn&apos;t tell them, or they don&apos;t care, or British newspapers run ads without saying they&apos;re ads.</i></blockquote>Or maybe they didn&apos;t want to run <i>unpaid ads</i>?<p></p>\n<p>Okay.  I&apos;m done.   This has distracted me from work for long enough today.</p>\n",

Just <a href=\"http://saladwithsteve.com/osx/2002_02_01_archive.html#9710921\">use <code>rsync</code> to publish</a> whenever the thing finds itself on a network, wireless or otherwise.  Maybe that happens while you&apos;re out <a href=\"http://www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/WarWalking\">Warwalking</a> - better yet, maybe that wireless network detector you cobbled together autoblogs what it finds while in your pocket.  </p>\n<p>But, beyond that, I wonder what else having your blog in your pocket might give you?  Toss in a GPS unit somehow, maybe some other things like a thermometer device?  A compass?  Thinking about ways to automatically capture metadata about your present environment.  Why?  Why not, I&apos;m sure if I thought longer, that stuff would seem useful.  </p>\n<p>And then there&apos;s the non-automatic writing you might do: jot down thoughts occuring on the spur of the moment; capture the scene as you sit in the park; report on the scene of an accident - or a disaster?  If you have a digital camera, and if both the PDA and camera had bluetooth, integrate the two so that you can easily combine the picture and 1000 words while they&apos;re fresh in your mind.</p>\n<p>But what about the other end of things - aggregation and reading?  Install <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> along with, maybe, a web cache and spider that proactively slurps down new news items when it&apos;s near a firehose net connection.  If you&apos;re in a town with frequent dips into the bandwidth pool as you wander around, maybe you&apos;ll catch another <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlogWalker\">BlogWalker</a> in your referrers, linking to what you just posted.

But... it's <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/syndication/message/3249\">strange</a> <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/dnn/2002/09/index.shtml#001361\">reading</a> <a href=\"http://winerlog.inspiredsites.net/discuss/msgReader$127\">about</a>     <a href=\"http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=78025336\">UserLand's abandoned trademark application for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a></a>.</li>\n<li><b>Chimera rocks my socks:</b> \n<br /><br />\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/09/04.html#chimera_coming_along_nicely\">Mark Pilgrim likes Chimera</a>.  Personally, I've been using it as my primary browser for about 5 weeks now, and update to the latest nightly every few days.  I had a glitch or two, but it's come light years from when I first started playing with it and it already seems to leave Mozilla-proper in the dust.</li>\n<li><b>Caffinated scraping:</b>\n<br /><br />\nI've been cobbling together an (X)HTML-to-RSS scraper using what I've learned of Java, XSLT, and XPath lately.  I've been tempted to slap together an aggregator of my own, too, but no: <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> has not made me itchy enough to do it.  The scraper might be of some use to someone though.</li>\n<li><b>Strange connectivity urges:</b>\n<br /><br />\nI've been having these strange urges lately to start playing with P2P-ish things again and build a collection of rendevous that piggyback on a number of existing infrastructures (ie. IRC, IM, NNTP, email, etc).  I want to get back on the path of investigating complete decentralization, or at least some robust thing which lies in between.  At the very least, though, I want to start doing some sort of IM-RPCish thing between behind-firewall PCs.

This daemon could check for a predetermined subject line, sender, and maybe even a trusted cryptographic signature.  The payload of the message could be in the clear, or encrypted.  You could have many recipients marked for the message.  \nThe gateway daemons then would turn valid newsgroup posts into outbound XML-RPC calls, and in turn, post to the newsgroup in response to inbound XML-RPC calls.\nWhat appears particularly attractive to me about doing this ofer NNTP, though, is that it's an existing architecture that already does queueing and distribution and all kinds of other nice things.  And if you wanted to be sneaky with a network of agents, you could even stenograph your messages in with other spam :)  But, the sneaky bits aren't what I'm most interested in.\nTo me, it's another potential rendevous to add to a hypothetical P2P system I'm musing about</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

This daemon could check for a predetermined subject line, sender, and maybe even a trusted cryptographic signature.  The payload of the message could be in the clear, or encrypted.  You could have many recipients marked for the message.  \r\n\r\nThe gateway daemons then would turn valid newsgroup posts into outbound XML-RPC calls, and in turn, post to the newsgroup in response to inbound XML-RPC calls.\r\n\r\nWhat appears particularly attractive to me about doing this ofer NNTP, though, is that it's an existing architecture that already does queueing and distribution and all kinds of other nice things.  And if you wanted to be sneaky with a network of agents, you could even stenograph your messages in with other spam :)  But, the sneaky bits aren't what I'm most interested in.\r\n\r\nTo me, it's another potential rendevous to add to a hypothetical P2P system I'm musing about</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

I may eventually hook up with a few fellow hackers to spread the monthly rent, and I may even consider floating some trial balloon for-pay services - assuming I hack together something I&apos;m presumptious enough to think is worth money.  :)  But for now, the cost is very affordable for what I get.</p>\n<p>So, I haven&apos;t dumped my current webhost yet, but I&apos;m slowly going about installing services and software up there, including but not limited to: Apache, mod_perl, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a>4, Tomcat, Jabber, INNd, IRCd and whatever else seems like a good idea (whether or not it actually is a good idea).  I might even throw a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a> installation up there.</p>\n<p>And, once I come to my senses, I may pare this list down and disable things until I get around to actually doing real things with them.  More soon, I hope.</p>\n",
