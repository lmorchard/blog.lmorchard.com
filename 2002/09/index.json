    "summary": "<p>More on Pingback vs <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> on <a href=\"http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1033171507&amp;count=1\">Hixie's Natural Log</a>.\n<br><br>\nHow embarassing - he points to my referrers as a typical list.  :)  Mine are crap.  Look at <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/09/27.html#pingback_vs_trackback\">how Mark Pilgrim handles referrers</a>.  Yesterday I was working at making my referrer tracking harvest titles, clean out false links, and collapse redundant backlinks, but I'm far from perfecting that.  But, at the same time, I agree:  Referrers are <strong>not</strong> enough.  They're one source, the most noise-ridden but the most effortless on the part of the outside contributor.  But you can only do so much with almost nothing.  :)\n<br><br>\nI think, when it comes down to it, my <strong>only</strong> issue with Pingback is not a Pingback-specific issue at all:  How to harvest machine readable metadata from a web resource.  This applies to my referrer links, Pingback, and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> alike.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> has a bit of a solution, with embedded <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a>, but that's got its own issues.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000292.phtml#comments\">Ian suggests</a> a few things to me in comments, such as harvesting the title from the HTML title tag (a no brainer), and then harvesting further data from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DublinCore\">DublinCore</a>-based data in meta tags in the page.  I've seen this last convention only once before, in the geographical data <a href=\"http://www.syndic8.com/help_metadata.php\">consumed by Syndic8.com</a>.\n<br><br>\nIs this a pretty common convention?  I've not seen it done much, but the I obviously have not seen everything or a large chunk of anything.  :)  If this is a known convention, it makes me happy and I think it would answer <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000142.phtml#000142\">a question I asked back in May</a>.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Update:</strong>  Duh.  Yes, it's a known convention.  It's even got an RFC:  <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2731.txt\">RFC2731: Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML</a>  Simple Google search.  Sometimes I can be so daft.  :)  Now I just have to start using this more - and I wonder why more people aren't using it?  Most likely because there's been not much in it for them.</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>Dave writes on \"<a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1766\">RSS and Namespaces</a>\":</p><blockquote><i>... there are some XML parsers that don't properly deal with namespace attributes on the top-level element of a source.</i></blockquote>Agreed.  These parsers are often cheaper to deal with when you know that the format you're expecting doesn't involve namespaces.  You trade some flexibility for some ease of development.<blockquote><i>For these guys, just introducing an xmlns attribute is enough to make them reject the feed. So while they could handle a 0.92 feed, as soon as we introduced the xmlns attribute, they gave up.</i></blockquote>Yes, because they weren't expecting to be fed something with namespaces, since they'd been designed around v0.92 and family, and had been fed v2.0 with the expectation that it was 100% backward-compatible.<blockquote><i>...Presumably <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 doesn't have the same problem we tripped over yesterday with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0. So I looked at a few <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 feeds, and guess what, they do the same thing we were doing with the 2.0 feeds. ...  I conclude that the same broken parsers that didn't like the 2.0 feeds with the xmlns attributes, must also not like the 1.0 feeds.</i></blockquote>And your conclusion would likely be correct - because those parsers weren't expecting to consume namespace-using XML, and they shouldn't be expecting <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> v1.0.  If an application is designed with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 in mind, then the author should be using a namespace-aware parser and correctly handle the namespaces, since that's the nature of the beast.  To neglect or mishandle namespaces in consuming <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0 is a mistake.<br><br><br>\nAdmittedly, some applications which apparently consume <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> v1.0 feeds correctly may be broken in this way - this is not unique to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> v2.0.  If they're broken, they need fixing.   But that's another story...\n<br><br>\nSo, on to the conclusion:<blockquote><i>If this is true, we can't design using namespaces until:\n<br><br><p></p>\n<ol>\n<li>All the parsers are fixed, or\n<br><br></li>\n<li>Users/content providers expect and accept this kind of breakage (I don't want to be the one delivering that bit of bad news, got burned not only by the users, but by developers too, people generally don't know about this problem, or if they do know are not being responsible with the info).\n<br><br>\nAnyway it looks to me like there's a big problem in the strategy of formats that intend to organize around namespaces.</li></ol></i></blockquote>Well, of course, end users should not expect breakage.  This is obvious to me.  No one really wants that.<br><br><br>\nThe big problem I see in the strategy, though, is this:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 claims to be backward-compatible with the 0.9x family, but the addition of namespaces in XML is enough of a fundamental change to break this.  I think <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/message/4115\">what Shelly wrote in </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>-DEV is correct:  \"Namespace support is NOT a\ntrivial change, and will break several technologies, including <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP\">PHP</a> if\nnamespace support isn't compiled in. This isn't something that can be\nhacked out.\"\n<br><br>\nWhen I originally read about the emergence of something called <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0, I said \"<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000268.phtml#000268\">Go man, go</a>!\"  But I also said, \"What's the catch?\"  Well, this appears to be a catch.  But I think it can be worked through.  This is not a <strong>fundamental</strong> problem with namespaces themselves.  This is a versioning problem, and a problem with anticipating all the implications the new version brings to the table.  This goes for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0, <strong>as well as</strong> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0.\n<br><br>\nThe first thing is to nail a few things down about version numbers and reverse-compatibility.  It's been my experience that, when some thing experiences an increment to its major version number, reverse-compatibility is not guaranteed.  So, I would assume that from a v0.94 to a v2.0, things are sufficiently different that using it would require that, indeed, \"All the parsers are fixed\" to support the new major version.  So for the most part, v2.0 follows the v0.94 tradition faithfully, but on this issue it parts ways - and yes, potential consumers of v2.0 feeds will need to adjust from their v0.94 code.  Thems the breaks, I've been told, when it comes to major version upgrades.\n<br><br>\nSo, again, I don't think that this is a fundamental flaw with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0, or namespaces.  This is an issue of versioning, understanding the technology's implications, and reverse-compatibility.",

I want <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/03/13/manufacturedSerendipity.html\">manufactured serendipty</a> to operate here while I'm away or asleep.  I want this site to help me discover connections and uncover links, whether by automated agent or by friendly visitor.  I want to lower the thresholds to interaction as far as I can.  I love it when I've seen a few visitors to my site talk amongst themselves while I was on my drive to work.\n<br><br>\nOf course, I've never been cracked or assaulted by an exploit of my systems.  I don't have unwanted stalkers or abusive anti-fans or malicious kids or babbling spammers after me in this space.  Perhaps if I did, my systems might not tend toward such openness.  I think this is a statement on many things beyond blogs, but that's a post for other days.  Maybe some day I'll have these negative elements facing me, and I'll have to revise my systems and their direction to account for them.\n<br><br>\nOn the other hand, I've got a naive notion that the openness itself can counteract much of the reason to become closed in the first place.  Should the need arise, I think I can come up with some measures to deflect inane and juvenile attacks.  As for spammers, I tend to think that their days are numbered anyway - but if they do arrive on my weblog I think I can leverage many of the technologies I use right now with great effectiveness on my email inbox.  But, to defuse real frustration behind attacks, I tend to think that <strong>more</strong> communication, not less, is what's needed.\n<br><br>\nBut I'm not sure at all, though, whether or not the threat of abuse is what motivates Ray and John to leave automated discussion channels closed.  It's just one motive I've seen discussed before.  I think they want more \"human\" and personal contact.\n<br><br>\nWith regards to that:  The irony in my life is that, with my lack of much free time,  automated agents, aggregators, and weblogs have given me more personal contact with human beings than I might have been able to achieve without them.  I'm trying to remember the thread a few months ago between <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner\">DaveWiner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JonUdell\">JonUdell</a>, and others concerning humans with the uncanny ability to connect other people together.  This very thing was supposed:  That aggregators and weblogs could augment one's ability to act as such a superconnector.  In that regard, I consider my agents, aggregators, and weblogs as integral to me as the new and improved pair of glasses I picked up last week.  Just as I can't see road signs without my glasses, I can't keep track of people without my agents.\n<br><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Update:</strong> And happily, Greg Graham, someone I've not met before, sends me an <a href=\"http://theologynotes.org/archives/000013.html#000013\">unexpected </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> ping and invites me to another blog I've never visited.</p>\n",

A few things, in particular that I like about <a href=\"http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback-1.0\">Pingback</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> URIs are used to specify the source and target of the ping, no other information is involved in setting up the relation (ie. arbitrary IDs, etc).  This makes site-wide integration of Pingback drop-dead simple - everything's already identifiable via URI.\n</li>\n<li> If one implements Pingback HTTP headers, one can allow non-HTML resources to be pinged.  (ie. Ping my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF\">FOAF</a> file when you add me to yours, and I might add you to mine.  That might be pushing the spec a bit, though.)\n</li>\n<li> The XML-RPC server is not tied to any sites it may serve.  I could offer one here, and you could point to it from your site, and if I allowed it I could record pings for you as a service.\n</li>\n</ul>\nAll-in-all, Pingback just seems like a more direct, intentional form of referrer log.\n<br><br>\nOne thing I don't like about Pingback, though (and the same for referrer logs):  It's just about URIs and links between them.  It says nothing much about titles or excerpts or comment bodies.  The spec suggests that a Pingback server <strong>might</strong> retrieve \"other data required from the content of Alice's new post,\" but makes no statement on how this is to happen.  I like that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a> sets down how to provide a bit more information.\n<br><br>\nI've got a vague idea in my little head, and I think it's something <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net\">Sam Ruby</a> touched on:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShowReferers\">ShowReferers</a>, form-submitted comments, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack\">TrackBack</a>, and Pingback are all just different on-ramps to inviting open participation in discussion on one's blog.  I want to take a shot at implementing Pingback very soon - but I might also try taking a shot at implementing a unified comment system that accepts comments for any URI from any of the aforementioned sources.  I'd also like something that scans a blog entry I post for links, then investigate those links for Pingback/TrackBack availability - all to make the system even <strong>more</strong> automatic.  I doubt that it would be very difficult, though I am notoriously naive.  On the other hand, I've been on a run of making hard things simple lately.  :)\n<br><br>\nBut I sense my round tuits slipping away - back to work!\n",

Ping a URL via its autodetected Pingback server, and also retrieve a list of pings for that URL from that server.  Another idea, add a pub/sub method: I supply a URI to monitor and a URI of my own, and the remote Pingback server will ping <strong>me</strong> at my URI (via my Pingback server) when the monitored URI gets new pings at the remote URI.  Require that the subscription be renewed weekly/daily.  Make sense?  One way to track conversations.</p>\n",

As things seem to have been going lately, I'd underestimated <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>, and it turned out <strong>so</strong> much easier than I'd thought.  :)  I'd had an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/recent_comments_rss.xml\">RSS feed for comments overall</a> on my site, but now I have individual <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds for each post.  (Notice the <img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/images/xml.gif\"> in the comments section now.)  The <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed is also linked in the head as per <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/31.html#more_on_rss_autodiscovery\">RSS autodiscovery</a> discussions.\n<br><br>\nI don't think aggregators are really ready yet for these per-post comment <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds, but the availability of the data gives food for hacking.  Being that they're pretty disposable and of interest for a very short time, aggregators will likely need to implement expiry times for feeds, or watch for a period of inactivity before unsubbing.  Grouing feeds would be nice too, in case I wanted to round up all my points of weblog discussion participation.  I've got a few things of this sort in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlinesWishList\">AmphetaOutlinesWishList</a>, with which I hope to play with further aggregator ideas.\n<br><br>\nIf you use <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> and you're interested in trying this, check out these two templates:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/recent_comments_rss.xml.tmpl\">recent_comments_rss.xml.tmpl</a>, for blog-wide comments; and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/archive_entry.rss.tmpl\">archive_entry.rss.tmpl</a>, for per-post comments.  The former template is added as an index template in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a>, whereas the latter is an archive template.  Also, the per-post archive template will need to be added to the list of individual archive templates in the <strong>Archiving</strong> section of your blog config.  You'll want to give it a template for the filename, perhaps something like <code>&lt;$MTEntryID pad=\"1\"$&gt;.rss</code>.\n<br><br>\nAt present, I'm publishing in what I think is vaguely <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 0.92 format.  Whether it complies with the spec, I'm not quite sure because I was lazy.  I plan to revisit this soon to make it at least comply with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 1.0.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.</p>\n",

And then, very recently, the thing became insatiable with desire for my CPU and memory.</p>\n<p>Turns out, in my spiffy new XML channel/item metadata files, I wasn't deleting data associated with old and no longer available items.  This resulted in multi-megabyte XML files which <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> happily munched through for each channel to which I'm subscribed.  Well, this update now regularly cleanses those files, leaving metadata stored only for those items that appeared in the current update of the channel.</p>\n<p>So, if <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> has been becoming a dog for you, you might want to give this a shot.  Upon the first run, the new code will wipe old data from the files.  If your poor, battered machine can't survive another run in the current circumstances, then wipe the contents of <code>data/channels_meta</code> and start again.  (But don't wipe your subscriptions or channel data!  Just the <code>channels_meta</code> data.)</p>\n<p>Let me know if this does good things for you.  In the meantime, I'm thinking about what I could do by applying these <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/BayesianAlgorithms?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">BayesianAlgorithms</font></span> (and those not-quite-so-BayesianAlgorithms) people have been tinkering with for use against spam.  What if I could have <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> initially sort my news items into ordered buckets of interest, according to my past viewing and scoring behavior?  I really need to do some machine learning research.</p>\n<p>Hell, what if I could go further and have a spider crawl blogrolls, looking for weblogs that seem to match other things I find interesting?  Seems promising, though I think I'm still too naive about the subject.</p>\n<p>Okay.  Time for bed.</p>\n",

He was originally a customer of yours.  Then, just for the fun of it, he made his own implementation of the news aggregation features of your software, and <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/history.html\">even acknowledged his source of inspiration</a> when he released <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a>, calling Radio \"<i>a wonderful piece of work</i>\".  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> isn't for sale - it's free and open source.  If that makes him a competitor to your selling product, I think you need to work harder or smarter.<blockquote><i>...explains on his weblog how he intends to kill me. Even he says it's too harsh; and it may be a joke, if so, it's not funny. I don't see the humor in my own death, esp at the hands of a person like Hemenway. (He also coined the term Jewgregator,</i></blockquote>Morbus is over the top on a frequent basis, and sometimes too far over the top.  This is a known fact - his sense of humor is obviously dark and a bit off kilter.  He also produces good working software, and writes useful articles.  But three obvious things:  1) He didn't state any intention to kill you - it's just that it seems his mere presence would be enough to set you a-boil.  2) He referred to <a href=\"http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/1031728134.shtml\">Kevin Burton's account</a> of meeting you, which depicts you as someone very easily set a-boil.  3) You're providing an example in support of the account.<blockquote><i>and calls <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 \"Hitler\" for some reason.)</i></blockquote>The \"some reason\" to which you alude is this bit Morbus said in IRC: \"I say 'proposed' rather innocently - its more 'shoved down everyone's throat by nazi dictator'... we should code name rss 2.0 'hitler'\".  There's frustration in there, and his wasn't the only head nodding in the room.  Morbus is over the top and says charged things I'd choose not to, but the frustration is real and genuine, and shared by more than one member of the community out here.  Yet, you always seem to \"take the high road\" by focusing on the over-the-top aspect, no matter the degree, ignoring the genuine gripe.<blockquote><i>...Bill Kearney has sent me private email about my deathbed, and what he hopes to teach me there, so I've chosen to filter his mail to a place where I never see it.</i></blockquote>Referring to private email is cheap - it's your word and his.<blockquote><i>I tried to come up with a word to describe how I feel about these people, this is what I came up with: monster.</i></blockquote>What a nasty thing to call potential collaborators and customers.  And what a viral, contagious thing, as you later demonstrate with Ben.  This doesn't seem very cluetrain-ish.<blockquote><i>...Hemenway has crossed that line. What happens next is stuff that will involve the police. I won't stand for these kinds of threats.</i></blockquote>What threat was made, and when will you be calling the police?  And how seriously will they take you?  You said yourself that you knew he wasn't seriously threatening you.  What stuff \"happens next\"?<blockquote><i>None of this means that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 will be delayed by even one moment.</i></blockquote>Thus, you avoid having to address the concerns all the \"monsters\" raise.<blockquote><i>I thought competition in the software business in the 80s was rough, but this is so much worse. Competition used to require a certain collegiality and professionalism. It's not true today. Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their way. Their perversion may even be the reason they're involved.</i></blockquote>But the funny thing about all of this is that most of this isn't business - it's hobby.  You've got a business, he's got a hobby, yet somehow he's competing with you.  I'm not a businessman by any stretch, but this comparison seems very odd.  (Hint:  Morbus is not acting as a professional in this context.  He can correct me if I've mistakenly assumed this.)<p></p>\n<p>These are people screwing around, trying things, playing with code.  And in order for these people to \"get their way\", they have to be nice to people and convince them to help out.  Otherwise, the cats wander off in search of fatter mice.  It becomes apparent rather quickly what sort of people they are from just a short bit of interaction with them.  And I've seen them \"triangulated\" as very nice people.</p><blockquote><i>Mr. Hemenway goes by the name Morbus Iff on his weblog, and writes for O'Reilly Associates, and for Ben Hammersley's syndication weblog. Mr. Hammersley is a reporter for the UK Guardian newspaper.</i></blockquote><blockquote><i>Postscript: Ben Hammersley threatened to sue me if I don't remove the previous paragraph. But every statement is true...</i></blockquote><a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=specious\">Specious</a> reasoning, at best.  Yes, Mr. Hammersley invited Morbus to write with him.  So, you feel free to splash him with the monster paint by association?<blockquote><i>The Guardian requests an apology. For what? They ran a tainted review.</i></blockquote>Oh, now we see the reason: He didn't plug your product in his review.  Though, he did say in the article, \"Did you notice how all those programs are free to use?\"  Perhaps he should have made that more a focus of the article, but he was writing about <i>free</i> programs.  I'm neither in his head, nor in the head of any Guardian editor, but maybe they didn't want the article to become free advertising for a commercial product?  Who knows.  He didn't mention you.  So that makes him a monster?<blockquote><i>Hammersley is a participant in the debate over the future of syndication technology, yet he wrote a review for the Guardian where that was not disclosed.</i></blockquote>This is obvious:  Many people who write about technology are involved with technology, even helping shape its direction.  It's what makes them most qualified to write about it.  This argument is starting to sound like politics - from whom did he get his funding?  I don't see you complaining when a \"participant in the debate\" <i>does</i> mention your product in an article.<blockquote><i>Now, either Hammersley didn't tell them, or they don't care, or British newspapers run ads without saying they're ads.</i></blockquote>Or maybe they didn't want to run <i>unpaid ads</i>?<p></p>\n<p>Okay.  I'm done.   This has distracted me from work for long enough today.</p>\n",

Personally, I want to head toward having an easily wearable or pocketable device that contains (or at least has seamless access to) all my personal data, so a PDA seems ideal to me.  However, maybe a large server at  home behind my cable modem would work better as a personal data sink, with the the PDA being more like a personal data <i>buffer</i>.

While I was learning to program on the Apple ][e and the Atari 800, my C=64 was home turf after school.  Man, I miss 6502 assembly and screwing with a kernal whose complexities I could mostly encompass in one brain.<p></p>\n<p>And then, when the day came that I could afford a new computer..  I saved my pennies and bought an Amiga 1200 (sorry, no picture).  That lasted me all through college as friends bought and upgraded (and upgraded) PCs.  It wasn't until I was a year or two past graduation, when my poor A1200 was really straining to keep up, that I finally broke down and built a PC.</p>\n<p>But now, I feel like I'm back full circle, and the PC's days are numbered in my home.  The Mac is my new Amiga, and Apple my neo-Commodore.  Now I just hope that they don't munge the whole company like Commodore did - I was there on #amiga on EFNet on the day when they announced the first of many buyouts.</p>\n<p>I'm not too worried though - Commodore didn't have anyone like Steve Jobs.</p>\n",

My first successful attempt at semi-sustained online narrative happened there, so much of what I consider a part of the experience comes from LJ.

I think a site like this would be a good idea, maybe.  </p>\n<p>But... here are my problems with being the guy to launch that site:</p><ul><li>I like making and breaking toys, not taking care of and feeding them.</li><li>Unless you pay me a lot and then don't bother me at all, <i>I</i> don't want to host <i>your</i> junk. :)</li><li>I've been wanting to see journals &amp; blogs more <i>de</i>centrallized, to avoid the growing pains that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a> has.</li></ul>In short, I've seen what trouble the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a> team have gone through, and I'm not all that interested.  Besides, I think that a decentrallized solution could all but erase the maintenance side of things, if everyone's responsible for their own personal servers.

I might even throw a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal\">LiveJournal</a> installation up there.</p>\n<p>And, once I come to my senses, I may pare this list down and disable things until I get around to actually doing real things with them.  More soon, I hope.</p>\n",
