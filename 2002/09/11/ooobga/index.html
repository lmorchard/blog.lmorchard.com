        <meta property="og:description" content="About switching to Mac, Torrez says (among other things):I haven&#39;t loved a brand in a while. The last computer brand I had the hots for was the Commodore Amiga, and that was over 12 years ago. It&#39;s nice...but weird.

My thoughts exactly.  My first home computer was a Commodore 64 (if you&#39;re curious, you can see a picture of me getting it for Christmas).  While I was learning to program on the Apple ][e and the Atari 800, my C=64 was home turf after school.  Man, I miss 6502 assembly and screwing with a kernal whose complexities I could mostly encompass in one brain.
And then, when the day came that I could afford a new computer..  I saved my pennies and bought an Amiga 1200 (sorry, no picture).  That lasted me all through college as friends bought and upgraded (and upgraded) PCs.  It wasn&#39;t until I was a year or two past graduation, when my poor A1200 was really straining to keep up, that I finally broke down and built a PC.
But now, I feel like I&#39;m back full circle, and the PC&#39;s days are numbered in my home.  The Mac is my new Amiga, and Apple my neo-Commodore.  Now I just hope that they don&#39;t munge the whole company like Commodore did - I was there on [#amiga](/tag/amiga) on EFNet on the day when they announced the first of many buyouts.
I&#39;m not too worried though - Commodore didn&#39;t have anyone like Steve Jobs." />

<div class="content">poke 60540... or something like that.  I forget. ;)  My first computer was a TI-99/4A, but the first computer I really loved was the C64.  Ah, the memories!  And I'm right there with you on the Mac/PC thing.  My PowerBook has my PCs collecting dust.  It's made computing fun again for me.</div>
