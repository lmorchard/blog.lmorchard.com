        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Neat!  I love the blogosphere.  Bryce is &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.ntwizards.net/2002/09/10.html#a976&quot;&gt;attempting to implement&lt;/a&gt; what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000270.phtml#000270&quot;&gt;I&amp;apos;d babbled about&lt;/a&gt; last week: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlogWalking&quot;&gt;BlogWalking&lt;/a&gt; with a Zaurus.  I&amp;apos;m still saving my pennies, and I&amp;apos;ve yet to acquire a Zaurus of my own.  So, I&amp;apos;ll be watching this experiment eagerly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;apos;t expect it to be perfect or necessarily go smoothly, but it&amp;apos;s a first step.  Someone had mentioned that a PDA is inappropriate to host something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType&quot;&gt;MovableType&lt;/a&gt;, since it&amp;apos;s usually off or easy to lose.  Personally, I want to head toward having an easily wearable or pocketable device that contains (or at least has seamless access to) all my personal data, so a PDA seems ideal to me.  However, maybe a large server at  home behind my cable modem would work better as a personal data sink, with the the PDA being more like a personal data &lt;i&gt;buffer&lt;/i&gt;.  This was suggested in comments on my previous entry as well, I believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType&quot;&gt;MovableType&lt;/a&gt; itself on a PDA and paired with rsync may or may not be nifty in the end.  I&amp;apos;d like to try it, and then maybe think about doing something like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BloggerAPI&quot;&gt;BloggerAPI&lt;/a&gt; / metaWeblogAPI client that can buffer up entries and fire off the XML-RPC calls at a given sync time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm...  more to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
