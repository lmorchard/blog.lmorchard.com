        <meta property="og:description" content="Neat!  I love the blogosphere.  Bryce is attempting to implement what I&#39;d babbled about last week: BlogWalking with a Zaurus.  I&#39;m still saving my pennies, and I&#39;ve yet to acquire a Zaurus of my own.  So, I&#39;ll be watching this experiment eagerly.
I don&#39;t expect it to be perfect or necessarily go smoothly, but it&#39;s a first step.  Someone had mentioned that a PDA is inappropriate to host something like MovableType, since it&#39;s usually off or easy to lose.  Personally, I want to head toward having an easily wearable or pocketable device that contains (or at least has seamless access to) all my personal data, so a PDA seems ideal to me.  However, maybe a large server at  home behind my cable modem would work better as a personal data sink, with the the PDA being more like a personal data buffer.  This was suggested in comments on my previous entry as well, I believe.
So, MovableType itself on a PDA and paired with rsync may or may not be nifty in the end.  I&#39;d like to try it, and then maybe think about doing something like a BloggerAPI / metaWeblogAPI client that can buffer up entries and fire off the XML-RPC calls at a given sync time.
Hmm...  more to think about." />
