&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Et tu Dave?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;m mostly in catch-up mode on the hubbub surrounding &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, so I can&#39;t say much other than that I like both flavors though I prefer the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt; approach best.  But... it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/syndication/message/3249&quot;&gt;strange&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.disobey.com/dnn/2002/09/index.shtml#001361&quot;&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://winerlog.inspiredsites.net/discuss/msgReader$127&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;a href=&quot;http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;amp;entry=78025336&quot;&gt;UserLand&#39;s abandoned trademark application for &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chimera rocks my socks:&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/09/04.html#chimera_coming_along_nicely&quot;&gt;Mark Pilgrim likes Chimera&lt;/a&gt;.  Personally, I&#39;ve been using it as my primary browser for about 5 weeks now, and update to the latest nightly every few days.  I had a glitch or two, but it&#39;s come light years from when I first started playing with it and it already seems to leave Mozilla-proper in the dust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Caffinated scraping:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;ve been cobbling together an (X)HTML-to-RSS scraper using what I&#39;ve learned of Java, XSLT, and XPath lately.  I&#39;ve been tempted to slap together an aggregator of my own, too, but no: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk&quot;&gt;AmphetaDesk&lt;/a&gt; has not made me itchy enough to do it.  The scraper might be of some use to someone though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strange connectivity urges:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;ve been having these strange urges lately to start playing with P2P-ish things again and build a collection of rendevous that piggyback on a number of existing infrastructures (ie. IRC, IM, NNTP, email, etc).  I want to get back on the path of investigating complete decentralization, or at least some robust thing which lies in between.  At the very least, though, I want to start doing some sort of IM-RPCish thing between behind-firewall PCs.  And this Jabber server I just installed on my new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies&quot;&gt;JohnCompanies&lt;/a&gt; system should be nice.  (It&#39;s at jabber.decafbad.com)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Soaking in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal&quot;&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Blessed be, I need help:  I&#39;ve convinced them at work to let me pilot a weblog/journal system on our intranet - and I&#39;ve started by installing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal&quot;&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt; source.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;ve also installed LJ here on my new server from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies&quot;&gt;JohnCompanies&lt;/a&gt;, but I&#39;m not quite sure what I want to do with it beyond tweaking and personal hacking.  I&#39;ve been musing at possibly enhancing some bits - particularly with regards to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; syndication and aggregation, maybe some backlink tracking.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Maybe I&#39;ll polish the thing up a bit and offer it up as a sister to LJ where the 15-year-olds will not reign and reciprocal connections with the outside world are encouraged and facilitated.  Would any of you pay for something like that?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This seems pretty ambitious, and it&#39;s likely I&#39;ll never do it, but hey.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;And on other fronts:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Still in the underworld with Java, trying to get this project dragged past the finish line.  Jaguar rocks and I took my girlfriend to the Apple Store opening in Novi, MI; we didn&#39;t buy anything, though it was close.    There&#39;s a second Apple Store opening in my area in Troy, MI; the danger has not passed.  And finally, I have succumbed lately to playing Grand Theft Auto 3 and it has affected my driving and given me pedestrian-smacking instincts to subdue while walking around town.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;That is all.  For now.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

<div class="content">Hmm... close.  Basically what I have for this scraper is a few parts in a pipeline:
* Grab an HTML page
* Mangle it into valid XML with JTidy
* Run it through an XSLT sheet to become RSS
I might also implement the old "start clipping here, end clipping there" scraper method with some regex support.  Basically, I want to have my own robot that distills any data source into RSS because all the others didn't quite do what I want.</div>
