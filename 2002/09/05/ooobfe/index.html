I&#39;m mostly in catch-up mode on the hubbub surrounding RSS, so I can&#39;t say much other than that I like both flavors though I prefer the RDF approach best.  But... it&#39;s strange reading about     UserLand&#39;s abandoned trademark application for RSS.
Chimera rocks my socks: 



Mark Pilgrim likes Chimera.  Personally, I&#39;ve been using it as my primary browser for about 5 weeks now, and update to the latest nightly every few days.  I had a glitch or two, but it&#39;s come light years from when I first started playing with it and it already seems to leave Mozilla-proper in the dust.
Caffinated scraping:



I&#39;ve been cobbling together an (X)HTML-to-RSS scraper using what I&#39;ve learned of Java, XSLT, and XPath lately.  I&#39;ve been tempted to slap together an aggregator of my own, too, but no: AmphetaDesk has not made me itchy enough to do it.  The scraper might be of some use to someone though.
Strange connectivity urges:



I&#39;ve been having these strange urges lately to start playing with P2P-ish things again and build a collection of rendevous that piggyback on a number of existing infrastructures (ie. IRC, IM, NNTP, email, etc).  I want to get back on the path of investigating complete decentralization, or at least some robust thing which lies in between.  At the very least, though, I want to start doing some sort of IM-RPCish thing between behind-firewall PCs.  And this Jabber server I just installed on my new JohnCompanies system should be nice.  (It&#39;s at jabber.decafbad.com)

Soaking in LiveJournal:



Blessed be, I need help:  I&#39;ve convinced them at work to let me pilot a weblog/journal system on our intranet - and I&#39;ve started by installing the LiveJournal source.  
I&#39;ve also installed LJ here on my new server from JohnCompanies, but I&#39;m not quite sure what I want to do with it beyond tweaking and personal hacking.  I&#39;ve been musing at possibly enhancing some bits - particularly with regards to RSS syndication and aggregation, maybe some backlink tracking.  
Maybe I&#39;ll polish the thing up a bit and offer it up as a sister to LJ where the 15-year-olds will not reign and reciprocal connections with the outside world are encouraged and facilitated.  Would any of you pay for something like that?
This seems pretty ambitious, and it&#39;s likely I&#39;ll never do it, but hey.

And on other fronts:



Still in the underworld with Java, trying to get this project dragged past the finish line.  Jaguar rocks and I took my girlfriend to the Apple Store opening in Novi, MI; we didn&#39;t buy anything, though it was close.    There&#39;s a second Apple Store opening in my area in Troy, MI; the danger has not passed.  And finally, I have succumbed lately to playing Grand Theft Auto 3 and it has affected my driving and given me pedestrian-smacking instincts to subdue while walking around town.

That is all.  For now." />

<div class="content">Hmm... close.  Basically what I have for this scraper is a few parts in a pipeline:
* Grab an HTML page
* Mangle it into valid XML with JTidy
* Run it through an XSLT sheet to become RSS
I might also implement the old "start clipping here, end clipping there" scraper method with some regex support.  Basically, I want to have my own robot that distills any data source into RSS because all the others didn't quite do what I want.</div>
