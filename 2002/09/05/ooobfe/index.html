<div class="content">Re: 3.Caffinated scraping
Just stumbled accross this: SuperGrabber at <a href="http://www.bannerdots.com/scripts/scripts.php">http://www.bannerdots.com/scripts/scripts.php</a> did you know about it? Is it something comparable?

<div class="content">Hmm... close.  Basically what I have for this scraper is a few parts in a pipeline:
<em> Grab an HTML page
</em> Mangle it into valid XML with JTidy
* Run it through an XSLT sheet to become RSS
I might also implement the old &quot;start clipping here, end clipping there&quot; scraper method with some regex support.  Basically, I want to have my own robot that distills any data source into RSS because all the others didn&#39;t quite do what I want.</div>
