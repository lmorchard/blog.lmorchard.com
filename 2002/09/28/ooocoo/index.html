How embarassing - he points to my referrers as a typical list.  :)  Mine are crap.  Look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/09/27.html#pingback_vs_trackback&quot;&gt;how Mark Pilgrim handles referrers&lt;/a&gt;.  Yesterday I was working at making my referrer tracking harvest titles, clean out false links, and collapse redundant backlinks, but I&#39;m far from perfecting that.  But, at the same time, I agree:  Referrers are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; enough.  They&#39;re one source, the most noise-ridden but the most effortless on the part of the outside contributor.  But you can only do so much with almost nothing.  :)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I think, when it comes down to it, my &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; issue with Pingback is not a Pingback-specific issue at all:  How to harvest machine readable metadata from a web resource.  This applies to my referrer links, Pingback, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack&quot;&gt;TrackBack&lt;/a&gt; alike.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack&quot;&gt;TrackBack&lt;/a&gt; has a bit of a solution, with embedded &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt;, but that&#39;s got its own issues.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000292.phtml#comments&quot;&gt;Ian suggests&lt;/a&gt; a few things to me in comments, such as harvesting the title from the HTML title tag (a no brainer), and then harvesting further data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DublinCore&quot;&gt;DublinCore&lt;/a&gt;-based data in meta tags in the page.  I&#39;ve seen this last convention only once before, in the geographical data &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syndic8.com/help_metadata.php&quot;&gt;consumed by Syndic8.com&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Is this a pretty common convention?  I&#39;ve not seen it done much, but the I obviously have not seen everything or a large chunk of anything.  :)  If this is a known convention, it makes me happy and I think it would answer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000142.phtml#000142&quot;&gt;a question I asked back in May&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;  Duh.  Yes, it&#39;s a known convention.  It&#39;s even got an RFC:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2731.txt&quot;&gt;RFC2731: Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML&lt;/a&gt;  Simple Google search.  Sometimes I can be so daft.  :)  Now I just have to start using this more - and I wonder why more people aren&#39;t using it?  Most likely because there&#39;s been not much in it for them.&lt;/p&gt;
