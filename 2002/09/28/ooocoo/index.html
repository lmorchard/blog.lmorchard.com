        <meta property="og:description" content="More on Pingback vs TrackBack on Hixie&#39;s Natural Log.
How embarassing - he points to my referrers as a typical list.  :)  Mine are crap.  Look at how Mark Pilgrim handles referrers.  Yesterday I was working at making my referrer tracking harvest titles, clean out false links, and collapse redundant backlinks, but I&#39;m far from perfecting that.  But, at the same time, I agree:  Referrers are not enough.  They&#39;re one source, the most noise-ridden but the most effortless on the part of the outside contributor.  But you can only do so much with almost nothing.  :)
I think, when it comes down to it, my only issue with Pingback is not a Pingback-specific issue at all:  How to harvest machine readable metadata from a web resource.  This applies to my referrer links, Pingback, and TrackBack alike.  TrackBack has a bit of a solution, with embedded RDF, but that&#39;s got its own issues.  Ian suggests a few things to me in comments, such as harvesting the title from the HTML title tag (a no brainer), and then harvesting further data from DublinCore-based data in meta tags in the page.  I&#39;ve seen this last convention only once before, in the geographical data consumed by Syndic8.com.
Is this a pretty common convention?  I&#39;ve not seen it done much, but the I obviously have not seen everything or a large chunk of anything.  :)  If this is a known convention, it makes me happy and I think it would answer a question I asked back in May.
Update:  Duh.  Yes, it&#39;s a known convention.  It&#39;s even got an RFC:  RFC2731: Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML  Simple Google search.  Sometimes I can be so daft.  :)  Now I just have to start using this more - and I wonder why more people aren&#39;t using it?  Most likely because there&#39;s been not much in it for them." />
