This applies to my referrer links, Pingback, and TrackBack alike.  TrackBack has a bit of a solution, with embedded RDF, but that&amp;apos;s got its own issues.  Ian suggests a few things to me in comments, such as harvesting the title from the HTML title tag (a no brainer), and then harvesting further data from DublinCore-based data in meta tags in the page.  I&amp;apos;ve seen this last convention only once before, in the geographical data consumed by Syndic8.com.  Is this a pretty common convention?  I&amp;apos;ve not seen it done much, but the I obviously have not seen everything or a large chunk of anything.  :)  If this is a known convention, it makes me happy and I think it would answer a question I asked back in May.  Update:  Duh.  Yes, it&amp;apos;s a known convention.  It&amp;apos;s even got an RFC:  RFC2731: Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML  Simple Google search.  Sometimes I can be so daft.  :)  Now I just have to start using this more - and I wonder why more people aren&amp;apos;t using it?  Most likely because there&amp;apos;s been not much in it for them.
