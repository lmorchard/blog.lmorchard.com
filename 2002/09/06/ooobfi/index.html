<div class="content">Until laptop keyboards improve (and improve vastly) I won&#39;t be getting rid of my desktop unit any time soon.  I have two laptops (only one of which has a halfway decent keyboard but alas, that style of keyboard is no longer being used on laptops) that I rarely use, and two desktop machines I use all the time.
Guess that makes me the exception rather than the rule.
-spc (I use only IBM AT or PS/2 keyboards&mdash;all others aren&#39;t worth the money)</div>

<div class="content">I&#39;m another desktop user, laptops cost quite a bit more than desktops, I don&#39;t have a wireless network, or even high-speed access (at home anyway...) That aside, I did just get a used PowerBook G3, though it&#39;s quite a bit older/slower than my desktop G4, it actually will be a satellite, if I can get OS X working properly on it.</div>
