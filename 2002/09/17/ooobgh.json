There&apos;s frustration in there, and his wasn&apos;t the only head nodding in the room.  Morbus is over the top and says charged things I&apos;d choose not to, but the frustration is real and genuine, and shared by more than one member of the community out here.  Yet, you always seem to &quot;take the high road&quot; by focusing on the over-the-top aspect, no matter the degree, ignoring the genuine gripe.<blockquote><i>...Bill Kearney has sent me private email about my deathbed, and what he hopes to teach me there, so I&apos;ve chosen to filter his mail to a place where I never see it.</i></blockquote>Referring to private email is cheap - it&apos;s your word and his.<blockquote><i>I tried to come up with a word to describe how I feel about these people, this is what I came up with: monster.</i></blockquote>What a nasty thing to call potential collaborators and customers.  And what a viral, contagious thing, as you later demonstrate with Ben.  This doesn&apos;t seem very cluetrain-ish.<blockquote><i>...Hemenway has crossed that line. What happens next is stuff that will involve the police. I won&apos;t stand for these kinds of threats.</i></blockquote>What threat was made, and when will you be calling the police?  And how seriously will they take you?  You said yourself that you knew he wasn&apos;t seriously threatening you.  What stuff &quot;happens next&quot;?<blockquote><i>None of this means that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 will be delayed by even one moment.</i></blockquote>Thus, you avoid having to address the concerns all the &quot;monsters&quot; raise.<blockquote><i>I thought competition in the software business in the 80s was rough, but this is so much worse. Competition used to require a certain collegiality and professionalism. It&apos;s not true today.

You&apos;ve got a business, he&apos;s got a hobby, yet somehow he&apos;s competing with you.  I&apos;m not a businessman by any stretch, but this comparison seems very odd.

First off, &quot;RSS 2.0: Hitler&quot; came first - it was, as l.m.orchard mentions, frustration at the RSS 2.0 spec, and the dictator like quality of Winer and his handling of it.\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&quot;Jewgregator&quot; came later, and is metaphoric in nature. With Dave being the dictator of RSS 2.0, there are all these other aggregator users, developers of RSS, and lovers of syndication who are being shafted with no respite. Dave thinks he has a wonderful spec, much like Hitler thought he was doing a &quot;good thing&quot; by cultural cleansing. The Jews suffered at the hands of Hitler, much like users will suffer at the hands of Winer.</p>\n<p>Of course, I do realize the inbred triviliazing of life based on this comparison - I&#39;m not condoning, nor wiping away the deaths that occurred. It&#39;s merely another over-the-top metaphor that is ruder than necessary on a closer examination.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221084174&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://gulliver.weblogs.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1f311d2ae9cd3f0e02d56b15924519ca&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://gulliver.weblogs.com&quot;&gt;Ehud Lamm&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221084174&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-09-17T19:10:39&quot;&gt;2002-09-17T19:10:39&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Humor with reference to Jewish people is quite all right.

Some of us are paying UL customers. Does that mean that UL no longer wants anything todo with some of there paying customers? If that the case then maybe i should get a refund and i probably can&#39;t continue to support a company like this. Wow this is the craziest i think i&#39;ve ever seen an online community.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221084194&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.syndic8.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b53911af792174097e8acb282414b44c&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.syndic8.com&quot;&gt;Bill Kearney&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221084194&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2002-09-19T14:16:52&quot;&gt;2002-09-19T14:16:52&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Well, well.  It seems the truth is starting to come crawling out of it&#39;s dark corners.  \n</code></pre><p>I&#39;m likewise dumbfounded by Winer&#39;s arrogance and abuse.  The pleas of false sympathy are staggeringly ridiculous.  </p>\n<p>I have been a paying customer of Userland (small albeit, but one nonetheless).  This whole episode arose after receiving several obscene e-mails from him in reply to serious issues raised about said purchase.  At one point I was verbally offered a refund from Dave.  It has never materialized, perhaps being a welcher is another unexpected facet of his psychoses.</p>\n<p>While I&#39;ll make no arguments as to my use of, shall we say, pointedly direct style, I find it continuously appalling to hear in discussions with others that my experiences with him are nearly duplicates of theirs.  I&#39;m shocked to see a vendor behaving in such a patently ridiculous manner.</p>\n<p>I have tremendous sympathies for anyone suffering from physical difficulties, cardiac or otherwise.  My dearly departed parents both suffered from heart ailments; they died three weeks apart.  I had to run two miles as a 14yr old kid to get help as my mother suffered her first myocardial infarction.  Now do I flail that about as some sort of shield to deflect culpability?  Hardly.  I&#39;ve seen up close the agonies people suffer.  I&#39;ve also seen the results of a lifetime of bad behavior and it&#39;s contributory influences.  So please, shut your pie hole you newbie.</p>\n<p>His twisting of my comments is plain for all to see by reading the text of the original message.  And his slanderous attempts to conflate my actions with any form of violence or ill-will are utterly despicable.  </p>\n<p>Shame on us?  Shame on US?&nbsp;  You hypocritical idiot!  Shame on YOU for making others suffer and exposing yourself to all sorts of added stress.  If you want to commit suicide with your postings that&#39;s your choice.  But please, don&#39;t come picking fights and making slanderous comments if you&#39;re not prepared to have the truth challenge you.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
