It's worth noting that I'm trying a change in approach now to get my hacking morale up.  I'm adopting a more UNIX-y approach and planning to write and release a number of smaller, interoperating utilities at first.  They should be really easy to pipe together, like cat | grep | more.  They should, at first, run just fine on my laptop Apache installation or out on the 0xDECAFBAD servers.  Eventually I might write the overarching <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer">DesktopWebAppServer</a> that provides another shell within which they can reside, but I have to get away from my year-long hermitage arcs of development where I make really cool things and get 75% of the way done and then abandon them.

Okay.  Nevermind work, it's time to go home.  Wheee!

Have to do more digging to work out how to stop that.)</i>
