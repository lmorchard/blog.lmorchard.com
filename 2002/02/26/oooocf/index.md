Hacked around tonight looking into the innards of <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MoinMoin">MoinMoin</a>  and discovered that things are not all that bad in there.  I've got most of a  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MoinMoin">MoinMoin</a> rendition of the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki">XmlRpcToWiki</a> done.  I just have to figure out how to map the concept of numerical versions into editlog manipulations.
<br /><br />
Whee, after this, that'll be 3 wikis I've thrown this thing at.  No sweat.  Next, I have to <i>do something</i> with it and prove that it hasn't just been <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TechQuaTech">TechQuaTech</a>.
