It's been up for 49 days and has served about 8 people.  It's running on a crappy lil 70Mhz HP Vectra PC I found in the dumpster. 
<br /><br />
It's <a href="http://bbs.decafbad.com">0xDECAFBAD BBS</a>, my telnet BBS running <a href="http://www.synchro.net">Synchronet BBS</a>!
<br /><br />
Call on in, either via Java applet on the web (<a href="http://bbs.decafbad.com">http://bbs.decafbad.com</a>) or via direct telnet (<a href="telnet://bbs.decafbad.com:2323">telnet://bbs.decafbad.com:2323</a>)  But, it would sure be lots of useless old-school fun to get people playing on here :)
<br /><br />
I haven't done a whole lot of work on it yet, other than putz around with an ANSI logo, and a few hours' nostalgic gathering and installing of BBS Door games (Legend of the Red Dragon, anyone?)
<br /><br />
Let's see how long I can go before Comcast finds it and shuts me down, whee!
