In one sense, I'm not satisfied with the fact that all it does it maintain a static set of pages rather than being a dynamic app...  but then I think, <i>do I really need anything more than that?</i>  I mean, the one dynamic thing I have on the front page is the recent wiki changes, and that's a server-side include (that almost seems retro to me).

Maybe it's just because of the new release of the <a href=\"http://www.snapstream.com\">SnapStream</a> software (which I tried a few months ago, and hated, might be worth a try again), but people all over the blog world have been mentioning this as if it's something new.  \"TiVO killer on your PC!  Check this out!\"<br><br><br>\nThe only reason for it I could see is if the <a href=\"http://www.snapstream.com\">SnapStream</a> software has improved incredibly since the last time I played with it, and it's become so dead simple that my Mom can use it by making vague flappy gesticulations at the screen.  The only semi-exciting thing I see in the <a href=\"http://www.snapstream.com\">SnapStream</a> buzz is that they're planning on doing something with .NET web services, but no one's really talking about that facet of it.\n<br><br>\nMaybe they've all missed the availability of these products, but I've been using my <a href=\"http://www.ati.com/na/pages/products/pc/aiw_radeon/index.html\">ALL-IN-WONDER? RADEON</a> for the past year and a half, before which I used a <a href=\"http://www.riva3d.com/3500/\">Voodoo 3 3500TV</a> (which sucked ass), and before <i>that</i> I used a plain old <a href=\"http://www.ati.com/na/pages/products/pc/aiw/index.html\">ATI All-In-Wonder</a> card.  That's been since I got my first real PC in 1997.\n<br><br>\nI've been using these cards to record the few shows I care about, in limited fashion, until I got the Radeon card and things took off.  With the AIW Radeon, I record straight to VCD format.  I burn the VCD movies onto CDRW and watch them in my DVD player, just like I used to use my VCR.  If I happen to like the show, I burn it to a real CD and file it away.  It's not the greatest quality, but is pretty comparable to VHS, which is fine.  If I want better quality, there's Super VCD which uses MPEG-2 to fit 30 minutes of DVD-quality video on a CD.  Or...  <strong>gasp</strong> I could get a DVD burner.\n<br><br>\nAnd then, there's the <a href=\"http://www.dlink.com/products/usb/dsbr100/\">D-Link DSB-R100 PC FM USB Radio</a> I've been using to record and archive FM radio shows, most notably Big Sonic Heaven.  Oh yeah, and the Voodoo 3500TV was good for that, too.  (But mostly, it sucked.)\n<br><br>\nMy digital lifestyle's been kicking it for some time now.  Hell, not even Apple's caught up to me yet, since I can't find Mac-OS-X-supported replacements for my cable and FM radio archival rig.  If I had the money, I'd switch to 100% Apple in an eyeblink if they could seamlessly replace all the above.\n<br><br>\nAnyway.  I'm done now.<p></p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>It feels good to have my secret laboratory finally out in the open on the web, for all that I haven't had time to do much with it yet.  Maybe I'll make a few releases tonight.\n<br><br>\nOver the past few days, amongst an unusual amount of social activity, I've been working on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MailToRSS\">MailToRSS</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\">XmlRpcToWiki</a> for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/WebHome\">TWiki</a> and maybe <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UseModWiki\">UseModWiki</a>.<br><br><br>\nOf course, as I'm working on that, I'm tossing around the idea of trashing my TWiki installation for a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MoinMoin\">MoinMoin</a> installation.  Why?  Because I'm starting to really dig <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Python\">Python</a>, because <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MoinMoin\">MoinMoin</a> is written in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Python\">Python</a>, and beyond that the design of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MoinMoin\">MoinMoin</a> seems very well thought out.  Whereas TWiki seems a bit \"evolutionary,\" to be charitable.  :)  I'm not sure yet.  One good offshoot of this is that I thought of another idea to throw on my project list: <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WikiWikiBridge\">WikiWikiBridge</a>.  Granted, I might never do it, but the whole point of this site is to just get all the ideas out there and see which survive and grow, rather than sitting on them because of my perfectionist tendencies.\n<br><br>\nAlso, right now I'm attempting to use <a href=\"http://simon.kittle.info\">Simon Kittle</a>'s <a href=\"http://simon.kittle.info/textrouter\">TextRouter</a> app to post to my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType\">MovableType</a> blog on decafbad.com.  It seems awfully similar to what I want to do with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster\">WeblogMulticaster</a>, and I'd even considered renaming that idea to something \"Router\" before I saw Simon's app.  One of the big differences is that my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster\">WeblogMulticaster</a> would be headless, assuming a semi-stupid <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BloggerAPI\">BloggerAPI</a> GUI program on the user's end, and taking care of all the \"text routing\" in a remote server or a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer\">DesktopWebAppServer</a> installation.  But, although rough around the edges right now, and not quite usable under <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/?topic=MacOsX\">MacOsX</a> at the moment, it might be something I'll try hacking around with first.  It's mostly a matter of where the intelligence lies: In the GUI app, or in a desktop server ala <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserland\">RadioUserland</a>.\n<br><br>\nAnyway, to bring this babble to a close and full circle:  I'm thinking of starting my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer\">DesktopWebAppServer</a> project as a sort of alongside companion for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserland\">RadioUserland</a>.  I <i>could</i> implement probably all of these things within Radio in <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/UserTalk?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">UserTalk</font></span> &amp; etc, but I don't like it.  I'm liking <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Python\">Python</a> much better lately.\n<br><br>\nSo, it would start out as a companion, and then maybe eventually be a full replacement and competitor for Radio.  Maybe.  Then again, I might be just lazy enough to decide to stick to complementing and not replacing Radio features, especially after I bought it.  So Radio can post to a the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster\">WeblogMulticaster</a> in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DesktopWebAppServer\">DesktopWebAppServer</a> project with the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BloggerAPI\">BloggerAPI</a>, and then the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster\">WeblogMulticaster</a> can take it from there.\n<br><br>\nOh and finally, where I want to go with the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster\">WeblogMulticaster</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\">XmlRpcToWiki</a> is to filter weblog entries through whatever wiki engine I'm using.  For example:  You see all the links in this blog entry?  Done by hand.  Yes I'm that nuts.  Mostly, I just wanted to be thorough in connecting this entry with the wiki on the site and to see how difficult it would be.  This motivates me to make a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster\">WeblogMulticaster</a> that talks to the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\">XmlRpcToWiki</a>.  For a current discussion on this sort of weblog/wiki integration I want, look here: <a href=\"http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiLog\">MeatballWiki:WikiLog</a>.\n<br><br>\nAlright...  back to work.</p>\n",
