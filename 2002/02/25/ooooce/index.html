        <meta property="og:description" content="I doubt that I have much of an audience yet, still, so I suppose this will be just thinking out loud... but hey, that&#39;s pretty much the express purpose of this site.  The historical context is useful, nonetheless.

Speaking of the purpose of this site: what about the purpose of this weblog?  Should this just be for general site news and calls-to-attention, or should I start all out nerdy musing about tech and what&#39;s going on out there?  I&#39;m thinking the latter, since any glance at the wiki&#39;s RecentChanges will get you that.

I have a half-thought notion that I might enfold more people into 0xDECAFBAD eventually, so I&#39;d like to keep the place from being too centered on l.m.orchard, but seeing as I&#39;m the only denizen here for now, it will be. 

So, maybe I should elucidate a bit within the site purpose up there in the corner.  This is a place for exposed thought processes about developing technologies.  Developing being used in a double meaning here-- both as an adjective and as verb.
The purpose of 0xDECAFBAD lies in both discussing the state of and participating in the process of technology building.

How&#39;s that?  Great.  (Suggest refinements, if you like.)  Now...  &quot;technology&quot; is a fairly broad topic.  What technology, exactly?

Seeing as I am the sole dictator of the site&#39;s direction so far, I will define this to be technologies that suit my fancy.  This, however is no definition-- it&#39;s more of a redirection.  A see also.  So, what technologies, in particular?  Here&#39;s a list off the cuff:
Collaboration
WritingOnTheWeb
InformationManagement
KnowledgeManagement
This probably needs some fleshing out.  In general, the focus is on web and internet tech with a lean toward that which enables human beings to work with information and each other.  Mainly, I&#39;m interested in PowerToThePeople rather than TechQuaTech.

How&#39;s that for a start?" />
