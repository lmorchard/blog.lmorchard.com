        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I doubt that I have much of an audience yet, still, so I suppose this will be just thinking out loud... but hey, that&#39;s pretty much the express purpose of this site.  The historical context is useful, nonetheless.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Speaking of the purpose of this site: what about the purpose of this weblog?  Should this just be for general site news and calls-to-attention, or should I start all out nerdy musing about tech and what&#39;s going on out there?  I&#39;m thinking the latter, since any glance at the wiki&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RecentChanges&quot;&gt;RecentChanges&lt;/a&gt; will get you that.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have a half-thought notion that I might enfold more people into 0xDECAFBAD eventually, so I&#39;d like to keep the place from being &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; centered on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LesOrchard&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;, but seeing as I&#39;m the only denizen here for now, it will be. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, maybe I should elucidate a bit within the site purpose up there in the corner.  This is a place for exposed thought processes about developing technologies.  Developing being used in a double meaning here-- both as an adjective and as verb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The purpose of 0xDECAFBAD lies in both discussing the state of and participating in the process of technology building.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
How&#39;s that?  Great.  (Suggest refinements, if you like.)  Now...  &quot;technology&quot; is a fairly broad topic.  &lt;i&gt;What&lt;/i&gt; technology, exactly?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Seeing as I am the sole dictator of the site&#39;s direction so far, I will define this to be technologies that suit my fancy.  This, however is no definition-- it&#39;s more of a redirection.  A see also.  So, what technologies, in particular?  Here&#39;s a list off the cuff:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Collaboration&quot;&gt;Collaboration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WritingOnTheWeb&quot;&gt;WritingOnTheWeb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/InformationManagement&quot;&gt;InformationManagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&lt;a href=&quot; http:=&quot;&quot; www.decafbad.com=&quot;&quot; twiki=&quot;&quot; bin=&quot;&quot; view=&quot;&quot; main=&quot;&quot; knowledgemanagement&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;KnowledgeManagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;This probably needs some fleshing out.  In general, the focus is on web and internet tech with a lean toward that which enables human beings to work with information and each other.  Mainly, I&#39;m interested in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PowerToThePeople&quot;&gt;PowerToThePeople&lt;/a&gt; rather than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TechQuaTech&quot;&gt;TechQuaTech&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
How&#39;s that for a start?
