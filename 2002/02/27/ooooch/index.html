        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hmm, does something like this fit into the &amp;quot;format&amp;quot; of 0xDECAFBAD?  Sure, but I&amp;apos;ll probably want to consider setting up some categories.  Like general tech rant/commentary, 0xDECAFBAD project updates, site updates, etc.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk&quot;&gt;The Register&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/24222.html&quot;&gt;How to &lt;span style=&quot;background : #FFFFCE;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/TiVO?topicparent=Main.FilterData&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;TiVO&lt;/font&gt;-ize your PC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;TiVO-like time shifting capabilities have come to the PC. At the Intel Developer Forum, Rakesh Agrawal, CEO of thirteen-man &lt;span style=&quot;background : #FFFFCE;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/SnapStream?topicparent=Main.FilterData&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;SnapStream&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, took his PVS software through its paces for The Register&amp;apos;s pleasure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Is it just me, or are these people are slow?  Maybe it&amp;apos;s just because of the new release of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snapstream.com&quot;&gt;SnapStream&lt;/a&gt; software (which I tried a few months ago, and hated, might be worth a try again), but people all over the blog world have been mentioning this as if it&amp;apos;s something new.  &amp;quot;TiVO killer on your PC!  Check this out!&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The only reason for it I could see is if the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snapstream.com&quot;&gt;SnapStream&lt;/a&gt; software has improved incredibly since the last time I played with it, and it&amp;apos;s become so dead simple that my Mom can use it by making vague flappy gesticulations at the screen.  The only semi-exciting thing I see in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snapstream.com&quot;&gt;SnapStream&lt;/a&gt; buzz is that they&amp;apos;re planning on doing something with .NET web services, but no one&amp;apos;s really talking about that facet of it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Maybe they&amp;apos;ve all missed the availability of these products, but I&amp;apos;ve been using my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ati.com/na/pages/products/pc/aiw_radeon/index.html&quot;&gt;ALL-IN-WONDER? RADEON&lt;/a&gt; for the past year and a half, before which I used a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.riva3d.com/3500/&quot;&gt;Voodoo 3 3500TV&lt;/a&gt; (which sucked ass), and before &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; I used a plain old &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ati.com/na/pages/products/pc/aiw/index.html&quot;&gt;ATI All-In-Wonder&lt;/a&gt; card.  That&amp;apos;s been since I got my first real PC in 1997.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;apos;ve been using these cards to record the few shows I care about, in limited fashion, until I got the Radeon card and things took off.  With the AIW Radeon, I record straight to VCD format.  I burn the VCD movies onto CDRW and watch them in my DVD player, just like I used to use my VCR.  If I happen to like the show, I burn it to a real CD and file it away.  It&amp;apos;s not the greatest quality, but is pretty comparable to VHS, which is fine.  If I want better quality, there&amp;apos;s Super VCD which uses MPEG-2 to fit 30 minutes of DVD-quality video on a CD.  Or...  &lt;strong&gt;gasp&lt;/strong&gt; I could get a DVD burner.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And then, there&amp;apos;s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlink.com/products/usb/dsbr100/&quot;&gt;D-Link DSB-R100 PC FM USB Radio&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;apos;ve been using to record and archive FM radio shows, most notably Big Sonic Heaven.  Oh yeah, and the Voodoo 3500TV was good for that, too.  (But mostly, it sucked.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My digital lifestyle&amp;apos;s been kicking it for some time now.  Hell, not even Apple&amp;apos;s caught up to me yet, since I can&amp;apos;t find Mac-OS-X-supported replacements for my cable and FM radio archival rig.  If I had the money, I&amp;apos;d switch to 100% Apple in an eyeblink if they could seamlessly replace all the above.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Anyway.  I&amp;apos;m done now.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
