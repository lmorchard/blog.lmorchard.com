It seems like <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> does pretty much everything I want it to do for a weblog, and the upcoming <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/2002_02_26.shtml#000224">v2.0</a> looks even better.  In one sense, I'm not satisfied with the fact that all it does it maintain a static set of pages rather than being a dynamic app...  but then I think, <i>do I really need anything more than that?</i>  I mean, the one dynamic thing I have on the front page is the recent wiki changes, and that's a server-side include (that almost seems retro to me).  Seems to work fine.

The main reason I have a tiny doubt is just having checked out <a href="http://www.slashcode.com">Slashcode</a> again and remembering all the neato stuff it does, including its own <a href="http://slashcode.com/article.pl?sid=02/02/27/1723205&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=24">wiki plugin</a>.  <a href="http://software.tangent.org/">software.tangent.org</a> uses Slashcode, but then they're Slashcode contributors over there if I recall.

I could see MT choking if I had tons of content.  Say I update my site's templates again and it has to rebuild <i>everything</i>.  Eh, that's a degenerate and least frequent case.  And I've got the source, so I could pry my content out of it if I had to.
<br /><br />
As things are, the template system is dead simple, and I've started creating categories.  Everything <i>Just Works</i>.  Maybe I'll go drop a donation in their hat next week...
