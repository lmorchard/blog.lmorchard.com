        <meta property="og:description" content="It seems like Movable Type does pretty much everything I want it to do for a weblog, and the upcoming v2.0 looks even better.  In one sense, I&#39;m not satisfied with the fact that all it does it maintain a static set of pages rather than being a dynamic app...  but then I think, do I really need anything more than that?  I mean, the one dynamic thing I have on the front page is the recent wiki changes, and that&#39;s a server-side include (that almost seems retro to me).  Seems to work fine.

The main reason I have a tiny doubt is just having checked out Slashcode again and remembering all the neato stuff it does, including its own wiki plugin.  software.tangent.org uses Slashcode, but then they&#39;re Slashcode contributors over there if I recall.

I could see MT choking if I had tons of content.  Say I update my site&#39;s templates again and it has to rebuild everything.  Eh, that&#39;s a degenerate and least frequent case.  And I&#39;ve got the source, so I could pry my content out of it if I had to.

As things are, the template system is dead simple, and I&#39;ve started creating categories.  Everything Just Works.  Maybe I&#39;ll go drop a donation in their hat next week..." />
