One of the main culprits that stole my sharing\nflow was <a href=\"http://reader.google.com\">Google Reader</a>: I went from using a quick bookmarklet to an\neven quicker icon-click in my feed reader. That meant I left most\nthings <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/untagged/\">untagged</a>, but I shared even more than before. Eventually,\nGoogle Reader released a bookmarklet for use off-site, which\nmeant I started sharing everything everywhere to Reader.</p>\n<p>I also found a replacement for my old del.icio.us network in Google\nReader&#39;s social features. I could follow people, and the stream of\nthings <em>they</em> shared and annotated turned into a great source of\nnews curated and pre-filtered by likeminded people.</p>\n<p>Well, as it turns out, Google&#39;s <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/new-in-reader-fresh-design-and-google.html\">recent changes</a> to Reader just\nremoved all of the above. In exchange, they added a couple of buttons\nto +1 and share items to Google+, which streamlines things for them\nand encourages more use of the new service.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/114487965928288927815/posts/fgscQet4kxh\">As I wrote</a> on Google+, the net result is nothing to stomp and\nshout about, but there&#39;s nothing there that makes me happier. As I\nplayed more, though, I came to realize that most of the value\nI derived from the service had evaporated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"item-centric-vs-people-centric-efficiency-vs-engagement\">Item-centric vs People-centric, Efficiency vs Engagement</h2>\n<p>There&#39;s a big difference between the way sharing happened on Google\nReader, and the way it happens now on Google+. The best way I can\nthink to explain is that the old way was item-centric and the new way\nis people-centric.  In other words, <em>people</em> seem to be the dominant\n<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/jyri/microblogging-tiny-social-objects-on-the-future-of-participatory-media\">social objects</a> in Google+, whereas Google Reader used to treat\n<em>items</em> that way.</p>\n<p>Before, we all gathered around the news. The headline and summary were\nprimary, and our comments were collected after the item. The result\nwas a de-duped stream of great news filtered through smart brains.\nEven if the people I followed never said a word, the fact that they&#39;d\nclicked &quot;share&quot; was value enough. In fact, it was better that\nway most of the time, because we all got out of the way of each other\nand the news.</p>\n<p>This, by the way, is what I loved about del.icio.us and now\n<a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">pinboard.in</a>: It&#39;s anti-social networking. We can provide\nlow-effort, intelligent inputs to build something useful for each\nother, but we&#39;re not there to assert a presence or distract each other\nfrom the things we each came to see.</p>\n<p>But now, that filtered news stream is gone. In its place, on a\ndifferent site entirely, removed from the flow of feeding on news, is\na highly-engaging flood of people babbling away, which occasionally\nincludes repeated shares of things that have bubbled up during the\nday.</p>\n<p>What&#39;s wrong with that, for me?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I don&#39;t want to wade through a heavily-padded, user-friendly flood\nof duplicated, echoed items.</li>\n<li>I don&#39;t want to engage with the people—at least, not when I&#39;m in a\nmood to feed on news. I want to catch up on what&#39;s been put out\ninto the infosphere already, and <em>then</em> start talking about it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The design of Google+—which has spilled over into the Google Reader\nface-lift—is about engagement and not fast &amp; efficient processing of\nthe day&#39;s news. Engagement in general puts a drag on the task—which\nfor me is like a <a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd\">GTD</a>, <a href=\"http://inboxzero.com/\">Inbox Zero</a>, headline skimming, pattern\nrecognition zen thing that might not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea.</p>\n<p>But, for all I know, avowed weirdo and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/10/11/allgrowedup\">info freako</a> that I am,\nthese changes may drive Google Reader growth through the roof for\nmainstream users.  But, it&#39;s no longer a product for me. The changes\nin sharing have removed most of the value for me, because I no longer\nhave the warp speed cruise through news that other people used to\npower for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"circles-point-the-wrong-way\">Circles point the wrong way</h2>\n<p>One of the things <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/100535338638690515335/posts/95ZsWiCG3xS\">Louis Gray touted about the new sharing\nfeatures</a> reads like so:</p>\n<blockquote>In Reader’s previous sharing model, as a follower of your\nitems, I would see every single item you shared, no matter what it was\nabout. Obviously, as I have different interests than you do, not\neverything you shared was something I cared about, which often led to\nreduced sharing of off-topic content. Now, you are more in control, so\nyou can share sports items to your sports circles, great recipes with\nyour foodies circle, or local news to family and friends. You can keep\nsharing, like you always have, but now, you can better select who sees\nwhat.</blockquote>\n\n<p>But, for this purpose, Circles point the wrong way.</p>\n<p>Circles on Google+ are lists of people controlled by me. They&#39;re not\ntopics—again, people-centric and not item-centric. Circles are a\ntargeting mechanism for sharing to people, and a filtering mechanism\nfor items from people.  That is, I can use a circle to set who sees\nsomething and I can decide who&#39;s stuff I see and when.</p>\n<p>But, things that Circles don&#39;t do include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Letting me follow Circles without the Circle-owner needing to manage\nmembership - eg. Don&#39;t make me send a message saying &quot;I am\ninterested in your ideas and would like to subscribe to your\nnewsletter&quot;. RSS doesn&#39;t work that way and it&#39;s better for it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Letting me and others filter for what gets sent to specific Circles -\neg. I&#39;m in both your &quot;scifi&quot; and &quot;politics&quot; circles, but just show\nme what you sent to your &quot;scifi&quot; circle.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Google Reader didn&#39;t have this to begin with, but what I&#39;m looking for\nis an equivalent to tagging on <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">pinboard.in</a>. For example, if you\nlike my taste in <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/t:scifi\">scifi</a> but could care less about my views in\n<a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/t:politics\">politics</a>, you can subscribe to just the tag feeds you want.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m happy to tag my shares with topics; that&#39;s beneficial to me for\nsearch later, and helps interested people besides. But, the last thing\nI want to do is manage subscriber lists. That doesn&#39;t scale. There&#39;s\nno way for you to even know I have &quot;scifi&quot; or &quot;politics&quot; Circles, and\nyou have no way to join either of them without asking for an add.</p>\n<p>Too much coordination, not enough benefit.

One of the main culprits that stole my sharing\r\nflow was [Google Reader][]: I went from using a quick bookmarklet to an\r\neven quicker icon-click in my feed reader. That meant I left most\r\nthings [untagged][], but I shared even more than before. Eventually,\r\nGoogle Reader released a bookmarklet for use off-site, which\r\nmeant I started sharing everything everywhere to Reader.\r\n\r\n[google reader]: http://reader.google.com\r\n\r\nI also found a replacement for my old del.icio.us network in Google\r\nReader's social features. I could follow people, and the stream of\r\nthings *they* shared and annotated turned into a great source of\r\nnews curated and pre-filtered by likeminded people.\r\n\r\nWell, as it turns out, Google's [recent changes][] to Reader just\r\nremoved all of the above. In exchange, they added a couple of buttons\r\nto +1 and share items to Google+, which streamlines things for them\r\nand encourages more use of the new service.\r\n\r\n[As I wrote][] on Google+, the net result is nothing to stomp and\r\nshout about, but there's nothing there that makes me happier. As I\r\nplayed more, though, I came to realize that most of the value\r\nI derived from the service had evaporated.\r\n\r\n[as i wrote]: https://plus.google.com/114487965928288927815/posts/fgscQet4kxh\r\n[recent changes]: http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/new-in-reader-fresh-design-and-google.html\r\n[less del.icio.us]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2010/12/18/less-del-icio-us-than-ever-before\r\n[untagged]: http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/untagged/\r\n\r\n## Item-centric vs People-centric, Efficiency vs Engagement\r\n\r\nThere's a big difference between the way sharing happened on Google\r\nReader, and the way it happens now on Google+. The best way I can\r\nthink to explain is that the old way was item-centric and the new way\r\nis people-centric.  In other words, *people* seem to be the dominant\r\n[social objects][] in Google+, whereas Google Reader used to treat\r\n*items* that way.\r\n\r\n[social objects]: http://www.slideshare.net/jyri/microblogging-tiny-social-objects-on-the-future-of-participatory-media\r\n\r\nBefore, we all gathered around the news. The headline and summary were\r\nprimary, and our comments were collected after the item. The result\r\nwas a de-duped stream of great news filtered through smart brains.\r\nEven if the people I followed never said a word, the fact that they'd\r\nclicked \"share\" was value enough. In fact, it was better that\r\nway most of the time, because we all got out of the way of each other\r\nand the news.\r\n\r\nThis, by the way, is what I loved about del.icio.us and now\r\n[pinboard.in][]: It's anti-social networking. We can provide\r\nlow-effort, intelligent inputs to build something useful for each\r\nother, but we're not there to assert a presence or distract each other\r\nfrom the things we each came to see.\r\n\r\n[pinboard.in]: http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\r\n\r\nBut now, that filtered news stream is gone. In its place, on a\r\ndifferent site entirely, removed from the flow of feeding on news, is\r\na highly-engaging flood of people babbling away, which occasionally\r\nincludes repeated shares of things that have bubbled up during the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWhat's wrong with that, for me?\r\n\r\n1. I don't want to wade through a heavily-padded, user-friendly flood\r\n   of duplicated, echoed items.\r\n1. I don't want to engage with the people—at least, not when I'm in a\r\n   mood to feed on news. I want to catch up on what's been put out\r\n   into the infosphere already, and *then* start talking about it.\r\n\r\nThe design of Google+—which has spilled over into the Google Reader\r\nface-lift—is about engagement and not fast & efficient processing of\r\nthe day's news. Engagement in general puts a drag on the task—which\r\nfor me is like a [GTD][], [Inbox Zero][], headline skimming, pattern\r\nrecognition zen thing that might not be everyone's cup of tea.\r\n\r\nBut, for all I know, avowed weirdo and [info freako][] that I am,\r\nthese changes may drive Google Reader growth through the roof for\r\nmainstream users.  But, it's no longer a product for me. The changes\r\nin sharing have removed most of the value for me, because I no longer\r\nhave the warp speed cruise through news that other people used to\r\npower for me.\r\n\r\n[gtd]: http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd\r\n[inbox zero]: http://inboxzero.com/\r\n[info freako]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/10/11/allgrowedup\r\n\r\n## Circles point the wrong way\r\n\r\nOne of the things [Louis Gray touted about the new sharing\r\nfeatures][touted] reads like so:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In Reader’s previous sharing model, as a follower of your\r\nitems, I would see every single item you shared, no matter what it was\r\nabout. Obviously, as I have different interests than you do, not\r\neverything you shared was something I cared about, which often led to\r\nreduced sharing of off-topic content. Now, you are more in control, so\r\nyou can share sports items to your sports circles, great recipes with\r\nyour foodies circle, or local news to family and friends. You can keep\r\nsharing, like you always have, but now, you can better select who sees\r\nwhat.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n[touted]: https://plus.google.com/100535338638690515335/posts/95ZsWiCG3xS\r\n\r\nBut, for this purpose, Circles point the wrong way.\r\n\r\nCircles on Google+ are lists of people controlled by me. They're not\r\ntopics—again, people-centric and not item-centric. Circles are a\r\ntargeting mechanism for sharing to people, and a filtering mechanism\r\nfor items from people.  That is, I can use a circle to set who sees\r\nsomething and I can decide who's stuff I see and when.\r\n\r\nBut, things that Circles don't do include:\r\n\r\n* Letting me follow Circles without the Circle-owner needing to manage\r\n  membership - eg. Don't make me send a message saying \"I am\r\n  interested in your ideas and would like to subscribe to your\r\n  newsletter\". RSS doesn't work that way and it's better for it.\r\n\r\n* Letting me and others filter for what gets sent to specific Circles -\r\n  eg. I'm in both your \"scifi\" and \"politics\" circles, but just show\r\n  me what you sent to your \"scifi\" circle.\r\n\r\nGoogle Reader didn't have this to begin with, but what I'm looking for\r\nis an equivalent to tagging on [pinboard.in][]. For example, if you\r\nlike my taste in [scifi][] but could care less about my views in\r\n[politics][], you can subscribe to just the tag feeds you want.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to tag my shares with topics; that's beneficial to me for\r\nsearch later, and helps interested people besides. But, the last thing\r\nI want to do is manage subscriber lists. That doesn't scale. There's\r\nno way for you to even know I have \"scifi\" or \"politics\" Circles, and\r\nyou have no way to join either of them without asking for an add.\r\n\r\nToo much coordination, not enough benefit. I just can't see the value\r\nin people-centric Circles here.\r\n\r\n[scifi]: http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/t:scifi\r\n[politics]: http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/t:politics\r\n\r\n## Other things broke, too.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond the fundamental shift in sharing and reading, these things\r\nhave broken for me now too:\r\n\r\n* The bookmarklet is dead, so there goes my off-site sharing.\r\n* No sharing at all from the [mobile web version][], so there goes at\r\n  least half of my sharing on-site.\r\n* Android apps like my favorite [gReader Pro][] still think sharing\r\n  works, but they're just deluded and use an unsupported API anyway\r\n* No more feed to Facebook, so there goes most of [my Facebook\r\n  output][]. (Though, that might be a boon some friends over there.)\r\n\r\n[greader pro]: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.noinnion.android.greader.readerpro&hl=en\r\n[my facebook output]: http://www.facebook.com/lmorchard\r\n\r\n## Now what?\r\n\r\nThe remaining value of Google Reader is as just a plain old hosted\r\nfeed reader—one of the last of them out there, in fact. The problem\r\nhere is that I'm a weirdo who wrote [a book on feeds and feed readers][],\r\nand so I'm perfectly capable of providing the remaining\r\nvalue for myself.\r\n\r\nI'm sure most people won't want to do that, which is probably why\r\n\"[you're not going anywhere][]\". But, there are alternatives even for\r\npeople who don't want to D.I.Y. entirely:\r\n\r\n* Dave Winer's [River2][] (also open source, in UserTalk on the [OPML\r\n  Editor][]) runs on my laptop and lets me circle back to the code\r\n  that ran my second-ever news reader, [Radio UserLand][].  (My first\r\n  was a thing called [News Clipper][] in Perl from many, many moons\r\n  ago.) And, of course, [River2][] is one of a suite of apps Dave's\r\n  working on to build a decentrallized network of feeds and outlines.\r\n\r\n* [NewsBlur][] looks mighty fine, and [the guy running it][] only asks\r\n  US$12-36 (your choice) for a year's worth of premium access.\r\n  Remember: if you're not the customer, you're the product.

An ever-growing mass of our code is going toward building web sites and services that <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering\">build</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/\">ship</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/AUS\">update</a>, <a href=\"http://support.mozilla.com/\">support</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Engagement\">promote</a>, <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/\">augment</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/\">document</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/sync/\">sync</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/F1\">share</a>, <a href=\"http://identity.mozilla.com/\">identify</a>, and <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Socorro\">report</a>. (And I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing a further cast of hundreds, here.) </p>\n<h3 id=\"sighting-storm-clouds-on-the-horizon\">Sighting storm clouds on the horizon</h3>\n<p>In other words, more and more of Mozilla is in the <em>cloud</em>. Unfortunately, many of these projects are really hard to get into as a contributor. It&#39;s often hard to find what needs doing in Bugzilla, and it&#39;s often hard to get the code up and running in a meaningful way without being both a bit of a sysadmin and a Mozilla insider.</p>\n<p>This is a huge problem. Although Mozilla has a core group of employees, we&#39;re not nearly enough to build all of these projects and pursue <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/about/mission.html\">the mission</a> on our own. We&#39;ve gotten to where we are thanks to the volunteer efforts of thousands of contributors—and the only way we&#39;ll get where we want to go is through the efforts of thousands (or *<a href=\"http://commonspace.wordpress.com/2011/02/22/nmm-redux/\">millions</a>*) more. The good news is that is feels like we&#39;re <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mozilla.org/Contribute\">waking up to this problem</a> and starting to get <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo\">really serious about it</a>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"sharing-recipes-for-fluffy-clouds\">Sharing recipes for fluffy clouds</h3>\n<p>For my part, I&#39;ve spent idle time over the past few years trying to work out how to make webdev projects more accessible to new contributors. We&#39;ve come a long way from the days of just uploading WordPress to an FTP server; these things come with a lot of moving parts nowadays, and the <code>INSTALL.txt</code> files run long and consume weekends. And so, they filter out all but the most dedicated (or masochistic) volunteers.</p>\n<p>For months, I spun my wheels playing with virtual machines and exporting appliances, doing a lot of things by hand. But then, earlier this year, I discovered both <a href=\"http://vagrantup.com/\">Vagrant</a> and <a href=\"http://www.puppetlabs.com/\">Puppet</a> and had my mind blown. With those tools, I could share recipes for VMs right alongside my code. </p>\n<p>I would never have to set up a webdev environment for myself by hand again—all the fiddly bits of installation and configuration could be codified, checked into github, and flushed from my brain.  But, the real magic is that I could <em>share</em> this stuff. So, future coworkers and collaborators could benefit from the same reproducible dev enviroments—<em>never having wasted brainpower and weekends on an INSTALL.txt to begin with</em>. </p>\n<p>This is a really big deal. I <a href=\"http://lanyrd.com/2011/osbridge/sdxby/\">presented on it this past June at Open Source Bridge</a> in Portland (<a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2011/06/os-webdev-vm/slides.html\">slides</a>). I&#39;ve been talking myself blue about this stuff for months, in opposition to my usual serially enthuastic habits. But, it looks like I&#39;ve infected my coworkers at Mozilla, because now we&#39;re talking about <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2011/10/04/developing-with-vagrant-puppet-and-playdoh/\">developing with Vagrant, Puppet, and Playdoh</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-assembly-required\">No assembly required</h3>\n<p>So, with <a href=\"http://vagrantup.com/\">Vagrant</a>, <a href=\"http://www.puppetlabs.com/\">Puppet</a>, and <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2011/10/04/developing-with-vagrant-puppet-and-playdoh/\">Playdoh</a>, we&#39;ll have projects that you can fire up with just a <code>git clone</code> and a <code>vagrant up</code> in a command line shell. Forget about <a href=\"http://macports.org/\">MacPorts</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/\">Homebrew</a> on Mac OS X, or whatever it is that people using Windows have to install. Take a bike ride or go to lunch, and you&#39;ll have a fully configured server running and source code ready for hacking.</p>\n<p>I think we can do better, though. For one, spinning up a fairly complex virtual machine from scratch with <a href=\"http://vagrantup.com/\">Vagrant</a> and <a href=\"http://www.puppetlabs.com/\">Puppet</a> takes a long time and a lot of bandwidth. This can be sped up by <a href=\"http://vagrantup.com/docs/boxes.html\">packaging pre-built boxes</a>. So, one improvement we can pursue is to spin up VMs with Vagrant as a part of our continual integration and deployment processes and package boxes for public download. These are also handy on a thumb drive for sharing at hack events and meetups.</p>\n<p>This still requires <a href=\"http://vagrantup.com/\">Vagrant</a> and working with the command-line, though. Not everyone who has something valuable to contribute is a command-line jockey. And, a few of us webdevs have run into issues with <a href=\"http://vagrantup.com/\">Vagrant</a>—it&#39;s still early days for that project, after all. Additionally, not everyone who could be a Mozilla contributor owns the kind of hardware necessary to support running a substantial virtual machine.</p>\n<p>So, I&#39;ve also started playing with <a href=\"http://www.puppetlabs.com/\">Puppet</a> by itself, to build plain-vanilla VM appliances and to spin up cloud servers on <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">Amazon EC2</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/\">Rackspace Cloud Servers</a>. It&#39;s going pretty well, and it&#39;s conceivable we could do without <a href=\"http://vagrantup.com/\">Vagrant</a> to script the build of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Virtualization_Format\">downloadable VM appliances</a> and to spin up disposable cloud servers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-now-what\">So, now what?</h3>\n<p>There are still some issues to be worked out, so <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webdev:DevBoxVMImages\">I&#39;ve started a wiki page</a>. And, we need to spread the word that we&#39;re doing this to see what people think—and more importantly, see if this helps attract more help.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>At Mozilla, we're redoubling efforts to attract contributors. And, in the Webdev team, we're [using virtual machines][playdoh] to make it even easier to get started hacking. It makes no sense to demand that a JavaScript ninja or a CSS artisan also be a Python-wielding sysadmin, so we're trying to build [ready-baked VMs for our projects][devimages].</em>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/erix/3998080471/\" style=\"display: block; float: right; text-decoration: none; border: none; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\"><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/images/cloud-box.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px\" /><br /><small>Lieferung 3 by erix on Flickr</small></a>\r\n\r\nFirefox is more than just a desktop browser, and Mozilla is more than just Firefox. An ever-growing mass of our code is going toward building web sites and services that [build][releng], [ship][downloads], [update][aus], [support][sumo], [promote][promote], [augment][amo], [document][mdn], [sync][sync], [share][share], [identify][identity], and [report][socorro]. (And I'm sure I'm missing a further cast of hundreds, here.) \r\n\r\n### Sighting storm clouds on the horizon\r\n\r\nIn other words, more and more of Mozilla is in the *cloud*. Unfortunately, many of these projects are really hard to get into as a contributor. It's often hard to find what needs doing in Bugzilla, and it's often hard to get the code up and running in a meaningful way without being both a bit of a sysadmin and a Mozilla insider.\r\n\r\nThis is a huge problem. Although Mozilla has a core group of employees, we're not nearly enough to build all of these projects and pursue [the mission][mission] on our own. We've gotten to where we are thanks to the volunteer efforts of thousands of contributors—and the only way we'll get where we want to go is through the efforts of thousands (or *[millions][]*) more. The good news is that is feels like we're [waking up to this problem][contribute] and starting to get [really serious about it][remo]. \r\n\r\n### Sharing recipes for fluffy clouds\r\n\r\nFor my part, I've spent idle time over the past few years trying to work out how to make webdev projects more accessible to new contributors. We've come a long way from the days of just uploading WordPress to an FTP server; these things come with a lot of moving parts nowadays, and the `INSTALL.txt` files run long and consume weekends. And so, they filter out all but the most dedicated (or masochistic) volunteers.\r\n\r\nFor months, I spun my wheels playing with virtual machines and exporting appliances, doing a lot of things by hand. But then, earlier this year, I discovered both [Vagrant][] and [Puppet][] and had my mind blown. With those tools, I could share recipes for VMs right alongside my code. \r\n\r\nI would never have to set up a webdev environment for myself by hand again—all the fiddly bits of installation and configuration could be codified, checked into github, and flushed from my brain.  But, the real magic is that I could *share* this stuff. So, future coworkers and collaborators could benefit from the same reproducible dev enviroments—*never having wasted brainpower and weekends on an INSTALL.txt to begin with*. \r\n\r\nThis is a really big deal. I [presented on it this past June at Open Source Bridge][osbridge] in Portland ([slides][]). I've been talking myself blue about this stuff for months, in opposition to my usual serially enthuastic habits. But, it looks like I've infected my coworkers at Mozilla, because now we're talking about [developing with Vagrant, Puppet, and Playdoh][playdoh].\r\n\r\n### No assembly required\r\n\r\nSo, with [Vagrant][], [Puppet][], and [Playdoh][], we'll have projects that you can fire up with just a `git clone` and a `vagrant up` in a command line shell. Forget about [MacPorts][] or [Homebrew][] on Mac OS X, or whatever it is that people using Windows have to install. Take a bike ride or go to lunch, and you'll have a fully configured server running and source code ready for hacking.\r\n\r\nI think we can do better, though. For one, spinning up a fairly complex virtual machine from scratch with [Vagrant][] and [Puppet][] takes a long time and a lot of bandwidth. This can be sped up by [packaging pre-built boxes][boxes]. So, one improvement we can pursue is to spin up VMs with Vagrant as a part of our continual integration and deployment processes and package boxes for public download. These are also handy on a thumb drive for sharing at hack events and meetups.\r\n\r\nThis still requires [Vagrant][] and working with the command-line, though. Not everyone who has something valuable to contribute is a command-line jockey. And, a few of us webdevs have run into issues with [Vagrant][]—it's still early days for that project, after all. Additionally, not everyone who could be a Mozilla contributor owns the kind of hardware necessary to support running a substantial virtual machine.\r\n\r\nSo, I've also started playing with [Puppet][] by itself, to build plain-vanilla VM appliances and to spin up cloud servers on [Amazon EC2][ec2] and [Rackspace Cloud Servers][rackspace]. It's going pretty well, and it's conceivable we could do without [Vagrant][] to script the build of [downloadable VM appliances][ovf] and to spin up disposable cloud servers.\r\n\r\n### So, now what?\r\n\r\nThere are still some issues to be worked out, so [I've started a wiki page][devimages]. And, we need to spread the word that we're doing this to see what people think—and more importantly, see if this helps attract more help. From my years at Mozilla so far and bouncing between projects, VM appliances are things I wish I'd had when faced with a new project. So, having been there—albeit with insider advantages—I'm pretty optimistic that this is a good step forward.\r\n\r\nOf course, it's not the only step: The other thing I mentioned—and have conveniently avoided addressing again throughout the rest of this post—is the issue of finding things to do in Bugzilla. Well, we're working on that too. It's a bit beyond the scope of this blog post, but we have a Mozilla-wide effort to start classifying [good first bugs][gfb] for new contributors and [identifying mentors][mentors] to contact for help.\r\n\r\nSo... what do you think?\r\n\r\n[gfb]: https://bugzil.la/sw:%5Bgood%20first%20bug%5D\r\n[mentors]: http://blog.paulbiggar.com/archive/helping-new-contributors-part-2-mentoring/\r\n[macports]: http://macports.org/\r\n[homebrew]: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/\r\n[rackspace]: http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/\r\n[ec2]: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\r\n[ovf]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Virtualization_Format\r\n[boxes]: http://vagrantup.com/docs/boxes.html\r\n[devimages]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webdev:DevBoxVMImages\r\n[slides]: http://decafbad.com/2011/06/os-webdev-vm/slides.html\r\n[playdoh]: http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2011/10/04/developing-with-vagrant-puppet-and-playdoh/\r\n[devops]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps\r\n[osbridge]: http://lanyrd.com/2011/osbridge/sdxby/\r\n[vagrant]: http://vagrantup.com/\r\n[puppet]: http://www.puppetlabs.com/\r\n[remo]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo\r\n[contribute]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mozilla.org/Contribute\r\n[millions]: http://commonspace.wordpress.com/2011/02/22/nmm-redux/\r\n[promote]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Engagement\r\n[socorro]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Socorro\r\n[releng]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering\r\n[aus]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/AUS\r\n[credits]: http://www.mozilla.org/credits/\r\n[downloads]: http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/\r\n[amo]: https://addons.mozilla.org/\r\n[sumo]: http://support.mozilla.com/\r\n[mdn]: https://developer.mozilla.org/\r\n[flux]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webdev/Flux\r\n[fennec]: http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/\r\n[sync]: http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/sync/\r\n[identity]: http://identity.mozilla.com/\r\n[share]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/F1\r\n[mission]: http://www.mozilla.org/about/mission.html\r\n[involved]: http://www.mozilla.org/contribute/\r\n\r\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=70: -->\r\n",

But, I abandoned that thing due to getting super\nbusy with the Firefox 4 release. It also didn&#39;t help that I was a\nDjango newb and that I got caught up in screwing around with shiny\nthings like <a href=\"http://pinaxproject.com\">Pinax</a> and <a href=\"http://lettuce.it\">Lettuce</a> and neglected the actual feature\nset.</p>\n<p>So now, finally, <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/badger2\">I&#39;m picking the thread back up again</a>. This\ntime, with a little less ambition and a few more practical aims.</p>\n<h3 id=\"make-something-more-useful-right-away\">Make something more useful right away</h3>\n<p>While I <em>have</em> spent some dangerous time screwing around with shinies like\n<a href=\"http://vagrantup.com\">Vagrant</a>, <a href=\"http://pupetlabs.com\">Puppet</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/playdoh\">Playdoh</a>, I think I&#39;ve gotten that\nmostly out of my system and have gotten down to work <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/badger2/commits/master\">as of last\nnight</a>.</p>\n<p>Rather than build a Grand Central Station for badges, I&#39;ve reset my\ngoals to a progression of practical results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a reusable Django app that supports some basic use cases of\ncreating and awarding badges to users.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms\">Activity Stream</a>s narrating <a href=\"http://wiki.activitystrea.ms/w/page/27189812/Badge\">badge claims</a></li>\n<li>Add support for <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PubSubHubbub</a> with Badger activity streams</li>\n<li>Add a REST API, maybe with OAuth</li>\n<li>Accept badges for local users, via <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PuSH</a> from\nexternal sites</li>\n<li>See what the <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges\">Open Badges Project</a> is up to, and how Badger can\nfit in with their goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea here is to make Badger a practical, reusable, drop-in app for\nexisting sites—preferably (but not necessarily) the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/playdoh\">Playdoh</a>-flavored sites we&#39;re building at Mozilla. Then,\nincrementally and optionally empower a Badger-enabled site to become a\nbadge hub by accepting reports of badge claims from other\nBadger-enabled sites.</p>\n<h3 id=\"take-baby-steps-to-federation\">Take baby steps to federation</h3>\n<p>So, for example, let&#39;s say we dropped Badger into a few sites like\nthese:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://developer.mozilla.org\">http://developer.mozilla.org</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.mozilla.com\">http://support.mozilla.com</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://addons.mozilla.org\">http://addons.mozilla.org</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At first, Badger would just augment those sites with badging\nfacilities for their respective user bases. That could fill some needs\nright away.</p>\n<p>Then, say we built a site that offered personal profiles to members of\nthe Mozilla community.  With the <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms\">Activity Stream</a> and <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PuSH</a>\naugmentations, users could connect their profiles with each of the\nother Mozilla sites they use.  That way, whenever they claim a badge\nout there, it gets delivered to their community profile.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-bother-federating-at-all\">Why bother federating at all?</h3>\n<p>If the only cross-site goal to build an all-in-one display case for\nbadges on a community profile, I could just build JSON feeds and wrap\nthem in a JS-based widget. In fact, <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/1.0/\">a JSON-formatted Activity\nStream</a> will work nicely for that. Drop that into the profile\npage, and we&#39;re done.</p>\n<p>There are lots of reasons to federate. But, at least one thing not supported by\nthis solution are <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2010/07/badger-article/#section-105\">meta-badges</a>. That is, badges awarded for badges.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s say you close 100 bugs on Bugzilla, answer 100 questions on\nSUMO, edit 100 pages of documentation on MDN, and author 100 add-ons.\nAnd, let&#39;s say you get badges on the respective sites for all of those\nactivities.</p>\n<p>Well, now, I&#39;d like to give you a badge on your community profile for\nbeing a <strong>Mozilla Superhero</strong>. I could just do that by hand, having\nobserved all your greatness. But, I&#39;d rather the system just do that\nautomatically.</p>\n<p>If your community profile treated all your badges from your chosen affiliated\nsites as first-class citizens, then I could build the meta-badge\ntrigger right there.</p>\n<p>Of course, I could also write a program that monitors badge feeds from\nvarious sites. Then, use the community profile site&#39;s Badger API to\nissue a badge when the conditions are met. But, as maintainer of the\nmonitoring program, I&#39;d have to keep track of what feeds where count\nfor which people, which could be a mess.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s still some thinking to do here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-about-identity-and-co-opting-badges\">What about identity and co-opting badges?</h3>\n<p>I&#39;m still thinking through how someone connects a profile to other\nsites. As in, how can Badger ensure that the owner of the community\nprofile is also the owner of a badge claim feed on MDN?  Maybe some\nkind of OAuth dance that results in a <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PuSH</a> subscription between\nsites?</p>\n<p>Consider the least-capable federation case: a Badger-compatible feed\nhosted as a static file on Amazon S3. And, by Badger-compatible, I\nmean an <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms\">Activity Stream</a> that contains <a href=\"http://wiki.activitystrea.ms/w/page/27189812/Badge\">badge claims</a>. You\nshouldn&#39;t need my specific implementation of Badger-in-Django to\nproduce one of those.</p>\n<p>Although <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PuSH</a> is still the ideal case (I think), occasional\npolling of an <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms\">Activity Stream</a> feed should still be supported. If a\nuser connects that up to their community profile, we just have to take\ntheir word for it. We&#39;d rely on community members to\nflag stinkers trying to claim badge feeds that aren&#39;t theirs.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, there&#39;s probably some crypto-voodoo we can invoke here,\nfor cases where badge claim validity really matters—as opposed to the\nfun and games I have in mind for Mozilla.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-about-the-open-badges-project\">What about the Open Badges Project?</h3>\n<p>From various conversations over the past year, it sounds to me like\nthe <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges\">Open Badges Project</a> is getting the parts in place to do even\nmore interesting federation of badges that gives ownership of the\nbadge hub to the user.</p>\n<p>In that scenario, you have a backpack in your browser and can carry\nyour badge claims with you between sites with no prior coordination\nbetween the sites themselves. </p>\n<p>This sounds like something in which Badger should be able to\nparticipate, eventually. If not as a hub, Badger should at least offer\nthe tools to create and award badges that work with the user-owned hub\nscheme.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-what-next\">So, what next?</h3>\n<p>Now that I&#39;ve written all this out, I need to hack on it. If you&#39;re\ninterested in this stuff, let me know. That way, it&#39;ll look like\nsomeone might actually find this stuff handy when I get something\nworking!</p>\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=70: -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-256743407\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=afd2a7efeaad01509a571bae031dfc5c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">David Boswell</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-256743407\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-07-19T01:18:24\">2011-07-19T01:18:24</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Very cool to see an update on Badger.  I'm definitely interested in this and would love to see something like this show up in the Mozillians phonebook that will be ready soonish :)\nDavid</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-257292756\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://briks.si\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=29e2f1888cdcc9c451d32ab902d5a19c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://briks.si\">Brian King</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-257292756\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-07-19T15:12:01\">2011-07-19T15:12:01</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Over at the Mozilla Reps program, we are discussing the possible use of badges - https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-257331862\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://kanai.net/weblog/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gkanai.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://kanai.net/weblog/\">Gen Kanai</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-257331862\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-07-19T15:48:22\">2011-07-19T15:48:22</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Agreed with DBos.

This\r\ntime, with a little less ambition and a few more practical aims.\r\n\r\n### Make something more useful right away\r\n\r\nWhile I *have* spent some dangerous time screwing around with shinies like\r\n[Vagrant][], [Puppet][], and [Playdoh][], I think I've gotten that\r\nmostly out of my system and have gotten down to work [as of last\r\nnight][work].\r\n\r\n[work]: https://github.com/lmorchard/badger2/commits/master\r\n\r\nRather than build a Grand Central Station for badges, I've reset my\r\ngoals to a progression of practical results:\r\n\r\n* Build a reusable Django app that supports some basic use cases of\r\n  creating and awarding badges to users.\r\n* Add [Activity Stream][]s narrating [badge claims][]\r\n* Add support for [PubSubHubbub][push] with Badger activity streams\r\n* Add a REST API, maybe with OAuth\r\n* Accept badges for local users, via [PuSH][] from\r\n  external sites\r\n* See what the [Open Badges Project][] is up to, and how Badger can\r\n  fit in with their goals.\r\n\r\n[badge claims]: http://wiki.activitystrea.ms/w/page/27189812/Badge\r\n[Open Badges Project]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to make Badger a practical, reusable, drop-in app for\r\nexisting sites—preferably (but not necessarily) the\r\n[Playdoh][]-flavored sites we're building at Mozilla. Then,\r\nincrementally and optionally empower a Badger-enabled site to become a\r\nbadge hub by accepting reports of badge claims from other\r\nBadger-enabled sites.\r\n\r\n### Take baby steps to federation\r\n\r\nSo, for example, let's say we dropped Badger into a few sites like\r\nthese:\r\n\r\n* <http://developer.mozilla.org>;\r\n* <http://support.mozilla.com>;\r\n* <http://addons.mozilla.org>.\r\n\r\nAt first, Badger would just augment those sites with badging\r\nfacilities for their respective user bases. That could fill some needs\r\nright away.\r\n\r\nThen, say we built a site that offered personal profiles to members of\r\nthe Mozilla community.  With the [Activity Stream][] and [PuSH][]\r\naugmentations, users could connect their profiles with each of the\r\nother Mozilla sites they use.  That way, whenever they claim a badge\r\nout there, it gets delivered to their community profile.\r\n\r\n### Why bother federating at all?\r\n\r\nIf the only cross-site goal to build an all-in-one display case for\r\nbadges on a community profile, I could just build JSON feeds and wrap\r\nthem in a JS-based widget. In fact, [a JSON-formatted Activity\r\nStream][as-json] will work nicely for that. Drop that into the profile\r\npage, and we're done.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of reasons to federate. But, at least one thing not supported by\r\nthis solution are [meta-badges][]. That is, badges awarded for badges.\r\n\r\nLet's say you close 100 bugs on Bugzilla, answer 100 questions on\r\nSUMO, edit 100 pages of documentation on MDN, and author 100 add-ons.\r\nAnd, let's say you get badges on the respective sites for all of those\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nWell, now, I'd like to give you a badge on your community profile for\r\nbeing a **Mozilla Superhero**. I could just do that by hand, having\r\nobserved all your greatness. But, I'd rather the system just do that\r\nautomatically.\r\n\r\nIf your community profile treated all your badges from your chosen affiliated\r\nsites as first-class citizens, then I could build the meta-badge\r\ntrigger right there.\r\n\r\nOf course, I could also write a program that monitors badge feeds from\r\nvarious sites. Then, use the community profile site's Badger API to\r\nissue a badge when the conditions are met. But, as maintainer of the\r\nmonitoring program, I'd have to keep track of what feeds where count\r\nfor which people, which could be a mess.\r\n\r\nThere's still some thinking to do here.\r\n\r\n### What about identity and co-opting badges?\r\n\r\nI'm still thinking through how someone connects a profile to other\r\nsites. As in, how can Badger ensure that the owner of the community\r\nprofile is also the owner of a badge claim feed on MDN?  Maybe some\r\nkind of OAuth dance that results in a [PuSH][] subscription between\r\nsites?\r\n\r\nConsider the least-capable federation case: a Badger-compatible feed\r\nhosted as a static file on Amazon S3. And, by Badger-compatible, I\r\nmean an [Activity Stream][] that contains [badge claims][]. You\r\nshouldn't need my specific implementation of Badger-in-Django to\r\nproduce one of those.\r\n\r\nAlthough [PuSH][] is still the ideal case (I think), occasional\r\npolling of an [Activity Stream][] feed should still be supported. If a\r\nuser connects that up to their community profile, we just have to take\r\ntheir word for it. We'd rely on community members to\r\nflag stinkers trying to claim badge feeds that aren't theirs.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, there's probably some crypto-voodoo we can invoke here,\r\nfor cases where badge claim validity really matters—as opposed to the\r\nfun and games I have in mind for Mozilla.\r\n\r\n### What about the Open Badges Project?\r\n\r\nFrom various conversations over the past year, it sounds to me like\r\nthe [Open Badges Project][] is getting the parts in place to do even\r\nmore interesting federation of badges that gives ownership of the\r\nbadge hub to the user.\r\n\r\nIn that scenario, you have a backpack in your browser and can carry\r\nyour badge claims with you between sites with no prior coordination\r\nbetween the sites themselves. \r\n\r\nThis sounds like something in which Badger should be able to\r\nparticipate, eventually. If not as a hub, Badger should at least offer\r\nthe tools to create and award badges that work with the user-owned hub\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n### So, what next?\r\n\r\nNow that I've written all this out, I need to hack on it. If you're\r\ninterested in this stuff, let me know. That way, it'll look like\r\nsomeone might actually find this stuff handy when I get something\r\nworking!\r\n\r\n[as-json]: http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/1.0/\r\n[meta-badges]: http://decafbad.com/2010/07/badger-article/#section-105\r\n[activity stream]: http://activitystrea.ms\r\n[push]: http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\r\n[vagrant]: http://vagrantup.com\r\n[puppet]: http://pupetlabs.com\r\n[playdoh]: https://github.com/mozilla/playdoh\r\n[pinax]: http://pinaxproject.com\r\n[lettuce]: http://lettuce.it\r\n[badger-paper]: http://decafbad.com/2010/07/badger-article/\r\n[badger1]: https://github.com/lmorchard/badger\r\n[badger2]: https://github.com/lmorchard/badger2\r\n\r\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=70: -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-256743407\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=afd2a7efeaad01509a571bae031dfc5c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">David Boswell</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-256743407\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-07-19T01:18:24\">2011-07-19T01:18:24</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Very cool to see an update on Badger.  I'm definitely interested in this and would love to see something like this show up in the Mozillians phonebook that will be ready soonish :)\r\n\r\nDavid</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-257292756\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://briks.si\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=29e2f1888cdcc9c451d32ab902d5a19c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://briks.si\">Brian King</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-257292756\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-07-19T15:12:01\">2011-07-19T15:12:01</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Over at the Mozilla Reps program, we are discussing the possible use of badges - https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-257331862\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://kanai.net/weblog/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gkanai.jpg\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://kanai.net/weblog/\">Gen Kanai</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-257331862\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-07-19T15:48:22\">2011-07-19T15:48:22</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Agreed with DBos.

It's using core template loaders and shortcuts, so switching over to standard stuff shouldn't be an issue for the views and models.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping at some point to put together some more Django-conventional template tags and templates toward that end, unless someone gets to it before me in a pull request (patches welcome!). Really, I think the template tags are the more important thing, since any templates out of the box will likely get overridden on a real site.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-301119028\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.integrating-technology.org/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/nelliemuller.jpg\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.integrating-technology.org/\">Dr. Nellie Deutsch</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-301119028\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-09-02T14:07:45\">2011-09-02T14:07:45</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I love the idea, Leslie.  I've been heading a self-funded organization that provides free online professional development workshops for educators around the world since 2006.

    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>Our <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">cable company</a> has offered poor\nsupport for our TiVo; cut our channels and allowed our service to\ndegrade; mislead us about possible solutions; and finally wasted our\ntime by sending a contractor to our home instead of a clued-in\nemployee who could handle the issue.  And, now that we&#39;re going to\npursue other options for putting moving pictures on our television,\nthey plan to charge us for cutting the cord. Since I&#39;ve been looking\nto write here more, I&#39;ve just been given a nice excuse to rant.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright House</a> has basically a local monopoly on cable TV here. So,\nwe&#39;ve been a customer of theirs for cable and internet over the past\nfew years. </p>\n<p>This is the thing, though: We&#39;ve spent a lot of money on a cable\nsubscription.  In exchange, I expect great and even proactive customer\nservice. I guess I&#39;m unreasonable, because instead we&#39;re expected to\npay more for less and to accept hassles and up-selling instead of\nsupport—because they&#39;re almost literally the only game in town. But,\nother options are getting <em>good enough</em> and we can learn to do\nwithout.</p>\n<p>You see, we have a <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a>. We like our <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a>. We got one when\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/sparklebunny/\">the girl</a> worked at the company, and we&#39;ve never gone back.\nHaving one is like living in the future. Yes, <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright House</a> offers\n<a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/shop/tv/dvr\">their own DVRs</a>, but they&#39;re inferior products and we don&#39;t want\none.  So, as far as I&#39;m concerned, <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright House</a> is just a video\nsupplier for our <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a>. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, over the past year, they&#39;ve done a crappy job.  They&#39;re\ntransitioning to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched_video\">Switched Digital Video</a>, and that&#39;s something\nour <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> doesn&#39;t support out of the box. As we eventually found\nout, there&#39;s a <a href=\"http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/307/kw/sdv/r_id/100041\">tuning adapter</a> that could fix things. But, rather\nthan tell us about that up front—and maybe offer to\nsend us one as a part of their transition—they&#39;ve instead sent us a\nseries of letters listing channels we&#39;re going to lose\nbecause we rent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CableCARD\">CableCARDs</a>.</p>\n<p>Since I&#39;ve got better things to do than call the cable company, I put\noff contacting them. In the meantime, we lost channels as promised.\nOther channels not listed in the letters began to degrade and became\nunwatchable.</p>\n<p>Finally, I sent an email. A week or so later, they called and left me\na voicemail, which described <strong>the installation fee and monthly\nrental rate</strong> of a <a href=\"http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/307/kw/sdv/r_id/100041\">tuning adapter</a>. This, on top of what we already\npay for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CableCARD\">CableCARDs</a> and the underlying cable service itself.  At\nthat point, we were pretty annoyed. The cable bill was already high\nand new fees seemed to appear every month—<strong>and they wanted us to pay\neven more just to get what we&#39;d originally signed up for</strong>.</p>\n<p>Yes, I understand that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched_video\">SDV</a> will let them make more efficient\nuse of resources and offer exciting new services and <em>yadda yadda\nyadda</em>—but, to me, it just looks like they&#39;re breaking the video feed\ninto our <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> and expect us to pay more to fix it. It&#39;s pretty\nshady and customer-hostile, this stuff. Oh wait: <a href=\"http://hd.engadget.com/2008/10/16/fcc-fines-twc-and-cox-for-deploying-switched-digital-video/\">Didn&#39;t some of these\nguys get fined by the FCC for SDV hijinx not too long ago?</a> </p>\n<p>So, rather than jump on getting a <a href=\"http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/307/kw/sdv/r_id/100041\">tuning adapter</a> installed, I bought\n<a href=\"http://www.bestbuy.com/site/RCA+-+Indoor+HDTV+Antenna+-+White/8939839.p;jsessionid=2D2BA012979FDCFA317D3D5E287FE00D.bbolsp-app03-25?id=1215217075905&amp;skuId=8939839&amp;st=hd%20antenna&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=2\">an antenna</a> and went retro. It turns out there are <a href=\"http://transition.fcc.gov/mb/engineering/maps/\">over a\ndozen over-the-air HD channels in range</a>. That might not sound\nlike a lot, but you&#39;d be surprised how much watchable stuff is packed\ninto the major networks versus the other 1000 channels we got on\ndigital cable. The theme here is <em>free</em> and <em>good enough</em>.</p>\n<p>True, some of those channels are a pain to tune in using a dinky\nlittle indoor antenna, reminicent of the &quot;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna\">rabbit ears</a>&quot; days.  But,\nfor most of the past month, we got by pretty well. The <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> works\nnicely <a href=\"http://www.tivo.com/products/source/antenna/index.html\">with an antenna</a>.  It&#39;s a decent <a href=\"http://netflix.com/\">Netflix</a>\nstreamer, too. (Though, to be honest, the Xbox 360 works better,\ncan get <a href=\"http://www.hulu.com/plus\">Hulu Plus</a>, and plays videos from our network. <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a>\nreally, really needs to catch up fast here.)</p>\n<p>Having given TV a trial without cable, we decided it was time to call\n<a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright House</a> back to sort out this <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> thing, one way or\nanother.  Since I&#39;m a proven procrastinating wuss about calling the\ncable company, my wife called and scheduled an appointment for a tech\nvisit. </p>\n<p>Here&#39;s the fun part: They told her we didn&#39;t need a <a href=\"http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/307/kw/sdv/r_id/100041\">tuning\nadapter</a>. Instead, they had &quot;HD boxes&quot; which would do the trick.\nThey could install those for free, reclaim our rented <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CableCARD\">CableCARDs</a>,\nand we&#39;d get a break on our bill at the end. I was dubious, but that\nsounded surprisingly good!</p>\n<p>So, the tech arrived today, near the end of the 2-hour window. He came\narmed with two <a href=\"http://www.motorola.com/Video-Solutions/US-EN/Products-and-Services/Video-Consumer-Premise-Equipment/All-Digital-Set-Tops/DCX3200_US-EN?localeId=33\">Motorola DCX3200</a> set-top boxes. I thought they must\nhave some kind of control connection to be slaved to the <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a>. My\ncable-tech-fu is pretty weak, but I assumed they knew what they were\ndoing.</p>\n<p>But, no: The tech—who was a contractor and not a <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright House</a>\nemployee—took one look at our <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> and shrugged. He had no idea\nhow to make these boxes work with that thing. So, he set one up\nalongside the <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> and called back to headquarters to schedule\n<em>another</em> appointment—this time with an elusive <strong>real</strong> <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright\nHouse</a> employee who apparently knew about these things. You know,\nthe guy whom they should have sent in the first place. </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve no real complaints about the contractor: His installation of the\nset-top box was fine—it was just the wrong solution altogether. Yeah,\nI could probably finagle something with an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_blaster\">IR blaster</a>, but it\ndoesn&#39;t seem worth it and probably doesn&#39;t work in HD. We could also\nkeep the appointment next week and hope that the <strong>bona fide <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright\nHouse</a> employee</strong> knows what he&#39;s doing and leaves us with a working\n<a href=\"http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/307/kw/sdv/r_id/100041\">tuning adapter</a>. But, trying to be happy about that starts to feel\nlike <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome\">Stockholm Syndrome</a>.</p>\n<p>After the contractor left, we thought a bit and my wife (again,\nbecause the phone is my kryptonite, and I&#39;d be useless without her)\ncalled <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright House</a> to cancel our cable.</p>\n<p>We wanted to keep the internet access—but even here, they did their\nbest to make us think twice about staying their customer at all.  It\nturns out that to break up our cable/internet bundle, they need to\n&quot;rebuild our whole system&quot; and that incurs a fee as large as what we\npaid to install cable in the first place.</p>\n<p>The funny thing is that it wouldn&#39;t have been hard to keep us\nhappy. Do a little work up front to help keep our <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> running,\nand we might have spent even more money on cable. Now, we&#39;re looking\nvery hard at alternatives we&#39;d been too complacent to consider\nbefore.</p>\n<p>But, I guess that&#39;s the problem: <a href=\"http://hd.engadget.com/2010/02/19/tivo-wonders-why-cable-wants-tv-everywhere-except-on-a-tivo/\">This is all very old news.</a>\nThey don&#39;t really want our <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> on their network. So, instead,\nthey sent letters promising degraded service and followed through on\nit. And, when contacted to address the issue, they botched it\naltogether. Clearly, if third-party set-top boxes and the customers\nwho use them were a priority beyond just avoiding FCC fines, they&#39;d\nhave the right people and processes in place to keep us happy. I think\nwe&#39;ve gotten the message, now.</p>\n<p>Where&#39;s that leave us? Well, our bill will be cut in half, at least\nafter we pay for the new setup fee. We&#39;ll need to be more mindful and\nintentional toward what we watch on TV and how we get it, but somehow\nI think we&#39;ll manage.  Past that, I think it&#39;ll feel good to pay less\nfor a service provided by a company that doesn&#39;t really want our\nbusiness and has a strange notion of customer service. </p>\n<p>In the meantime, I think I&#39;ll be on the lookout\nfor a better internet provider so we can ditch <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright House</a>\noutright. The problem is, I don&#39;t think the market around here is\nexactly rife with competition.</p>\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=70: -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-223874330\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/google-ec18b68fb719cdef24375dc3a0ffb29f.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Craig Maloney</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-223874330\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-11T15:57:19\">2011-06-11T15:57:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Not sure if you can get it, but I've been happy with Wide Open West for my phone / Internet connectivity.

AS long as I'm not working on the computer thats doing the recording at the same time, the quality is great and we can watch the next day (still considering a hardware h.264 encoder).

They apparently only have \"the guy\" who knows how to work with TiVo and CableCARDs, and we're \"lucky\" to get him. And, that was *before* the SDV transition started here.\nIt's not my job to be proactive about their service. We're paying them, not the other way around. They knew something was wrong, because they knew enough to send us letters about breaking our service. They could have been proactive themselves and called us to schedule an appointment with \"the guy\" to get us hooked up with a tuning adapter before we started losing channels and reception quality.\nAnd, when we *did* finally call them, they sent the wrong guy to install the wrong stuff.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>Our [cable company][bright house] has offered poor\r\nsupport for our TiVo; cut our channels and allowed our service to\r\ndegrade; mislead us about possible solutions; and finally wasted our\r\ntime by sending a contractor to our home instead of a clued-in\r\nemployee who could handle the issue.  And, now that we're going to\r\npursue other options for putting moving pictures on our television,\r\nthey plan to charge us for cutting the cord. Since I've been looking\r\nto write here more, I've just been given a nice excuse to rant.</em>\r\n\r\n[Bright House][] has basically a local monopoly on cable TV here. So,\r\nwe've been a customer of theirs for cable and internet over the past\r\nfew years. \r\n\r\nThis is the thing, though: We've spent a lot of money on a cable\r\nsubscription.  In exchange, I expect great and even proactive customer\r\nservice. I guess I'm unreasonable, because instead we're expected to\r\npay more for less and to accept hassles and up-selling instead of\r\nsupport—because they're almost literally the only game in town. But,\r\nother options are getting *good enough* and we can learn to do\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nYou see, we have a [TiVo][]. We like our [TiVo][]. We got one when\r\n[the girl][girl] worked at the company, and we've never gone back.\r\nHaving one is like living in the future. Yes, [Bright House][] offers\r\n[their own DVRs][dvrs], but they're inferior products and we don't want\r\none.  So, as far as I'm concerned, [Bright House][] is just a video\r\nsupplier for our [TiVo][]. \r\n\r\n[dvrs]: http://brighthouse.com/michigan/shop/tv/dvr\r\n[girl]: http://twitter.com/sparklebunny/\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, over the past year, they've done a crappy job.  They're\r\ntransitioning to [Switched Digital Video][sdv], and that's something\r\nour [TiVo][] doesn't support out of the box. As we eventually found\r\nout, there's a [tuning adapter][] that could fix things. But, rather\r\nthan tell us about that up front—and maybe offer to\r\nsend us one as a part of their transition—they've instead sent us a\r\nseries of letters listing channels we're going to lose\r\nbecause we rent [CableCARDs][].\r\n\r\nSince I've got better things to do than call the cable company, I put\r\noff contacting them. In the meantime, we lost channels as promised.\r\nOther channels not listed in the letters began to degrade and became\r\nunwatchable.\r\n\r\nFinally, I sent an email. A week or so later, they called and left me\r\na voicemail, which described **the installation fee and monthly\r\nrental rate** of a [tuning adapter][]. This, on top of what we already\r\npay for [CableCARDs][] and the underlying cable service itself.  At\r\nthat point, we were pretty annoyed. The cable bill was already high\r\nand new fees seemed to appear every month—**and they wanted us to pay\r\neven more just to get what we'd originally signed up for**.\r\n\r\nYes, I understand that [SDV][sdv] will let them make more efficient\r\nuse of resources and offer exciting new services and *yadda yadda\r\nyadda*—but, to me, it just looks like they're breaking the video feed\r\ninto our [TiVo][] and expect us to pay more to fix it. It's pretty\r\nshady and customer-hostile, this stuff. Oh wait: [Didn't some of these\r\nguys get fined by the FCC for SDV hijinx not too long ago?][fined] \r\n\r\n[fined]: http://hd.engadget.com/2008/10/16/fcc-fines-twc-and-cox-for-deploying-switched-digital-video/\r\n\r\nSo, rather than jump on getting a [tuning adapter][] installed, I bought\r\n[an antenna][antenna] and went retro. It turns out there are [over a\r\ndozen over-the-air HD channels in range][range]. That might not sound\r\nlike a lot, but you'd be surprised how much watchable stuff is packed\r\ninto the major networks versus the other 1000 channels we got on\r\ndigital cable. The theme here is *free* and *good enough*.\r\n\r\nTrue, some of those channels are a pain to tune in using a dinky\r\nlittle indoor antenna, reminicent of the \"[rabbit ears][]\" days.  But,\r\nfor most of the past month, we got by pretty well. The [TiVo][] works\r\nnicely [with an antenna][tivo-ota].  It's a decent [Netflix][]\r\nstreamer, too. (Though, to be honest, the Xbox 360 works better,\r\ncan get [Hulu Plus][], and plays videos from our network. [TiVo][]\r\nreally, really needs to catch up fast here.)\r\n\r\n[rabbit ears]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna\r\n\r\nHaving given TV a trial without cable, we decided it was time to call\r\n[Bright House][] back to sort out this [TiVo][] thing, one way or\r\nanother.  Since I'm a proven procrastinating wuss about calling the\r\ncable company, my wife called and scheduled an appointment for a tech\r\nvisit. \r\n\r\nHere's the fun part: They told her we didn't need a [tuning\r\nadapter][]. Instead, they had \"HD boxes\" which would do the trick.\r\nThey could install those for free, reclaim our rented [CableCARDs][],\r\nand we'd get a break on our bill at the end. I was dubious, but that\r\nsounded surprisingly good!\r\n\r\nSo, the tech arrived today, near the end of the 2-hour window. He came\r\narmed with two [Motorola DCX3200][] set-top boxes. I thought they must\r\nhave some kind of control connection to be slaved to the [TiVo][]. My\r\ncable-tech-fu is pretty weak, but I assumed they knew what they were\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nBut, no: The tech—who was a contractor and not a [Bright House][]\r\nemployee—took one look at our [TiVo][] and shrugged. He had no idea\r\nhow to make these boxes work with that thing. So, he set one up\r\nalongside the [TiVo][] and called back to headquarters to schedule\r\n*another* appointment—this time with an elusive **real** [Bright\r\nHouse][] employee who apparently knew about these things. You know,\r\nthe guy whom they should have sent in the first place. \r\n\r\nI've no real complaints about the contractor: His installation of the\r\nset-top box was fine—it was just the wrong solution altogether. Yeah,\r\nI could probably finagle something with an [IR blaster][], but it\r\ndoesn't seem worth it and probably doesn't work in HD. We could also\r\nkeep the appointment next week and hope that the **bona fide [Bright\r\nHouse][] employee** knows what he's doing and leaves us with a working\r\n[tuning adapter][]. But, trying to be happy about that starts to feel\r\nlike [Stockholm Syndrome][].\r\n\r\nAfter the contractor left, we thought a bit and my wife (again,\r\nbecause the phone is my kryptonite, and I'd be useless without her)\r\ncalled [Bright House][] to cancel our cable.\r\n\r\nWe wanted to keep the internet access—but even here, they did their\r\nbest to make us think twice about staying their customer at all.  It\r\nturns out that to break up our cable/internet bundle, they need to\r\n\"rebuild our whole system\" and that incurs a fee as large as what we\r\npaid to install cable in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing is that it wouldn't have been hard to keep us\r\nhappy. Do a little work up front to help keep our [TiVo][] running,\r\nand we might have spent even more money on cable. Now, we're looking\r\nvery hard at alternatives we'd been too complacent to consider\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nBut, I guess that's the problem: [This is all very old news.][oldnews]\r\nThey don't really want our [TiVo][] on their network. So, instead,\r\nthey sent letters promising degraded service and followed through on\r\nit. And, when contacted to address the issue, they botched it\r\naltogether. Clearly, if third-party set-top boxes and the customers\r\nwho use them were a priority beyond just avoiding FCC fines, they'd\r\nhave the right people and processes in place to keep us happy. I think\r\nwe've gotten the message, now.\r\n\r\nWhere's that leave us? Well, our bill will be cut in half, at least\r\nafter we pay for the new setup fee. We'll need to be more mindful and\r\nintentional toward what we watch on TV and how we get it, but somehow\r\nI think we'll manage.  Past that, I think it'll feel good to pay less\r\nfor a service provided by a company that doesn't really want our\r\nbusiness and has a strange notion of customer service. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I think I'll be on the lookout\r\nfor a better internet provider so we can ditch [Bright House][]\r\noutright. The problem is, I don't think the market around here is\r\nexactly rife with competition.\r\n\r\n[oldnews]: http://hd.engadget.com/2010/02/19/tivo-wonders-why-cable-wants-tv-everywhere-except-on-a-tivo/\r\n[stockholm syndrome]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome\r\n[ir blaster]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_blaster\r\n[hulu plus]: http://www.hulu.com/plus\r\n[range]: http://transition.fcc.gov/mb/engineering/maps/\r\n[tivo-ota]: http://www.tivo.com/products/source/antenna/index.html\r\n[antenna]: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/RCA+-+Indoor+HDTV+Antenna+-+White/8939839.p;jsessionid=2D2BA012979FDCFA317D3D5E287FE00D.bbolsp-app03-25?id=1215217075905&skuId=8939839&st=hd%20antenna&cp=1&lp=2\r\n[motorola dcx3200]: http://www.motorola.com/Video-Solutions/US-EN/Products-and-Services/Video-Consumer-Premise-Equipment/All-Digital-Set-Tops/DCX3200_US-EN?localeId=33\r\n[cablecards]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CableCARD\r\n[netflix]: http://netflix.com/\r\n[tivo]: http://tivo.com/\r\n[tuning adapter]: http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/307/kw/sdv/r_id/100041\r\n[sdv]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched_video\r\n[bright house]: http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\r\n\r\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=70: -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-223874330\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/google-ec18b68fb719cdef24375dc3a0ffb29f.jpg\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Craig Maloney</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-223874330\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-11T15:57:19\">2011-06-11T15:57:19</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Not sure if you can get it, but I've been happy with Wide Open West for my phone / Internet connectivity.

    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>My blog is now produced by <a href=\"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a>, with comments hosted by <a href=\"http://disqus.com/\">Disqus</a>.</em></p>\n<p>This blog has transitioned between a handful of publishing platforms -\nincluding Movable Type, blosxom, and Wordpress. Well, apparently, it&#39;s that\ntime again.  I&#39;ve been toying with making a change again for a few years,\nand finally just got all the pieces together over the past week. This blog\nis now just a pile of static files produced by <a href=\"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a>, and the comments\nare now hosted by <a href=\"http://disqus.com/\">Disqus</a>.</p>\n<p>This has a lot of interesting implications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I can neglect my server for long periods of time without worrying that my\nlong-outdated copy of Wordpress has been exploited. Really, there&#39;s no\nreason for me to have a full-featured CMS running here.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I could host my entire blog on Amazon S3 or something similar, and be\nmore neglectful by reducing active code even further. The only crappy\nthing is that I don&#39;t think I can send <code>decafbad.com</code> directly to S3, and\nwould need to redirect to a CNAME on a subdomain on <code>blog.decafbad.com</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I can edit my blog directly on GitHub and, assuming I get the webhooks\nset up, have my server rebuild the HTML automatically on a <code>git push</code>. I\ncould probably use <a href=\"http://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> and the Jekyll support there,\nbut I suspect I&#39;ll be doing some Weird Things that they won&#39;t handle.\n(And probably for good reason.) </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Since Disqus has all my comments now, I can stop worrying about running\nthat code on my server too. I&#39;m a little antsy about putting that in the\ncloud, but the escape routes are well lit and I should be able to replace\nit easily if I need to. Self-hosted, JS-include-based comments is a\nproject in my TODO list.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>My writing here is now all stored in individual text files, formatted with\nMarkdown, annotated with YAML metadata, and subject to revision control\nunder git. This combination feels like it has a lot of longevity and\npotential for survival even beyond this current experiment with <a href=\"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Writing, editing, and publishing entries here can now more closely match\nmy daily reality of living in MacVim and git. It sounds lame, but the\nnotion of swapping over to a Wordpress admin page and working in a\nbrowser textarea has often kept me from even starting a post.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But, some things are broken, now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.decafbad.com/commit/a79678828ab612c2edb8a8ac3f796199cb922a2e\">Fixed</a> <strike>No more tag pages. I don&#39;t think very many humans visit these pages, but\na lot of search engines do.</strike></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.decafbad.com/commit/a79678828ab612c2edb8a8ac3f796199cb922a2e\">Fixed</a> <strike>No more tag feeds. I expect to hear about this soon, since this blog gets\nsyndicated to Planet Mozilla via my &quot;mozilla&quot; tag feed.</strike></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>No more year / month archive pages or sidebar widget. Not sure how many\npeople actually stroll down memory lane here on my blog, but I do have a\n<a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/archives\">gigantor huge list of all my posts evar</a>, now.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A general lack of contextual links to related posts and such. Turns out\nthat running the LSI option on Jekyll is completely horrible.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Regeneration seems less-than-happy in general, and I wish it did\nconditional regneration. That is, only produce the HTML for things that\nneed it because dependencies have changed. No need to rebake the whole\nworld just because I changed one file.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bright side is that there are solutions to all the broken things, and\nnow I have something to tinker with again on my blog.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>My blog is now produced by [Jekyll][], with comments hosted by [Disqus][].</em>\n\n[jekyll]: https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\n[disqus]: http://disqus.com/\n\nThis blog has transitioned between a handful of publishing platforms -\nincluding Movable Type, blosxom, and Wordpress. Well, apparently, it's that\ntime again.  I've been toying with making a change again for a few years,\nand finally just got all the pieces together over the past week. This blog\nis now just a pile of static files produced by [Jekyll][], and the comments\nare now hosted by [Disqus][].\n\n[pages]: http://pages.github.com/\n\nThis has a lot of interesting implications:\n\n* I can neglect my server for long periods of time without worrying that my\n  long-outdated copy of Wordpress has been exploited. Really, there's no\n  reason for me to have a full-featured CMS running here.\n\n* I could host my entire blog on Amazon S3 or something similar, and be\n  more neglectful by reducing active code even further. The only crappy\n  thing is that I don't think I can send `decafbad.com` directly to S3, and\n  would need to redirect to a CNAME on a subdomain on `blog.decafbad.com`.\n\n* I can edit my blog directly on GitHub and, assuming I get the webhooks\n  set up, have my server rebuild the HTML automatically on a `git push`. I\n  could probably use [GitHub Pages][pages] and the Jekyll support there,\n  but I suspect I'll be doing some Weird Things that they won't handle.\n  (And probably for good reason.) \n\n* Since Disqus has all my comments now, I can stop worrying about running\n  that code on my server too. I'm a little antsy about putting that in the\n  cloud, but the escape routes are well lit and I should be able to replace\n  it easily if I need to. Self-hosted, JS-include-based comments is a\n  project in my TODO list.\n\n* My writing here is now all stored in individual text files, formatted with\n  Markdown, annotated with YAML metadata, and subject to revision control\n  under git. This combination feels like it has a lot of longevity and\n  potential for survival even beyond this current experiment with [Jekyll][]\n\n* Writing, editing, and publishing entries here can now more closely match\n  my daily reality of living in MacVim and git. It sounds lame, but the\n  notion of swapping over to a Wordpress admin page and working in a\n  browser textarea has often kept me from even starting a post.\n\nBut, some things are broken, now:\n\n* [Fixed][tags] <strike>No more tag pages. I don't think very many humans visit these pages, but\n  a lot of search engines do.</strike>\n\n* [Fixed][tags] <strike>No more tag feeds. I expect to hear about this soon, since this blog gets\n  syndicated to Planet Mozilla via my \"mozilla\" tag feed.</strike>\n\n* No more year / month archive pages or sidebar widget. Not sure how many\n  people actually stroll down memory lane here on my blog, but I do have a\n  [gigantor huge list of all my posts evar][archives], now.\n\n* A general lack of contextual links to related posts and such. Turns out\n  that running the LSI option on Jekyll is completely horrible.\n\n* Regeneration seems less-than-happy in general, and I wish it did\n  conditional regneration. That is, only produce the HTML for things that\n  need it because dependencies have changed. No need to rebake the whole\n  world just because I changed one file.\n\n[tags]: https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.decafbad.com/commit/a79678828ab612c2edb8a8ac3f796199cb922a2e\n\nThe bright side is that there are solutions to all the broken things, and\nnow I have something to tinker with again on my blog.  So, let me know if\nanything else looks broken, and hopefully this will get me spewing some\nmore words out onto this thing soon.\n\n[archives]: http://decafbad.com/blog/archives\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221397880\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/lmorchard.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com/\">Les Orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221397880\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-08T17:45:54\">2011-06-08T17:45:54</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Testing a comment here on my new post.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221404263\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/bkclements.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">bkclements</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221404263\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-08T17:59:01\">2011-06-08T17:59:01</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Hi, did you happen to look at blogofile for similar functionality?\n\nI'm still trying to decide which way to  go.

But, that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing: Some features steal attention from others that are more important. Some could be spun off into add-ons, which are getting easier to make.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>Feel free to comment on this blog post. But, if you feel strongly about these features, you might get a better discussion with more people on <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_thread/thread/fa6f83e781b962a4\">this thread from the <code>mozilla.dev.apps.firefox</code> newsgroup (in Google Groups)</a>.</em></p>\n<p style=\"display: block; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; float:right;\">\n<a style=\"display: block;\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/4925985819/\" title=\"Phone Don't Work No More by Thomas Hawk, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4925985819_9ccbb166f7.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Phone Don't Work No More\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/4925985819/\">Phone Don't Work No More</a> by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/\">Thomas Hawk</a>\n</p>\n\n<p>When&#39;s the last time you used a pay phone? For me, it&#39;s been over a decade—which is about how long I&#39;ve had a cell phone.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/nyregion/19phones.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print\">pay phones have been disappearing</a> for awhile now. Why? Because pay phones are expensive to keep in working order. If more and more people have wireless phones, it&#39;s less likely that any particular pay phone will result in value for the phone company.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-what\">So what?</h3>\n<p>The reason I&#39;m thinking about this is that I&#39;m troubled by a few bugs I ran into in Bugzilla:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622051\">Remove support for microsummaries</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622045\">Remove smart bookmarks support</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622047\">Remove support for tagging bookmarks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049\">Get rid of livemark support</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Are these like pay phones? </p>\n<p>Each one requires engineering effort to keep working from release to release in Firefox. Some of them have issues in performance and functionality that could use some attention. And, the introduction of <a href=\"https://services.mozilla.com/\">Firefox Sync</a>, for example, introduces some new complexities in tracking changes.</p>\n<p>But, do any of these features provide enough value to justify continued attention?</p>\n<h3 id=\"microsummaries\">Microsummaries</h3>\n<p>Ever heard of <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries\">microsummaries</a>? I have, and I thought they&#39;d be neat. I installed a plugin on my blog to offer a microsummary, and I tried hacking them into Delicious at one point during a Hack Day. </p>\n<p>That was about 4 years ago, and I haven&#39;t thought about them much since. Sounds like a pay phone to me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"smart-bookmarks\">Smart Bookmarks</h3>\n<p>I always wondered how those out-of-box &quot;Recently Bookmarked&quot;, &quot;Recent Tags&quot;, and &quot;Most Visited&quot; folders worked in Firefox. Turns out that you can bookmark <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Places_query_uris\">queries against the internal Places database</a> as a persistent search folder. Seems pretty keen.</p>\n<p>But, I&#39;ve been using Firefox for years and only just learned about this in the past month. The feature&#39;s not very exposed, and it&#39;s not obvious how to use it. In fact, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622045#c0\">the bug to remove it might list the clearest hints on using it</a>.</p>\n<p>Seems like it might be a good feature to jettison into an add-on, like a pay phone to play with in your basement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tagging-bookmarks\">Tagging Bookmarks</h3>\n<p>This is a no-brainer for me: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470037857?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;%0D%0Acreative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470037857\">I like tagging my bookmarks</a>. The problem is that I&#39;ve exceeded 16,000 bookmarks. It&#39;s been years since any browser coped well with my corpus of bookmarks—that&#39;s one of the reasons I started really liking Delicious.</p>\n<p>However, tagging bookmarks in Firefox is kind of rough. The UI isn&#39;t awesome, and the database supporting it could use some work. Rather than improve things, though, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622047\">bug 622047</a> proposes removing the functionality altogether.</p>\n<p>Here, I&#39;m conflicted: I don&#39;t use tags in Firefox, because I don&#39;t use bookmarks in Firefox. If they worked better, I might use them. Instead, I use <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">pinboard.in</a> or a private Delicious clone of my own that copes with my scale—in fact, I got to this scale because those services handle it. So, usage data from me would support the feature&#39;s removal despite what I think I&#39;d like to see.</p>\n<p>But, does my <em>suspicion</em> that I would use a feature justify someone else&#39;s time in making it better? I don&#39;t think I can ask for that with a straight face. </p>\n<p>Put another way, I could see how that pay phone they removed from the corner gas station could someday come in handy, but should I expect the phone company to keep it clear of graffiti until I come along with quarters?</p>\n<h3 id=\"livemarks\">Livemarks</h3>\n<p>Live Bookmarks (or Livemarks) are bookmark folders whose contents are generated from RSS and Atom feeds periodically polled by Firefox. They&#39;re feed subscriptions, built into the browser.</p>\n<p>So, when I saw <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049\" title=\"Get rid of livemark support\">bug 622049</a>, my first thought was &quot;<strong>Hey! I&#39;m using those!</strong>&quot; </p>\n<p>I just spent a week building an <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/27/introducing-fireriver-a-river-of-news-for-firefox-4\">add-on powered by Livemarks</a>. I&#39;ve been using <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireriver/\">Fireriver</a> on a daily basis, and I&#39;ve been thinking about trying more experiments. But, if livemarks are going away, then <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c11\">I&#39;m working toward a dead end</a>.</p>\n<p>Like tagging bookmarks, the UI and feed polling code behind livemarks could use some work. My add-on was an attempt to improve the interface, but I did <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=629742\">report a bug</a> on performance issues raised by my import of around 700 subscriptions from Google Reader. That&#39;s just one more strike against livemarks for <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049\" title=\"Get rid of livemark support\">bug 622049</a>.</p>\n<p>In the end, if livemarks go away <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/shared/l.m.orchard\">I&#39;d still have Google Reader</a>. I&#39;ll have blown a week or so on this add-on, though I did learn some interesting things. And, if Google Reader goes away, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764597582?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;c%0D%0Areative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0764597582\">it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve never written a feed reader before</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, this one bothers me the most, in terms of what I want to see for the web itself. <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/27/what-should-be-done-about-feeds-in-browsers\">This is better explored in another blog post</a>, but I want my browser to do more of the surfing for me. I think of bookmarks as long-term relationships to web resources—and livemarks turn those static links into live updates. I can think of a lot of uses for this functionality built into the browser, rather than delegated to <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848\">lobster traps</a> and content silos.</p>\n<p>But, livemarks do complicate things for Firefox engineers. They don&#39;t interact well with Sync, and the feed polling code has cases where it can really drag down the whole browser. And, of course, livemarks aren&#39;t good for much when a laptop&#39;s closed or if Firefox isn&#39;t running. Granted, the former happens more often than the latter for me, but we&#39;re not talking about an always-on server here in any case.</p>\n<p>Are livemarks a pay phone feature? Personally, I don&#39;t think so. I think Firefox is diminished if it loses this feature, rather than taking it further.</p>\n<p>Although I&#39;m reticent to do so, I might just rebuild livemarks in some form with an add-on if they go away. The good news is that add-ons are getting easier to write, which also deserves its own blog post. The bad news is, I might not have time or motivation to do the work myself. But, either, I&#39;m not all that comfortable clamoring for other people&#39;s time for this <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c11\">beyond registering my disagreement</a> and <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c14\">backing off</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Most of these things do indeed look like pay phones to me.

I have bookmarks going back over a decade. Until about a year ago, they were a huge mess and nearly impossible to deal with. The big problem was that the folders were too restrictive and, so, the placement of many bookmarks was pretty arbitrary. So, I finally decided to go through every bookmark, delete all the useless stuff (the vast majority of bookmarks), and attach one or more tag to each bookmark. It took about a week. The result: the organization system now makes sense, and I have few enough bookmarks that I actually use them quite a lot. The problem is that the interface is designed for folders and not tags. I cannot drill down tags like I can with folders. Tags don’t appear in the bookmarks menu like folders. I had to create smart bookmarks to work around this limitation. Even with these artificial limitations in the interface, tags are <em>much</em> more humane than folders.</p>\n<p>My suggestion: deprecate folders altogether. In a future version of Firefox, migrate everyone to tags by converting them to tags. Moreover, fix the interface so as to make sense for tags instead of folders. Do that, and you’ll find that people start using tags. I agree that it’s kind of overkill to have both folders and tags. But the solution is to get rid of the archaic system of forced hierarchy (folders) and give tags the chance they deserve (by greatly improving the tagging interface).</p></div>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085116\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085116\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T07:40:18\">2011-02-07T07:40:18</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>FWIW, if I used bookmarks in Firefox, this is exactly what I'd do.

Throughout FF4's development it's felt like any new team or project can make drastic changes to the browser with seemingly flimsy justification (see the UI team's constant fiddling with a stable interface to save miniscule amounts of vertical space and emulate Chrome's aesthetic). Sync is a nice feature but it needs time to bake just like everything else; we shouldn't rip out other features that have existed for years to prop up something unproven.</p>\n<p>In some ways I think the Test Pilot program has been dangerous; the statistics gathered tend to result in design decisions that favour the tyranny of the majority while breaking long-term usage patterns employed by smaller groups (\"power users\" as they're affectionately called, also known as Firefox's Chief Proponents). This popularist-majority mindset can be seen in the design decisions regarding the status bar, tab positioning, the hiding of the bookmark bar on first launch after upgrade and the new awful addons manager.</p>\n<p>It's also lame to see it argued on the bugtracker that tags should be stored in the cloud but that we shouldn't use the new feature that does exactly that to put them there. Who knows which direction Sync will go a year after release? Maybe we'll gain the ability to set bookmarks public and browse them on a website like Delicious... surely we'll need the tag info then.</p>\n<p>One last thing: this may be a little snarky, but if a major argument for removing tagging support is an underexposed and unpolished UI then Sync is doomed. A menu entry that shows a dialog with no description of the feature isn't the best way to sell it.

Sync is a nice feature but it needs time to bake just like everything else; we shouldn't rip out other features that have existed for years to prop up something unproven.</p>\n<p>In some ways I think the Test Pilot program has been dangerous; the statistics gathered tend to result in design decisions that favour the tyranny of the majority while breaking long-term usage patterns employed by smaller groups (\"power users\" as they're affectionately called, also known as Firefox's Chief Proponents). This popularist-majority mindset can be seen in the design decisions regarding the status bar, tab positioning, the hiding of the bookmark bar on first launch after upgrade and the new awful addons manager.</p>\n<p>It's also lame to see it argued on the bugtracker that tags should be stored in the cloud but that we shouldn't use the new feature that does exactly that to put them there. Who knows which direction Sync will go in a year after release? Maybe we'll gain the ability to set bookmarks public and browse them on a website like Delicious... surely we'll need the tag info then.</p>\n<p>One last thing: this may be a little snarky, but if a major argument for removing tagging support is an underexposed and unpolished UI then Sync is doomed. A menu entry that shows a dialog with no description of the feature isn't the best way to sell it. I still don't have a clue whether it's working or not.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085128\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0f0f4e5c8446a0f6fd5bd888760eee02&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Benedikt P.</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085128\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T12:55:49\">2011-02-07T12:55:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>My bookmarks are organized in a rather flat manner with little to no sub-folders.Being able to tag a bookmark and search and save the searchs (Smartbookmarks?) are much more useful to me.

I don't know where it would show up in my web browser.  I had to Google to find The MozillaWiki describing them as \"Microsummaries are better for labeling bookmarks than static page titles, because they give users quicker access to the most interesting information behind a bookmark, and they give web sites a way to notify users of updates and entice them to revisit the site.\"  If you have your bookmarks open constantly, and are monitoring something, then sure that would be helpful.  But usually if we want real-time monitoring of something, there are other methods that we use.  We have moved to increasing screen real-estate, making tabs into just icons and hiding the bookmark toolbar.  </p>\n<p>I never got the hang of LiveMarks in the browser.  That definitely has a lot to do with UI.  But trying to turn a web browser into a full-fledged feed-reader, as part of the core technology, isn't the right direction.  There are addons, websites, and stand-alone readers that do a much better job.  The more RSS feeds you subscribe to, it quickly overwhelms the basics.  Personally, I do like having the little orange button in my URL bar to subscribe (I have it auto-routing to Google Reader), but that's mostly because it provides a fast way to subscribe instead of me hunting for a link.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Smart Bookmarks and Tags have a lot of potential, especially as the volume of bookmarks grows.  I don't use either of them, but I wouldn't want to see them gone.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085135\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ff6fac10b30d4f19bc083164c4c9b328&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Gruber</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085135\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T14:35:08\">2011-02-07T14:35:08</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>One more thing, I wonder if these arguments against these \"pay phones\" could/will also be made for Panorama and Tab Groups, I personally wouldn't shed a tear for it.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085138\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5406d41679a6d770aac64a86a1d1c815&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">augustm</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085138\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T19:16:39\">2011-02-07T19:16:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Firstly SQL has been broken in Firefox 3.6.x and 4.0b since the summer.\nIt makes searching on tags in bookmarks almost impossible. \nSo tags are mostly broken.

It sat in my wallet for years until the day my cellphone battery died and all I had was my WIFI iPad. I looked up her phone number in my contacts and called her from the nearest payphone though it was a struggle to find the payphone in one of the most modern building complexes here in Tokyo.</p>\n<p>Another payphone story that came to mind was shortly after the recent Earthquake. Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people walked home. Some walking several hours. In my short walk to camp out a nearby friend's house, I saw people queuing up for payphones after their mobile phones had become unusable due to the mobile network congestion. The line to use the payphone was hundreds of people long. I'm sure that the maximum queue length at that phone in the previous 10 years was 2 people. This experience changed my mind. </p>\n<p>There are much fewer payphones than their heyday 15 years ago when we had payphones with ISDN jacks to plug in your laptop. It is difficult to find one now. Also, payphones are clunky and in Tokyo at least, very reliable. They are going to work, if nothing else works.</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

But, if you feel strongly about these features, you might get a better discussion with more people on [this thread from the `mozilla.dev.apps.firefox` newsgroup (in Google Groups)](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_thread/thread/fa6f83e781b962a4).</em>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"display: block; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; float:right;\">\r\n<a style=\"display: block;\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/4925985819/\" title=\"Phone Don't Work No More by Thomas Hawk, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4925985819_9ccbb166f7.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Phone Don't Work No More\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/4925985819/\">Phone Don't Work No More</a> by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/\">Thomas Hawk</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWhen's the last time you used a pay phone? For me, it's been over a decade—which is about how long I've had a cell phone.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, [pay phones have been disappearing][pay phones disappear] for awhile now. Why? Because pay phones are expensive to keep in working order. If more and more people have wireless phones, it's less likely that any particular pay phone will result in value for the phone company.\r\n\r\n[pay phones disappear]: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/nyregion/19phones.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print\r\n\r\n### So what?\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm thinking about this is that I'm troubled by a few bugs I ran into in Bugzilla:\r\n\r\n* [Remove support for microsummaries](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622051)\r\n* [Remove smart bookmarks support](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622045)\r\n* [Remove support for tagging bookmarks](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622047)\r\n* [Get rid of livemark support](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049)\r\n\r\nAre these like pay phones? \r\n\r\nEach one requires engineering effort to keep working from release to release in Firefox. Some of them have issues in performance and functionality that could use some attention. And, the introduction of [Firefox Sync][], for example, introduces some new complexities in tracking changes.\r\n\r\n[Firefox Sync]: https://services.mozilla.com/\r\n\r\nBut, do any of these features provide enough value to justify continued attention?\r\n\r\n### Microsummaries\r\n\r\nEver heard of [microsummaries][]? I have, and I thought they'd be neat. I installed a plugin on my blog to offer a microsummary, and I tried hacking them into Delicious at one point during a Hack Day. \r\n\r\nThat was about 4 years ago, and I haven't thought about them much since. Sounds like a pay phone to me.\r\n\r\n[microsummaries]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries\r\n\r\n### Smart Bookmarks\r\n\r\nI always wondered how those out-of-box \"Recently Bookmarked\", \"Recent Tags\", and \"Most Visited\" folders worked in Firefox. Turns out that you can bookmark [queries against the internal Places database][placesuri] as a persistent search folder. Seems pretty keen.\r\n\r\n[placesuri]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Places_query_uris\r\n\r\nBut, I've been using Firefox for years and only just learned about this in the past month. The feature's not very exposed, and it's not obvious how to use it. In fact, [the bug to remove it might list the clearest hints on using it](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622045#c0).\r\n\r\nSeems like it might be a good feature to jettison into an add-on, like a pay phone to play with in your basement.\r\n\r\n### Tagging Bookmarks\r\n\r\nThis is a no-brainer for me: [I like tagging my bookmarks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470037857?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&%0D%0Acreative=9325&creativeASIN=0470037857). The problem is that I've exceeded 16,000 bookmarks. It's been years since any browser coped well with my corpus of bookmarks—that's one of the reasons I started really liking Delicious.\r\n\r\nHowever, tagging bookmarks in Firefox is kind of rough. The UI isn't awesome, and the database supporting it could use some work. Rather than improve things, though, [bug 622047](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622047) proposes removing the functionality altogether.\r\n\r\nHere, I'm conflicted: I don't use tags in Firefox, because I don't use bookmarks in Firefox. If they worked better, I might use them. Instead, I use [pinboard.in](http://pinboard.in/u:deusx) or a private Delicious clone of my own that copes with my scale—in fact, I got to this scale because those services handle it. So, usage data from me would support the feature's removal despite what I think I'd like to see.\r\n\r\nBut, does my *suspicion* that I would use a feature justify someone else's time in making it better? I don't think I can ask for that with a straight face. \r\n\r\nPut another way, I could see how that pay phone they removed from the corner gas station could someday come in handy, but should I expect the phone company to keep it clear of graffiti until I come along with quarters?\r\n\r\n### Livemarks\r\n\r\nLive Bookmarks (or Livemarks) are bookmark folders whose contents are generated from RSS and Atom feeds periodically polled by Firefox. They're feed subscriptions, built into the browser.\r\n\r\nSo, when I saw [bug 622049][], my first thought was \"**Hey! I'm using those!**\" \r\n\r\nI just spent a week building an [add-on powered by Livemarks][fireriver]. I've been using [Fireriver](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireriver/) on a daily basis, and I've been thinking about trying more experiments. But, if livemarks are going away, then [I'm working toward a dead end][deadend].\r\n\r\n[deadend]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c11\r\n[fireriver]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/27/introducing-fireriver-a-river-of-news-for-firefox-4\r\n\r\nLike tagging bookmarks, the UI and feed polling code behind livemarks could use some work. My add-on was an attempt to improve the interface, but I did [report a bug][bug 629742] on performance issues raised by my import of around 700 subscriptions from Google Reader. That's just one more strike against livemarks for [bug 622049][].\r\n\r\n[bug 629742]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=629742\r\n[bug 622049]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049 \"Get rid of livemark support\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, if livemarks go away [I'd still have Google Reader][mygr]. I'll have blown a week or so on this add-on, though I did learn some interesting things. And, if Google Reader goes away, [it's not like I've never written a feed reader before][rssbook].\r\n\r\n[mygr]: http://www.google.com/reader/shared/l.m.orchard\r\n[rssbook]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764597582?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&c%0D%0Areative=9325&creativeASIN=0764597582\r\n\r\nStill, this one bothers me the most, in terms of what I want to see for the web itself. [This is better explored in another blog post][browserfeeds], but I want my browser to do more of the surfing for me. I think of bookmarks as long-term relationships to web resources—and livemarks turn those static links into live updates. I can think of a lot of uses for this functionality built into the browser, rather than delegated to [lobster traps][] and content silos.\r\n\r\n[browserfeeds]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/27/what-should-be-done-about-feeds-in-browsers\r\n[lobster traps]: http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848\r\n\r\nBut, livemarks do complicate things for Firefox engineers. They don't interact well with Sync, and the feed polling code has cases where it can really drag down the whole browser. And, of course, livemarks aren't good for much when a laptop's closed or if Firefox isn't running. Granted, the former happens more often than the latter for me, but we're not talking about an always-on server here in any case.\r\n\r\nAre livemarks a pay phone feature? Personally, I don't think so. I think Firefox is diminished if it loses this feature, rather than taking it further.\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm reticent to do so, I might just rebuild livemarks in some form with an add-on if they go away. The good news is that add-ons are getting easier to write, which also deserves its own blog post. The bad news is, I might not have time or motivation to do the work myself. But, either, I'm not all that comfortable clamoring for other people's time for this [beyond registering my disagreement](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c11) and [backing off](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622049#c14).\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nMost of these things do indeed look like pay phones to me. Most of them seem not to offer enough value to pay for upkeep. \r\n\r\nLivemarks are the exception, in my mind, but I don't have answers as to how to fix their flaws. Maybe they're inherently doomed in the face of ubiquitous computing, maybe they're just in need of a better execution. But, I won't expect other busy engineers to drop what they're doing to come up with those answers in the meantime.\r\n\r\n**Update:** <em>Feel free to comment on this blog post.

I have bookmarks going back over a decade. Until about a year ago, they were a huge mess and nearly impossible to deal with. The big problem was that the folders were too restrictive and, so, the placement of many bookmarks was pretty arbitrary. So, I finally decided to go through every bookmark, delete all the useless stuff (the vast majority of bookmarks), and attach one or more tag to each bookmark. It took about a week. The result: the organization system now makes sense, and I have few enough bookmarks that I actually use them quite a lot. The problem is that the interface is designed for folders and not tags. I cannot drill down tags like I can with folders. Tags don’t appear in the bookmarks menu like folders. I had to create smart bookmarks to work around this limitation. Even with these artificial limitations in the interface, tags are <em>much</em> more humane than folders.</p>\n\n<p>My suggestion: deprecate folders altogether. In a future version of Firefox, migrate everyone to tags by converting them to tags. Moreover, fix the interface so as to make sense for tags instead of folders. Do that, and you’ll find that people start using tags. I agree that it’s kind of overkill to have both folders and tags. But the solution is to get rid of the archaic system of forced hierarchy (folders) and give tags the chance they deserve (by greatly improving the tagging interface).</p></div>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085116\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085116\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T07:40:18\">2011-02-07T07:40:18</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>FWIW, if I used bookmarks in Firefox, this is exactly what I'd do.

I don't know where it would show up in my web browser.  I had to Google to find The MozillaWiki describing them as \"Microsummaries are better for labeling bookmarks than static page titles, because they give users quicker access to the most interesting information behind a bookmark, and they give web sites a way to notify users of updates and entice them to revisit the site.\"  If you have your bookmarks open constantly, and are monitoring something, then sure that would be helpful.  But usually if we want real-time monitoring of something, there are other methods that we use.  We have moved to increasing screen real-estate, making tabs into just icons and hiding the bookmark toolbar.  </p>\n\n<p>I never got the hang of LiveMarks in the browser.  That definitely has a lot to do with UI.  But trying to turn a web browser into a full-fledged feed-reader, as part of the core technology, isn't the right direction.  There are addons, websites, and stand-alone readers that do a much better job.  The more RSS feeds you subscribe to, it quickly overwhelms the basics.  Personally, I do like having the little orange button in my URL bar to subscribe (I have it auto-routing to Google Reader), but that's mostly because it provides a fast way to subscribe instead of me hunting for a link.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, Smart Bookmarks and Tags have a lot of potential, especially as the volume of bookmarks grows.  I don't use either of them, but I wouldn't want to see them gone.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085135\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ff6fac10b30d4f19bc083164c4c9b328&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Gruber</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085135\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T14:35:08\">2011-02-07T14:35:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>One more thing, I wonder if these arguments against these \"pay phones\" could/will also be made for Panorama and Tab Groups, I personally wouldn't shed a tear for it.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085138\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5406d41679a6d770aac64a86a1d1c815&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">augustm</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085138\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-02-07T19:16:39\">2011-02-07T19:16:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Firstly SQL has been broken in Firefox 3.6.x and 4.0b since the summer.\nIt makes searching on tags in bookmarks almost impossible. \nSo tags are mostly broken.

It's somewhat difficult to create microsummaries or smart bookmarks (as a user, without the web site supporting it).  Tags are easy to create, but are presented everywhere as a single list, which makes large numbers of them infeasible (rather than something closer to a tag cloud).  Livemarks... well, they basically have no useful way of showing the summary, just... half a headline :p  Only if it actually opened the feed preview page rather than a useless dropdown...</p>\n\n<p>As I understand it, it's mostly things getting cut to make the release, then... well, just getting dropped on the floor once the release is out, really.  There's never a focus on polishing things.  But that's pretty much true of all the projects I've looked close enough at, sadly.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder which ones would be next?  Devtools, with the backend sticking around for Firebug? More changes to the URL display on hovering links?

It sat in my wallet for years until the day my cellphone battery died and all I had was my WIFI iPad. I looked up her phone number in my contacts and called her from the nearest payphone though it was a struggle to find the payphone in one of the most modern building complexes here in Tokyo.</p>\n\n<p>Another payphone story that came to mind was shortly after the recent Earthquake. Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people walked home. Some walking several hours. In my short walk to camp out a nearby friend's house, I saw people queuing up for payphones after their mobile phones had become unusable due to the mobile network congestion. The line to use the payphone was hundreds of people long. I'm sure that the maximum queue length at that phone in the previous 10 years was 2 people. This experience changed my mind. </p>\n\n<p>There are much fewer payphones than their heyday 15 years ago when we had payphones with ISDN jacks to plug in your laptop. It is difficult to find one now. Also, payphones are clunky and in Tokyo at least, very reliable. They are going to work, if nothing else works.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>Browsers need help doing a better job using feeds for discovery, aggregation, and publishing on the web to keep us from swimming into self-destructing lobster traps.</em></p>\n<p>Last week, I wrote <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967\">some blog posts</a> about <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967\">Bug 578967</a>, wherein the feed auto-discovery icon in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">Firefox 4</a> has been moved off the URL bar and hidden by default. I support that decision of <a href=\"http://planet.firefox.com/ux/\">the UX team</a>, because <a href=\"https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/\">that feed button is a slacker</a>. And even if it does get used, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/what-happened-to-feed-autodiscovery-in-firefox-4#serving\">I&#39;m not a fan of what it does anyway</a>.</p>\n<p>But, I&#39;ve got lots more rattling around in my head about this stuff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-the-point-of-feeds\">What&#39;s the point of feeds?</h3>\n<p>Feeds—that&#39;s RSS and Atom and maybe even JSON—let robots pull lots of stuff from a bunch of places and pile it all together in one spot for your perusal, analysis, and remixing pleasure. Feed readers and news aggregators do the surfing for you, so you don&#39;t have to.</p>\n<p>But, Twitter and Facebook and others have managed to make <em>the people themselves</em> all gather in one spot. So, to see what those people are saying and doing, you just have to go <em>there</em>—kind of like what feeds promised, right? Only, you go <em>there</em> rather than all that stuff coming <em>here</em>.</p>\n<p>The problem is, even if the logo says it <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dunstan/524137648/\">loves you</a>, the people who made it say that <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/\">won&#39;t always stay in charge</a>. And, someday, when whomever&#39;s left rides off into the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/\">sunset</a>, you&#39;ll learn how much <a href=\"http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Why_Back_Up%3F\">they didn&#39;t care about you</a> in the end.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/herzogbr/2261662706/\" title=\"Flickr Loves You by herzogbr, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2003/2261662706_db086ea4bb_m.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"64\" alt=\"Flickr Loves You\" /></a> <strong style=\"font-size: 200%; padding: 0.5em;\">vs</strong> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/en-us/flickr-yahoo-logo.png\" height=\"50\" style=\"padding: 7px; background: #fff\"></a></p>\n\n<p>For some people and some places, that&#39;s no big tragedy. It&#39;s just a party; you go home when it&#39;s over. You made memories, you hope to find some of those people again elsewhere. <a href=\"http://blog.pownce.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-hello-six-apart/\">Pownce croaked</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/09/six-apart-shuts-down-vox/\">so did Vox</a>, but who cares? There&#39;s always Twitter next door for the afterparty.</p>\n<p>But, what if a world you lived in <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2444\">evaporated while you were on vacation elsewhere for the holidays</a>? I guess you could say that was just a game and, again, who cares?</p>\n<p>What if <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a> went away just like that? People are not only partying there—they&#39;re leaving their visual memories at the coat check. Things are a little more real there, by some definitions thereof.</p>\n<p>What if you never swam into that <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848\">lobster trap</a>, though? What if your words and images and creations were borrowed and copied, but never wholly kept in someone else&#39;s bucket? What if <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a> were just like <a href=\"http://google.com\">Google Search</a>? That is, a collector and an index—but never the host—of photos and conversations?</p>\n<p>Feeds can help make that happen, but not by themselves.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-feeds-belong-in-the-browser\">Do feeds belong in the browser?</h3>\n<p>Well, yeah. Would sites like Twitter and Facebook have been as successful if feeds worked better in the browser? I think so. But, by working better, I don&#39;t just mean improvements to that funky blue thing that showed up in the location bar every now and then. No, I mean all of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Discovery</strong> — help me find and follow interesting people and things</li>\n<li><strong>Aggregation</strong> — give me one spot where what I find and follow is delivered to me</li>\n<li><strong>Publishing</strong> — enable me to post things where people (and their agents) can find and follow</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To me, this is where Twitter and Facebook are totally nailing it. But, much of this can happen in the browser, and I think more of it should. Projects like <a href=\"http://www.rockmelt.com/\">RockMelt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flock.com/\">Flock</a> have seemed promising to me in this context, but have yet to really thrill me. I don&#39;t think they go far enough.</p>\n<p>There is a point where the rubber (client) meets the road (server)—but that point can live <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/howToShareABucketOnS3.html\">so much farther down the stack than it does now</a>. Mind you, I don&#39;t want a revival of <a href=\"http://www.zisman.ca/netgold/\">Netscape Gold</a> as such—but recall that <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm\">&quot;the first browser was an editor, it was a writer as well as a reader&quot;</a>.</p>\n<p>We need some services and hosts out there as rendezvous points for our browsers and agents, but we really don&#39;t need any of those services to collapse into <a href=\"http://buddycloud.com/cms/content/we-are-aol-days-social-networking\">the next all-encompassing AOL-style singularity</a>. There&#39;s money to be made there, but most of us are the product.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whose-job-is-it-anyway\">Whose job is it anyway?</h3>\n<p>I&#39;d like to see my employer, Mozilla, do more with feeds in the browser—and I suspect we will. <a href=\"http://mozillalabs.com/blog/2010/03/online-identity-concept-series/\">Mozilla Labs has had some interesting Concept Series topics</a>, and I look forward to seeing some of those things get pursued further. If I can carve out the time, I wouldn&#39;t mind helping.</p>\n<p>Something I find interesting about feed auto-discovery—the thing that started this latest round of buzz—is that it didn&#39;t originate with browser makers. <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery\">RSS auto-discovery</a> was itself discovered <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/31/oooago\">by bloggers</a>, way back in 2002. It wasn&#39;t until we sussed out the details of that <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links\">HTML link tag</a> and shoved it into our pages that browsers like Firefox started looking for it.</p>\n<p>Hell, even though <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss#History\">RSS started with Netscape</a>, it took <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss.html\">Dave Winer and UserLand and friends running with it</a> to keep it alive and kicking. Now, Dave&#39;s <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/krocCamenProvesRssIsVeryMu.html\">suggested forking an open source browser</a> to show Mozilla how it&#39;s done. I support the sentiment, but there are easier ways to go about this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"making-it-your-job\">Making it your job</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply\">Christopher Blizzard</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>We created add-ons with the original Firefox as a way to be able to say “no” in a constructive manner. If you want something that you think is important to you, you can make an add-on.</blockquote>\n\n<p>That could be taken as a cop-out, but it&#39;s not. With the efforts behind <a href=\"https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/\">Jetpack</a>—now just <em>the</em> <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/12/09/announcing-add-on-sdk-1-0b1/\">Add-on SDK</a>—building add-ons for Firefox is being made easier. Rather than dealing with a morass of XUL and obscure APIs that I know has scared me personally away all these years, you can now do most everything you&#39;d like though <a href=\"https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/sdk/1.0b1/docs/#package/addon-kit\">much-simplified JavaScript APIs</a> and HTML/CSS.</p>\n<p>In other words, if you are a web developer—albeit a fairly advanced one—you can make an add-on for Firefox. Hopefully, as the Add-on SDK advances, the bar to participation will continue to drop.</p>\n<h3 id=\"to-be-continued\">To be continued</h3>\n<p>I&#39;m running out of steam and it&#39;s time for bed, so I think I&#39;ll just trail off for now. I do have a bit more in me, though. The next thing is about taking my own advice in that last section and making some of this <em>my</em> job to fix.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086137\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=52674e2ce2d7671878b26ed534b0c662&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Majken \"Lucy\" Connor</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T06:38:04\">2011-01-27T06:38:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Yay!</p>\n<p>Feeds are soo soo soooo great, but not as live bookmarks. Google Reader is the place to be in terms of functionality, but there's no reason I have to put everything through google.</p>\n<p>When I find a site I like, why should I have to go to it to check for new content? A feed reader brings it to <em>me</em> AND it remembers where I was. I've been trying to get my kids hooked on it, though they seem to forget about it.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the kids, their teachers are getting all technical and they post the homework online, but I've been pulling my hair out for 2 years trying to get them to do it in a way that enables feeds. Several nights it happened that they didn't write down what they had and then we had to remember to check periodically because the homework wasn't updated right away.  </p>\n<p>Right now they're sent home with books with it all written down and I'm supposed to sign that I saw it, but who remembers to look at a book all the time? It's such a complicated process - kids have to write it down in the first place, then one of us has to remember to show it to me. FEEDS!!! No one has to remember, it just shows up where I'm already looking!</p>\n<p>So glad you're on board.</p></div>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086159\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086159\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T20:54:22\">2011-01-27T20:54:22</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Not sure if the homework lists online are behind a login or not, but if it's in HTML we can hack a feed out of it :)</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086141\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=adfd6aa4efe2aa64f5e091abf07f2766&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Bee</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086141\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T08:13:46\">2011-01-27T08:13:46</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>\"Discovery — help me find and follow interesting people and things\nAggregation — give me one spot where what I find and follow is delivered to me\nPublishing — enable me to post things where people (and their agents) can find and follow\"\n..

You'd think that would be a simple and obvious thing that would just work, but even by hooking the two together with a selection of Heath Robinson-style scripts, it's still never been possible to get them to play nicely.</p></div>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086149\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086149\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T15:06:57\">2011-01-27T15:06:57</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>That's a good point - a lot of this falls under the bailiwick of Mozilla Messaging, who work on Thunderbird.

Or, at least, finding someone to run it for you who cares about keeping it up, whether through direct payment or other direct incentive (ie. they're family or friends). Otherwise, you still have the problem where what they care about doesn't match what you care about (eg. ad supported services).\n</p><p>But, with the way the user agent picture is splitting up across devices (eg. the cloud, ambient computing), I don't think Firefox will ever be the server.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>Browsers need help doing a better job using feeds for discovery, aggregation, and publishing on the web to keep us from swimming into self-destructing lobster traps.</em>\r\n\r\nLast week, I wrote [some blog posts](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discovery icon in [Firefox 4](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been moved off the URL bar and hidden by default. I support that decision of [the UX team](http://planet.firefox.com/ux/), because [that feed button is a slacker](https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/). And even if it does get used, [I'm not a fan of what it does anyway](http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/what-happened-to-feed-autodiscovery-in-firefox-4#serving).\r\n\r\nBut, I've got lots more rattling around in my head about this stuff.\r\n\r\n### What's the point of feeds?\r\n\r\nFeeds—that's RSS and Atom and maybe even JSON—let robots pull lots of stuff from a bunch of places and pile it all together in one spot for your perusal, analysis, and remixing pleasure. Feed readers and news aggregators do the surfing for you, so you don't have to.\r\n\r\nBut, Twitter and Facebook and others have managed to make *the people themselves* all gather in one spot. So, to see what those people are saying and doing, you just have to go *there*—kind of like what feeds promised, right? Only, you go *there* rather than all that stuff coming *here*.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, even if the logo says it [loves you](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dunstan/524137648/), the people who made it say that [won't always stay in charge](http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/). And, someday, when whomever's left rides off into the [sunset](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/), you'll learn how much [they didn't care about you](http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Why_Back_Up%3F) in the end.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/herzogbr/2261662706/\" title=\"Flickr Loves You by herzogbr, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2003/2261662706_db086ea4bb_m.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"64\" alt=\"Flickr Loves You\" /></a> <strong style=\"font-size: 200%; padding: 0.5em;\">vs</strong> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/107408/\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/g/images/en-us/flickr-yahoo-logo.png\" height=\"50\" style=\"padding: 7px; background: #fff\"></a></p>\r\n\r\nFor some people and some places, that's no big tragedy. It's just a party; you go home when it's over. You made memories, you hope to find some of those people again elsewhere. [Pownce croaked](http://blog.pownce.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-hello-six-apart/), and [so did Vox](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/09/six-apart-shuts-down-vox/), but who cares? There's always Twitter next door for the afterparty.\r\n\r\nBut, what if a world you lived in [evaporated while you were on vacation elsewhere for the holidays](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2444)? I guess you could say that was just a game and, again, who cares?\r\n\r\nWhat if [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) went away just like that? People are not only partying there—they're leaving their visual memories at the coat check. Things are a little more real there, by some definitions thereof.\r\n\r\nWhat if you never swam into that [lobster trap](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848), though? What if your words and images and creations were borrowed and copied, but never wholly kept in someone else's bucket? What if [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) were just like [Google Search](http://google.com)? That is, a collector and an index—but never the host—of photos and conversations?\r\n\r\nFeeds can help make that happen, but not by themselves.\r\n\r\n### Do feeds belong in the browser?\r\n\r\nWell, yeah. Would sites like Twitter and Facebook have been as successful if feeds worked better in the browser? I think so. But, by working better, I don't just mean improvements to that funky blue thing that showed up in the location bar every now and then. No, I mean all of the following:\r\n\r\n* **Discovery** — help me find and follow interesting people and things\r\n* **Aggregation** — give me one spot where what I find and follow is delivered to me\r\n* **Publishing** — enable me to post things where people (and their agents) can find and follow\r\n\r\nTo me, this is where Twitter and Facebook are totally nailing it. But, much of this can happen in the browser, and I think more of it should. Projects like [RockMelt](http://www.rockmelt.com/) and [Flock](http://www.flock.com/) have seemed promising to me in this context, but have yet to really thrill me. I don't think they go far enough.\r\n\r\nThere is a point where the rubber (client) meets the road (server)—but that point can live [so much farther down the stack than it does now](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/howToShareABucketOnS3.html). Mind you, I don't want a revival of [Netscape Gold](http://www.zisman.ca/netgold/) as such—but recall that [\"the first browser was an editor, it was a writer as well as a reader\"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm).\r\n\r\nWe need some services and hosts out there as rendezvous points for our browsers and agents, but we really don't need any of those services to collapse into [the next all-encompassing AOL-style singularity](http://buddycloud.com/cms/content/we-are-aol-days-social-networking). There's money to be made there, but most of us are the product.\r\n\r\n### Whose job is it anyway?\r\n\r\nI'd like to see my employer, Mozilla, do more with feeds in the browser—and I suspect we will. [Mozilla Labs has had some interesting Concept Series topics](http://mozillalabs.com/blog/2010/03/online-identity-concept-series/), and I look forward to seeing some of those things get pursued further. If I can carve out the time, I wouldn't mind helping.\r\n\r\nSomething I find interesting about feed auto-discovery—the thing that started this latest round of buzz—is that it didn't originate with browser makers. [RSS auto-discovery](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery) was itself discovered [by bloggers](http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/31/oooago), way back in 2002. It wasn't until we sussed out the details of that [HTML link tag](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links) and shoved it into our pages that browsers like Firefox started looking for it.\r\n\r\nHell, even though [RSS started with Netscape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss#History), it took [Dave Winer and UserLand and friends running with it](http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss.html) to keep it alive and kicking. Now, Dave's [suggested forking an open source browser](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/11/krocCamenProvesRssIsVeryMu.html) to show Mozilla how it's done. I support the sentiment, but there are easier ways to go about this.\r\n\r\n### Making it your job\r\n\r\n[Christopher Blizzard](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply):\r\n<blockquote>We created add-ons with the original Firefox as a way to be able to say “no” in a constructive manner. If you want something that you think is important to you, you can make an add-on.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat could be taken as a cop-out, but it's not. With the efforts behind [Jetpack](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/)—now just *the* [Add-on SDK](http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/12/09/announcing-add-on-sdk-1-0b1/)—building add-ons for Firefox is being made easier. Rather than dealing with a morass of XUL and obscure APIs that I know has scared me personally away all these years, you can now do most everything you'd like though [much-simplified JavaScript APIs](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/sdk/1.0b1/docs/#package/addon-kit) and HTML/CSS.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if you are a web developer—albeit a fairly advanced one—you can make an add-on for Firefox. Hopefully, as the Add-on SDK advances, the bar to participation will continue to drop.\r\n\r\n### To be continued\r\n\r\nI'm running out of steam and it's time for bed, so I think I'll just trail off for now. I do have a bit more in me, though. The next thing is about taking my own advice in that last section and making some of this *my* job to fix.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086137\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=52674e2ce2d7671878b26ed534b0c662&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Majken \"Lucy\" Connor</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086137\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T06:38:04\">2011-01-27T06:38:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Yay!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feeds are soo soo soooo great, but not as live bookmarks.

No one has to remember, it just shows up where I'm already looking!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So glad you're on board.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086159\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086159\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T20:54:22\">2011-01-27T20:54:22</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Not sure if the homework lists online are behind a login or not, but if it's in HTML we can hack a feed out of it :)</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086141\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=adfd6aa4efe2aa64f5e091abf07f2766&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Bee</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086141\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-27T08:13:46\">2011-01-27T08:13:46</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>\"Discovery — help me find and follow interesting people and things\r\nAggregation — give me one spot where what I find and follow is delivered to me\r\nPublishing — enable me to post things where people (and their agents) can find and follow\"\r\n..

Whats your opinion on FF (and other browsers) handling of the direct feed url?\r\nI've long wanted browsers to back off from forcing their own baked-in handling (stylesheets, functionality etc).\r\nI've just wanted the simple alert dialog (now standardized for all alerts like geolocation, passwords etc) to appear when necessary before the browser takes over (Like you include with Fireriver auto-discovery).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The obvious example is when a feed specifies its own XSL stylesheet but FF ignores this instruction and the sniffer only cares about the presence of the &lt;rss or &lt;feed element before treating this &#039;document&#039; differently than any other XML document.  This can be overcome with some hacks but that is a moot point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally, the browser will adhere to the content publisher&#039;s (or feed generator&#039;s) instructions on how to handle the presentation of the data.

You send a message to a server, which then sends it to their server, and eventually their mail client picks it up. There are intermediaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BitTorrent relies on trackers (ie. rendezvous points) before you can start transferring chunks, though the distributed hash stuff helps get away from that. But, if all that were easy (including discovery), it would have taken off long, long ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can't go P2P for everything, at least not easily. Not every P is online at all times, so we need store-and-forward services. Some P's have multiple devices and agents, and most of those are behind firewalls and NAT. So, we need servers out there as accessible fixed points that are (mostly) always available. We can try to build P2P meshes that do the same thing, but servers are simpler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, yeah, I do believe that running your own server is the ultimate solution. Or, at least, finding someone to run it for you who cares about keeping it up, whether through direct payment or other direct incentive (ie. they're family or friends). Otherwise, you still have the problem where what they care about doesn't match what you care about (eg. ad supported services).\r\n</p><p>But, with the way the user agent picture is splitting up across devices (eg. the cloud, ambient computing), I don't think Firefox will ever be the server. Even if you connect user agents together with something like Jabber/XMPP, you still need a server out there—though at least that's pushing things in the right direction, since an XMPP server can be agnostic about the messages that go through it</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do have another blog post rattling around in my head about hosting. It's too hard right now; charging money smothers a lot of use; etc.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086173\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vocal.ly\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8b71ac29d4c8fbc68955337e5143d549&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vocal.ly\">@sull</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086173\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-28T21:17:32\">2011-01-28T21:17:32</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Opera Unite is out there but it too leverages a centralized service as a proxy.

    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>The feed button is not dead; it&#39;s just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it&#39;s not pulling its weight up front. This post discusses how you can still use feed auto-discovery, even restoring the icon to the toolbar with a few clicks and a drag.</em></p>\n<p>There&#39;s <a href=\"http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply\">a brouhaha</a> about <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967\">Bug 578967</a>, wherein the feed auto-discover icon in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a> has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, <em>and</em> a Mozilla employee—I&#39;ve got at least a few opinions.</p>\n<p>This post is one of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967\">several on this subject</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feeds-are-too-ubiquitous-to-need-an-indicator\">Feeds are too ubiquitous to need an indicator</h3>\n<p>Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it&#39;s simpler to assume every site has one, rather than keeping an un-lit indicator around to tell you when one&#39;s missing. So, Firefox 4 has an option in the bookmark menu to subscribe to the current page:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-002.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-00.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\n\n<p>The only indicator of a missing feed is that the menu item greys out. Since feeds are everywhere, you should feel comfortable reaching for that subscription menu whenever you like. Of course, this assumes that subscribing to a page falls into the same thought process as bookmarking it—but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an unreasonable notion.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you didn&#39;t know that subscribing to a page was possible—or if you worry there might be people (ie. the potential readers of your feeds) who are in that position—this change may seem problematic. </p>\n<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an unreasonable notion, either. But, I&#39;ll get back to that in a future post.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-feed-icon-isnt-dead-its-just-hiding\">The feed icon isn&#39;t dead, it&#39;s just hiding</h3>\n<p>Even with the new bookmark menu item, the feed subscription button is still available and ready to return to your toolbar in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a>.</p>\n<p>First, right-click somewhere in the empty space of your Firefox 4 toolbar. Try somewhere after the tabs, or somewhere between the toolbar buttons. <a href=\"http://blog.fligtar.com/2011/01/16/how-to-customize-firefox-4s-ui/\">This is how it works on Windows</a>, and this is what it looks like on my Mac:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"220\" height=\"161\" />\n\n<p>Click Customize, and you&#39;ll get a panel like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-01.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\n\n<p>This lets you customize which buttons and controls appear on the toolbar. If you scroll down in the panel, you&#39;ll see a &quot;<strong>Subscribe</strong>&quot; button. Drag that from the panel to a position in the toolbar, and you&#39;ll get a result like this:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-02.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-02.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\n\n<p>Click &quot;<strong>Done</strong>&quot;, and your browser should end up like this:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-03.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-03.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"203\" />\n\n<p>I took my browser screenshots with <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/15/mozillaPleaseKeepTheRssIco.html\">Dave Winer&#39;s screenshot of the old Firefox feed icon</a> for comparison. The result is different, but not radically so. It even enables and darkens when you visit a site with a feed:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-04.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-04.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"271\" />\n\n<p>The main difference is that Dave&#39;s screenshot is the default in Firefox 3.6, whereas mine is the result of the last few screenshots of toolbar customization in Firefox 4 beta 9. That customization is easy, if you know it&#39;s possible—but the worry is, as they say: out of sight, out of mind. </p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082410\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e0ad94a966cfab0b02d938e4bf9cd1c1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\">Felix Pleșoianu</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082410\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T08:00:44\">2011-01-16T08:00:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I have to take issue with some of your points, based on my personal experience. :)</p>\n<p>\"Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it’s simpler to assume every site has one,\"</p>\n<p>Um, no. I follow a hundred webcomics, and while the situation has gotten better recently, many of them still don't have a feed. That's not unique to webcomics, either. Lack of a newsfeed is common enough that being able to tell at first glace is very useful. Heck, many people, even website owners, are ignorant of RSS. More about that in a moment.</p>\n<p>Besides, the feed button serves a second purpose, which is to allow easy access to the feed. Just as I don't want to hunt for an \"RSS\" or \"XML\" link inside the website, I don't want to hunt for it in the browser's interface.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, many people still don't know about RSS. That big prominent orange icon is a big auto-discovery feature, not just in the technical sense, but also because a newbie could see it and click it out of curiosity, and thus learn about feeds. I had to explain what RSS is to someone whose browser didn't have one, and that proved to be quite difficult.</p>\n<p>Of course, all this talk is for nothing as the decision has already been made but, you know. Just my two cents.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082411\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.factoetum.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d7a5934cd119837d75f98dc7e99043d8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.factoetum.com\">Bruce Wayne</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082411\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T11:34:59\">2011-01-16T11:34:59</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Nice explaination\nBut by removing the rss indicator Firefox has shifted content aggregation control from an open browser to closed siloed companies.\nThere is no valid excuse for this....

This could make it a lot easier to work with semi-social sites like del.icio.us and Bloglines.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>The feed button is not dead; it's just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it's not pulling its weight up front. This post discusses how you can still use feed auto-discovery, even restoring the icon to the toolbar with a few clicks and a drag.</em>\r\n\r\nThere's [a brouhaha](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discover icon in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, *and* a Mozilla employee—I've got at least a few opinions.\r\n\r\nThis post is one of [several on this subject](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967).\r\n\r\n### Feeds are too ubiquitous to need an indicator\r\n\r\nFeeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it's simpler to assume every site has one, rather than keeping an un-lit indicator around to tell you when one's missing. So, Firefox 4 has an option in the bookmark menu to subscribe to the current page:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-002.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-00.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\r\n\r\nThe only indicator of a missing feed is that the menu item greys out. Since feeds are everywhere, you should feel comfortable reaching for that subscription menu whenever you like. Of course, this assumes that subscribing to a page falls into the same thought process as bookmarking it—but I don't think that's an unreasonable notion.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you didn't know that subscribing to a page was possible—or if you worry there might be people (ie. the potential readers of your feeds) who are in that position—this change may seem problematic. \r\n\r\nI don't think that's an unreasonable notion, either. But, I'll get back to that in a future post.\r\n\r\n### The feed icon isn't dead, it's just hiding\r\n\r\nEven with the new bookmark menu item, the feed subscription button is still available and ready to return to your toolbar in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/).\r\n\r\nFirst, right-click somewhere in the empty space of your Firefox 4 toolbar. Try somewhere after the tabs, or somewhere between the toolbar buttons. [This is how it works on Windows](http://blog.fligtar.com/2011/01/16/how-to-customize-firefox-4s-ui/), and this is what it looks like on my Mac:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"220\" height=\"161\" />\r\n\r\nClick Customize, and you'll get a panel like this:\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-01.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThis lets you customize which buttons and controls appear on the toolbar. If you scroll down in the panel, you'll see a \"**Subscribe**\" button. Drag that from the panel to a position in the toolbar, and you'll get a result like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-02.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-02.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"\" />\r\n\r\nClick \"**Done**\", and your browser should end up like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-03.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-03.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"203\" />\r\n\r\nI took my browser screenshots with [Dave Winer's screenshot of the old Firefox feed icon](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/15/mozillaPleaseKeepTheRssIco.html) for comparison. The result is different, but not radically so. It even enables and darkens when you visit a site with a feed:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-04.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-04.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"271\" />\r\n\r\nThe main difference is that Dave's screenshot is the default in Firefox 3.6, whereas mine is the result of the last few screenshots of toolbar customization in Firefox 4 beta 9. That customization is easy, if you know it's possible—but the worry is, as they say: out of sight, out of mind. \r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082410\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e0ad94a966cfab0b02d938e4bf9cd1c1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://felix.plesoianu.ro/\">Felix Pleșoianu</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082410\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T08:00:44\">2011-01-16T08:00:44</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I have to take issue with some of your points, based on my personal experience. :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it’s simpler to assume every site has one,\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Um, no. I follow a hundred webcomics, and while the situation has gotten better recently, many of them still don't have a feed. That's not unique to webcomics, either. Lack of a newsfeed is common enough that being able to tell at first glace is very useful. Heck, many people, even website owners, are ignorant of RSS. More about that in a moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, the feed button serves a second purpose, which is to allow easy access to the feed. Just as I don't want to hunt for an \"RSS\" or \"XML\" link inside the website, I don't want to hunt for it in the browser's interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, many people still don't know about RSS. That big prominent orange icon is a big auto-discovery feature, not just in the technical sense, but also because a newbie could see it and click it out of curiosity, and thus learn about feeds. I had to explain what RSS is to someone whose browser didn't have one, and that proved to be quite difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, all this talk is for nothing as the decision has already been made but, you know.

A built-in HTTP server would be a good start (is there one yet?), plus support for (say) Atom protocol for shoving data out. This could make it a lot easier to work with semi-social sites like del.icio.us and Bloglines. It's notable that these kind of tools have traditionally been very server-driven, with browsers playing (limited) catch up with plugins. Why can't the client set the agenda for a while?</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082451\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082451\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-19T03:16:41\">2011-01-19T03:16:41</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>FWIW: Firefox Sync does some shifting of things to the web.

    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>The feed button is not dead; it&#39;s just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it&#39;s not pulling its weight. This post talks about why things have changed.</em></p>\n<p>There&#39;s <a href=\"http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply\">a brouhaha</a> about <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967\">Bug 578967</a>, wherein the feed auto-discover icon in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a> has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, <em>and</em> a Mozilla employee—I&#39;ve got at least a few opinions.</p>\n<p>This post is one of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967\">several on this subject</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defaults-are-hard-to-pare-down\">Defaults are hard to pare down</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/how-to-use-feed-auto-discovery-in-firefox-4\">feed icon still lives</a> in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">the Firefox 4 Beta</a>; it&#39;s just not there by default any more. But, if you look at the controls available in <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png\">the toolbar customization panel</a>, you&#39;ll notice a <em>lot</em> of things that don&#39;t show up by default—there are a lot of things in there, period.</p>\n<p>This is the dilemma for <a href=\"http://planet.firefox.com/ux/\">the Firefox User Experience team at Mozilla</a>: Like it or not, one of the main themes of this next generation of browsers is minimalism—faster, smaller, less browser to get in the way of what you&#39;re browsing. Yet, at the same time, Firefox 4 has the features of Firefox 3.6 and more.</p>\n<p>You can&#39;t just cram it all in there, so what gets prime real estate by default? People say it&#39;s just a few pixels, that feed button—but is it so much more important than anything else that could go there? And before you answer, consider that not just for your personal use, but for the 100&#39;s of millions of people using Firefox. How do you check your own biases and make a decision on that scale? You could make an educated guess, make a gut check. A lot of brilliant design happens that way.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/\">gather some telemetry from beta installs to see what people really use</a>. Looking at a heatmap of clicks, the feed button is an absolute stinker. This isn&#39;t a random whim of the UX team—seriously, it&#39;s an <strong>order of magnitude</strong> less used than anything else in the toolbar (notice the one black spot):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/heatmap.png\" alt=\"heatmap.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"75\" /></a></p>\n<p>There have been comments dismissing the validity of that heatmap study. But, as far as I can tell, none of them really stick. So, for the sake of argument and a shorter blog post, let&#39;s assume barely anyone is using the feed icon and that it&#39;s not pulling its weight in this new age of browser minimalism.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that Firefox isn&#39;t the only browser to deprioritize the feed button: <em>Google Chrome doesn&#39;t even have a feed button at all</em>, and for many people that&#39;s the gold standard for minimal browser UI:</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-chrome.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-chrome.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\n\n<p><a name=\"serving\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"serving-the-users\">Serving the users</h3>\n<p>Let&#39;s hammer on the point of disuse some more—what&#39;s the payoff for clicking that thing, anyway?</p>\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-styling.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-styling.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" />\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>+1 — You get an option to create a <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/livebookmarks.html\">Live Bookmark</a>, which is really handy for things like Bugzilla searches or light headline reading. (I like those so much that I tried building them on the server at Delicious once, but we never quite worked it out at scale.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>0 — You get a list of sites to which Firefox will delegate subscription, if you happen to have <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM:window.navigator.registerContentHandler\">installed a content handler</a>. Useful if you know what it&#39;s about; a mystery if you don&#39;t—not much more useful than a bookmarklet, to me.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>-1 — You get a plainly-styled version of what you were probably already looking at on a site, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/02/firefox-20-breaks-client-side-xsl-for-rss-and-atom-feeds\">something I criticized back in 2006</a>, like some are criticizing the feed icon change now.  (At the time, I was working for <a href=\"http://organic.com\">a marketing company</a>, and the change cost me days trying to incorporate branding in feeds on <a href=\"http://www.jeep.com/en/autoshow/feeds/jeep-all.xml\">a client&#39;s site</a>. I think we gave up after a bit, but I suspect that <a href=\"http://feedburner.com\">FeedBurner</a> built a nice business routing around that change.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#39;s been status quo for years, and it&#39;s less than compelling—I&#39;ve even had people ask me if they broke the page when the button was clicked on accident.</p>\n<p>So, given little reward for clicking that feed icon, <em>pushing it into the background in <strong>its current state</strong> is a service to the users of Firefox<em>. In other words, that feed button has to get a lot more interesting if it&#39;s going to serve alongside UI all-stars like <strong>Back</strong>, <strong>Reload</strong>, and **Location</em></em>. </p>\n<p>Hell, even with Firebug installed, I use <strong>View Source</strong> more than the feed button these days, and I&#39;ve never stuck <em>that</em> on the toolbar.</p>\n<h3 id=\"leading-the-web\">Leading the web</h3>\n<p>The most compelling response I&#39;ve seen to the &quot;removal&quot; of the feed auto-discovery button is the challenge that Mozilla and other browser makers should be <em>improving</em> feed-related features, rather than pushing them into the background. With this, I wholeheartedly agree—but I&#39;m not entirely sure what to do about it.</p>\n<p>So, there&#39;s a balance here: Make the <strong>experience of the web better</strong> by improving how Firefox handles what&#39;s already out there, and <strong>make the web itself better</strong> by building more powerful and enabling technologies into Firefox and other products. In the best of times, Mozilla can do and has done both at once. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL\">WebGL</a> and technologies associated with HTML5 represent great examples of this.</p>\n<p>But, alas, syndication feeds in the browser have stagnated. The feed button has been a weak feature <em>for years</em>. In the meantime, other things have taken priority in the Firefox project. The rise of Twitter and Facebook and more complex applications on the web have reduced the need for most people to interact directly with feeds, so demands for attention to the feed button haven&#39;t exactly topped the charts in comparison to things like <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/The%20Adobe%20Flash%20plugin%20has%20crashed\">making sure Flash doesn&#39;t crash the browser</a> and <a href=\"http://arewefastyet.com/\">getting super fast</a> for everything else. </p>\n<h3 id=\"ship-it\">Ship it!</h3>\n<p>In the end, Mozilla has a browser to ship. The decision on the feed button <em>has been made</em> and, believe it or not, with a great deal of thought behind it. </p>\n<p>I know that this is the first time many people have heard of this change, but many already have heard and have given the UX team a number of earsful. Coming in at this late stage and requesting—nay <strong>demanding</strong>—a reversal of that decision will do nothing but piss off all the people who&#39;ve been banging away at this and many other things up to now. They&#39;re people who&#39;ve worked hard, stayed up late—and the last thing anyone wants to do is rehash every conversation ever about the topic.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089393\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=478a310fc648c632ba1a3c120437289b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jacques</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089393\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T07:22:31\">2011-01-16T07:22:31</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I understand that we always try to enhance UI of any software and that it takes a lot of time and discussions to make decisions.

You need to click on it to see if Firefox 4 discovered feeds of not.</p>\n<p>In Firefox 3.6, you don't need to guess or click on a button to find if a feed is available.</p>\n<p>So instead of a feed button that is always shown, feed available or not, it's much more usable to show a button that highlight properly (takes more space), or is shown only when feeds are available (optimal space use).</p>\n<p>Using a heatmap of clicks does not do justice to the feeds button, since it's of no use to click on it in Firefox 3.6 to instantly see if or not there is a feeds available.</p>\n<p>There are other information that have been removed in Firefox 4 that are open to discussion.</p>\n<p>For example, a heatmap does not show loading icons, throbbers, urls loading in the status bar, \"done\" message in the status bar, etc. In fact, any status information won't show up in a clicks heatmap. So if that information does not show up in a clicks heatmap, it does not mean these statuses must be removed from the UI.</p></div>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089415\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089415\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T21:25:30\">2011-01-16T21:25:30</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Actually, the Feed button in the toolbar <em>does</em> change state depending on the presence or absence of feeds: It's enabled and clickable with a feed, and greys out without a feed.

There's no way to fit a large number of beta users with eye-tracking gear. Also, I personally don't buy that people just like to have the feed indicator around because it's nice to see it light up.

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>The feed button is not dead; it's just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it's not pulling its weight. This post talks about why things have changed.</em>\r\n\r\nThere's [a brouhaha](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discover icon in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, *and* a Mozilla employee—I've got at least a few opinions.\r\n\r\nThis post is one of [several on this subject](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967).\r\n\r\n### Defaults are hard to pare down\r\n\r\nThe [feed icon still lives](http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/01/15/how-to-use-feed-auto-discovery-in-firefox-4) in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/); it's just not there by default any more. But, if you look at the controls available in [the toolbar customization panel](http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png), you'll notice a *lot* of things that don't show up by default—there are a lot of things in there, period.\r\n\r\nThis is the dilemma for [the Firefox User Experience team at Mozilla](http://planet.firefox.com/ux/): Like it or not, one of the main themes of this next generation of browsers is minimalism—faster, smaller, less browser to get in the way of what you're browsing. Yet, at the same time, Firefox 4 has the features of Firefox 3.6 and more.\r\n\r\nYou can't just cram it all in there, so what gets prime real estate by default? People say it's just a few pixels, that feed button—but is it so much more important than anything else that could go there? And before you answer, consider that not just for your personal use, but for the 100's of millions of people using Firefox. How do you check your own biases and make a decision on that scale? You could make an educated guess, make a gut check. A lot of brilliant design happens that way.\r\n\r\nYou can also [gather some telemetry from beta installs to see what people really use](https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/). Looking at a heatmap of clicks, the feed button is an absolute stinker. This isn't a random whim of the UX team—seriously, it's an **order of magnitude** less used than anything else in the toolbar (notice the one black spot):\r\n\r\n[<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/heatmap.png\" alt=\"heatmap.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"75\" />](https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/)\r\n\r\nThere have been comments dismissing the validity of that heatmap study. But, as far as I can tell, none of them really stick. So, for the sake of argument and a shorter blog post, let's assume barely anyone is using the feed icon and that it's not pulling its weight in this new age of browser minimalism.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that Firefox isn't the only browser to deprioritize the feed button: *Google Chrome doesn't even have a feed button at all*, and for many people that's the gold standard for minimal browser UI:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-chrome.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-chrome.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"242\" />\r\n\r\n<a name=\"serving\"></a>\r\n### Serving the users\r\n\r\nLet's hammer on the point of disuse some more—what's the payoff for clicking that thing, anyway?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-styling.png\" alt=\"feed-sub-styling.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" />\r\n\r\n* +1 — You get an option to create a [Live Bookmark](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/livebookmarks.html), which is really handy for things like Bugzilla searches or light headline reading. (I like those so much that I tried building them on the server at Delicious once, but we never quite worked it out at scale.)\r\n\r\n* 0 — You get a list of sites to which Firefox will delegate subscription, if you happen to have [installed a content handler](https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM:window.navigator.registerContentHandler). Useful if you know what it's about; a mystery if you don't—not much more useful than a bookmarklet, to me.\r\n\r\n* -1 — You get a plainly-styled version of what you were probably already looking at on a site, [something I criticized back in 2006](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/02/firefox-20-breaks-client-side-xsl-for-rss-and-atom-feeds), like some are criticizing the feed icon change now.  (At the time, I was working for [a marketing company](http://organic.com), and the change cost me days trying to incorporate branding in feeds on [a client's site](http://www.jeep.com/en/autoshow/feeds/jeep-all.xml). I think we gave up after a bit, but I suspect that [FeedBurner](http://feedburner.com) built a nice business routing around that change.)\r\n\r\nThat's been status quo for years, and it's less than compelling—I've even had people ask me if they broke the page when the button was clicked on accident.\r\n\r\nSo, given little reward for clicking that feed icon, *pushing it into the background in **its current state** is a service to the users of Firefox*. In other words, that feed button has to get a lot more interesting if it's going to serve alongside UI all-stars like **Back**, **Reload**, and **Location**. \r\n\r\nHell, even with Firebug installed, I use **View Source** more than the feed button these days, and I've never stuck *that* on the toolbar.\r\n\r\n### Leading the web\r\n\r\nThe most compelling response I've seen to the \"removal\" of the feed auto-discovery button is the challenge that Mozilla and other browser makers should be *improving* feed-related features, rather than pushing them into the background. With this, I wholeheartedly agree—but I'm not entirely sure what to do about it.\r\n\r\nSo, there's a balance here: Make the **experience of the web better** by improving how Firefox handles what's already out there, and **make the web itself better** by building more powerful and enabling technologies into Firefox and other products. In the best of times, Mozilla can do and has done both at once. [WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) and technologies associated with HTML5 represent great examples of this.\r\n\r\nBut, alas, syndication feeds in the browser have stagnated. The feed button has been a weak feature *for years*. In the meantime, other things have taken priority in the Firefox project. The rise of Twitter and Facebook and more complex applications on the web have reduced the need for most people to interact directly with feeds, so demands for attention to the feed button haven't exactly topped the charts in comparison to things like [making sure Flash doesn't crash the browser](https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/The%20Adobe%20Flash%20plugin%20has%20crashed) and [getting super fast](http://arewefastyet.com/) for everything else. \r\n\r\n### Ship it!\r\n\r\nIn the end, Mozilla has a browser to ship. The decision on the feed button *has been made* and, believe it or not, with a great deal of thought behind it. \r\n\r\nI know that this is the first time many people have heard of this change, but many already have heard and have given the UX team a number of earsful. Coming in at this late stage and requesting—nay **demanding**—a reversal of that decision will do nothing but piss off all the people who've been banging away at this and many other things up to now. They're people who've worked hard, stayed up late—and the last thing anyone wants to do is rehash every conversation ever about the topic.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089393\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=478a310fc648c632ba1a3c120437289b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Jacques</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089393\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T07:22:31\">2011-01-16T07:22:31</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I understand that we always try to enhance UI of any software and that it takes a lot of time and discussions to make decisions.

It's a call to action (eg. subscribe to this site)—and if barely anyone takes that action, how valuable can it be?</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089396\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.mozillaitalia.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0dc7c70165e18529e8ce7cffca832f6f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.mozillaitalia.org\">Giuliano</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089396\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-16T08:40:45\">2011-01-16T08:40:45</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>And if you really miss the feed-autodiscovery feature, just use <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/rss-icon-in-awesombar/\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS Icon In Awesombar</a>. ;)</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089444\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://usefuldissident.blogspot.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f836de283983db304b0191e3777c2eda&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://usefuldissident.blogspot.com/\">dude</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089444\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-01-17T03:17:05\">2011-01-17T03:17:05</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>RSS/Atom are standardized web features, it's a shame we have to rely on 3rd parties to enable support.
