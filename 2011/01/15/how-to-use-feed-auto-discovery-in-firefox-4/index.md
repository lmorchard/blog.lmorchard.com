**TL;DR**: <em>The feed button is not dead; it's just been sent to sing backup in Firefox 4 because it's not pulling its weight up front. This post discusses how you can still use feed auto-discovery, even restoring the icon to the toolbar with a few clicks and a drag.</em>

There's [a brouhaha](http://camendesign.com/rss_a_reply) about [Bug 578967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578967), wherein the feed auto-discover icon in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/) has been hidden by default. Being a feed nerd, the author of a book on the stuff, *and* a Mozilla employee—I've got at least a few opinions.

This post is one of [several on this subject](http://decafbad.com/blog/tag/bug578967).

### Feeds are too ubiquitous to need an indicator

Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it's simpler to assume every site has one, rather than keeping an un-lit indicator around to tell you when one's missing. So, Firefox 4 has an option in the bookmark menu to subscribe to the current page:

<img src="http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-002.png" alt="feed-sub-00.png" border="0" width="600" height="242" />

The only indicator of a missing feed is that the menu item greys out. Since feeds are everywhere, you should feel comfortable reaching for that subscription menu whenever you like. Of course, this assumes that subscribing to a page falls into the same thought process as bookmarking it—but I don't think that's an unreasonable notion.

On the other hand, if you didn't know that subscribing to a page was possible—or if you worry there might be people (ie. the potential readers of your feeds) who are in that position—this change may seem problematic. 

I don't think that's an unreasonable notion, either. But, I'll get back to that in a future post.

### The feed icon isn't dead, it's just hiding

Even with the new bookmark menu item, the feed subscription button is still available and ready to return to your toolbar in [the Firefox 4 Beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/).

First, right-click somewhere in the empty space of your Firefox 4 toolbar. Try somewhere after the tabs, or somewhere between the toolbar buttons. [This is how it works on Windows](http://blog.fligtar.com/2011/01/16/how-to-customize-firefox-4s-ui/), and this is what it looks like on my Mac:

<img src="http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png" alt="feed-sub-toolbarmenu.png" border="0" width="220" height="161" />

Click Customize, and you'll get a panel like this:

<p><img src="http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-01.png" alt="feed-sub-01.png" border="0" width="500" height="" />

This lets you customize which buttons and controls appear on the toolbar. If you scroll down in the panel, you'll see a "**Subscribe**" button. Drag that from the panel to a position in the toolbar, and you'll get a result like this:

<img src="http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-02.png" alt="feed-sub-02.png" border="0" width="500" height="" />

Click "**Done**", and your browser should end up like this:

<img src="http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-03.png" alt="feed-sub-03.png" border="0" width="600" height="203" />

I took my browser screenshots with [Dave Winer's screenshot of the old Firefox feed icon](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/15/mozillaPleaseKeepTheRssIco.html) for comparison. The result is different, but not radically so. It even enables and darkens when you visit a site with a feed:

<img src="http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/feed-sub-04.png" alt="feed-sub-04.png" border="0" width="600" height="271" />

The main difference is that Dave's screenshot is the default in Firefox 3.6, whereas mine is the result of the last few screenshots of toolbar customization in Firefox 4 beta 9. That customization is easy, if you know it's possible—but the worry is, as they say: out of sight, out of mind.

            <div class="content"><p>I have to take issue with some of your points, based on my personal experience. :)</p>

<p>"Feeds are so successful and ubiquitous that it’s simpler to assume every site has one,"</p>

<p>Um, no. I follow a hundred webcomics, and while the situation has gotten better recently, many of them still don't have a feed. That's not unique to webcomics, either. Lack of a newsfeed is common enough that being able to tell at first glace is very useful. Heck, many people, even website owners, are ignorant of RSS. More about that in a moment.</p>

<p>Besides, the feed button serves a second purpose, which is to allow easy access to the feed. Just as I don't want to hunt for an "RSS" or "XML" link inside the website, I don't want to hunt for it in the browser's interface.</p>

<p>Last but not least, many people still don't know about RSS. That big prominent orange icon is a big auto-discovery feature, not just in the technical sense, but also because a newbie could see it and click it out of curiosity, and thus learn about feeds. I had to explain what RSS is to someone whose browser didn't have one, and that proved to be quite difficult.</p>

<p>Of course, all this talk is for nothing as the decision has already been made but, you know. Just my two cents.</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>Nice explaination
But by removing the rss indicator Firefox has shifted content aggregation control from an open browser to closed siloed companies.
There is no valid excuse for this.... Even the one you have eloquently made.... I'm quiet certain that with this decision Firfox will speed up it's demise...Just to let you know... we are close to launching several application platforms for consumers that use RSS as as a content transport protocol</p></div>

<p>Complete fallacy. 3% out of the group participating in a time-limited beta test clicked on the button during that timeframe to subscribe to new feeds.</p>

<p>Now ponder how often you discover new feeds in comparison to how often you use the reload button.</p>

<p>Let's try a scenario somehow similar to the RSS problem. 
What if, Firefox would be launched with the Navigation Toolbar hidden? How many will enable it?</p>

<p>I have another one, less scary.
What if, Tabs on Top would be unchecked by default? How many people will change this setting?</p>

<p>Similar to these scenarios, RSS usage will drop on FF.</p></div>

<p>Saying that the feed icon is rarely used misses the point big time. There are websites I've been visiting three times a week for years, but I only needed to click the feed icon <em>once</em>. That's what feeds are <em>for</em>: to spare you from manually clicking a button to check for updates.</p>

<p>Statistics are great, but they don't substitute for common sense.</p></div>

<p>For the same reason you have fire hydrants everywhere in a city, even if they are very rarely used. Heck, ideally you should <em>never</em> need them; but would you advocate taking them out?</p>

<p>I gave a bunch of reasons why the RSS feed icon is good in my first comment. And I hope all of them were already known, and have been weighted, when the decision was made.</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>If my own experience is anything to go on, the feed icon's benefit in spreading the idea of feeds is being highly exaggerated in some of the comments here. It was a very long time before I noticed it, for pages without an icon in them I would do View Source to find the alternate links.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I reckon having something in the bookmarks menu would give more exposure to people who want to do more with a given resource (bookmarking and subscribing to feeds are both rather unidirectional relationships!).</p>

<p>In fact it would be really useful to have a fully integrated, user-accessible system for handling all such things, ideally one that could be transparently shifted to the Web (with appropriate access control). A built-in HTTP server would be a good start (is there one yet?), plus support for (say) Atom protocol for shoving data out. This could make it a lot easier to work with semi-social sites like del.icio.us and Bloglines. It's notable that these kind of tools have traditionally been very server-driven, with browsers playing (limited) catch up with plugins. Why can't the client set the agenda for a while?</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>FWIW: Firefox Sync does some shifting of things to the web. It's a pretty dumb store, providing just enough structure for the client to push encrypted hunks of data into a storage cloud shared between devices. But, it <em>is</em> a bespoke API for sync and not composed from standards like Atom.</p>

<p>As for a built-in HTTP server... I've been toying with the idea of playing with something like that since I started poking at the new <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/addon-sdk" rel="nofollow">add-on API</a> and seeing a lot in common with node.js. It seems like that's getting easier soon</p></div>
