    "html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>Our <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">cable company</a> has offered poor\nsupport for our TiVo; cut our channels and allowed our service to\ndegrade; mislead us about possible solutions; and finally wasted our\ntime by sending a contractor to our home instead of a clued-in\nemployee who could handle the issue.  And, now that we&#39;re going to\npursue other options for putting moving pictures on our television,\nthey plan to charge us for cutting the cord. Since I&#39;ve been looking\nto write here more, I&#39;ve just been given a nice excuse to rant.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright House</a> has basically a local monopoly on cable TV here. So,\nwe&#39;ve been a customer of theirs for cable and internet over the past\nfew years. </p>\n<p>This is the thing, though: We&#39;ve spent a lot of money on a cable\nsubscription.  In exchange, I expect great and even proactive customer\nservice. I guess I&#39;m unreasonable, because instead we&#39;re expected to\npay more for less and to accept hassles and up-selling instead of\nsupport—because they&#39;re almost literally the only game in town. But,\nother options are getting <em>good enough</em> and we can learn to do\nwithout.</p>\n<p>You see, we have a <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a>. We like our <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a>. We got one when\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/sparklebunny/\">the girl</a> worked at the company, and we&#39;ve never gone back.\nHaving one is like living in the future. Yes, <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright House</a> offers\n<a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/shop/tv/dvr\">their own DVRs</a>, but they&#39;re inferior products and we don&#39;t want\none.  So, as far as I&#39;m concerned, <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright House</a> is just a video\nsupplier for our <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a>. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, over the past year, they&#39;ve done a crappy job.  They&#39;re\ntransitioning to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched_video\">Switched Digital Video</a>, and that&#39;s something\nour <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> doesn&#39;t support out of the box. As we eventually found\nout, there&#39;s a <a href=\"http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/307/kw/sdv/r_id/100041\">tuning adapter</a> that could fix things. But, rather\nthan tell us about that up front—and maybe offer to\nsend us one as a part of their transition—they&#39;ve instead sent us a\nseries of letters listing channels we&#39;re going to lose\nbecause we rent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CableCARD\">CableCARDs</a>.</p>\n<p>Since I&#39;ve got better things to do than call the cable company, I put\noff contacting them. In the meantime, we lost channels as promised.\nOther channels not listed in the letters began to degrade and became\nunwatchable.</p>\n<p>Finally, I sent an email. A week or so later, they called and left me\na voicemail, which described <strong>the installation fee and monthly\nrental rate</strong> of a <a href=\"http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/307/kw/sdv/r_id/100041\">tuning adapter</a>. This, on top of what we already\npay for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CableCARD\">CableCARDs</a> and the underlying cable service itself.  At\nthat point, we were pretty annoyed. The cable bill was already high\nand new fees seemed to appear every month—<strong>and they wanted us to pay\neven more just to get what we&#39;d originally signed up for</strong>.</p>\n<p>Yes, I understand that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched_video\">SDV</a> will let them make more efficient\nuse of resources and offer exciting new services and <em>yadda yadda\nyadda</em>—but, to me, it just looks like they&#39;re breaking the video feed\ninto our <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> and expect us to pay more to fix it. It&#39;s pretty\nshady and customer-hostile, this stuff. Oh wait: <a href=\"http://hd.engadget.com/2008/10/16/fcc-fines-twc-and-cox-for-deploying-switched-digital-video/\">Didn&#39;t some of these\nguys get fined by the FCC for SDV hijinx not too long ago?</a> </p>\n<p>So, rather than jump on getting a <a href=\"http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/307/kw/sdv/r_id/100041\">tuning adapter</a> installed, I bought\n<a href=\"http://www.bestbuy.com/site/RCA+-+Indoor+HDTV+Antenna+-+White/8939839.p;jsessionid=2D2BA012979FDCFA317D3D5E287FE00D.bbolsp-app03-25?id=1215217075905&amp;skuId=8939839&amp;st=hd%20antenna&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=2\">an antenna</a> and went retro. It turns out there are <a href=\"http://transition.fcc.gov/mb/engineering/maps/\">over a\ndozen over-the-air HD channels in range</a>. That might not sound\nlike a lot, but you&#39;d be surprised how much watchable stuff is packed\ninto the major networks versus the other 1000 channels we got on\ndigital cable. The theme here is <em>free</em> and <em>good enough</em>.</p>\n<p>True, some of those channels are a pain to tune in using a dinky\nlittle indoor antenna, reminicent of the &quot;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna\">rabbit ears</a>&quot; days.  But,\nfor most of the past month, we got by pretty well. The <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> works\nnicely <a href=\"http://www.tivo.com/products/source/antenna/index.html\">with an antenna</a>.  It&#39;s a decent <a href=\"http://netflix.com/\">Netflix</a>\nstreamer, too. (Though, to be honest, the Xbox 360 works better,\ncan get <a href=\"http://www.hulu.com/plus\">Hulu Plus</a>, and plays videos from our network. <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a>\nreally, really needs to catch up fast here.)</p>\n<p>Having given TV a trial without cable, we decided it was time to call\n<a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright House</a> back to sort out this <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> thing, one way or\nanother.  Since I&#39;m a proven procrastinating wuss about calling the\ncable company, my wife called and scheduled an appointment for a tech\nvisit. </p>\n<p>Here&#39;s the fun part: They told her we didn&#39;t need a <a href=\"http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/307/kw/sdv/r_id/100041\">tuning\nadapter</a>. Instead, they had &quot;HD boxes&quot; which would do the trick.\nThey could install those for free, reclaim our rented <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CableCARD\">CableCARDs</a>,\nand we&#39;d get a break on our bill at the end. I was dubious, but that\nsounded surprisingly good!</p>\n<p>So, the tech arrived today, near the end of the 2-hour window. He came\narmed with two <a href=\"http://www.motorola.com/Video-Solutions/US-EN/Products-and-Services/Video-Consumer-Premise-Equipment/All-Digital-Set-Tops/DCX3200_US-EN?localeId=33\">Motorola DCX3200</a> set-top boxes. I thought they must\nhave some kind of control connection to be slaved to the <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a>. My\ncable-tech-fu is pretty weak, but I assumed they knew what they were\ndoing.</p>\n<p>But, no: The tech—who was a contractor and not a <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright House</a>\nemployee—took one look at our <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> and shrugged. He had no idea\nhow to make these boxes work with that thing. So, he set one up\nalongside the <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> and called back to headquarters to schedule\n<em>another</em> appointment—this time with an elusive <strong>real</strong> <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright\nHouse</a> employee who apparently knew about these things. You know,\nthe guy whom they should have sent in the first place. </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve no real complaints about the contractor: His installation of the\nset-top box was fine—it was just the wrong solution altogether. Yeah,\nI could probably finagle something with an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_blaster\">IR blaster</a>, but it\ndoesn&#39;t seem worth it and probably doesn&#39;t work in HD. We could also\nkeep the appointment next week and hope that the <strong>bona fide <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright\nHouse</a> employee</strong> knows what he&#39;s doing and leaves us with a working\n<a href=\"http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/307/kw/sdv/r_id/100041\">tuning adapter</a>. But, trying to be happy about that starts to feel\nlike <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome\">Stockholm Syndrome</a>.</p>\n<p>After the contractor left, we thought a bit and my wife (again,\nbecause the phone is my kryptonite, and I&#39;d be useless without her)\ncalled <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright House</a> to cancel our cable.</p>\n<p>We wanted to keep the internet access—but even here, they did their\nbest to make us think twice about staying their customer at all.  It\nturns out that to break up our cable/internet bundle, they need to\n&quot;rebuild our whole system&quot; and that incurs a fee as large as what we\npaid to install cable in the first place.</p>\n<p>The funny thing is that it wouldn&#39;t have been hard to keep us\nhappy. Do a little work up front to help keep our <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> running,\nand we might have spent even more money on cable. Now, we&#39;re looking\nvery hard at alternatives we&#39;d been too complacent to consider\nbefore.</p>\n<p>But, I guess that&#39;s the problem: <a href=\"http://hd.engadget.com/2010/02/19/tivo-wonders-why-cable-wants-tv-everywhere-except-on-a-tivo/\">This is all very old news.</a>\nThey don&#39;t really want our <a href=\"http://tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> on their network. So, instead,\nthey sent letters promising degraded service and followed through on\nit. And, when contacted to address the issue, they botched it\naltogether. Clearly, if third-party set-top boxes and the customers\nwho use them were a priority beyond just avoiding FCC fines, they&#39;d\nhave the right people and processes in place to keep us happy. I think\nwe&#39;ve gotten the message, now.</p>\n<p>Where&#39;s that leave us? Well, our bill will be cut in half, at least\nafter we pay for the new setup fee. We&#39;ll need to be more mindful and\nintentional toward what we watch on TV and how we get it, but somehow\nI think we&#39;ll manage.  Past that, I think it&#39;ll feel good to pay less\nfor a service provided by a company that doesn&#39;t really want our\nbusiness and has a strange notion of customer service. </p>\n<p>In the meantime, I think I&#39;ll be on the lookout\nfor a better internet provider so we can ditch <a href=\"http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\">Bright House</a>\noutright. The problem is, I don&#39;t think the market around here is\nexactly rife with competition.</p>\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=70: -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-223874330\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/google-ec18b68fb719cdef24375dc3a0ffb29f.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Craig Maloney</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-223874330\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-11T15:57:19\">2011-06-11T15:57:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Not sure if you can get it, but I've been happy with Wide Open West for my phone / Internet connectivity.

And, that was *before* the SDV transition started here.\nIt's not my job to be proactive about their service. We're paying them, not the other way around. They knew something was wrong, because they knew enough to send us letters about breaking our service. They could have been proactive themselves and called us to schedule an appointment with \"the guy\" to get us hooked up with a tuning adapter before we started losing channels and reception quality.\nAnd, when we *did* finally call them, they sent the wrong guy to install the wrong stuff. Sure, we could let them come back and try again, but we've played this game before.\nWe're not going with anyone else - we've cancelled cable altogether. </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-225731744\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/neilio.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">neilio</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-225731744\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-14T15:24:01\">2011-06-14T15:24:01</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Nice write up, and your experience basically mirrors ours, except replace \"Brighthouse\" with \"Rogers|Bell\" (our two major providers).

    "body": "**TL;DR**: <em>Our [cable company][bright house] has offered poor\r\nsupport for our TiVo; cut our channels and allowed our service to\r\ndegrade; mislead us about possible solutions; and finally wasted our\r\ntime by sending a contractor to our home instead of a clued-in\r\nemployee who could handle the issue.  And, now that we're going to\r\npursue other options for putting moving pictures on our television,\r\nthey plan to charge us for cutting the cord. Since I've been looking\r\nto write here more, I've just been given a nice excuse to rant.</em>\r\n\r\n[Bright House][] has basically a local monopoly on cable TV here. So,\r\nwe've been a customer of theirs for cable and internet over the past\r\nfew years. \r\n\r\nThis is the thing, though: We've spent a lot of money on a cable\r\nsubscription.  In exchange, I expect great and even proactive customer\r\nservice. I guess I'm unreasonable, because instead we're expected to\r\npay more for less and to accept hassles and up-selling instead of\r\nsupport—because they're almost literally the only game in town. But,\r\nother options are getting *good enough* and we can learn to do\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nYou see, we have a [TiVo][]. We like our [TiVo][]. We got one when\r\n[the girl][girl] worked at the company, and we've never gone back.\r\nHaving one is like living in the future. Yes, [Bright House][] offers\r\n[their own DVRs][dvrs], but they're inferior products and we don't want\r\none.  So, as far as I'm concerned, [Bright House][] is just a video\r\nsupplier for our [TiVo][]. \r\n\r\n[dvrs]: http://brighthouse.com/michigan/shop/tv/dvr\r\n[girl]: http://twitter.com/sparklebunny/\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, over the past year, they've done a crappy job.  They're\r\ntransitioning to [Switched Digital Video][sdv], and that's something\r\nour [TiVo][] doesn't support out of the box. As we eventually found\r\nout, there's a [tuning adapter][] that could fix things. But, rather\r\nthan tell us about that up front—and maybe offer to\r\nsend us one as a part of their transition—they've instead sent us a\r\nseries of letters listing channels we're going to lose\r\nbecause we rent [CableCARDs][].\r\n\r\nSince I've got better things to do than call the cable company, I put\r\noff contacting them. In the meantime, we lost channels as promised.\r\nOther channels not listed in the letters began to degrade and became\r\nunwatchable.\r\n\r\nFinally, I sent an email. A week or so later, they called and left me\r\na voicemail, which described **the installation fee and monthly\r\nrental rate** of a [tuning adapter][]. This, on top of what we already\r\npay for [CableCARDs][] and the underlying cable service itself.  At\r\nthat point, we were pretty annoyed. The cable bill was already high\r\nand new fees seemed to appear every month—**and they wanted us to pay\r\neven more just to get what we'd originally signed up for**.\r\n\r\nYes, I understand that [SDV][sdv] will let them make more efficient\r\nuse of resources and offer exciting new services and *yadda yadda\r\nyadda*—but, to me, it just looks like they're breaking the video feed\r\ninto our [TiVo][] and expect us to pay more to fix it. It's pretty\r\nshady and customer-hostile, this stuff. Oh wait: [Didn't some of these\r\nguys get fined by the FCC for SDV hijinx not too long ago?][fined] \r\n\r\n[fined]: http://hd.engadget.com/2008/10/16/fcc-fines-twc-and-cox-for-deploying-switched-digital-video/\r\n\r\nSo, rather than jump on getting a [tuning adapter][] installed, I bought\r\n[an antenna][antenna] and went retro. It turns out there are [over a\r\ndozen over-the-air HD channels in range][range]. That might not sound\r\nlike a lot, but you'd be surprised how much watchable stuff is packed\r\ninto the major networks versus the other 1000 channels we got on\r\ndigital cable. The theme here is *free* and *good enough*.\r\n\r\nTrue, some of those channels are a pain to tune in using a dinky\r\nlittle indoor antenna, reminicent of the \"[rabbit ears][]\" days.  But,\r\nfor most of the past month, we got by pretty well. The [TiVo][] works\r\nnicely [with an antenna][tivo-ota].  It's a decent [Netflix][]\r\nstreamer, too. (Though, to be honest, the Xbox 360 works better,\r\ncan get [Hulu Plus][], and plays videos from our network. [TiVo][]\r\nreally, really needs to catch up fast here.)\r\n\r\n[rabbit ears]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna\r\n\r\nHaving given TV a trial without cable, we decided it was time to call\r\n[Bright House][] back to sort out this [TiVo][] thing, one way or\r\nanother.  Since I'm a proven procrastinating wuss about calling the\r\ncable company, my wife called and scheduled an appointment for a tech\r\nvisit. \r\n\r\nHere's the fun part: They told her we didn't need a [tuning\r\nadapter][]. Instead, they had \"HD boxes\" which would do the trick.\r\nThey could install those for free, reclaim our rented [CableCARDs][],\r\nand we'd get a break on our bill at the end. I was dubious, but that\r\nsounded surprisingly good!\r\n\r\nSo, the tech arrived today, near the end of the 2-hour window. He came\r\narmed with two [Motorola DCX3200][] set-top boxes. I thought they must\r\nhave some kind of control connection to be slaved to the [TiVo][]. My\r\ncable-tech-fu is pretty weak, but I assumed they knew what they were\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nBut, no: The tech—who was a contractor and not a [Bright House][]\r\nemployee—took one look at our [TiVo][] and shrugged. He had no idea\r\nhow to make these boxes work with that thing. So, he set one up\r\nalongside the [TiVo][] and called back to headquarters to schedule\r\n*another* appointment—this time with an elusive **real** [Bright\r\nHouse][] employee who apparently knew about these things. You know,\r\nthe guy whom they should have sent in the first place. \r\n\r\nI've no real complaints about the contractor: His installation of the\r\nset-top box was fine—it was just the wrong solution altogether. Yeah,\r\nI could probably finagle something with an [IR blaster][], but it\r\ndoesn't seem worth it and probably doesn't work in HD. We could also\r\nkeep the appointment next week and hope that the **bona fide [Bright\r\nHouse][] employee** knows what he's doing and leaves us with a working\r\n[tuning adapter][]. But, trying to be happy about that starts to feel\r\nlike [Stockholm Syndrome][].\r\n\r\nAfter the contractor left, we thought a bit and my wife (again,\r\nbecause the phone is my kryptonite, and I'd be useless without her)\r\ncalled [Bright House][] to cancel our cable.\r\n\r\nWe wanted to keep the internet access—but even here, they did their\r\nbest to make us think twice about staying their customer at all.  It\r\nturns out that to break up our cable/internet bundle, they need to\r\n\"rebuild our whole system\" and that incurs a fee as large as what we\r\npaid to install cable in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing is that it wouldn't have been hard to keep us\r\nhappy. Do a little work up front to help keep our [TiVo][] running,\r\nand we might have spent even more money on cable. Now, we're looking\r\nvery hard at alternatives we'd been too complacent to consider\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nBut, I guess that's the problem: [This is all very old news.][oldnews]\r\nThey don't really want our [TiVo][] on their network. So, instead,\r\nthey sent letters promising degraded service and followed through on\r\nit. And, when contacted to address the issue, they botched it\r\naltogether. Clearly, if third-party set-top boxes and the customers\r\nwho use them were a priority beyond just avoiding FCC fines, they'd\r\nhave the right people and processes in place to keep us happy. I think\r\nwe've gotten the message, now.\r\n\r\nWhere's that leave us? Well, our bill will be cut in half, at least\r\nafter we pay for the new setup fee. We'll need to be more mindful and\r\nintentional toward what we watch on TV and how we get it, but somehow\r\nI think we'll manage.  Past that, I think it'll feel good to pay less\r\nfor a service provided by a company that doesn't really want our\r\nbusiness and has a strange notion of customer service. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I think I'll be on the lookout\r\nfor a better internet provider so we can ditch [Bright House][]\r\noutright. The problem is, I don't think the market around here is\r\nexactly rife with competition.\r\n\r\n[oldnews]: http://hd.engadget.com/2010/02/19/tivo-wonders-why-cable-wants-tv-everywhere-except-on-a-tivo/\r\n[stockholm syndrome]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome\r\n[ir blaster]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_blaster\r\n[hulu plus]: http://www.hulu.com/plus\r\n[range]: http://transition.fcc.gov/mb/engineering/maps/\r\n[tivo-ota]: http://www.tivo.com/products/source/antenna/index.html\r\n[antenna]: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/RCA+-+Indoor+HDTV+Antenna+-+White/8939839.p;jsessionid=2D2BA012979FDCFA317D3D5E287FE00D.bbolsp-app03-25?id=1215217075905&skuId=8939839&st=hd%20antenna&cp=1&lp=2\r\n[motorola dcx3200]: http://www.motorola.com/Video-Solutions/US-EN/Products-and-Services/Video-Consumer-Premise-Equipment/All-Digital-Set-Tops/DCX3200_US-EN?localeId=33\r\n[cablecards]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CableCARD\r\n[netflix]: http://netflix.com/\r\n[tivo]: http://tivo.com/\r\n[tuning adapter]: http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/307/kw/sdv/r_id/100041\r\n[sdv]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched_video\r\n[bright house]: http://brighthouse.com/michigan/default\r\n\r\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=70: -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-223874330\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/google-ec18b68fb719cdef24375dc3a0ffb29f.jpg\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Craig Maloney</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-223874330\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-11T15:57:19\">2011-06-11T15:57:19</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Not sure if you can get it, but I've been happy with Wide Open West for my phone / Internet connectivity.

We use an AppleTV as our main box, the EyeTV exports to itunes so that shows just show up under \"TV Shows\" on the ATV.\r\n\r\n--Steve</div>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-225730462\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/lmorchard.jpg\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com/\">Les Orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-225730462\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-14T15:21:40\">2011-06-14T15:21:40</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">We get pretty much all of that with a TiVo, though I've been thinking about picking up an AppleTV and/or a Roku box to play with.\r\n\r\nI've been pretty surprised with the quality of HD over the air, provided that I get the antenna pointed *just right* :)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-224275489\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=374446f38b479f01f4f77deaff6f3572&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Slivertoung</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-224275489\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-12T13:35:46\">2011-06-12T13:35:46</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Birghthouse can only do so much, sometimes it takes a little to get the problem solved but trust me they are doing their best to give you the best in service possible at the most reasonable price.  I have had Brighthouse for years and have a TiVo and yes at first it took a bit to get the kinks worked out but they came back till it was fixed on their own dime and now its great, other companys charge everytime they send someone out and most don't even bother working with you if you have Tivo becuase they don't support it.  You can go with someone else but expect contracts, good deals that last a bit then trap you into higher prices till your contract is up and little to no customer service skills if you have to call in for help.  Try it and when you hate it call BrightHouse back and they will be glad to come help you out and get you all fixed up again they will even help you out of you contract if they have to.  Just some advice, if you have a problem don't let it just sit their and bother you, do something proactive let them know something is wrong and see if they don't hop to and try and fix it</div>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-224370885\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/lmorchard.jpg\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com/\">Les Orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-224370885\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-12T17:12:01\">2011-06-12T17:12:01</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Here's the thing: We went through all of the above, a few years ago, just to get the TiVo working in the first place when we started service with Bright House. They apparently only have \"the guy\" who knows how to work with TiVo and CableCARDs, and we're \"lucky\" to get him. And, that was *before* the SDV transition started here.\r\n\r\nIt's not my job to be proactive about their service. We're paying them, not the other way around. They knew something was wrong, because they knew enough to send us letters about breaking our service. They could have been proactive themselves and called us to schedule an appointment with \"the guy\" to get us hooked up with a tuning adapter before we started losing channels and reception quality.\r\n\r\nAnd, when we *did* finally call them, they sent the wrong guy to install the wrong stuff. Sure, we could let them come back and try again, but we've played this game before.\r\n\r\nWe're not going with anyone else - we've cancelled cable altogether. </div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-225731744\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/neilio.jpg\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">neilio</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-225731744\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-14T15:24:01\">2011-06-14T15:24:01</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Nice write up, and your experience basically mirrors ours, except replace \"Brighthouse\" with \"Rogers|Bell\" (our two major providers).

Really, there&#39;s no\nreason for me to have a full-featured CMS running here.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I could host my entire blog on Amazon S3 or something similar, and be\nmore neglectful by reducing active code even further. The only crappy\nthing is that I don&#39;t think I can send <code>decafbad.com</code> directly to S3, and\nwould need to redirect to a CNAME on a subdomain on <code>blog.decafbad.com</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I can edit my blog directly on GitHub and, assuming I get the webhooks\nset up, have my server rebuild the HTML automatically on a <code>git push</code>. I\ncould probably use <a href=\"http://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> and the Jekyll support there,\nbut I suspect I&#39;ll be doing some Weird Things that they won&#39;t handle.\n(And probably for good reason.) </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Since Disqus has all my comments now, I can stop worrying about running\nthat code on my server too. I&#39;m a little antsy about putting that in the\ncloud, but the escape routes are well lit and I should be able to replace\nit easily if I need to. Self-hosted, JS-include-based comments is a\nproject in my TODO list.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>My writing here is now all stored in individual text files, formatted with\nMarkdown, annotated with YAML metadata, and subject to revision control\nunder git. This combination feels like it has a lot of longevity and\npotential for survival even beyond this current experiment with <a href=\"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Writing, editing, and publishing entries here can now more closely match\nmy daily reality of living in MacVim and git. It sounds lame, but the\nnotion of swapping over to a Wordpress admin page and working in a\nbrowser textarea has often kept me from even starting a post.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But, some things are broken, now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.decafbad.com/commit/a79678828ab612c2edb8a8ac3f796199cb922a2e\">Fixed</a> <strike>No more tag pages. I don&#39;t think very many humans visit these pages, but\na lot of search engines do.</strike></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.decafbad.com/commit/a79678828ab612c2edb8a8ac3f796199cb922a2e\">Fixed</a> <strike>No more tag feeds. I expect to hear about this soon, since this blog gets\nsyndicated to Planet Mozilla via my &quot;mozilla&quot; tag feed.</strike></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>No more year / month archive pages or sidebar widget. Not sure how many\npeople actually stroll down memory lane here on my blog, but I do have a\n<a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/archives\">gigantor huge list of all my posts evar</a>, now.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A general lack of contextual links to related posts and such. Turns out\nthat running the LSI option on Jekyll is completely horrible.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Regeneration seems less-than-happy in general, and I wish it did\nconditional regneration. That is, only produce the HTML for things that\nneed it because dependencies have changed. No need to rebake the whole\nworld just because I changed one file.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bright side is that there are solutions to all the broken things, and\nnow I have something to tinker with again on my blog.  So, let me know if\nanything else looks broken, and hopefully this will get me spewing some\nmore words out onto this thing soon.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221397880\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.com/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/lmorchard.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://decafbad.com/\">Les Orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221397880\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-08T17:45:54\">2011-06-08T17:45:54</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Testing a comment here on my new post.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221404263\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/bkclements.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">bkclements</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221404263\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-08T17:59:01\">2011-06-08T17:59:01</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Hi, did you happen to look at blogofile for similar functionality?\nI'm still trying to decide which way to  go.

Really, there's no\n  reason for me to have a full-featured CMS running here.\n\n* I could host my entire blog on Amazon S3 or something similar, and be\n  more neglectful by reducing active code even further. The only crappy\n  thing is that I don't think I can send `decafbad.com` directly to S3, and\n  would need to redirect to a CNAME on a subdomain on `blog.decafbad.com`.\n\n* I can edit my blog directly on GitHub and, assuming I get the webhooks\n  set up, have my server rebuild the HTML automatically on a `git push`. I\n  could probably use [GitHub Pages][pages] and the Jekyll support there,\n  but I suspect I'll be doing some Weird Things that they won't handle.\n  (And probably for good reason.) \n\n* Since Disqus has all my comments now, I can stop worrying about running\n  that code on my server too. I'm a little antsy about putting that in the\n  cloud, but the escape routes are well lit and I should be able to replace\n  it easily if I need to. Self-hosted, JS-include-based comments is a\n  project in my TODO list.\n\n* My writing here is now all stored in individual text files, formatted with\n  Markdown, annotated with YAML metadata, and subject to revision control\n  under git. This combination feels like it has a lot of longevity and\n  potential for survival even beyond this current experiment with [Jekyll][]\n\n* Writing, editing, and publishing entries here can now more closely match\n  my daily reality of living in MacVim and git. It sounds lame, but the\n  notion of swapping over to a Wordpress admin page and working in a\n  browser textarea has often kept me from even starting a post.\n\nBut, some things are broken, now:\n\n* [Fixed][tags] <strike>No more tag pages. I don't think very many humans visit these pages, but\n  a lot of search engines do.</strike>\n\n* [Fixed][tags] <strike>No more tag feeds. I expect to hear about this soon, since this blog gets\n  syndicated to Planet Mozilla via my \"mozilla\" tag feed.</strike>\n\n* No more year / month archive pages or sidebar widget. Not sure how many\n  people actually stroll down memory lane here on my blog, but I do have a\n  [gigantor huge list of all my posts evar][archives], now.\n\n* A general lack of contextual links to related posts and such. Turns out\n  that running the LSI option on Jekyll is completely horrible.\n\n* Regeneration seems less-than-happy in general, and I wish it did\n  conditional regneration. That is, only produce the HTML for things that\n  need it because dependencies have changed. No need to rebake the whole\n  world just because I changed one file.\n\n[tags]: https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.decafbad.com/commit/a79678828ab612c2edb8a8ac3f796199cb922a2e\n\nThe bright side is that there are solutions to all the broken things, and\nnow I have something to tinker with again on my blog.  So, let me know if\nanything else looks broken, and hopefully this will get me spewing some\nmore words out onto this thing soon.\n\n[archives]: http://decafbad.com/blog/archives\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221397880\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/lmorchard.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.com/\">Les Orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221397880\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-08T17:45:54\">2011-06-08T17:45:54</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Testing a comment here on my new post.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221404263\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/bkclements.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">bkclements</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221404263\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-08T17:59:01\">2011-06-08T17:59:01</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Hi, did you happen to look at blogofile for similar functionality?\n\nI'm still trying to decide which way to  go.

injected DISQUS UI?  \n\nThile there are several knobs in their UI, but the only form of customization that's worked for me is fiddling with external javscript and CSS...  Specifically things like disabling media upload and changing default sort, and threading seem to be no-ops.</div>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\"
