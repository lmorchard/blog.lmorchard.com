A year or so later,\n<a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/09/wedding-day-is-today\">we got married</a>. That was five years ago, this past\nThursday.</p>\n<p>Over these past five years, my love has put up with a lot from me. To\nstart with, she let me drag her across the country, away from friends\nand family, before we&#39;d even gotten beach sand from our honeymoon out\nof the luggage. She let me chase a fantasy out West without even\nknowing where we&#39;d live—and she was the one who found us a home while\nI got started at my Silicon Valley dream job.</p>\n<p>This has been the theme of our years together: Alexandra makes my life\npossible. She gives me so much happiness, support, and cares for me\nwithout question—for which I am entirely undeserving.  I would be\nuseless without her, and rediscover the fact of this on a daily basis.\nShe enables and encourages me in so many ways, and I can only hope to\nreturn even a fraction of the favor.</p>\n<p>Alexandra is my best friend and closest confidant. I love\nher as deeply as on our wedding day, and that feeling just grows\nstronger every day. As an introvert, I get exahusted after a day\naround other people, and need a day alone to recharge. Alexandra is\nthe only person I&#39;ve met who can has the opposite effect on me—<em>we\nrecharge each other</em>.</p>\n<p>Since we moved back to Michigan, making a home here has\nbeen the happiest time of my life. It&#39;s not life as I&#39;d dreamed it\nwould be—it&#39;s been better. And I owe it all to my gorgeous wife,\nAlexandra.</p>\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=70: -->\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-224484763\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://groovecoder.com/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/openid-84477.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://groovecoder.com/\">groovecoder</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-224484763\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-12T22:37:41\">2011-06-12T22:37:41</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">congrats man!</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-240411531&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://kosso.co.uk&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/kosso.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://kosso.co.uk&quot;&gt;kosso&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-240411531&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2011-07-02T03:51:00&quot;&gt;2011-07-02T03:51:00&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;*sniff*\n</code></pre><p>tis a beautiful thang. </p>\n<p>i miss having a great woman aside me on my life adventures. </p>\n<p>i wish some people were more easily replaceable. but their beauty is, is that they can&#39;t be.</p>\n<p>oh well. onwards. alone.</p>\n<p>for now.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
