Well, I putzed around and didn&#39;t get far, so I&#39;m starting\nover with something more immediately useful.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/images/badger-logo-working.png\" style=\"width:98%; display: block\" /></p>\n<p><em>(This is an awesome illustration by <a href=\"http://seanmartell.com/\">Sean\nMartell</a>, used entirely without permission.\nI&#39;ll take it down if anyone gets mad.)</em></p>\n<p>Almost a year ago, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2010/07/badger-article/\">I wrote about building a badging service for\nall of Mozilla</a>. </p>\n<p>In a nutshell, I left the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/gen/4784616521/\">2010 Mozilla Summit</a>\nwanting to build a tool that empowered people to craft social objects\nrepresenting achievement and gratitude, and give them to each other.</p>\n<p>Since then, I&#39;ve <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/badger\">played around with a prototype in Django with\nPinax</a>.  But, I abandoned that thing due to getting super\nbusy with the Firefox 4 release. It also didn&#39;t help that I was a\nDjango newb and that I got caught up in screwing around with shiny\nthings like <a href=\"http://pinaxproject.com\">Pinax</a> and <a href=\"http://lettuce.it\">Lettuce</a> and neglected the actual feature\nset.</p>\n<p>So now, finally, <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/badger2\">I&#39;m picking the thread back up again</a>. This\ntime, with a little less ambition and a few more practical aims.</p>\n<h3 id=\"make-something-more-useful-right-away\">Make something more useful right away</h3>\n<p>While I <em>have</em> spent some dangerous time screwing around with shinies like\n<a href=\"http://vagrantup.com\">Vagrant</a>, <a href=\"http://pupetlabs.com\">Puppet</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/playdoh\">Playdoh</a>, I think I&#39;ve gotten that\nmostly out of my system and have gotten down to work <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/badger2/commits/master\">as of last\nnight</a>.</p>\n<p>Rather than build a Grand Central Station for badges, I&#39;ve reset my\ngoals to a progression of practical results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a reusable Django app that supports some basic use cases of\ncreating and awarding badges to users.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms\">Activity Stream</a>s narrating <a href=\"http://wiki.activitystrea.ms/w/page/27189812/Badge\">badge claims</a></li>\n<li>Add support for <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PubSubHubbub</a> with Badger activity streams</li>\n<li>Add a REST API, maybe with OAuth</li>\n<li>Accept badges for local users, via <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PuSH</a> from\nexternal sites</li>\n<li>See what the <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges\">Open Badges Project</a> is up to, and how Badger can\nfit in with their goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea here is to make Badger a practical, reusable, drop-in app for\nexisting sites—preferably (but not necessarily) the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/playdoh\">Playdoh</a>-flavored sites we&#39;re building at Mozilla. Then,\nincrementally and optionally empower a Badger-enabled site to become a\nbadge hub by accepting reports of badge claims from other\nBadger-enabled sites.</p>\n<h3 id=\"take-baby-steps-to-federation\">Take baby steps to federation</h3>\n<p>So, for example, let&#39;s say we dropped Badger into a few sites like\nthese:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://developer.mozilla.org\">http://developer.mozilla.org</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.mozilla.com\">http://support.mozilla.com</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://addons.mozilla.org\">http://addons.mozilla.org</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At first, Badger would just augment those sites with badging\nfacilities for their respective user bases. That could fill some needs\nright away.</p>\n<p>Then, say we built a site that offered personal profiles to members of\nthe Mozilla community.  With the <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms\">Activity Stream</a> and <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PuSH</a>\naugmentations, users could connect their profiles with each of the\nother Mozilla sites they use.  That way, whenever they claim a badge\nout there, it gets delivered to their community profile.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-bother-federating-at-all-\">Why bother federating at all?</h3>\n<p>If the only cross-site goal to build an all-in-one display case for\nbadges on a community profile, I could just build JSON feeds and wrap\nthem in a JS-based widget. In fact, <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/1.0/\">a JSON-formatted Activity\nStream</a> will work nicely for that. Drop that into the profile\npage, and we&#39;re done.</p>\n<p>There are lots of reasons to federate. But, at least one thing not supported by\nthis solution are <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2010/07/badger-article/#section-105\">meta-badges</a>. That is, badges awarded for badges.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s say you close 100 bugs on Bugzilla, answer 100 questions on\nSUMO, edit 100 pages of documentation on MDN, and author 100 add-ons.\nAnd, let&#39;s say you get badges on the respective sites for all of those\nactivities.</p>\n<p>Well, now, I&#39;d like to give you a badge on your community profile for\nbeing a <strong>Mozilla Superhero</strong>. I could just do that by hand, having\nobserved all your greatness. But, I&#39;d rather the system just do that\nautomatically.</p>\n<p>If your community profile treated all your badges from your chosen affiliated\nsites as first-class citizens, then I could build the meta-badge\ntrigger right there.</p>\n<p>Of course, I could also write a program that monitors badge feeds from\nvarious sites. Then, use the community profile site&#39;s Badger API to\nissue a badge when the conditions are met. But, as maintainer of the\nmonitoring program, I&#39;d have to keep track of what feeds where count\nfor which people, which could be a mess.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s still some thinking to do here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-about-identity-and-co-opting-badges-\">What about identity and co-opting badges?</h3>\n<p>I&#39;m still thinking through how someone connects a profile to other\nsites. As in, how can Badger ensure that the owner of the community\nprofile is also the owner of a badge claim feed on MDN?  Maybe some\nkind of OAuth dance that results in a <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PuSH</a> subscription between\nsites?</p>\n<p>Consider the least-capable federation case: a Badger-compatible feed\nhosted as a static file on Amazon S3. And, by Badger-compatible, I\nmean an <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms\">Activity Stream</a> that contains <a href=\"http://wiki.activitystrea.ms/w/page/27189812/Badge\">badge claims</a>. You\nshouldn&#39;t need my specific implementation of Badger-in-Django to\nproduce one of those.</p>\n<p>Although <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PuSH</a> is still the ideal case (I think), occasional\npolling of an <a href=\"http://activitystrea.ms\">Activity Stream</a> feed should still be supported. If a\nuser connects that up to their community profile, we just have to take\ntheir word for it. We&#39;d rely on community members to\nflag stinkers trying to claim badge feeds that aren&#39;t theirs.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, there&#39;s probably some crypto-voodoo we can invoke here,\nfor cases where badge claim validity really matters—as opposed to the\nfun and games I have in mind for Mozilla.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-about-the-open-badges-project-\">What about the Open Badges Project?</h3>\n<p>From various conversations over the past year, it sounds to me like\nthe <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges\">Open Badges Project</a> is getting the parts in place to do even\nmore interesting federation of badges that gives ownership of the\nbadge hub to the user.</p>\n<p>In that scenario, you have a backpack in your browser and can carry\nyour badge claims with you between sites with no prior coordination\nbetween the sites themselves. </p>\n<p>This sounds like something in which Badger should be able to\nparticipate, eventually. If not as a hub, Badger should at least offer\nthe tools to create and award badges that work with the user-owned hub\nscheme.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-what-next-\">So, what next?</h3>\n<p>Now that I&#39;ve written all this out, I need to hack on it. If you&#39;re\ninterested in this stuff, let me know. That way, it&#39;ll look like\nsomeone might actually find this stuff handy when I get something\nworking!</p>\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=70: -->\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-256743407\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=afd2a7efeaad01509a571bae031dfc5c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">David Boswell</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-256743407\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-07-19T01:18:24\">2011-07-19T01:18:24</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Very cool to see an update on Badger.

(I&#39;d even got as far as knocking up a data-model in web2py.) And then I saw this.</p>\n<p>I quickly cloned and tried out your app with an ordinary Django project but it&#39;s blowing up without jingo and I guess other Playdoh related modules. Are you committed to Playdoh for Badger2 ?</p>\n<p></div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;ul class=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-278514925&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/lmorchard.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/&quot;&gt;Les Orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-278514925&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2011-08-05T18:05:31&quot;&gt;2011-08-05T18:05:31&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;I&#39;m committed to Playdoh insofar as my initial users will probably be my co-workers at Mozilla, who are all building Playdoh-based sites.\n</code></pre><p>But, there&#39;s no reason why it shouldn&#39;t eventually work with vanilla Django. It&#39;s using core template loaders and shortcuts, so switching over to standard stuff shouldn&#39;t be an issue for the views and models.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m hoping at some point to put together some more Django-conventional template tags and templates toward that end, unless someone gets to it before me in a pull request (patches welcome!). Really, I think the template tags are the more important thing, since any templates out of the box will likely get overridden on a real site.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-301119028&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.integrating-technology.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/nelliemuller.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.integrating-technology.org/&quot;&gt;Dr. Nellie Deutsch&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-301119028&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2011-09-02T14:07:45&quot;&gt;2011-09-02T14:07:45&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;I love the idea, Leslie.
