You see,\none of my hobbies is turning myself into a human content filter for\nfriends on the web.</p>\n<p>And, honestly, having my sharing habits shaken up by the\n<a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/11/01/readerpocalypse\">Readerpocalypse</a> makes it fun again.</p>\n<p>The image over to the right is an attempt I made to diagram some of my\nsocial media flow. It&#39;s incomplete, though: I&#39;m a cheapsake and ran\nout of free objects in my diagram. So, I had to leave out at least a\nhalf-dozen more services and a dozen additional connections.\n(<a href=\"http://www.lucidchart.com/\">LucidChart</a> is very nice, by the way.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"in-other-words-ifttt-com-is-awesome\">In other words, ifttt.com is awesome</h2>\n<p>In particular, I&#39;ve finally spent some time with <a href=\"http://ifttt.com\">ifttt.com</a>. It&#39;s\nlike <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automator_%28software%29\">Automator</a> for the social web. It lets you <a href=\"http://ifttt.com/people/lmorchard\">define event\ntriggers from one site that cause actions on another site</a>. </p>\n<p>So, I&#39;ve gone crazy and created a bunch of tasks that make things like\nthe following possible:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">Pinboard</a> bookmarks based on favorites from\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lmorchard/favorites\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://identi.ca/lmorchard/favorites\">identi.ca</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/lmorchard\">YouTube</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/user/deusx/library/loved\">Last.fm</a>, and my <a href=\"https://kindle.amazon.com/profile/Leslie-Michael-Orchard/1056858\">Kindle</a> highlights. I&#39;m turning my\n<a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">Pinboard</a> account into both my personal social media archive and\na Google Reader sharing replacement, and I don&#39;t even have to beg\nfor new features at <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">Pinboard</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://lmorchard.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a> photo posts based on <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=6f374b46f1b9a132972b262f2d85b7db&amp;_render=rss\">Reddit up-votes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/favorites/\">Flickr\nfavorites</a>, and <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">Pinboard</a> bookmarks tagged &quot;<a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx/t:to:tumblr\">to:tumblr</a>&quot;.\nSince creating it, I&#39;ve left my <a href=\"http://lmorchard.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a> almost entirely\nneglectedâ€”but now with <a href=\"http://ifttt.com\">ifttt.com</a>, I can route almost every nifty\nimage I find over to that thing. It&#39;s the right side of my outboard\nbrain to the <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">Pinboard</a> left.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Published items from from my private installation of <a href=\"http://tt-rss.org/\">Tiny Tiny RSS</a> \nend up shared on <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:deusx\">Pinboard</a>. This pretty much scratches my itch\nfor feed reader sharing, since <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/11/01/readerpocalypse\">Google nixed those features from\nReader</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Starred items from <a href=\"http://tt-rss.org/\">tt-rss</a> get sent to\n<a href=\"http://www.instapaper.com/\">Instapaper</a>, so I can read them on my <a href=\"https://kindle.amazon.com/profile/Leslie-Michael-Orchard/1056858\">Kindle</a> later. If <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/132482782709555200\">email\ndelivery of documents start working</a>, then I&#39;ll have a\npersonal long-attention span newspaper delivered regularly to that\ngadget.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Posts from <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/114487965928288927815/posts\">Google+</a> get copied over to <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/lmorchard\">Facebook</a>, because I\ndon&#39;t want to pick sides.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In fact, almost everything I do everywhere eventually ends up posted\nto <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/lmorchard\">Facebook</a>, because I almost never post anything in person over\nthere. I do have friends and family over there and respond to\ncomments, though.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-the-point-\">What&#39;s the point?</h2>\n<p>The important principle here is that I&#39;m lazy. If there&#39;s a single\nbutton to click somewhere that expresses my happiness about a thing,\nI&#39;d like to click it and have that happiness shared and archived\nelsewhere without me doing much (or anything) more. The scheme I have\nnow feels pretty good for that, and <a href=\"http://ifttt.com\">ifttt.com</a> does a huge amount\nto help.</p>\n<p>The other important thing is that <strong>I am at the center of these\nconnections</strong>. I don&#39;t live entirely on any single service, and\nanything I care about is archived where I can easily grab it for\nbackups or mashups. Should any particular service node in this web\nfail, I can probably do without, find an alternative, or build one\nmyself. </p>\n<p>My goal is to eventually replace as many of these nodes as possible\nwith self-hosted or at least Open Source derived services. (Though, of\ncourse, I&#39;m also lazy and my friends are where they are. So, that goal\nwill take awhile.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"one-more-thing-\">One more thing...</h2>\n<p>I&#39;ve got <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tinkering-with-activity-streams\">an idea for my next book simmering</a>. And, since I&#39;ve\nso far managed to write books about the major things I&#39;ve done for\nfun, I feel I&#39;d be remiss if I skipped this stuff. I mean, I sort of\ncovered the same ground all in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764597582?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;c%0D%0Areative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0764597582\">my first</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470037857?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;%0D%0Acreative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470037857\">second</a> books, but\nthings have progressed since then.</p>\n<p>What this means is that all the above feels like a warm up for the\ncoding and prosing I&#39;ll need to do. I just need to get my shit\ntogether and carve out the time to make it happen.</p>\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=mkd textwidth=70: -->\n"}
