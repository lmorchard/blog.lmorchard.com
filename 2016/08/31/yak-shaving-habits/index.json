I told myself it was a good night to get this done. I made plans to start working on it after dinner.  I cooked dinner. I ate dinner and had a beer. I sat down on the couch... and all I wanted to do was anything else but write.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recursive-yak-shaving\">Recursive yak shaving</h2>\n<p>Let's see, what did I do instead? I'd mused in my journal that I needed a different venue to get myself into the ritual mindset to write. I write my daily pages at the kitchen island over breakfast. That's a way easier environment for focusing on that task than my workaday desk with my laptop and all that entails.</p>\n<p>So, that means I went to the kitchen island with notebook &amp; pen and started writing, right? Nope. </p>\n<p>I went to the basement to dig out an old laptop. I wanted something to write a blog post with fewer distractions. I dug up a ChromeBook, a MacBook, and an Android tablet with a keyboard. Surely one of those things would be handy for writing! (Why I didn't also dig up <a href=\"http://www.tankraider.com/DOSPALMTOP/prolinearps1000.html\">my old 80x24 DOS palmtop from 1993</a>, I'm not sure. That thing's nifty and I used to write with it back in college!)</p>\n<div class=\"pullquote right\">\nSo, that means I went to the kitchen island with notebook &amp; pen and started writing, right? Nope. \n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the way out of the basement, I noticed the unassembled comic book boxes I'd been meaning to put together. So, I put them together. I considered reorganizing some comics from their 20+ year old boxes into the new ones. But, no, I decided: That was too far off task. I'll get to that later.</p>\n<p>Continuing on, I considered my Tempest arcade machine. The screen's still not working on that thing, and I've been meaning to fix it most of the last year. I moved to pop open the back, but stopped. Again, too far off task!</p>\n<p>I made it upstairs with the laptops and the tablet. I got to the kitchen and plugged things in to charge. The tablet wouldn't get past the boot-up screen. Okay, forget the tablet. The MacBook booted into... Ubuntu Linux? I forgot I did that with this machine. I forgot my password. Wi-fi didn't work. Deal with that later. </p>\n<p>The ChromeBook booted up fine. But, for some reason, I suddenly decided it needed to have <a href=\"https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton\">Crouton</a> and Ubuntu installed. You know, so I could run git &amp; node &amp; gulp to preview my blog post and publish when I was done. So, I started on that. <a href=\"https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton\">Crouton</a>'s nifty and it was up &amp; running with less fuss than I expected. I got all my tools installed, and had my blog building before I knew it.</p>\n<p>Then, around 10pm, I moved back to the couch and my Windows PC. I opened up a text editor, a shell running my blog, and a browser for previews - all of which, mind you, I've had set up and working fine on that Windows machine for the past year at least. I put on headphones and started <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/16MILExMR5RIvzTIII2YnH\">Killing Joke</a> on Spotify. I assembled photos and drafted the blog post for GameChord. Finally, around 3am, I published it. Then, I went to bed.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Finally wrote about GameChord, the little 1-handed keypad I made this summer <a href=\"https://t.co/fUCv6o5M6l\">https://t.co/fUCv6o5M6l</a></p>— Les Orchard (@lmorchard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/770881246020800512\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So, umm, yeah.
