        <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Writing is apparently so important to me that I procrastinate like crazy rather than risk failing at it.</p>

<p>In composing this, I fully recognize the danger of disappearing up my own backside. The thing is, I want to write more. And, it was pretty cool I managed to get something posted last night. But, the process of doing so ended up way more convoluted than it should have been. So, I want to share the story and invite public ridicule.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So I told myself that I should do some writing tonight, but now that it's tonight all I want to do is drink booze and play video games.</p>— Les Orchard (@lmorchard) <a href="https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/770771394816729088">August 30, 2016</a></blockquote>



<p>It started with yesterday morning's journal pages. I told myself it was a good night to get this done. I made plans to start working on it after dinner.  I cooked dinner. I ate dinner and had a beer. I sat down on the couch... and all I wanted to do was anything else but write.</p>
<h2 id="recursive-yak-shaving">Recursive yak shaving</h2>
<p>Let's see, what did I do instead? I'd mused in my journal that I needed a different venue to get myself into the ritual mindset to write. I write my daily pages at the kitchen island over breakfast. That's a way easier environment for focusing on that task than my workaday desk with my laptop and all that entails.</p>
<p>So, that means I went to the kitchen island with notebook &amp; pen and started writing, right? Nope. </p>
<p>I went to the basement to dig out an old laptop. I wanted something to write a blog post with fewer distractions. I dug up a ChromeBook, a MacBook, and an Android tablet with a keyboard. Surely one of those things would be handy for writing! (Why I didn't also dig up <a href="http://www.tankraider.com/DOSPALMTOP/prolinearps1000.html">my old 80x24 DOS palmtop from 1993</a>, I'm not sure. That thing's nifty and I used to write with it back in college!)</p>
<div class="pullquote right">

</div>



<p>On the way out of the basement, I noticed the unassembled comic book boxes I'd been meaning to put together. So, I put them together. I considered reorganizing some comics from their 20+ year old boxes into the new ones. But, no, I decided: That was too far off task. I'll get to that later.</p>
<p>Continuing on, I considered my Tempest arcade machine. The screen's still not working on that thing, and I've been meaning to fix it most of the last year. I moved to pop open the back, but stopped. Again, too far off task!</p>
<p>I made it upstairs with the laptops and the tablet. I got to the kitchen and plugged things in to charge. The tablet wouldn't get past the boot-up screen. Okay, forget the tablet. The MacBook booted into... Ubuntu Linux? I forgot I did that with this machine. I forgot my password. Wi-fi didn't work. Deal with that later. </p>
<p>The ChromeBook booted up fine. But, for some reason, I suddenly decided it needed to have <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">Crouton</a> and Ubuntu installed. You know, so I could run git &amp; node &amp; gulp to preview my blog post and publish when I was done. So, I started on that. <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">Crouton</a>'s nifty and it was up &amp; running with less fuss than I expected. I got all my tools installed, and had my blog building before I knew it.</p>
<p>Then, around 10pm, I moved back to the couch and my Windows PC. I opened up a text editor, a shell running my blog, and a browser for previews - all of which, mind you, I've had set up and working fine on that Windows machine for the past year at least. I put on headphones and started <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/16MILExMR5RIvzTIII2YnH">Killing Joke</a> on Spotify. I assembled photos and drafted the blog post for GameChord. Finally, around 3am, I published it. Then, I went to bed.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finally wrote about GameChord, the little 1-handed keypad I made this summer <a href="https://t.co/fUCv6o5M6l">https://t.co/fUCv6o5M6l</a></p>— Les Orchard (@lmorchard) <a href="https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/770881246020800512">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>



<p>So, umm, yeah. Did you notice that I never used the tablet, the MacBook, or the ChromeBook at any point? The comic books didn't come in handy, either.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/28511732042/in/datetaken-public/" title="20160728_200320"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8782/28511732042_815448af85.jpg" alt="20160728_200320" class="inset wide right" width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/28511732042/in/datetaken-public/">I built worktables out of 2x4s and plywood</a>. It was my first time really working with wood since shop class in High School. But, I did it: Found plans. Found a lumberyard. Got lumber &amp; tools. Picked a weekend and got super sweaty in the garage making lots of mistakes with wood. I produced a pair of crude but solid worktables.</p>
<p>Building GameChord was similar: I started researching &amp; tinkering until I had something working. I even managed to get myself out of the house to talk to actual people and join up as a member at <a href="https://i3detroit.org/">i3Detroit</a>. No small measure of social terror involved, there. It took me a few months, but I managed to move the project along to completion.</p>
<p>But, somehow, the notion of writing drives me to insane <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html">yak shaving</a> diversions in the basement. </p>
<p>This morning, back at the kitchen island, I had a post-mortem over coffee. What I managed to wring out of myself is that I've stuck writing up on a scary high pedestal.</p>
<p>If I don't make another table or keyboard, that's cool: I've never considered myself <strong>A Woodworker</strong> or <strong>A Keyboard Maker</strong>. Those things aren't as crucial to my self-image, I guess. For as long as I can remember, though, I've wanted to be <strong>A Writer</strong>. The trouble is that actually engaging in the process of writing means I might discover that, you know, I might be <strong>Not A Writer</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-past-this">How to get past this?</h2>
<p>The funny thing is that I <em>have</em> written a bunch. I really like words. I've been told I'm good at it. <a href="http://amzn.to/2bW4moK">A book publisher even paid me for it, more than once!</a></p>
<p>I also know I produce some terrible stuff. But, writers I admire have admitted the same. The key is to just keep writing and get better. Clean up the junk in editing.</p>
<p>What to do, then, to stop all the procrastination &amp; avoidance?</p>
<p>The best answer I have is nothing clever: Write more. No lifehacks. Just get over myself and write more. Be a writer by writing and let the failure wash over me. Then write some more - maybe even write about feeling like a failure. Write embarassing things and invite ridicule. Disappear up my own backside and turn inside out. (Wait, that last one sounds unpleasant. I should edit that out.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess I don't really have a conclusion. Do you, dear reader, have any better advice? I'd like to hear it.</p>
