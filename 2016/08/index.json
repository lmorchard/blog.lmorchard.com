Well, I\nfinished this GameChord thing back in July after about 5 months of occasional\nwork. But, I&#39;ve been too busy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/770771394816729088\">drinking booze\nand playing video games</a> \nto get my butt in a chair and write about it.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s see if I can fix that now...</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-design\">The design</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/##@_name=gamechord&amp;author=lmorchard;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@_r:35&amp;rx:2.5&amp;ry:3.5&amp;y:-1&amp;x:1;&amp;=a&amp;=b&amp;=c\"><img class=\"inset left\"\nsrc=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/keyboard-layout.png\"></a></p>\n<p>I started doodling with key layouts and <a href=\"http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/##@_name=gamechord&amp;author=lmorchard;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@_r:35&amp;rx:2.5&amp;ry:3.5&amp;y:-1&amp;x:1;&amp;=a&amp;=b&amp;=c\">came up with\nthis</a>. Only 18 switches, but enough for gaming. At the\ntime, I was putting a lot of hours into Elite\nDangerous, so this felt promising as a spaceship control pad.<br><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24872268889/\"><img class=\"inset right\" src=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/paper-planning.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24781232904/in/datetaken-public/\"><img class=\"inset right\" src=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/cats-happen.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Over on <a href=\"http://builder.swillkb.com/\">builder.swillkb.com</a>, I plonked in the JSON from <a href=\"http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/##@_name=gamechord&amp;author=lmorchard;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@_r:35&amp;rx:2.5&amp;ry:3.5&amp;y:-1&amp;x:1;&amp;=a&amp;=b&amp;=c\">Keyboard\nLayout Editor</a> and came up with some SVG files that printed\nup nicely.</p>\n<p>That gave me a paper mockup of a mounting plate for key switches. I had some\nclear keycaps, so I dropped them onto the paper to get a sense for how it\nwould feel under my hand.</p>\n<p>Of course, cats happen - so those keycaps didn&#39;t stay put for very long. But,\nthat&#39;s okay. Nothing wandered off too far, and I got what I needed from\nthe mess on my desk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"making-the-case\">Making the case</h2>\n<p>Back when <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2016/02/06/keyboard-hacking/\">I first started thinking about building a\nkeyboard</a>, I\nassumed I&#39;d send off whatever design files I came up with to a place\nlike <a href=\"https://www.ponoko.com/\">Ponoko</a> and get the mounting plate made for me.</p>\n<p>Prices at those places were just a bit higher than I liked, though. I also\nsuspected things wouldn&#39;t work with my first attempt. I wanted to be able\nto iterate without it taking days or weeks to learn from my mistakes\nand refine.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s when I remembered <a href=\"https://i3detroit.org\">i3Detroit</a> was just down the road. I&#39;d been\nmeaning to get over there for a couple of years: Among other things, the space\nhas <a href=\"https://www.i3detroit.org/wiki/Category:Laser_Cutter\">nice laser cutters</a> that I really wish I&#39;d used <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/02/10/building-my-couch-computing-station/\">back when\nI butchered some plastic to make a terrible PC monitor case</a>. </p>\n<p>A month or so later, I&#39;d gotten through the new member onboarding process\nand a few training sessions with the laser cutter. I had some\nacrylic sheets still on hand, so I gave my design a shot:</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/25839524664/\" title=\"Cutting a keyboard mounting plate on a laser cutter\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1506/25839524664_3250860a23_c.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Cutting a keyboard mounting plate on a laser cutter\"></a></p>\n<p>Pretty sure I had the power too high and the speed too low for the run\nin this video. But, the result was not too bad for a first attempt.  I had a\nfew dozen Cherry MX Clear switches to play with, so I snapped them into the\nplate and put on the keycaps I&#39;d used in the paper mockup earlier:</p>\n<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/clear-keycaps.jpg\">\n\n<p>Still lots of work ahead, but I was feeling pretty accomplished after taking\nthis little glamour shot. I even took it into an <a href=\"https://i3detroit.org\">i3Detroit</a> member meeting\nfor show &amp; tell.</p>\n<h2 id=\"re-making-the-case\">Re-making the case</h2>\n<p>At this point, I&#39;d already heard the term &quot;kerf&quot;. Like a saw blade, the laser\nhas a width that destroys material while cutting. You want that on the\n<em>inside</em> edge of something like a key switch mounting hole, in order to keep\nthe dimensions correct. Unlike a blade, the laser is a cylindrical\nbeam that passes through a lens to form <a href=\"http://www.buildlog.net/blog/2013/05/why-are-my-laser-cut-edges-not-straight/\">something like an\nhourglass</a>. So, the\nkerf&#39;s shape depends on the lens focal length and the conical section that\nintersects with the material.</p>\n<p>Well, I didn&#39;t account for the kerf well enough in my first plate. All the key\nswitches were wobbly. Some would just fall out if I flipped\nthe thing over. Time for some of those iterations I\nfigured I&#39;d have to end up doing.</p>\n<img class=\"inset wide right\" src=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/kerf-is-real.jpg\">\n\n<p>I know the saying is &quot;measure twice, cut once&quot; - but in this case it was\neasier to measure by cutting! I tried mounting holes with a sampling of kerf\nwidths until I found one that matched the key switch tolerances. Not so snug\nthat it cracked the plate, but not so loose that it wiggled or fell out. </p>\n<p>Once I found a good laser focus and figured out the kerf, I\nattacked another sheet of acrylic with the laser to produce another\niteration of the case.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/26975072884/\"><img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/glamour-shot.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Two changes you might notice: I added slots to glue in some socket\nheaders, so I could unplug or replace the Teensy without soldering. I also found some\n<a href=\"http://dro.ps/b/x3g0KCy\">relegendable keycaps</a> on Massdrop - they have little removable covers that\ntake 14mm paper squares.

Well, I\nfinished this GameChord thing back in July after about 5 months of occasional\nwork. But, I've been too busy [drinking booze\nand playing video games](https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/770771394816729088) \nto get my butt in a chair and write about it.\n\nLet's see if I can fix that now...\n\n[keyboardhacking]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2016/02/06/keyboard-hacking/\n\n## The design\n\n[<img class=\"inset left\"\nsrc=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/keyboard-layout.png\">][layoutpermalink]\n\nI started doodling with key layouts and [came up with\nthis][layoutpermalink]. Only 18 switches, but enough for gaming. At the\ntime, I was putting a lot of hours into Elite\nDangerous, so this felt promising as a spaceship control pad.  \n[<img class=\"inset right\" src=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/paper-planning.jpg\">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24872268889/)\n\n[<img class=\"inset right\" src=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/cats-happen.jpg\">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24781232904/in/datetaken-public/)\n\nOver on [builder.swillkb.com][builder], I plonked in the JSON from [Keyboard\nLayout Editor][layoutpermalink] and came up with some SVG files that printed\nup nicely.\n\nThat gave me a paper mockup of a mounting plate for key switches. I had some\nclear keycaps, so I dropped them onto the paper to get a sense for how it\nwould feel under my hand.\n\nOf course, cats happen - so those keycaps didn't stay put for very long. But,\nthat's okay. Nothing wandered off too far, and I got what I needed from\nthe mess on my desk.\n\n[builder]: http://builder.swillkb.com/\n\n## Making the case\n\nBack when [I first started thinking about building a\nkeyboard][keyboardhacking], I\nassumed I'd send off whatever design files I came up with to a place\nlike [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/) and get the mounting plate made for me.\n\nPrices at those places were just a bit higher than I liked, though. I also\nsuspected things wouldn't work with my first attempt. I wanted to be able\nto iterate without it taking days or weeks to learn from my mistakes\nand refine.\n\nThat's when I remembered [i3Detroit][] was just down the road. I'd been\nmeaning to get over there for a couple of years: Among other things, the space\nhas [nice laser cutters][lasercutters] that I really wish I'd used [back when\nI butchered some plastic to make a terrible PC monitor case][monitorcase]. \n\n[lasercutters]: https://www.i3detroit.org/wiki/Category:Laser_Cutter\n[monitorcase]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/02/10/building-my-couch-computing-station/\n[i3Detroit]: https://i3detroit.org\n\nA month or so later, I'd gotten through the new member onboarding process\nand a few training sessions with the laser cutter. I had some\nacrylic sheets still on hand, so I gave my design a shot:\n\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/25839524664/\" title=\"Cutting a keyboard mounting plate on a laser cutter\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1506/25839524664_3250860a23_c.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Cutting a keyboard mounting plate on a laser cutter\"></a>\n\nPretty sure I had the power too high and the speed too low for the run\nin this video. But, the result was not too bad for a first attempt.  I had a\nfew dozen Cherry MX Clear switches to play with, so I snapped them into the\nplate and put on the keycaps I'd used in the paper mockup earlier:\n\n<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/clear-keycaps.jpg\">\n\nStill lots of work ahead, but I was feeling pretty accomplished after taking\nthis little glamour shot. I even took it into an [i3Detroit][] member meeting\nfor show & tell.\n\n## Re-making the case\n\nAt this point, I'd already heard the term \"kerf\". Like a saw blade, the laser\nhas a width that destroys material while cutting. You want that on the\n*inside* edge of something like a key switch mounting hole, in order to keep\nthe dimensions correct. Unlike a blade, the laser is a cylindrical\nbeam that passes through a lens to form [something like an\nhourglass][beamshape]. So, the\nkerf's shape depends on the lens focal length and the conical section that\nintersects with the material.\n\n[beamshape]: http://www.buildlog.net/blog/2013/05/why-are-my-laser-cut-edges-not-straight/\n\nWell, I didn't account for the kerf well enough in my first plate. All the key\nswitches were wobbly. Some would just fall out if I flipped\nthe thing over. Time for some of those iterations I\nfigured I'd have to end up doing.\n\n<img class=\"inset wide right\" src=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/kerf-is-real.jpg\">\n\nI know the saying is \"measure twice, cut once\" - but in this case it was\neasier to measure by cutting! I tried mounting holes with a sampling of kerf\nwidths until I found one that matched the key switch tolerances. Not so snug\nthat it cracked the plate, but not so loose that it wiggled or fell out. \n\nOnce I found a good laser focus and figured out the kerf, I\nattacked another sheet of acrylic with the laser to produce another\niteration of the case.\n\n[<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/glamour-shot.jpg\">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/26975072884/)\n\nTwo changes you might notice: I added slots to glue in some socket\nheaders, so I could unplug or replace the Teensy without soldering. I also found some\n[relegendable keycaps][] on Massdrop - they have little removable covers that\ntake 14mm paper squares. I figured that would come in handy for crazy\nkey layouts I might come up with.\n\n[relegendable keycaps]: http://dro.ps/b/x3g0KCy\n\n## Wiring up the key matrix\n\nI haven't learned how to design circuit boards yet, so I figured I'd just\nhandwire this [like I saw in the video][handwirevideo]. Only 18 switches, so\nhow bad could it be?\nTurns out, it's rather annoying.
