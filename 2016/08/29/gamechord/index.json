Well, I\nfinished this GameChord thing back in July after about 5 months of occasional\nwork.

Only 18 switches, but enough for gaming.

I also\nsuspected things wouldn&#39;t work with my first attempt. I wanted to be able\nto iterate without it taking days or weeks to learn from my mistakes\nand refine.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s when I remembered <a href=\"https://i3detroit.org\">i3Detroit</a> was just down the road. I&#39;d been\nmeaning to get over there for a couple of years: Among other things, the space\nhas <a href=\"https://www.i3detroit.org/wiki/Category:Laser_Cutter\">nice laser cutters</a> that I really wish I&#39;d used <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/02/10/building-my-couch-computing-station/\">back when\nI butchered some plastic to make a terrible PC monitor case</a>. </p>\n<p>A month or so later, I&#39;d gotten through the new member onboarding process\nand a few training sessions with the laser cutter.

I had a\nfew dozen Cherry MX Clear switches to play with, so I snapped them into the\nplate and put on the keycaps I&#39;d used in the paper mockup earlier:</p>\n<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/clear-keycaps.jpg\">\n\n<p>Still lots of work ahead, but I was feeling pretty accomplished after taking\nthis little glamour shot.

So, the\nkerf&#39;s shape depends on the lens focal length and the conical section that\nintersects with the material.</p>\n<p>Well, I didn&#39;t account for the kerf well enough in my first plate. All the key\nswitches were wobbly. Some would just fall out if I flipped\nthe thing over.

The diodes serve to prevent <a href=\"https://deskthority.net/wiki/Rollover,_blocking_and_ghosting\">ghosting when\nmultiple keys are pressed</a>. </p>\n<p>Then, I stripped sections of wires to\nrun as columns down the left-hand pin of the switches. </p>\n<p>The remaining\ninsulation ensures the column wires don&#39;t short against the row diodes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wiring-up-the-teensy\">Wiring up the Teensy</h2>\n<img class=\"inset wide left\" src=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/teensy-wired-up.jpg\">\n\n<p>This matrix gives me 4 rows (counting the thumb switches) and 5 columns - or 9\nI/O pins to scan 18 switches.</p>\n<p>Except for <a href=\"https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=72804.0\">magical PD6</a> - which is hardwired to an onboard LED - just\nabout every pin is fair game on the Teensy for rows or columns. </p>\n<p>So, I tried to pick a set that would be easiest to route wires. Since this\ncase is transparent, I wanted to keep things visually interesting with\ndifferent colored wires and a neat shape to the runs.</p>\n<p>Of course, I botched things a bit and marred the acrylic by splashing\nsolder and slipping with the iron a few times. But, maybe no one will really\nnotice.</p>\n<p>If I had to do this over again - and I <em>still</em> hadn&#39;t learned how to make a\nPCB - I&#39;d probably try using something thinner like <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/1446\">30AWG repair\nwire</a>. That seems like it would thread through the spaces much\nbetter, which would be even more important for a board with many more\nswitches. </p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: both\">Programming the Teensy</h2>\n\n<p>I based <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/gamechord\">the GameChord firmware</a> on the great <a href=\"https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard\">tmk\nfirmware</a> that seems popular on mech keyboard forums.</p>\n<p>Building <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/gamechord/blob/863295d2cbdbc7052a25e989a77c3448796e67a6/matrix.c\">the matrix</a> was easy: The firmware scans through rows (DF0, DF1,\nDF4, and DF5) by pulling each low in turn. The columns (DB4, DB5, DB6, DF7,\nand DF6) are set as &quot;active low&quot; pins - which means keys pressed in the\ncurrent scan row get connected to ground and read as signals. So,\nI wrote the functions to manipulate &amp; read the appropriate row &amp; column pins,\nrespectively. </p>\n<p>It was almost <em>too</em> easy:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Holy crap.

So,\nI wrote the functions to manipulate & read the appropriate row & column pins,\nrespectively. \n\nIt was almost *too* easy:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Holy crap. My attempt at setting up firmware for my newly wired DIY keypad worked first time. How does this happen. <a href=\"https://t.co/xWESzku4Lp\">https://t.co/xWESzku4Lp</a></p>&mdash; Les Orchard (@lmorchard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/746518856328372225\">June 25, 2016</a></blockquote>\n\nFrom there, I built [a dead simple key map][plainmap] with just enough\nkeys to play [Overwatch][]:\n\n```c\n#include \"keymap_common.h\"\n\nconst uint8_t PROGMEM keymaps[][MATRIX_ROWS][MATRIX_COLS] = {\n    KEYMAP( ESC,   1,    2,    3,    T, \\\n            TAB,   Q,    W,    E,    R, \\\n           LSFT,   A,    S,    D,    F, \\\n             NO,  NO, LCTL,  SPC,    C),\n};\nconst uint16_t PROGMEM fn_actions[] = {};\n```\n\nI got it all working and had myself a nice evening of pushing carts and taking\nobjectives.\n\n<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/test-run-on-gaming-station.jpg\">\n\n[the matrix]: https://github.com/lmorchard/gamechord/blob/863295d2cbdbc7052a25e989a77c3448796e67a6/matrix.c\n[plainmap]: https://github.com/lmorchard/gamechord/blob/863295d2cbdbc7052a25e989a77c3448796e67a6/keymap_plain.c\n[gamechordfirmware]: https://github.com/lmorchard/gamechord\n[tmk firmware]: https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard\n[overwatch]: https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/\n\n## Going crazy with chording\n\nI had all these [relegendable keycaps][] and this crazy flexible [tmk\nfirmware][] - so I decided to try implementing [a complex and fully impractical\nkeymap based on chords with the thumb keys][halfqwerty].\n\n[halfqwerty]: https://github.com/lmorchard/gamechord/blob/863295d2cbdbc7052a25e989a77c3448796e67a6/keymap_halfqwerty.c\n\n<img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/gamechord/finished-key-legends.jpg\">\n\nGiven two thumb keys in combination, I can get 4 layers out of the other 15\nkeys - for a total of 60 keys. The firmware also [lets me distinguish\nbetween keys held or just tapped][taps], which gives me a few more layers or\nmodifier keys.\n\n[taps]: https://github.com/lmorchard/gamechord/blob/863295d2cbdbc7052a25e989a77c3448796e67a6/keymap_halfqwerty.c#L43\n\nLong story short, I can get most of the functionality of a regular keyboard\nout of just one hand. All I have to do is just get used to putting my left\nhand through some very awkward and uncomfortable contortions until I get up to\nfull typing speed!\n\n[As I've written before][steamcontroller], I do really like odd input devices.\nBut, this got old fast. This isn't so much a practical peripheral as a thing I\ndid because I could. It gave me an excuse to explore the firmware more\nand to use Inkscape to design some legends for my nifty keycaps.\n\n[steamcontroller]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2016/02/05/steam-controller/\n\n## Showing it off\n\nAnd just to wrap things up, this happened:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I even have a project out in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i3Detroit\">@i3Detroit</a> tent at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MakerFaireDetroit?src=hash\">#MakerFaireDetroit</a> ! <a href=\"https://t.co/v0goD3DCBk\">pic.twitter.com/v0goD3DCBk</a></p>&mdash; Les Orchard (@lmorchard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/759400946514427904\">July 30, 2016</a></blockquote>\n\nThis was the first summer I went to [Maker Faire Detroit][] as a Maker. I\nhelped for a bit at the [i3Detroit][] tent, mainly just standing and smiling\nat the front table as folks walked in. But, I had my little keyboard out there\non a table, with a project card and everything.\n\nIt and I were only there for a handful of hours, but it's pretty satisfying to\nhave actually gotten this thing done!\n\n[maker faire detroit]: http://www.makerfairedetroit.com/\n[laservideo]: https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/25839524664/\n[layoutpermalink]: http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/##@_name=gamechord&author=lmorchard;&@=1&=2&=3&=4&=5;&@=1&=2&=3&=4&=5;&@=1&=2&=3&=4&=5;&@_r:35&rx:2.5&ry:3.5&y:-1&x:1;&=a&=b&=c\n\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<!-- vim: set wrap wm=5 syntax=markdown textwidth=78: -->\n",
