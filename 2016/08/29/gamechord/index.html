        <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: I made a USB keypad that's good for gaming and typing entirely with

<nav role="navigation" class="table-of-contents"></nav>

<p>So, remember back in February when I said that <a href="http://blog.lmorchard.com/2016/02/06/keyboard-hacking/">keyboard hacking seems like
fun</a>?  Well, I
finished this GameChord thing back in July after about 5 months of occasional
work. But, I've been too busy <a href="https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/770771394816729088">drinking booze
and playing video games</a> 
to get my butt in a chair and write about it.</p>
<p>Let's see if I can fix that now...</p>
<h2 id="the-design">The design</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/##@_name=gamechord&amp;author=lmorchard;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@_r:35&amp;rx:2.5&amp;ry:3.5&amp;y:-1&amp;x:1;&amp;=a&amp;=b&amp;=c"><img class="inset left" src="/uploads/2016/gamechord/keyboard-layout.png" width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>I started doodling with key layouts and <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/##@_name=gamechord&amp;author=lmorchard;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@_r:35&amp;rx:2.5&amp;ry:3.5&amp;y:-1&amp;x:1;&amp;=a&amp;=b&amp;=c">came up with
this</a>. Only 18 switches, but enough for gaming. At the
time, I was putting a lot of hours into Elite
Dangerous, so this felt promising as a spaceship control pad.<br><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24872268889/"><img class="inset right" src="/uploads/2016/gamechord/paper-planning.jpg" width="" height=""></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24781232904/in/datetaken-public/"><img class="inset right" src="/uploads/2016/gamechord/cats-happen.jpg" width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Over on <a href="http://builder.swillkb.com/">builder.swillkb.com</a>, I plonked in the JSON from <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/##@_name=gamechord&amp;author=lmorchard;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@=1&amp;=2&amp;=3&amp;=4&amp;=5;&amp;@_r:35&amp;rx:2.5&amp;ry:3.5&amp;y:-1&amp;x:1;&amp;=a&amp;=b&amp;=c">Keyboard
Layout Editor</a> and came up with some SVG files that printed
up nicely.</p>
<p>That gave me a paper mockup of a mounting plate for key switches. I had some
clear keycaps, so I dropped them onto the paper to get a sense for how it
would feel under my hand.</p>
<p>Of course, cats happen - so those keycaps didn't stay put for very long. But,
that's okay. Nothing wandered off too far, and I got what I needed from
the mess on my desk.</p>
<h2 id="making-the-case">Making the case</h2>
<p>Back when <a href="http://blog.lmorchard.com/2016/02/06/keyboard-hacking/">I first started thinking about building a
keyboard</a>, I
assumed I'd send off whatever design files I came up with to a place
like <a href="https://www.ponoko.com/">Ponoko</a> and get the mounting plate made for me.</p>
<p>Prices at those places were just a bit higher than I liked, though. I also
suspected things wouldn't work with my first attempt. I wanted to be able
to iterate without it taking days or weeks to learn from my mistakes
and refine.</p>
<p>That's when I remembered <a href="https://i3detroit.org">i3Detroit</a> was just down the road. I'd been
meaning to get over there for a couple of years: Among other things, the space
has <a href="https://www.i3detroit.org/wiki/Category:Laser_Cutter">nice laser cutters</a> that I really wish I'd used <a href="http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/02/10/building-my-couch-computing-station/">back when
I butchered some plastic to make a terrible PC monitor case</a>. </p>
<p>A month or so later, I'd gotten through the new member onboarding process
and a few training sessions with the laser cutter. I had some
acrylic sheets still on hand, so I gave my design a shot:</p>
<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/25839524664/" title="Cutting a keyboard mounting plate on a laser cutter"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1506/25839524664_3250860a23_c.jpg" width="" height="" alt="Cutting a keyboard mounting plate on a laser cutter"></a></p>
<p>Pretty sure I had the power too high and the speed too low for the run
in this video. But, the result was not too bad for a first attempt.  I had a
few dozen Cherry MX Clear switches to play with, so I snapped them into the
plate and put on the keycaps I'd used in the paper mockup earlier:</p>
<img class="fullwidth" src="/uploads/2016/gamechord/clear-keycaps.jpg" width="" height="">

<p>Still lots of work ahead, but I was feeling pretty accomplished after taking
this little glamour shot. I even took it into an <a href="https://i3detroit.org">i3Detroit</a> member meeting
for show &amp; tell.</p>
<h2 id="re-making-the-case">Re-making the case</h2>
<p>At this point, I'd already heard the term "kerf". Like a saw blade, the laser
has a width that destroys material while cutting. You want that on the
<em>inside</em> edge of something like a key switch mounting hole, in order to keep
the dimensions correct. Unlike a blade, the laser is a cylindrical
beam that passes through a lens to form <a href="http://www.buildlog.net/blog/2013/05/why-are-my-laser-cut-edges-not-straight/">something like an
hourglass</a>. So, the
kerf's shape depends on the lens focal length and the conical section that
intersects with the material.</p>
<p>Well, I didn't account for the kerf well enough in my first plate. All the key
switches were wobbly. Some would just fall out if I flipped
the thing over. Time for some of those iterations I
figured I'd have to end up doing.</p>
<img class="inset wide right" src="/uploads/2016/gamechord/kerf-is-real.jpg" width="" height="">

<p>I know the saying is "measure twice, cut once" - but in this case it was
easier to measure by cutting! I tried mounting holes with a sampling of kerf
widths until I found one that matched the key switch tolerances. Not so snug
that it cracked the plate, but not so loose that it wiggled or fell out. </p>
<p>Once I found a good laser focus and figured out the kerf, I
attacked another sheet of acrylic with the laser to produce another
iteration of the case.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/26975072884/"><img class="fullwidth" src="/uploads/2016/gamechord/glamour-shot.jpg" width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Two changes you might notice: I added slots to glue in some socket
headers, so I could unplug or replace the Teensy without soldering. I also found some
<a href="http://dro.ps/b/x3g0KCy">relegendable keycaps</a> on Massdrop - they have little removable covers that
take 14mm paper squares. I figured that would come in handy for crazy
key layouts I might come up with.</p>
<h2 id="wiring-up-the-key-matrix">Wiring up the key matrix</h2>
<p>I haven't learned how to design circuit boards yet, so I figured I'd just
handwire this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrokZ1afnVg">like I saw in the video</a>. Only 18 switches, so
how bad could it be?
Turns out, it's rather annoying. Interesting exercise with my terrible old
Radio Shack soldering iron. </p>
<img class="inset wide left" src="/uploads/2016/gamechord/matrix-wired-up.jpg" width="" height="">


<p>I think I'd much rather get over that PCB fabrication hurdle for when I try
scaling this up to a 60% keyboard like my HHKB.</p>
<p>The technique here involves first building up rows of diodes across the
right-hand pin of every key switch. The diodes serve to prevent <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Rollover,_blocking_and_ghosting">ghosting when
multiple keys are pressed</a>. </p>
<p>Then, I stripped sections of wires to
run as columns down the left-hand pin of the switches. </p>
<p>The remaining
insulation ensures the column wires don't short against the row diodes.</p>
<h2 id="wiring-up-the-teensy">Wiring up the Teensy</h2>
<img class="inset wide left" src="/uploads/2016/gamechord/teensy-wired-up.jpg" width="" height="">

<p>This matrix gives me 4 rows (counting the thumb switches) and 5 columns - or 9
I/O pins to scan 18 switches.</p>
<p>Except for <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=72804.0">magical PD6</a> - which is hardwired to an onboard LED - just
about every pin is fair game on the Teensy for rows or columns. </p>
<p>So, I tried to pick a set that would be easiest to route wires. Since this
case is transparent, I wanted to keep things visually interesting with
different colored wires and a neat shape to the runs.</p>
<p>Of course, I botched things a bit and marred the acrylic by splashing
solder and slipping with the iron a few times. But, maybe no one will really
notice.</p>
<p>If I had to do this over again - and I <em>still</em> hadn't learned how to make a
PCB - I'd probably try using something thinner like <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1446">30AWG repair
wire</a>. That seems like it would thread through the spaces much
better, which would be even more important for a board with many more
switches. </p>
<h2 style="clear: both">Programming the Teensy</h2>

<p>I based <a href="https://github.com/lmorchard/gamechord">the GameChord firmware</a> on the great <a href="https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard">tmk
firmware</a> that seems popular on mech keyboard forums.</p>
<p>Building <a href="https://github.com/lmorchard/gamechord/blob/863295d2cbdbc7052a25e989a77c3448796e67a6/matrix.c">the matrix</a> was easy: The firmware scans through rows (DF0, DF1,
DF4, and DF5) by pulling each low in turn. The columns (DB4, DB5, DB6, DF7,
and DF6) are set as "active low" pins - which means keys pressed in the
current scan row get connected to ground and read as signals. So,
I wrote the functions to manipulate &amp; read the appropriate row &amp; column pins,
respectively. </p>
<p>It was almost <em>too</em> easy:</p>

<p>From there, I built <a href="https://github.com/lmorchard/gamechord/blob/863295d2cbdbc7052a25e989a77c3448796e67a6/keymap_plain.c">a dead simple key map</a> with just enough

};
const uint16_t PROGMEM fn_actions[] = {};

<p>I got it all working and had myself a nice evening of pushing carts and taking
objectives.</p>

firmware</a> - so I decided to try implementing <a href="https://github.com/lmorchard/gamechord/blob/863295d2cbdbc7052a25e989a77c3448796e67a6/keymap_halfqwerty.c">a complex and fully impractical
keymap based on chords with the thumb keys</a>.</p>
<img class="fullwidth" src="/uploads/2016/gamechord/finished-key-legends.jpg" width="" height="">

<p>Given two thumb keys in combination, I can get 4 layers out of the other 15
keys - for a total of 60 keys. The firmware also <a href="https://github.com/lmorchard/gamechord/blob/863295d2cbdbc7052a25e989a77c3448796e67a6/keymap_halfqwerty.c#L43">lets me distinguish
between keys held or just tapped</a>, which gives me a few more layers or
modifier keys.</p>
<p>Long story short, I can get most of the functionality of a regular keyboard
out of just one hand. All I have to do is just get used to putting my left
hand through some very awkward and uncomfortable contortions until I get up to
full typing speed!</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.lmorchard.com/2016/02/05/steam-controller/">As I've written before</a>, I do really like odd input devices.
But, this got old fast. This isn't so much a practical peripheral as a thing I
did because I could. It gave me an excuse to explore the firmware more
and to use Inkscape to design some legends for my nifty keycaps.</p>

<p>And just to wrap things up, this happened:</p>

<p>This was the first summer I went to <a href="http://www.makerfairedetroit.com/">Maker Faire Detroit</a> as a Maker. I
helped for a bit at the <a href="https://i3detroit.org">i3Detroit</a> tent, mainly just standing and smiling
at the front table as folks walked in. But, I had my little keyboard out there
on a table, with a project card and everything.</p>
<p>It and I were only there for a handful of hours, but it's pretty satisfying to
have actually gotten this thing done!</p>
