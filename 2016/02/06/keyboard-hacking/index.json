That seems to be the microcontroller board a lot of keyboard\nprojects have been using, so I figured getting acquainted with it would be\nhandy. After the traditional &quot;hello world&quot; project of <a href=\"https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/tutorial.html\">getting an LED to\nblink</a>, I wired up a pile of buttons on a breadboard and <a href=\"https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_keyboard.html\">built the\nfirmware to my first DIY USB keyboard</a>.</p>\n<p>Okay, so it was just a tutorial and no special effort on my part. But, the\nprocess was super easy, so the hacking possibilities started piling up in my\nhead.</p>\n<p>Then, I discovered the <a href=\"https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=41989.0\">TMK keyboard firmware</a> on the\n<a href=\"https://geekhack.org/\">geekhack</a> forums. Basically, all the software work had been done for me.\nThe TMK firmware is a ready-made pile of code for translating from basically any\nmatrix of switches or wire protocol to USB HID keyboard codes - complete with\nsupport for flexible key maps, mouse control, function-key layers, macros, and\na bunch of other things. </p>\n<p>My little 10-key breadboard toy wasn&#39;t all that practical. But, I discovered\nthat the TMK firmware also supported building keyboard <em>converters</em>. Of\nparticular interest was the <a href=\"https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/blob/master/converter/ps2_usb/README.md\">PS/2 to USB keyboard converter</a>, since I\njust happen to have a pile of older PS/2 keyboards lying around doing nothing.</p>\n<p>The converter only took 4 wires, so I sacrificed a PS/2 cable from the back of\na drawer and came up with this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24832952956/\"><img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"/uploads/2016/teensy-ps2-adapter/adapter.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Coincidentally, the day after I built this, I got some IBM Model M keyboards\nfrom <a href=\"https://nuxx.net/blog/\">a friend</a> of mine.

So, the DIY converter\nproved its worth immediately. </p>\n<p>I put together <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/tmk_keyboard/blob/lmo-model-mac/converter/ps2_usb/keymap_modelmac.c\">my own simple keymap</a> and spent a day with it,\ntweaking as I went.  I set up <a href=\"https://github.com/alloy/kicker\">a file watcher</a> to rebuild the\nfirmware whenever I changed the source. Along with that, the <a href=\"https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html\">Teensy\nLoader</a> has an &quot;auto&quot; mode which reprograms the Teensy whenever I hit\nthe reset button. </p>\n<p>At this point, I&#39;ve replaced the Caps Lock key with Control and changed Alt keys\nto Command keys.  Then, I turned the Print Screen / Caps Lock / Pause trio\ninto volume control keys. After that, F10, F11, and F12 were pressed into\nservice as previous, next, &amp; pause buttons for music. It was all a bit fiddly,\nbut it&#39;s the kind of thing I enjoy.</p>\n<p>Overall, this all feels like a nice intro into a new hobby. Next, I&#39;m\nconsidering <a href=\"https://github.com/antonizoon/archivis.me/wiki/IBM-Model-M-USB-Controller\">replacing the IBM Model M keyboard controller</a>\naltogether, which will embed the Teensy right in the case. </p>\n<p>After that, I&#39;m tempted to turn my screwdriver on that other keyboard on my\ndesk - the Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional. There&#39;s a <a href=\"https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=12047.0\">Teensy-based\nalternative controller</a> option for it, also using the TMK firmware.</p>\n<p>Once I feel comfortable with all that, it might be time to build something of\nmy own! <a href=\"http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/##@_name=noisy%20fat%20hacker%20keyboard&amp;author=lmorchard&amp;switchMount=cherry&amp;switchBrand=cherry&amp;plate:true%3B&amp;@=Esc&amp;=!%0A1&amp;=%2F@%0A2&amp;=%23%0A3&amp;=$%0A4&amp;=%25%0A5&amp;=%5E%0A6&amp;=%2F&amp;%0A7&amp;=*%0A8&amp;=%28%0A9&amp;=%29%0A0&amp;=%2F_%0A-&amp;=+%0A%2F=&amp;=%7C%0A%5C&amp;=~%0A%60&amp;_x:0.25%3B&amp;=Insert&amp;=Home&amp;=PgUp%3B&amp;@_w:1.5%3B&amp;=Tab&amp;=Q&amp;=W&amp;=E&amp;=R&amp;=T&amp;=Y&amp;=U&amp;=I&amp;=O&amp;=P&amp;=%7B%0A%5B&amp;=%7D%0A%5D&amp;_a:0&amp;w:1.5%3B&amp;=Delete%0A%0A%0A%0ABS&amp;_x:0.25&amp;a:4%3B&amp;=Delete&amp;=End&amp;=PgDn%3B&amp;@_w:1.75%3B&amp;=Control&amp;=A&amp;=S&amp;=D&amp;=F&amp;=G&amp;=H&amp;=J&amp;=K&amp;=L&amp;=%2F:%0A%2F%3B&amp;=%22%0A%27&amp;_w:2.25%3B&amp;=Enter&amp;_x:0.25%3B&amp;=Op1&amp;=Op2&amp;=Op3%3B&amp;@_w:2.25%3B&amp;=Shift&amp;=Z&amp;=X&amp;=C&amp;=V&amp;=B&amp;=N&amp;=M&amp;=%3C%0A,&amp;=%3E%0A.&amp;=%3F%0A%2F%2F&amp;_w:2.75%3B&amp;=Shift&amp;_x:1.25%3B&amp;=%E2%86%91%3B&amp;@_w:1.25%3B&amp;=Fn&amp;_w:1.25%3B&amp;=%3Ci%20class%2F=%27mss%20mss-Unicode-Option-3%27%3E%3C%2F%2Fi%3E&amp;_w:1.25%3B&amp;=%3Ci%20class%2F=%27kb%20kb-logo-apple-outline%27%3E%3C%2F%2Fi%3E&amp;_a:7&amp;w:6.25%3B&amp;=&amp;_a:4&amp;w:1.25%3B&amp;=%3Ci%20class%2F=%27kb%20kb-logo-apple%27%3E%3C%2F%2Fi%3E&amp;_w:1.25%3B&amp;=%3Ci%20class%2F=%27mss%20mss-Unicode-Option-3%27%3E%3C%2F%2Fi%3E&amp;_w:1.25%3B&amp;=%3Ci%20class%2F=%27kb%20kb-Hamburger-Menu%27%3E%3C%2F%2Fi%3E&amp;_w:1.25%3B&amp;=Fn&amp;_x:0.25%3B&amp;=%E2%86%90&amp;=%E2%86%93&amp;=%E2%86%92\">I&#39;ve got a 75-key layout I&#39;m mulling over.</a> If I end up liking\nthat, I can get a case &amp; mounting plate <a href=\"http://builder.swillkb.com/\">designed</a> &amp;\n<a href=\"https://www.ponoko.com/\">fabricated</a>.
