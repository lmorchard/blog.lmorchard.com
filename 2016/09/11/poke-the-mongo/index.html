        <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: I started writing a video game for a fantasy console. The future is weird.</p>
<!--more-->



<nav role="navigation" class="table-of-contents"></nav>

<h2 id="play-my-game">Play My Game!</h2>
<p>Just to spoil the whole post, here's a game I made and you can play it right here:</p>
<iframe class="lazyload" style="width: 100%; height: 420px" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" data-src="/uploads/2016/poke-the-mongo/pokethemongo.html"></iframe>

<h2 id="enter-the-pocketchip">Enter the PocketC.H.I.P.</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">Pico-8</a> has been out for a few years. With it, folks have been making fun neo-retro games - and of course I've got a soft spot for that genre. </p>
<p>But, I never really fell down the Pico-8 rabbit hole until this arrived:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh hey! My <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pocketchip?src=hash">#pocketchip</a> just showed up! <a href="https://t.co/5HxB2mzCPw">pic.twitter.com/5HxB2mzCPw</a></p>— Les Orchard (@lmorchard) <a href="https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/766350094555750400">August 18, 2016</a></blockquote>



<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2016/05/04/tiny-8-bit-console-designed-f.html">I read about the PocketC.H.I.P. back in May</a>. I was sold on the idea of real hardware for a fantasy game console - a Raspberry PI turned GameBoy. I pre-ordered and then mostly forgot about it. Fast forward three months and I've got the thing in my hands.</p>
<p>While I do want to write up an in-depth look at the PocketC.H.I.P., for now I'm going to focus on this Pico-8 thing that's grabbed me in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>But, like my old Commodore 64, PocketC.H.I.P. is a gateway drug: It doesn't just play games - it comes with a full Pico-8 installation: Tools for code, sprites, maps, sounds, and music. In past visits to the Pico-8 scene, using just the web player, the significance of this hadn't quite dawned on me. </p>
<h2 id="view-source">View Source</h2>
<img class="lazyload inset right" data-src="/uploads/2016/poke-the-mongo/PICO-8_21.gif" width="" height="">

<p>With the full package, you can hit <kbd>Esc</kbd> on any running cartridge and tinker with the source - <strong>not entirely unlike View Source and Developer Tools on the Web</strong>. And, <a href="/2015/08/07/web-awesome/">you know I'm a fan of that</a>.</p>
<p>Or, to strum my nostalgia strings, it's like when I would pour over listings in 1980s computer magazines to see how those games worked. In fact, there have even been a few issues of a <a href="https://sectordub.itch.io/pico-8-fanzine-1">Pico-8 Zine</a> with code and interviews. </p>
<p>After I'd poked at a dozen-odd carts and browsed through the zines, I thought I should give it a go myself. I didn't know much Lua, but it's an easy language to pick up. Simpler than JavaScript, <a href="https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/766870582856081409">but it beats revisiting BASIC</a> - even my old favorite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simons%27_BASIC">Simons' BASIC</a>, which has a surprising amount in common with this modern day system. </p>
<p>I also decided to be masochistic by coding directly on the PocketC.H.I.P. Later, when my fingers vetoed further typing on metal domes, I plugged in a USB keyboard. As things got more complex, I broke down and bought the main edition of Pico-8 to move to a bigger screen. It's not Free Software or even Free-as-in-Beer. But, <a href="http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php#getpico8">it's only US$14.99</a>. That single purchase gave me access to versions for my PC, Mac, and Linux machines. </p>
<p>(There's even a Raspberry PI version - which gives me ideas for building a Pico-8 multicade machine. But, that's a story for another post.)</p>
<p>On my PC, I discovered <code>.p8</code> cartridges are just text files I can edit in Vim! With that revelation, <a href="https://github.com/lmorchard/Pico-8-Carts">I created a GitHub repo</a> and started saving my work there. Things have come a long way since I only had a tape drive to work with on my C64!</p>
<p>A couple of days later, I had a promising start:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just in case I don't work on it any further, here's Poke the Mongo v0.1! <a href="https://t.co/Qgn0p2ZCep">https://t.co/Qgn0p2ZCep</a> <a href="https://t.co/rGtP6UCf5p">pic.twitter.com/rGtP6UCf5p</a></p>— Les Orchard (@lmorchard) <a href="https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/767604122388279296">August 22, 2016</a></blockquote>



<h2 id="share-and-enjoy">Share and enjoy!</h2>
<p>There are a few more things I discovered in composing that tweet:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pico-8 has easy built-in video recording that renders animated GIFs to my desktop. <kbd>F3</kbd> to start, <kbd>F4</kbd> to save - and I'm ready to tweet little moments while I hack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pico-8 cartridges can be exported as images. <img class="inset right" style="width: inherit" src="/uploads/2016/poke-the-mongo/poke-the-mongo.p8.png" width="" height=""> The code for my game is encoded in that PNG with <a href="https://twitter.com/lexaloffle/status/611581098900897793">a steganography technique that subtly tweaks pixel color bits</a>. As long as no intermediaries corrupt the hidden encoding, I can share this game cartridge by uploading the image.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apropos of that, Lexaloffle has forums - a BBS - where folks post &amp; discuss their Pico-8 carts. <a href="http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=4111">You can find mine over here</a>!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inside Pico-8 is a mode called "Splore" which connects to the Lexaloffle BBS to let you browse uploaded carts from the console. So, when I uploaded my game, it was instantly available to everyone else with Pico-8!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Pico-8 is game making as a social activity, and the system has all the batteries included.</p>
<h2 id="game-making-is-a-fun-game">Game making is a fun game</h2>
<p>As I tinkered, it occurred to me that Pico-8 is less a serious game development system and more a game about making games. Through intentional constraints &amp; platform quirks, it offers offer creative hooks &amp; puzzles.</p>
<p>The constraints mean it's not as easy to get lost in options or feel overwhelmed. For example, <a href="https://neko250.github.io/pico8-api/">here's a Pico-8 API cheatsheet</a> - it's pretty much all I've needed! It's also hard to build anything huge, so there's less of a compulsion to go beyond doodles or a few specific game mechanics. I can make something derpy but good enough and move on without stressing about my artistic skills.</p>
<p>But also, some folks have found ways to really push the boundaries of the system - and that is a puzzle in itself. It's great to get a fresh dose of that old school awe from seeing a clever hack make the machine do something it wasn't meant to do. It's akin to seeing someone pull off some nasty moves in game streams where I know just enough to realize what's happening.</p>
<p>I'm nowhere near that level of Pico-8 mastery, but it could be interesting to dive into some of the things I've learned so far. But, I'll save that for yet another post.</p>
<h2 id="play-my-game-1">Play my game!</h2>
<p>Pico-8 games can also be exported to HTML5 and JavaScript. This embedded web player consists of the game code and an Emscripten-compiled version of the Pico-8 engine. So, <a href="/2015/08/07/web-awesome/">because the web is awesome</a>, even if Pico-8 goes away this copy of my game will continue working long after.</p>
<p>I've also read that the folks behind Pico-8 aren't particularly hostile to others cloning the system - which has lead to things like <a href="https://github.com/picolove/picolove">PICOLOVE</a>, an independent implementation of the Pico-8 APIs for another Lua-based game system. I've seen a few folks leverage that to get their games running on Android, so I'll have to check that out at some point.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've got a few more things to add, but I think this game is getting pretty close to where I want it to be. It's all gone much faster than I expected, so I'm looking forward to trying more ideas. </p>
<p>Until then, let me know how you like Poke the Mongo, and I'll follow up with a more in-depth look at how I made this thing!</p>
