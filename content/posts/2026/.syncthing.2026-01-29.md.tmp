- Hello world!
- [Dave Winer mentions a thing about LLMs & AI in coding](http://scripting.com/2026/01/28.html#a150041): "AI is going to be part of programming forever. There's no way to go back."
	- This, after reading "[Don't fall into the anti-AI hype](https://antirez.com/news/158)" from antirez
	- I keep thinking about this and I think it's true.
	- Two things can be true at the same time:
		- "AI" as it currently exists is a bubble and most of the high-flying companies pushing slop are going to die messily.
		- LLMs that generate code are going to be in the programming toolkit for a great many folks from here on, indefinitely.
	- Like I wrote last summer, [the bomb still works](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/06/02/the-bomb-still-works/) despite its origins. And folks will continue to build more.
	- Dave says, "We get so mired in the question of should we do this -- well we're doing it, time to start looking at the next set of questions."
	- And, I know [technological inevitability is a myth](https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/the-myth-of-technological-inevitability) - this stuff isn't self-executing, it still takes people to build it and carry it forward by choice.
