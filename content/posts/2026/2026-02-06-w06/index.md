**TL;DR:** Hid 3D printed critters around the house for my wife to find, got late-night Skyrim modding working on Linux (with Dagoth Ur!), and deeply related to that LLM alarm clock burning $20 repeatedly asking "is it time yet?" - because that's exactly how afternoon meetings feel with ADHD.

## Meta

Kind of a slow, sleepy week. Probably not much to report, this week.

Update from future-next-week-me: I also just realized that I never quite got this post published on time. But, through the magic of doing whatever I want on my own blog, I'm going to post-date it to the correct week. 😅

## 3D Printing Adventures

I've been [hiding little printed critters](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115997933734139566) around the house lately. Out of reach of cats, but my wife likes finding them:

It's like leaving tiny surprises for future-me and my-wife-me to discover. Except I know where they all are. But I'll forget. So it still counts as a surprise, right?

## Late Night Linux Gaming

Why did my brain [convince me](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/116005404670992943) it would be fun to try to get Skyrim running on Linux with [the Dagoth Ur follower mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/161398) installed? And why did I do this at bedtime? Still, [I did get it working in the end](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/116005520925353277) and it was kinda worth it?

I think I've decided that learning a game has mods is a cognitohazard for me. Last time I played Skyrim about 5 years ago, I [installed like 100 mods](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/116005428850893318), giggled at it, then wandered off entirely. My brain just wants to mod things, not actually *play* them.

## The $20 LLM Alarm Clock Incident

Stupid shower thought: Remember that guy who [spent $20](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/116019712986994364) using an LLM as an alarm clock that just repeatedly asked "is it time yet?" all night until the tokens ran out?

I'm actually sympathizing with the LLM here, because that's what it feels like to me when there's an afternoon meeting scheduled. Just sitting there, repeatedly checking: is it time yet? Is it time yet? How about now? What about now?

Like sure, "just set a reminder alarm for the calendar event" like that's a real thing that actually works. (Duh.)

## Media

Meanwhile, everyone must [watch this latest Technology Connections video](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115987885104758023):

And, here's [a live show by Information Society](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/116005233379607742) from way back when. It's pretty keen.

This is peak cat content, folks.
