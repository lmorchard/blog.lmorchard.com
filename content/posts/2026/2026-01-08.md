- Hello world!

I still favor the notion that [a blog post is "a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox"](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query). So, I keep wanting to put energy into this thing, keep trying to throw those search queries out there.

Last May, I [rigged up some plumbing](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/09/new-blog-a-lot-like-the-old/) to make it super easy to jot down ideas in Obsidian and have them automagically published via my own [Easy-Blog Oven](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2020/05/24/easy-blog-oven/index.html). That worked, insofar as I managed to blog up a storm and post 54 (!) times [in May](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/).

But, the novelty wore off, and my ADHD [serially enthusiastic](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast/) brain had me wandering off to something else shiny. And, well, a lot of crap happened last summer that I didn't feel like broadcasting on any channel. So, the posting spree tapered off rather sharply.

Interestingly, though, I did manage to post at least a couple things every month for the rest of the year. So, that's something. More than nothing, at least.

Another thing I've been trying is posting [weeknotes](https://blog.lmorchard.com/tag/weeknotes/) - or, at least, that's what I've called them.A [lot of folks are doing weeknotes](https://duckduckgo.com/?ia=web&origin=funnel_home_searchresults&t=ffab&q=weeknotes+blog), but I think I first got the idea [from Giles Turnbull](https://gilest.org/doingweeknotes/index.html)? I've seen weeknotes vary from sparse bullets to sprawling journal entries. I've seen a range from professional to confessional. Some are personal reflections, some are more like newsletters.

Mine have sort of landed in that newsletter-ish shape, since I'm not thinking-out-loud as much for myself as trying to cast those search queries into the ether. Also, I've been still sort of ruminating on ideas I had for my half-formed and mostly abandoned [Pebbling Club](https://github.com/lmorchard/pebbling-club) project.

That is, a thing I've really liked doing on the internet is finding things in feeds, gathering & stashing them, then sharing them back out in hopefully interesting ways for fascinating folks. Routing [shiny pebbles to potential friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebbling) on the web. Occasionally, I'll make & share something original, but being a human repeater feels fun to me. So, I think my "weeknotes" have really leaned in that newsletter-ish direction.

Another central feature of weeknotes is that, well, they're a weekly habit. I couldn't quite manage a daily blogging habit, so I thought maybe I could manage a lower frequency.

Still, again blaming my ADHD brain, I find habits of any kind or periodicity really, really hard to establish and maintain. And that sucks, because regularity is how a lot of things get built over time - i.e. like sending out blog post search query signals reliably over a long span.

That said, I *do* manage to [toot on the fediverse](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard) rather often but at random intervals and length. I've also been collecting web links for a very long time - moving from [my own super-ancient bookmark blogging](https://web.archive.org/web/20050207175549/http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger), [to del.icio.us](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2007/10/09/bookmarking-outlier/), [to pinboard.in](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2010/12/19/let-a-million-bookmarks-bloom/), to my own half-baked Pebbling Club, and now [to self-hosted Linkding](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/09/17/miscellanea/).

So, for my latest wave of weeknotes since October through last week, I decided to build myself some tooling. If I can't automate a habit in myself, maybe I can harness my natural semi-random behavior with a capacitor that gathers it all up and smooths the output to a regular schedule?

Toward that end, I built [linkding-to-markdown](https://github.com/lmorchard/linkding-to-markdown) and [mastodon-to-markdown](https://github.com/lmorchard/mastodon-to-markdown) as little CLI tools that take what I did in each of those contexts over a given timespan and format it all into single markdown documents. Then, I composed a [weeknotes-blog-post-composer skill](https://github.com/lmorchard/lmorchard-agent-skills/tree/main/weeknotes-blog-post-composer) for Claude Code that uses those CLI tools to grab all my toots and links and draft up a more coherent blog post in prose.

Yeah, yeah, I know, LLMs and AI are evil and all that. But, this skill does a pretty good job at taking words I wrote and things I found
