- Hello world!

I still favor the notion that [a blog post is "a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox"](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query). So, I keep wanting to put energy into this thing, keep trying to throw those search queries out there.

Last May, I [rigged up some plumbing](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/09/new-blog-a-lot-like-the-old/) to make it super easy to jot down ideas in Obsidian and have them automagically published via my own [Easy-Blog Oven](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2020/05/24/easy-blog-oven/index.html). That worked, insofar as I managed to blog up a storm and post 54 (!) times [in May](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/).

But, the novelty wore off, and my ADHD [serially enthusiastic](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast/) brain had me wandering off to something else shiny. And, well, a lot of crap happened last summer that I didn't feel like broadcasting on any channel. So, the posting spree tapered off rather sharply.

Interestingly, though, I did manage to post at least a couple things every month for the rest of the year. So, that's something.

Another thing I've been trying are [weeknotes](https://blog.lmorchard.com/tag/weeknotes/) - or, at least, that's what I've called them. A lot of bloggers are doing weeknotes.
