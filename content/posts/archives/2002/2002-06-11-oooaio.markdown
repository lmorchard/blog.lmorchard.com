title: Identifying RSS readers, and obsessively watching referrers in RSS
wordpress_id: 169

<p>Okay, starting to poke at my referrer scripts again and produced two new things:  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/recent_referers_rss.php">Recent Referrers in <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a></a> (<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/recent_referers_rss_php.txt">src</a>) and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/rss_readers.phtml">RSS Feed Readers</a> (<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/rss_readers_phtml.txt">src</a>).  I simplified my database a bit, collapsing multiple rows into single rows with a hit count column.  Also squashed a few stupid bugs that had cropped up in the Great Site Move a month or so ago.  Realized that the counts were insanely wrong, sometimes showing a count as high as 15 for a post that might have only 3 back links.</p>
<p>Likely the referers in <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> will be of interest only to me as I obsessively watch my site (though I <i>do</i> subscribe to <a href="http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/xml.html">Disenchanted's Recent Inbound</a>, since it gives me a stream of new sites to visit).  But, the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feed readers list is a few steps closer to the friends-of list I want to move from <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> out into the blogosphere proper.  </p>
<p>One of the next things I want to do is start cobbling a fairly modular &amp; general URL investigator - that is, give it a url, and have it try to track down title, author, contents page, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feed, location, and any other metadata that comes up.  I could then use this to flesh out all the links everywhere, from backlinks to the friends-of list.  Basically what many other people have been doing for different semantic aspects, but all rolled into one agent.</p>
<p>Along with that, I want to implement some manual annotation of sites known by my site.  Thinking that, between per-post backlinks and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> reader links, I could eventually build a decent database of metadata here.  With that, all kinds of nifty things could happen...</p>
<p>Okay, time for bed.  Starting to ramble, or at least be tempted to do so.</p>
