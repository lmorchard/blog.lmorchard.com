Jon Udell wrote <a href="http://www.byte.com/documents/s=1113/byt20010816s0002/0820_udell.html">a few columns</a> <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0100887/2002/03/27.html#a153">and weblog entries</a> about <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PipelineTheWeb">pipelining the web</a>, and the power of the URL-line as akin to a UNIX command line with pipes.  His examples did nifty things with a publicly available XSLT processor to use an XSL stylesheet at one URL and an XML document at another to produce a new document.

So, this is what I've been playing with a bit this week, expecially with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/GoogleToRSS">GoogleToRSS</a> and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RssDisplay">RssDisplay</a>.  But, this is what the URL looks like when I string the two together (line wrapping forced):</p>

What a pain this was to build.  I had to make a little form in a throwaway page to trick my browser into doing the hard work.  I suppose I could make a lil utility script to do the meta character escaping more easily.  But, man, if people are already making fun of the punctuation and obfuscation possible in <i>Perl</i>, imagine what they'll say about scripts on the URL-line.  (Assuming I'm not missing reams of existing ridicule already. :) )

Jon does make a note of this little problem, but I'm thinking it's going to be what makes me wrap up my URL-as-command-line experiments.  What would this URL look like if it had 1 or 2 more levels of pipeline? 
</p>

I suppose I could, as he'd also mentioned, employ a few tricks like reducing script names and parameter names down to single characters, but then I'm sacrificing one of the virtues he'd mentioned: the human readable, self-documenting nature of URL-based services.  Well, that gets scrapped at the first layer of pipelined URL indirection with the escaping of URL meta characters.  Hmm...

Still poking away at things, anyway.
