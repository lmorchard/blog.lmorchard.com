Haven't had a whole lot of success doing any blogging on the go with my Treo yet, but then I haven't tried very hard at all yet due to a lack of copious free time.  Have some ideas that should help.  Liking the Treo, but after settling into it, I'm kind of wishing I could have gotten a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/HipTop">HipTop</a>.  I expected the Palm to be mature, but it's just kinda clunky and creaky and elderly.  I expect the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/HipTop">HipTop</a> to get slicker, and I'd like the bigger keys better - not to mention the lil camera.  But, my Sprint contract is up in a little under a year, so around this time next year I'll retire the Treo and survey the landscape again.  Hopefully there'll be a dream device out by then.
