My new syndication format is called XHTML.</i></blockquote>In one corner, we have the syndication format taking over the document format.  In the other corner, we have the document format taking over the syndication format!  <strong>FIGHT!</strong>

Yeah, yeah, it's not quite <em>that</em> simple - but the opposed directions are interesting.

It's just very interesting to watch things go in both directions.  In the end, hopefully, either or both ways end up being so simple that it's just a bare hiccup to support in aggregators.
