Just read <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6453">E-mail as a System Console. Part I</a> over at Linux Journal.  It's something I've been meaning to implement for awhile, using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=all&amp;query=Mail::Audit" title="CPAN search for Mail::Audit">CPAN:Mail::Audit</a> and other tools.  Got a bit of a start on things, with a sort of plugin system for adding commands available via email.  Maybe I should hit this again.
<br /><br />
Personally, it's been a long, long while since I had a dialup-based system - so I don't have to solve their exact problem.  But, it would be nice to fire off an email to myself or some other mailbox I own, formulated just so and cryptographically signed by me that would cause some machine behind a firewall to open up an SSH tunnel to a predetermined location somewhere.  Among other things.
