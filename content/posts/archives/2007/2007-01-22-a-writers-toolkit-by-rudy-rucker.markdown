<blockquote cite="http://www.rudyrucker.com/writing/">When you’re writing a novel you’re working at the most extreme limit of your 
capabilities.  What you’re doing is beyond logic, so far out at the limits of what you can do 
that there’s no hope of your having a short and manageable simulation of the process by 
which to figure out what you’re doing, it’s computationally irreducible.  When you get into 
this zone, out on the very surface of your brain, you become sensitive to the tiniest chaotic 
emanations of the world outside.  At times it feels as if the world, feeling your sensitivity, 
gladly dances back.  Dosie-do.  Keep your eyes peeled.</blockquote><div class="quotesource">Source: <a href="http://www.rudyrucker.com/writing/">A Writer's Toolkit by Rudy Rucker</a></div>

Been reading some of the notes and essays [here at Rudy Rucker's site](http://www.rudyrucker.com/writing/) in the spirit of getting my brain resonating in a writing mode, and the above quote just stuck out at me.
