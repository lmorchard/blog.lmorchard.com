That&#8217;s not actually me in this picture: It&#8217;s something I found in [an archive of a defunct GeoCities page][1], from who knows when. (Though, apparently, it was forged in the era of the Counting Crows.)

But, anyway, that&#8217;s Mr. Sabo there in the middle. He was my High School science teacher, and nearly every day I remember something that he taught me. Let&#8217;s see if I can come up with a few off the top of my head&#8230;

*   You aren&#8217;t in control of an automobile; physics is. You merely provide suggestions. 
*   Yield signs are stop signs: Since others are not in control of their automobiles, either, you should be more careful. 
*   Always rotate the sample container while tipping out a measure of material. Never reach in with a scoop and risk contamination or unintentional reactions. 
*   If you&#8217;ve learned to print in all caps from your drafting class, make sure the *real* capital letters are twice the height of the lower-case letters. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll fail the class. 
*   The scientific method is the best means available to human beings for discovering and describing the universe, while compensating for our individual flaws and biases. 
*   The scientific method doesn&#8217;t care about politics, even if scientists do. 
*   You don&#8217;t know much about anything. But, that&#8217;s okay, because we have tools that help quantify how little we know about a given something. 
*   Not knowing much is great, because it means there&#8217;s so much left to find. 
*   Lending a copy of [Gödel, Escher, Bach][2]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=0xdecafbad01-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0465026567" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important; display: inline" /> to a young nerd will warp his or her brain, leaving it strange forever. 
*   Dropping a soup-can sized chunk of pure sodium into a lake is awesome.

I don&#8217;t know what Mr. Sabo is up to, these days. I heard he retired—good for him, sad for students. If he or anyone he knows ever reads this, I just want to say this: Thank you so much for teaching me so much. My brief time in your class had an astounding affect on my life.
