Hope no one minds the flood too much, but I just remembered that there was a such thing as [FlickrExport](http://connectedflow.com/flickrexport/) and that I hadn't posted anything at all to [my Flickr account](http://flickr.com/photos/deusx) in over a year.  So, I present to you the following new photo sets which pretty much summarize the past year:

* [<img src="460661d338e6.jpg" /> We Got Engaged!](http://flickr.com/photos/deusx/sets/1316877/)
* [<img src="d0fada32ea3d.jpg" /> random pets](http://flickr.com/photos/deusx/sets/1316941/)
* [<img src="325aa5f85a10.jpg" /> Hacking RSS and Atom Arrives](http://flickr.com/photos/deusx/sets/1316791/)

May these amuse you to some degree.
