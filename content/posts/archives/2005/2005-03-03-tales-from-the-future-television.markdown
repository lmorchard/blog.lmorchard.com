Between Netflix and other means, I think I'm already sucked into the future, at least with respect to television viewing.  These are two things that I've all but forgotten about:

* I can't pause or rewind--if I've missed something, I've missed it.  What if I want to take off for a minute to get some more coffee, or have a conversation with my girlfriend?
* Did you know that they actually prioritize a televised sports game over what the schedule said they were going to deliver?  (Don't they, like, have whole channels dedicated to that sort of thing now?)
    
It's funny: This sort of thing makes me feel kind of indignantly surprised.  I wonder if someday everyone will feel this way?
