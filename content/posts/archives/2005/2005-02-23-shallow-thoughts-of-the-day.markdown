* Maybe if I put this coffee from the office pot into this Starbucks cup, I can fool myself that it's suitable for drinking.

* I hate that there's no "logout" button for HTTP authentication that works on all browsers.

* Microsoft's .NET ain't all that bad.  Sooner or later I should do some personal tinkering with it, versus just random tasks at work.

* I wish the iTunes plugin for Quicksilver indexed into my connected iPod, where my music really resides.  I'd like to twitch-select songs when they come to mind.

* I wish my Treo 600 had Quicksilver, though [McPhling][mcp] ain't half bad.

* You know, it's a treat when I wander into someone else's code to make modifications and discover that it's all been laid out in a nice and orderly fashion.  And it's nice when the right things are loosely coupled in a way that it's a 5 minute job to switch a web service from using a database and stored procedures to using a collection of XML via HTTP.  And then, it's a beautiful thing to start managing that collection of XML with CVS and an automated build system, versus whatever hellish means our DBAs used to manage the same content beforehand.

* Office coffee in a Starbucks cup does not make it into Starbucks coffee.

* Damn, Marshall Rose of the [Radio Free RFC podcast][rfc] can be downright ruthless when laying down the deadpan nerd zingers.

* One of many odd things about me:  Throughout junior and senior High School, I spent a great deal of time trying to perfect my impression of the [Software Automatic Mouth][sam] for the Commodore 64 and Apple II, in which today's Mac OS X speech has its roots.

* Looks like I've found a reliably reproduced bug in Safari that's pretty annoying:  Use a popup window bookmarklet to post a link to del.icio.us.  Tab down to the extended field.  Realize you need to edit the title.  Shift-tab and-- BOOM.
