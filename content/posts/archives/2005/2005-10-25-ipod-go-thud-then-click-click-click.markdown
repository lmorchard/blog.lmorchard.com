Man, color me peeved:  The girl just got me a new [LCD-equipped iTrip][li] for my 4G iPod 20GB, and what happens?  I fumble it from chest level, from which it fell to land flat on its back on a marble floor.  No obvious external or cosmetic damage, but I'm hearing [an old familiar noise from the hard drive inside][hd].  

I guess it's time to exercise the AppleCare on this thing now, too.  Are these things all meant to be this fragile?  Maybe next time I'll leave it in one of those "iCondom" cases I bought but never use.
