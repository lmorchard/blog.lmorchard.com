* Just finally caught an episode of [Robot Chicken][rc].  It's kinda like videos we tried making in high school, only with a budget.  I can't breathe, and coffee keeps shooting out my nose.  I can only hope that this condition isn't permanent.

* Considering the `mdls` and `mdfind` commands on Tiger gives me an idea toward making an über-Blosxom.  (I'm really abusing [über][ub] lately.)

* I hope someone works out a way to tie Spotlight to indexing arbitrary HFS extended attributes.

* Times like these, I wish I was developing software for Mac :)

* Under Tiger, it seems like CPU and memory consumption are markedly reduced.  Although I did a backup-slash-and-burn installation of Tiger, I'm back to running pretty much the same set of apps as I had on Panther.  

  Usually, I'd be running at around a 25% baseline CPU consumption all the time and there'd be no free physical memory.  But now, even with a NetNewsWire refresh in progress, I'm barely up to 5% CPU, and I've still got a sliver of my 1GB free.  So, it might just be an artifact of a fresh, clean install--or I might be nuts--but it seems like they've done some good things.
