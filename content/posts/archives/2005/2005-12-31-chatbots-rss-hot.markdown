<blockquote cite="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002176.php">And the beauty is that a couple of code jockeys like Phil Torrone and his partner Sergio Zlobin can make it happen in a few days, using platforms (IM) and data structures (RSS) that already exist.</blockquote>

For what it's worth:  Building an RSS and Atom powered IM chatbot appears in [Chapter 4, *Adding Feeds to your Buddy List*, in Hacking RSS and Atom][bo]â€”and it's even the screenshot featured on the back cover of the book.  It's got lots of room for improvement, but it does have what I think is a nice and simple conversational interface for subscribing and polling feeds.
