<em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I just put together [a tutorial about writing an article in HTML][article] using [Tinderbox][] from [Eastgate Systems, Inc][eastgate].</em>

<em><strong>Update:</strong></em> There's a <a href="http://pc.de/pages/tinderbox-tutorial-be">Belorussian</a> translation of this post provided by <a href="http://pc.de/">PC</a> - very cool!

I've been toying with a set of writing topics to get my blog going again, apropos of [my notion of writing for myself][cobwebs]. But, I like to write at length and have finally decided that life's too short to write in browser `<textarea>`'s, no matter how cleverly augmented.

I did buy [MarsEdit 3][marsedit], which is a fine app for dashing off short entries. But, for longer things, I found myself doing the actual writing elsewhere and pasting the text into MarsEdit for posting later. I even wrote and posted [a whole fanfic novella][avd] this way, and it was a silly way to do things.

Well, one of the places where writing actually happens for me over the past few years is within [Tinderbox][] documents. And, as it turns out, [Tinderbox][] has some powerful HTML export facilities that I've left underused until some things finally clicked for me.

So, I thought I'd try turning that experience back upon itself to produce something worth writing. Without further ado, here's the [source in GitHub][github], and the [article exported to HTML for easy reading][article].

The funny thing is, I started working on this tutorial in the middle of writing another article. So, this post is a particularly advanced form of [Yak Shaving][]. I hope it ends up handy for someone, and I hope it leads to the *real* articles I'm hoping to produce.
