How unobservant am I?  It took 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30458.html" target="_top">an article from The Register</a>
to make me realize that this new Apple music store does indeed
use DRM to lock up purchased music.  The files aren't mine.  (Though, whoopie, I'm 
<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=93014" target="_top">allowed to use them on up to 3 computers</a>.)
Crap.  No thanks.  I guess
that 10% of the catalog doesn't look quite so attractive at a buck-a-song now.
<br /><br />
I mean, I've already destroyed one computer 
<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/misc/thirsty_ibook.html" target="_top">with a tumbler of water</a>, why would
I want to lose all my music with the next one I douse?  And what happens in 10
years or so, when I want to listen to all those hypothetical Talking Heads
tunes I bought?  Of course, I'm still listening to CDs and tapes I acquired back
in junior high, and I don't need to query anyone's permission to do so.
<br /><br />
I hereby bestow this award to the Apple Music Store:

SO when I get a new computer I just deauthorize the old one. If you destroy a computer I am sure support can deauthorize it for you.</div>
