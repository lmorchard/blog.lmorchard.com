- Hello world!
- I should write something here, just to get something written.
- Just found this [Obsidian Kindle Plugin](https://github.com/hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin) that does what it says on the tin.
	- I've read a lot on a kindle over the past 10 years at least, but my pace has accelerated lately since I've reliably carved out 30 minutes every weekday morning to ride an exercise bike and read while I'm doing it.
	- The highlight feature always seemed neat but pointless, because I never really looked into how to uplift that data into some other system to do anything with it.
	- But, this plugin did a nice job of pulling down all the highlights and notes from books I've read on my Kindle.
	- So now, I have nice markdown files for all my books, ready to copy/paste into blog posts if I manage to motivate myself to do it.
- Apropos of that plugin, I just finished reading [*Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI* by Ethan Mollick](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/741805/co-intelligence-by-ethan-mollick/)—maybe I should try collecting some highlights and thoughts around that?
	- Probably worth its own standalone post, rather than trying to clutter up a miscellanea post like this.
	- Off the top of my head, I thought this book was pretty great. Neither selling doom nor hype, rather realistic about where AI was at circa April 2024.
	- That said, it all still applies now in September 2025, but it's worth noting that this stuff is still moving fast—I don't think we've quite hit the flattening of the [S-curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) yet. (Though, I do think we will—and will have found that this stuff isn't a hockey stick.)
- Been having a bunch of conversations with folks trying to explain what LLMs are and aren't.
	- Been toying with saying things like: AI isn't thinking, just like the horsepower in your car isn't horses, but it can still get you places.
	- Like, an internal combustion engine doesn't have horses but we needed to relate it to something. Weirdly, it doesn't even make much sense now, since we ride more in cars than on horses, but the notion stuck around.
	- I do appreciate this bit in Mollick's book: "I’m about to commit a sin. And not just once, but many, many times. For the rest of this book, I am going to anthropomorphize AI."
	- If you play-act with the machine, it offers back a thinking-like response that isn't thinking but can still get you places.
	- Engaging with an LLM isn't a conversation, but using the patterns and forms of conversation activates pathways that effectively mine the model for continuations that are often useful.
	- But you still need to keep your wits about you and remember you're not riding a horse. If you pass out on a horse, she still knows the way home. If you pass out in a car, you end up in a ditch.
