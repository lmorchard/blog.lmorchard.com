- Hello world!
- I should write something here, just to get something written.
- Just found this [Obsidian Kindle Plugin](https://github.com/hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin) that does what it says on the tin.
	- I've read a lot on a kindle over the past 10 years at least, but my pace has accelerated lately since I've reliably carved out 30 minutes every weekday morning to ride an exercise bike and read while I'm doing it.
	- The highlight feature always seemed neat but pointless, because I never really looked into how to uplift that data into some other system to do anything with it.
	- But, this plugin did a nice job of pulling down all the highlights and notes from books I've read on my Kindle.
	- So now, I have nice markdown files for all my books, ready to copy/paste into blog posts if I manage to motivate myself to do it.
- Apropos of that plugin, I just finished reading [*Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI* by Ethan Mollick](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/741805/co-intelligence-by-ethan-mollick/)â€”maybe I should try collecting some highlights and thoughts around that?
