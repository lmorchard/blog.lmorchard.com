- Hello world!
- Been doing a bunch of vibe coding lately in Windsurf, "pairing" with Claude. A thing I keep wondering is how to make this process more multiplayer.
	- Like, there's a conversation between Claude and I. But I can't easily share that transcript with another human teammate.
	- That conversation is about as important as the code for making sense of things. More so, if we start to consider the code as an increasingly derivative product of the conversation.
	- So, if my teammate is also working in Windsurf with Claude, they're missing all the context I built up that brought the project to its current state.
	- And this isn't even getting into the notion of "mob coding" where maybe there's 2-3 of us humans with an AI agent riding shotgun.
	- I'm thinking the conversation with the agent is a particular form of documentation that should be preserved - maybe as an artifact paired with each discrete git commit?
	- Of course, the conversation is messy, with lots of iteration. So maybe it would help if there's a summary or a tl;dr ginned up at commit time, too? (That could be the commit message, I guess?)
- I like the notion of [Architecture Decision Records](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record) (ADRs) - I wonder if something like that could work for iteration sessions with an AI agent? 
	- If we can scope a session to something discrete like a feature and capture the conversation from start to end in one of a rolling series of markdown files, that might be interesting context for both human and AI.
- I know all the above presupposes that coding with an AI agent is a real and valuable thing. But, after putting a bunch of hours into giving it a try, I've morphed from skeptical disbelief to cautious buy-in.
