- Hello world!
- Random adventures in vibe coding, last night:
	- Since I sort of re-launched my blog, I was interested in monitoring traffic and logs more closely.
	- It's been awhile since I ran stuff like Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki on my own hardware - but it turns out there's [this handy all-in-one docker-compose setup that runs on my Synology NAS](https://github.com/ddiiwoong/synology-prometheus).
	- Well, with the exception of Loki, that is.
	- So, I [read the docs](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/setup/install/docker/), and soon enough got Loki running alongside the rest of the crew on my NAS.
	- The next thing is that my blog is a static site hosted on AWS S3 and CloudFront. Both S3 and CloudFront will spew logs into an S3 bucket, but I've never before bothered trying to read them.
