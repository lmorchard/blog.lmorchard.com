- Hello world!
- Had some adventures in vibe coding, last night. Maybe I'll write about it? I keep reading folks saying this stuff doesn't work, but... it does?

8<--- { "draft": false, "title": "Random Adventures in Vibe Coding with Grafana and Claude", "slug": "vibe-coding-claude-grafana", "tags": [ "grafana", "claude", "vibecoding", "llms", "ai" ], "time": "15:26:23-07:00" }

Since re-launching my blog, I wanted to monitor traffic and logs more closely. Nothing groundbreaking, but it had been a while since I'd run Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki on my own hardware.

Turns out there's [this handy all-in-one docker-compose setup that runs on Synology NAS](https://github.com/ddiiwoong/synology-prometheus). It fired up with minimal fuss, and soon I had metrics machinery humming in my basement—except the package didn't include Loki. A quick [docs consultation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/setup/install/docker/) got it running alongside the rest.

My blog is a static site hosted via AWS S3 and CloudFront. Both services dump logs into an S3 bucket, but I'd never bothered reading them before—and didn't want to start now. Instead, I loaded up Claude.ai and described my problem:

> I want to get logs out of CloudFront. I have enabled new-style log delivery that stores gzipped JSON logs in an S3 bucket at s3://lmorchard-logs/blog.lmorchard.com/ with names like E5YXU82LZHZCM.2025-06-04-04.d024d283.gz
> 
> Can you help me write a script for my home Loki server to download only new log files and push them into Loki?

Claude stepped right up:

>  I'll help you create a script to process CloudFront logs and push them to Loki. Let me write a Python script that tracks processed files and handles the gzipped JSON format.

After some vibey iteration, we [landed at this artifact](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/9fa52759-3b21-4e5a-a854-222d1696802b):

<div style="height: 400px; overflow-y: auto;">
<script src="https://gist.github.com/lmorchard/97c532df654d6e135cf7ce4f1ad8846a.js"></script>
</div>

It's quite verbose and could use some tightening up. But, I really don't care—it does the quick & dirty needful.

I wrote zero Python. I just henpecked Claude to add features until the script did what I needed. I wasn't even in an IDE, just the Claude.ai interface in a browser. An interesting thing to note is that Claude didn't have access to my AWS resources—I didn't even give it a sample of my logs. But, still, what I told it about JSON, S3, and CloudFront was enough for it to be off to the races.

Anyway, after a quick review and a satisfactory dry run, I dropped it into a cronjob to grab new logs every 5 minutes. Then I pestered Claude with Grafana dashboard questions I _could_ have figured out myself. But why read docs when you can just ask?

Total time from idea to working dashboard: about an hour.

Not revolutionary, but pretty satisfying for barely having to think about it.
