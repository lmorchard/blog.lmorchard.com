Dave Winer, [Think different about developers](http://scripting.com/2025/10/23/133525.html#a133630):

> This is the same problem web devs have, we have to become resellers for Amazon S3. Why can't Amazon, who already has an account for every freaking person in the world, let the user own their own data, which I believe they would _reallllly_ like. I don't want access to it, I just want to make great tools for them to use

I blogged a long while ago about [separating publishing from hosting](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/09/separating-publishing-from-hosting-on-the-web/), which I think jibes with what Dave's saying here. 

The current paradigm for web-based software is that it's an all-in-one silo: The software and the stuff you do with it are all trapped on servers controlled by the creators of the software.

But, the software should be separable from the files and content it handles—even if the software is deployed to a server on the web. It should be able to access my data, with permission, somewhere I control. Web developers—and now AI developers—should be able to build stuff that users can use, without also needing to worry about keeping users' stuff.

I've tried making this case in the past to folks at Mozilla: ideally, I think every Mozilla / Firefox account should a come with a bit of public web hosting and private data storage that web apps can ask permission to use. Pay to expand the capacity of either. Encourage further service providers to come online as alternatives to Mozilla. 

But, I don't think I'm very good at product pitches. And I don't really know how this would all make money as a product for average users. That's a huge motivating factor for doing anything, of course.
