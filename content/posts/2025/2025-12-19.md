David Celis says "[Writing Code Is Fun](https://davidcel.is/articles/writing-code-is-fun)":

> I became a software engineer because writing code is fun. Thinking through hard problems, designing elegant solutions, seeing the things you’ve built working for the first time… these moments are all deeply satisfying, so why in the world would I ever surrender them to AI? 

It's not really a secret that I've been spending a lot of time [using LLMs to generate code](https://blog.lmorchard.com/tag/codegen/), this year. My job and the industry at large has pushed for it—and [I don't feel like I can afford to just opt out](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/06/18/ai-anger-way-forward/). The thing is, though—and I feel like this is hugely looked down upon by folks I respect—this has been a fun and gratifying experience for me. 

So, I haven't tried to be *too* loud about this. And it's not like Anthropic or Google or OpenAI are tossing me affiliate kickbacks to shill for them. These are tools, I pay for a subscription, and I'm [trying to be normal about them](https://www.anildash.com/2025/10/17/the-majority-ai-view/). It's like grabbing a Makita or Dewalt cordless drill. (Although there's plenty of folks [not being normal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ui9FfxFDoA) about *that*.)

Anyway, public shaming and tech normality aside, I've had a hunch growing that this code-gen stuff is highlighting a divide between how folks approach software development.

In one group, we have folks for whom, yes, writing code is fun. I don't want to stereotype, but these might be folks who smile at a Lisp or a Haskell or enjoy the tasteful syntax elision of Ruby and how it results in beautiful code. They might enjoy a Zachtronics game like [EXAPUNKS](https://www.zachtronics.com/exapunks/) where you can compete globally to code golf down the the least cycles spent making little robots complete tasks.

I'm at least partially in that group. But, not entirely or even mostly. I think this is a Venn diagram, really.

Then, in another group, we have folks who like to make the computer do things. These might be folks who see code as a means to an end, as building blocks of Rube Goldberg machines that
