David Celis says "[Writing Code Is Fun](https://davidcel.is/articles/writing-code-is-fun)":

> I became a software engineer because writing code is fun. Thinking through hard problems, designing elegant solutions, seeing the things you’ve built working for the first time… these moments are all deeply satisfying, so why in the world would I ever surrender them to AI? 

It's not really a secret that I've been spending a lot of time [using LLMs to generate code](https://blog.lmorchard.com/tag/codegen/), this year. My job and the industry at large has pushed for it—and [I don't feel like I can afford to just opt out](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/06/18/ai-anger-way-forward/). The thing is, though—and I feel like this is hugely looked down upon by folks I respect—this has been a fun and gratifying experience for me. 

So, I haven't tried to be *too* loud about this. And it's not like Anthropic or Google or OpenAI are tossing me affiliate kickbacks to shill for them. These are tools, and I'm [trying to be normal about them](https://www.anildash.com/2025/10/17/the-majority-ai-view/), like grabbing a Makita or Dewalt cordless drill. (Although there's plenty of folks [not being normal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ui9FfxFDoA) about that versus matchup.)
