David Celis says "[Writing Code Is Fun](https://davidcel.is/articles/writing-code-is-fun)":

> I became a software engineer because writing code is fun. Thinking through hard problems, designing elegant solutions, seeing the things you’ve built working for the first time… these moments are all deeply satisfying, so why in the world would I ever surrender them to AI? 

It's not really a secret that I've been spending a lot of time [using LLMs to generate code](https://blog.lmorchard.com/tag/codegen/), this year. My job and the industry at large has pushed for it—and [I don't feel like I can afford to just opt out](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/06/18/ai-anger-way-forward/). The thing is, though—and I feel like this is hugely looked down upon by folks I respect—this has been a fun and gratifying experience for me. 

So, I haven't tried to be *too* loud about this. And it's not like Anthropic or Google or OpenAI are tossing me affiliate kickbacks to shill for them. These are tools, I pay for a subscription, and I'm [trying to be normal about them](https://www.anildash.com/2025/10/17/the-majority-ai-view/). It's like grabbing a Makita or Dewalt cordless drill. (Although there's plenty of folks [not being normal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ui9FfxFDoA) about *that*.)

Anyway, public shaming and tech normality aside, I've had a hunch growing that this code-gen stuff is highlighting a divide between how computer touchers approach software development.

In one group, we have folks for whom, yes, writing code is fun. I don't want to stereotype, but these might be folks who smile at a Lisp or a Haskell or enjoy the tasteful syntax elision of Ruby and how it results in beautiful code. They might enjoy a Zachtronics game like [EXAPUNKS](https://www.zachtronics.com/exapunks/) where you can compete globally to [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) down the the least cycles spent making little robots complete tasks.

Then, in another group, we have folks who like to make the computer do things. These might be folks who see code as a means to an end. They might smile at complex assemblies of Unix commands piped into each other, at Rube Goldberg machines that are grungy but get a job done. They might enjoy a game like [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) where you plug things into other things to make things.

I think this is a Venn diagram, really. These aren't opposing or even fully distinct groups, but I do think there are differences. Personally, while I am at least partly in the first group, I am mainly in the second.

I became a software engineer because making computers do things is fun. For me, writing code is just a means to that end. It's been that way since I was 7 years old and first delved into 6502 assembly on a Commodore 64—I didn't particularly appreciate elegance, I just liked that assembly drew lines in high-resolution graphics way faster than BASIC.

While I do have a great appreciation for elegance and clean code, my day-to-day focus is on what that enables. That is, does it keep our work humming along, can we sleep better at night with fewer things breaking?
