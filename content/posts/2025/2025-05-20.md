- Hello world!
- [Added support for a `draft: true` flag on entries here](https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/commit/954919050fca61d04d6e89beec96b0ea374ba74d), which should at least help me keep half-broken things from deploying mid-rant
- Now I just have to make sure to use that flag right so I *still* don't include half-broken things here ðŸ˜…
- I should figure out a decent way for showing really long strings here, like the path names in that cloud saves post today ðŸ¤”

Ah, the problems of a masochistic nerd trying to game. For about a year now, my gaming PC has run [Bazzite Linux](https://bazzite.gg/) because I got tired of Windows. I've also got a Game Pass subscription, prepaid for a long while from before I switched to Linux. This was not a well thought out plan.

While other game stores work pretty great, the only way to use my Game Pass subscription on Linux is via [Xbox Cloud Gaming](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play). The Xbox app doesn't on Linux and won't install Game Pass stuff locally on Linux. Still, streaming works pretty well for games I want to try and ditch when I get bored. But, it's so ephemeral that I wouldn't really want to commit to buying a game through that outright.

So, I started playing [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/clair-obscur-expedition-33/9PPT8K6GQHRZ/0010) via Cloud Gaming. After about 13 hours in, I realized I wanted to buy the game. As it turns out, Steam likes Linux and [the game runs well there](https://www.protondb.com/app/1903340). It was on sale in a bundle, so I went ahead and bought it [from Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/)  instead of from Xbox.

But, my 13-hour-old save game was trapped in the cloud. I guessed I'd just have to abandon it and start over. That is, until I pieced a few things together:

Thanks to [Xbox Play Anywhere](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/xbox-play-anywhere), the saves in Cloud Gaming sync down to PC game installations. I had one old Windows laptop left in the house that would install Game Pass games - it just played them horribly. Once I installed the game locally from Game Pass and booted it up once, my cloud save descended onto my laptop hard drive.

Then, I installed the game again from Steam - i.e. the copy I purchased. From there, I could follow [this guide to transplant my save file from Game Pass to Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1903340/discussions/0/592895445665061488/). Once properly transplanted, the save game found its way onto Steam's cloud sync servers and then back onto my real gaming PC.

For posterity, in case that thread goes away, I copied from the newest modified directory here: ```C:\Users\me\AppData\Local\Packages\KeplerInteractive.Expedition33_ymj30pw7xe604\SystemAppData\wgs\00090000044E48CB_000000000000000000000000697F9EC3```

And I copied to here: ```C:\Users\me\AppData\Local\Sandfall\Saved\SaveGames\76561198015267336```

Oh, and it needed renaming to `EXPEDITION_0.sav` - easy peasy.

I realize this sounds like the plot to a dork heist. But, it worked!

Greg Storey, "[Minimum Viable Humans.](https://brilliantcrank.com/minimum-viable-humans/)" hits like [a funnel cloud](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/15/quoting-will-larson-on-career-advice-in/index.html):

> Companies aren't just cutting costsâ€”they're conducting a fundamental reset to find their Minimum Viable Humans model. They're stripping organizations down to the groundâ€”the irreducible human functions that (currently) can't be replaced or augmented by AI.

This rings true to what I've been seeing. The cruelty feels incidental to the processâ€”not to me and everyone I know, mind youâ€”but indignation won't pay my mortgage.

> Trying to get your old job back is futileâ€”that role, as you remember it, isnâ€™t coming back. The opportunity now lies in positioning yourself for the roles and capabilities that will emerge as organizations rebuild from the bottom upâ€”core human strengths like creativity and ethical judgment, the ability to collaborate with AI, your unique experience and expertise, and the kind of discernment that values judgment over process.

Brutal, yet maybe positive? If drudgery gets distilled out, what's left are human creativity, judgment, and experience. That sounds nice, like what classic sci-fi promised us.

But you can't mechanize that. What job activates all those human qualities all the time? Some jobs are just paychecks, some spark enthusiasm, and some flip between both unpredictably.

You can't mechanize that, though. I don't think there's [a time and motion study from Taylorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_motion_study) to optimize for that. What job activates all those human qualities all the time? Some jobs are just a paycheck, some draw out enthusiasm. This, regardless of any wishful company line in the job posting about passion and dedication. And some jobs are a paycheck on Tuesday but an avocation on Thursday - and no one can tell what kind of week it'll be, come Monday.

Will companies make allowances for that, while rewarding what they're asking for? I know we're seeing a reckoning right now, a firm snatching back from privileged labor. But will companies they find they've burnt everyone out and emptied the industry? What's the churn for all of us while they figure that out?

> The manager's role isn't just being eliminatedâ€”it's being fundamentally redefined from day-to-day oversight to exception handling, strategic communication, and resource allocation across much larger teams. It will keep going into augmenting the decision-making process for leaders and individual contributors alike. The boundaries of acceptable risk at all levels are now in a constant prototype state as AI becomes more powerful and faster, giving mere mortals more access to information and insight than ever before. The trick will be what training we need in order to make the pairing work.

In a way, this sounds like an ideal job for an ADHD-head like me. Given a project about which I actually care and can get excited, I could see having a fun time as a human relay and filter with an occasional dip into reallocating [pylons](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Pylon) and [vespene gas](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Vespene_gas) amongst largely autonomous [protoss](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Protoss) units. I wonder what the minimum [APM](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Actions_per_minute) is for that job? 

Admittedly, I'm more comfortable directing Starcraft units and AI agents like this. Maybe not so much my human co-workers. I am having what feel like a better time than some with AI-assisted IDEs and even straight-up vibe coding. I'm not hitting as many walls or seeing as much stupid behavior. I'm not sure what that says about me. Maybe I'm learning the magic invocations? Maybe I'm the right kind of moron? Either way, I am ending up with working code and nodding heads. This gives me some hope that I can "stay current" - whatever that means in the current era.

> This isn't just another tech cycle. It's a fundamental recalibration of the human role in organizational life. And while there's no easy path through this transition, understanding what's actually happening might help you find your footing on shifting ground.

I keep finding what I'm writing slips into snark. I think that's because part of me finds this exciting while another part of me is cynical, surly, and burnt out. I'm hoping the former holds out for a few decades longer. I'm worried that the industry's going to eat itself, hollow itself out, and eject everything we've learned so far - only to relearn it all again atop a new wave of younger bodies that burn out faster like athletes.

Or, like, will [the thumbless neurotic puma driving a maroon AMC Gremlin](https://monkeybagel.com/pumas.html) have the last laugh after all? I dunno, I'm just trying to figure how much all of this is like [that surface rupture captured on video in Myanmar last week](https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/earthquakes/first-of-its-kind-video-captures-the-terrifying-moment-the-ground-tore-apart-during-major-myanmar-earthquake) and whether my Crocs can carry me on the right side of something like that?
