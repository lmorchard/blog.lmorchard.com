Ah, the problems of a masochistic nerd trying to game. My gaming PC runs [Bazzite Linux](https://bazzite.gg/), these days, because I got tired of Windows. I've also got a Game Pass subscription, prepaid from before I switched to Linux.

While other game stores work pretty great, the only way to use my Game Pass subscription is via [Xbox Cloud Gaming](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play) because that's the only way to use Game Pass on Linux. That works pretty well, but it's so ephemeral that I wouldn't ever commit to buying a game through that outright.

So, I've been playing 

Turns out, though, that Steam likes Linux and [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 runs well there](https://www.protondb.com/app/1903340). So I broke down and bought [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/)

- But, my 13-hour-old save game was trapped in the cloud.

- I found a tangly way to liberate my save game from Game Pass cloud streaming

Okay,  because:

I have one last Windows machine in the house. It’ll install Game Pass games locally, albeit playing terribly. But, Xbox Play Anywhere means cloud games sync to PC - so that gets the save data to my laptop drive.

Then, I install the game again under Steam. I found a guide for porting the save file over from Game Pass install to Steam install. Crossing fingers this works and it, in turn, gets synced to Steam’s cloud for me to play on my real gaming PC

I realize this sounds like the plot to a dork heist. And is, but that’s my kind of shit
