- Hello world!
- [Added support for a `draft: true` flag on entries here](https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/commit/954919050fca61d04d6e89beec96b0ea374ba74d), which should at least help me keep half-broken things from deploying mid-rant
- Now I just have to make sure to use that flag right so I *still* don't include half-broken things here ðŸ˜…
- I should figure out a decent way for showing really long strings here, like the path names in that cloud saves post today ðŸ¤”

Ah, the problems of a masochistic nerd trying to game. For about a year now, my gaming PC has run [Bazzite Linux](https://bazzite.gg/) because I got tired of Windows. I've also got a Game Pass subscription, prepaid for a long while from before I switched to Linux. This was not a well thought out plan.

While other game stores work pretty great, the only way to use my Game Pass subscription on Linux is via [Xbox Cloud Gaming](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play). The Xbox app doesn't on Linux and won't install Game Pass stuff locally on Linux. Still, streaming works pretty well for games I want to try and ditch when I get bored. But, it's so ephemeral that I wouldn't really want to commit to buying a game through that outright.

So, I started playing [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/clair-obscur-expedition-33/9PPT8K6GQHRZ/0010) via Cloud Gaming. After about 13 hours in, I realized I wanted to buy the game. As it turns out, Steam likes Linux and [the game runs well there](https://www.protondb.com/app/1903340). It was on sale in a bundle, so I went ahead and bought it [from Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/)  instead of from Xbox.

But, my 13-hour-old save game was trapped in the cloud. I guessed I'd just have to abandon it and start over. That is, until I pieced a few things together:

Thanks to [Xbox Play Anywhere](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/xbox-play-anywhere), the saves in Cloud Gaming sync down to PC game installations. I had one old Windows laptop left in the house that would install Game Pass games - it just played them horribly. Once I installed the game locally from Game Pass and booted it up once, my cloud save descended onto my laptop hard drive.

Then, I installed the game again from Steam - i.e. the copy I purchased. From there, I could follow [this guide to transplant my save file from Game Pass to Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1903340/discussions/0/592895445665061488/). Once properly transplanted, the save game found its way onto Steam's cloud sync servers and then back onto my real gaming PC.

For posterity, in case that thread goes away, I copied from the newest modified directory here: ```C:\Users\me\AppData\Local\Packages\KeplerInteractive.Expedition33_ymj30pw7xe604\SystemAppData\wgs\00090000044E48CB_000000000000000000000000697F9EC3```

And I copied to here: ```C:\Users\me\AppData\Local\Sandfall\Saved\SaveGames\76561198015267336```

Oh, and it needed renaming to `EXPEDITION_0.sav` - easy peasy.

I realize this sounds like the plot to a dork heist. But, it worked!

Greg Storey, "[Minimum Viable Humans.](https://brilliantcrank.com/minimum-viable-humans/)":

> Companies aren't just cutting costsâ€”they're conducting a fundamental reset to find their Minimum Viable Humans model. They're stripping organizations down to the groundâ€”the irreducible human functions that (currently) can't be replaced or augmented by AI.

Again, [impersonal like a funnel cloud](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/15/quoting-will-larson-on-career-advice-in/index.html), but this rings true to what I've been seeing too. That it hits like cruelty is just incidental to the process. Not incidental to me and everyone I know, mind youâ€”but also, again, indignation won't pay my mortgage. I've said I'm likely to [burn out in a business (mech) suit](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/16/solo-burnout/) on my own, so I'm still hoping this being-an-employee thing continues to pay. It's that or retire and radically reinvent, and I don't think I'm there yet.

> Trying to get your old job back is futileâ€”that role, as you remember it, isnâ€™t coming back. The opportunity now lies in positioning yourself for the roles and capabilities that will emerge as organizations rebuild from the bottom upâ€”core human strengths like creativity and ethical judgment, the ability to collaborate with AI, your unique experience and expertise, and the kind of discernment that values judgment over process.

This sounds brutal yet maybe also positive, if true. The thing here is that if drudgery and routine are distilled out of a job, what's left? Creativity, judgement, experience. The hard part, I think, will be what job activates all those all the time? Or at least enough of the time to get paid for it? Some jobs are just a paycheck, some draw out enthusiasm - regardless of the wishful company line about passion and dedication. Well, I think this is companies fixing to mean it.

Will this go both ways? I mean, if the job's pared down to the essential creative bone, will it pay like that's what they're asking for? Will folks be taken  Will they find that they've emptied out the industry of folks left to actually work their hearts out?

> The manager's role isn't just being eliminatedâ€”it's being fundamentally redefined from day-to-day oversight to exception handling, strategic communication, and resource allocation across much larger teams. It will keep going into augmenting the decision-making process for leaders and individual contributors alike. The boundaries of acceptable risk at all levels are now in a constant prototype state as AI becomes more powerful and faster, giving mere mortals more access to information and insight than ever before. The trick will be what training we need in order to make the pairing work.

In a way, this sounds like an ideal job for an ADHD-head like me. 

> This isn't just another tech cycle. It's a fundamental recalibration of the human role in organizational life. And while there's no easy path through this transition, understanding what's actually happening might help you find your footing on shifting ground.
