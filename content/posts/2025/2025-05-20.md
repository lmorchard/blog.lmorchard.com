Okay, so I broke down and bought Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 on Steam because a) I really like it b) Steam likes linux and c) I found a tangly way to liberate my save game from Game Pass cloud streaming:

I have one last Windows machine in the house. It’ll install Game Pass games locally, albeit playing terribly. But, Xbox Play Anywhere means cloud games sync to PC - so that gets the save data to my laptop drive.

Then, I install the game again under Steam. I found a guide for porting the save file over from Game Pass install to Steam install. Crossing fingers this works and it, in turn, gets synced to Steam’s cloud for me to play on my real gaming PC

I realize this sounds like the plot to a dork heist. And is, but that’s my kind of shit
