- Hello world!
- I need to come up with a process here that keeps these miscellanea posts marked as a draft, if I never get past "Hello world!"
	- I start a new file every morning from a template, with the intent that I'll drop by and jot some things here throughout the day. But, this week turned out to be particularly busy. So, I went a few days never getting past "Hello world!" and that's not super interesting to publish.
	- At some point, I want to hook this stuff up to Mastodon and Bluesky accounts. I don't want to just post templated nonsense. (Just intentional nonsense.)
- Maybe there's something in the air, because a week or two ago I got suddenly compelled to dive down a rabbit hole about [the transformer robot watch](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Kronoform) I had when I was a kid in the 80s.
	- The one I had was confiscated by a teacher and never given back. I'm still salty about that.
	- But, just a couple days ago, I saw [this video from Secret Galaxy on the history of the Kronoform watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe5umc6Jha4)
	- From there, I found [this giant-sized printable version of the Takara Kronoform in desktop clock form](https://www.printables.com/model/962592-takara-mc-06-kronoform-the-desktop-clock) - I'm going to have to give that a try.
	- I kind of want to try building some version of the robot watch with some smart guts. I probably won't get around to it, but why do smart watches have to be so boring?
	- Maybe I can split the difference by sticking a smart display in the desktop clock version? Hook it up to Home Assistant and make it do... I don't know what.

> If you've found web development frustrating over the past 5-10 years, here's something that has worked worked great for me: give yourself permission to avoid any form of frontend build system (so no npm / React / TypeScript / JSX / Babel / Vite / Tailwind etc) and code in HTML and JavaScript like it's 2009.

This blog has a ["backend" build process](https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/main/index.js) to produce the static HTML. But, [the frontend](https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/main/content/public/index.js) is pretty much build-free. 

Web development with "vanilla" JavaScript has gotten pretty good in the last decade, thanks to [Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), [dynamic `import()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import), [Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements), and a pile of other relatively recent APIs. 

The easy path at work these days tends to be Next.js, but I kind of hate it. All my side projects start with `touch index.{html,js,css}`.  I roll on from there with maybe a live-reload HTTP server pointed at the directory (e.g. `npx reload src`).

That said, I have started playing with carefully re-introducing *some* build tooling for [a few side projects](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/04/25/sketches-as-web-components/index.html) - but, only for external dependencies. I've tinkered a bit with [using esbuild to compose bundles as JS modules](https://github.com/lmorchard/sketches-v03/blob/main/build.js) importable by the rest of my unbundled modules. 

The nice thing about this is that I can treat those external dependencies as standalone utility modules without infecting the rest of my project with build machinery. I can even just check in a copy of the built asset to keep the project stable and usable, years later.

I use Obsidian as a daybook, for taking notes and writing in general. One markdown file per day, created every morning from a template, named for the current date in a folder for the current year.

In that file, I accumulate notions and tasks over the course of a day. Occasionally, something buds off into a linked page devoted to the topic - a project, a person, a train of thought. Sometimes I use tags to index bullet points on themes I might want to collect & review later.

Beyond all of that, I don't use many of the fancier features of Obsidian. There are a few things I do by hand for which I keep meaning to write a plugin or some scripts - but it's been about six years of never quite getting around to it.

I also don't use Obsidian Sync, though it would probably make my life easier if I did. Instead, I use Syncthing - that works well enough since my Obsidian notes are really just a pile of files. There are builds of Syncthing for every desktop & laptop OS that I use, along with my
