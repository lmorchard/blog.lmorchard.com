> If you've found web development frustrating over the past 5-10 years, here's something that has worked worked great for me: give yourself permission to avoid any form of frontend build system (so no npm / React / TypeScript / JSX / Babel / Vite / Tailwind etc) and code in HTML and JavaScript like it's 2009.

This blog has a "backend" build process to build the static HTML from all the Markdown content source files. But, the frontend is pretty much build-free. Web development with "vanilla" JavaScript has gotten pretty good in the last decade, thanks to [Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), [dynamic `import()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import), [Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements), and a pile of other relatively recent APIs.

The easy path at work these days tends to be Next.js, but I kind of hate it. All my side projects start with `touch index.{html,js,css}` and I roll on from there with maybe a live-reload HTTP server pointed at the directory.
