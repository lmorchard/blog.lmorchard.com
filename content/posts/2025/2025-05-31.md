- Hello world!
- I need to come up with a process here that keeps these miscellanea posts marked as a draft, if I never get past "Hello world!"
	- I start a new file every morning from a template, with the intent that I'll drop by and jot some things here throughout the day. But, this week turned out to be particularly busy. So, I went a few days never getting past "Hello world!" and that's not super interesting to publish.
	- At some point, I want to hook this stuff up to Mastodon and Bluesky accounts. I don't want to just post templated nonsense. (Just intentional nonsense.)
- Maybe there's something in the air, because a week or two ago I got suddenly compelled to dive down a rabbit hole about the transformer robot watch I had when I was a kid in the 80s.
	- And just a couple days ago, I saw [this video from Secret Galaxy on the history of the Kronoform watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe5umc6Jha4)
	- From there, I found

> If you've found web development frustrating over the past 5-10 years, here's something that has worked worked great for me: give yourself permission to avoid any form of frontend build system (so no npm / React / TypeScript / JSX / Babel / Vite / Tailwind etc) and code in HTML and JavaScript like it's 2009.

This blog has a ["backend" build process](https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/main/index.js) to produce the static HTML. But, [the frontend](https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/main/content/public/index.js) is pretty much build-free. 

Web development with "vanilla" JavaScript has gotten pretty good in the last decade, thanks to [Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), [dynamic `import()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import), [Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements), and a pile of other relatively recent APIs. 

The easy path at work these days tends to be Next.js, but I kind of hate it. All my side projects start with `touch index.{html,js,css}`.  I roll on from there with maybe a live-reload HTTP server pointed at the directory (e.g. `npx reload src`).

That said, I have started playing with carefully re-introducing *some* build tooling for [a few side projects](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/04/25/sketches-as-web-components/index.html) - but, only for external dependencies. I've tinkered a bit with [using esbuild to compose bundles as JS modules](https://github.com/lmorchard/sketches-v03/blob/main/build.js) importable by the rest of my unbundled modules. 

The nice thing about this is that I can treat those external dependencies as standalone utility modules without infecting the rest of my project with build machinery. I can even just check in a copy of the built asset to keep the project stable and usable, years later.
