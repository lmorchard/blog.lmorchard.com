- Hello world!
- Since I'm bouncing between multiple teams' projects, this LLM agent-assisted coding thing reminds me of [multi-box mining in EVE Online](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Mining#Dual_account_mining).
	- I haven't done that in years, but it was a way to make mining more interesting. You could fill in the lulls in gameplay by swapping between ships, treating it more like real-time strategy.
	- Apparently, [EVE Online multi-boxing UI has gotten more sophisticated these days](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ijoXyVTv83Q)? I can only imagine this is the direction coding agent orchestration will head.
	- It's totally [spinning plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_spinning) and it's a more energy-consuming activity than I might have first expected.
	- I'm really leaning on the Command-Backtick button to cycle through IDE windows to shepherd the Claude Code sessions as they crunch through execution plans.
	- There is kind of a hyperfocus flow state available—not in the coding on individual projects, but in swapping between agents, keeping things running with answers to questions, performing rescues from ditches.
	- This seems appealing to my ADHD brain, until or unless I get distracted in a way that lets plates start falling.
	- I am finding that writing or generating gratuitous notes as context for both me and the LLM is really handy. Especially helps me remember what I was trying to accomplish when I last cycled into some particular IDE window.

Jason Santa Maria, [Large Language Muddle](https://jasonsantamaria.com/blog/large-language-muddle):

> As someone who has spent their entire career and most of their life participating and creating online, this sucks. It feels like someone just harvested lumber from a forest I helped grow, and now wants to sell me the furniture they made with it.
> 
> The part that stings most is they didn’t even ask. They just assumed they could take everything like it was theirs. The power imbalance is so great, they’ll probably get away with it.
> ...
> I imagine there will be a time when using these tools or not creates a rift, and maybe it will be difficult to sustain a career in our field without using them. Maybe something will change, and I’ll come around to using these services regularly. I don’t think I’ll ever not be angry about it.

This is basically [involuntary stone soup](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/27/involuntary-stone-soup-ai/). I'm feeling a lot of conflict, these days. I'm unhappy about the way LLMs have come about—but [the bomb still works](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/06/02/the-bomb-still-works/). I'm increasingly convinced that I need to learn everything I can about it. [I don't think I can afford](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/20/minimum-viable-human-career/) to just opt out and boycott this wave of tech.

But I'm also [trying to stay tuned into skeptical takes](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/06/11/codegen-enthusiasm/) and keep my easily-enthused novelty-seeking brain from turning entirely to the cult. While I can't side with folks who claim this tech is nothing but a sham, I do want to steer clear from ever swallowing claims that this stuff is more than what it actually is. I want to be clear-eyed and understand the precise nature.

> And still that anger. It’s not just that they didn’t ask. If these tools have so much promise, could this have been a communal effort rather than a heist? I don’t even know what that would’ve looked like, but I can say I would feel much differently about AI if I could use a model built on communal contributions and opt-ins, made for the advancement of everyone, not just those who can pay the monthly subscription.

> Behind that anger is sadness. How do we nurture curiosity and the desire for self growth?

I feel like there's a way through this that *can* be good. I do believe that these models can employed to help facilitate curiosity and self growth. And that good way can only be found by understanding this stuff, not by ignoring it like a lot of folks demand we do. 

These new models are not going to go away, even if the companies burning billions do. [The models released in the open](https://huggingface.co/) are artifacts that will keep powering unexpected consequences for probably decades to come.

A lot of things right now strike me as rhyming with [the dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) from the 2000s. And the interesting thing was that the web didn't die with the bubble: In fact, a bunch of folks with spare time built the blogosphere and API mashups and the precursors to what we now call "Web 2.0". 

I have a very strong hunch that we may find ourselves in a similar pattern repeating. Maybe it's self-soothing daydreaming, but part of me expects that ironically we may eventually end up with a lot of cheap-to-free surplus capacity
