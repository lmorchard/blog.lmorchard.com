- Hello world!
- Since I'm bouncing between multiple teams' projects, this LLM agent-assisted coding thing is starting to feel a bit like multi-box mining in EVE Online.
	- I haven't done that in years, but it was the only way to really make mining exciting back in the day: filling in the gameplay lulls by swapping between ships as the ore piled in.
	- I'm really leaning on the Command-Backtick button to cycle through IDE windows to shepherd the Claude Code sessions as they crunch through execution plans.
	- Apparently, [EVE Online multi-boxing UI has gotten really sophisticated these days](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ijoXyVTv83Q)? I can only imagine this is the direction coding agent orchestration will head.
