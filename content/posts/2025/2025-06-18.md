- Hello world!
- Since I'm bouncing between multiple teams' projects, this LLM agent-assisted coding thing reminds me of [multi-box mining in EVE Online](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Mining#Dual_account_mining).
	- I haven't done that in years, but it was a way to make mining more interesting. You could fill in the lulls in gameplay by swapping between ships, treating it more like real-time strategy.
	- Apparently, [EVE Online multi-boxing UI has gotten more sophisticated these days](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ijoXyVTv83Q)? I can only imagine this is the direction coding agent orchestration will head.
	- It's totally [spinning plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_spinning) and it's a more energy-consuming activity than I might have first expected.
	- I'm really leaning on the Command-Backtick button to cycle through IDE windows to shepherd the Claude Code sessions as they crunch through execution plans.
	- There is kind of a hyperfocus flow state available—not in the coding on individual projects, but in swapping between agents, keeping things running with answers to questions, performing rescues from ditches.
	- This seems appealing to my ADHD brain, until or unless I get distracted in a way that lets plates start falling.
	- I am finding that writing or generating gratuitous notes as context for both me and the LLM is really handy. Especially helps me remember what I was trying to accomplish when I last cycled into some particular IDE window.

This is basically [involuntary stone soup](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/27/involuntary-stone-soup-ai/). I'm feeling a lot of conflict, these days. I'm unhappy about the way LLMs have come about—but [the bomb still works](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/06/02/the-bomb-still-works/). I'm increasingly convinced that I need to learn everything I can about it. [I don't think I can afford](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/20/minimum-viable-human-career/) to just opt out and boycott this wave of tech.

But I'm also [trying to stay tuned into skeptical takes](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/06/11/codegen-enthusiasm/) and try to keep my easily-enthused novelt
