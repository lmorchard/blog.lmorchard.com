- Hello world!
- Since I'm bouncing between multiple teams' projects, this LLM agent-assisted coding thing reminds me of multi-box mining in EVE Online.
	- I haven't done that in years, but it was a way to make mining more interesting. You could fill in the lulls in gameplay by swapping between ships, treating it more like real-time strategy.
	- Apparently, [EVE Online multi-boxing UI has gotten more sophisticated these days](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ijoXyVTv83Q)? I can only imagine this is the direction coding agent orchestration will head.
	- It's totally [spinning plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_spinning) and it's a more energy-consuming activity than I might have first expected.
	- I'm really leaning on the Command-Backtick button to cycle through IDE windows to shepherd the Claude Code sessions as they crunch through execution plans.
	- There is kind of a hyperfocus flow state availableâ€”not in the coding on individual projects, but in swapping between agents, keeping things running with answers to questions, performing rescues from ditches.
	- This seems appealing to my ADHD brain, until or unless I get distracted in a way that lets plates start falling.
