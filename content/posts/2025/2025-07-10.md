- Hello world!
- Trying to decide if this is a "[still alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ljFaKRTrI)" or a "[beware, I live!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC2iqlvifSU)" kind of day?
- Either way, I've been down a hole of busy-ness for the past few weeks and been wanting to climb out to emit some reports here.
- Still trying to find a good balance while spinning plates across multiple projects. But, I've gotten a lot done without quite going entirely insane.
- Feel like I've suddenly become a cyborg over the past few weeks. Been working across multiple instances of Claude Code all day, every day.
- I've gotten well acquainted with Anthropic's usage limits, having managed to reliably burn through my Max plan allowances every 5 hours or so.
- Also feels like I've picked a side in the war against Skynet in some folks' estimation. Except, to me, it feels like working with a concussed version of the main computer from the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D).

To make steps toward showing and telling about my Claude Code workflow, I built a Breakout game with Phaser 3. The [repository](https://github.com/lmorchard/claude-breakout-clone) captures the full development process so farâ€”prompts, commands, and session transcripts.

[Added a multi-ball power-up](https://github.com/lmorchard/claude-breakout-clone/tree/main/docs/dev-sessions/2025-07-05-1336-multiball) to demonstrate iterative development. The game itself isn't particularly novel, but the documented development process might be useful for others exploring AI-assisted coding workflows.

At some point, this will turn into a show-and-tell presentation for co-workers and maybe a follow-up to last month's blog post on ["Baby steps into semi-automatic coding"](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/06/07/semi-automatic-coding/).

This took all of a couple hours on a Saturday afternoon, but I kind of want to keep going with it. It's rather addictive to just kind of riff on ideas and get them into the game with quick little iterations.
