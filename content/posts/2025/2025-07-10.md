- Hello world!
- Trying to decide if this is a "[still alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ljFaKRTrI)" or a "[beware, I live!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC2iqlvifSU)" kind of day?
- Either way, I've been down a hole of busy-ness for the past few weeks and been wanting to climb out to emit some reports here.
- Still trying to find a good balance while spinning plates across multiple projects. But, I've gotten a lot done without quite going entirely insane.
- Feel like I've suddenly become a cyborg over the past few weeks. Been working across multiple instances of Claude Code all day, every day.
- Also feels like I've picked a side in the war against Skynet in some folks' estimation. Except, to me, it feels like working with a concussed version of the main computer from the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D).
