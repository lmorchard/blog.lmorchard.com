- Hello world!
- Trying to decide if this is a "[still alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ljFaKRTrI)" or a "[beware, I live!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC2iqlvifSU)" kind of day?
- Either way, I've been down a hole of busy-ness for the past few weeks and been wanting to climb out to emit some reports here.
- Still trying to find a good balance while spinning plates across multiple projects. But, I've gotten a lot done without quite going entirely insane.
- Feel like I've suddenly become a cyborg over the past few weeks. Been working across multiple instances of Claude Code all day, every day.
- I've gotten well acquainted with Anthropic's usage limits, having managed to reliably burn through my Max plan allowances every 5 hours or so.
- Also feels like I've picked a side in the war against Skynet in some folks' estimation. Except, to me, it feels like working with a concussed version of the main computer from the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D).

To make steps toward showing and telling about my Claude Code workflow, I built a browser-based Breakout game with Phaser 3. The [repository](https://github.com/lmorchard/claude-breakout-clone) captures the full development process so far—prompts, commands, and session transcripts.

Along with the basic game, [I added a multi-ball power-up](https://github.com/lmorchard/claude-breakout-clone/tree/main/docs/dev-sessions/2025-07-05-1336-multiball) to demonstrate iterative development. The game itself isn't particularly novel, but the documented development process might be useful for others exploring AI-assisted coding workflows.

At some point, this will turn into a show-and-tell presentation for co-workers and maybe a follow-up to last month's blog post on ["Baby steps into semi-automatic coding"](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/06/07/semi-automatic-coding/).

This took all of a couple hours on a Saturday afternoon on the couch watching TV, but I kind of want to keep going with it. It's rather addictive to just kind of riff on ideas and get them into the game with quick little iterations.

I've been procrastinating getting back to it, but I threw some hours into a substantial overhaul of my Pebbling Club project so I could make progress again. Migrated [from SQLite to Postgres](https://github.com/lmorchard/pebbling-club/pull/239), [switched to uv](https://github.com/lmorchard/pebbling-club/pull/238) for dependency management, and moved deployment from fly.io to my basement machine running Docker Compose.

Then, I built a git-push deployment hook because I'm a masochist—er, I wanted complete control over the deployment process. It's nice watching your own server rebuild containers when you push to main, even if cloud platforms would be more practical.

The development environment [became a hybrid](https://github.com/lmorchard/pebbling-club/pull/240): Docker Compose for stable services, Honcho + Procfile for active development. Added Flower for Celery monitoring and experimented with Prometheus and Grafana metrics.

I got several useful features working: RSS feed reading, duplicate URL detection through normalized hashing, ActivityStreams-inspired import/export, and a Netscape Bookmarks HTML export. Built a link inbox that currently handles RSS feeds, with in-progress work to add Mastodon timeline integration and plans for Bluesky.

Along the way, I wanted to see how far I could get with Claude Code and make tweaks to my overall process. If nothing else, the bot helped me get past the barrier of activation energy to get some things done.
