- Hello world!
- Jotted down a couple posts today on AI stuff that aren't particularly revelatory.
	- If anything, they're just me trying to think out loud and clarify.
	- I'm probably going to try writing more stuff like this, if only to be Wrong on the Internet and lure someone in to correct me. ðŸ˜…

I found myself in a frustrating argument with someone convinced that LLMs are pure vaporwareâ€”incapable of real work. Their reasoning? Since LLMs were trained on stolen material, the results they produce can't actually exist.

Not that the results should be considered illegitimate or taintedâ€”but that they're literally impossible. That the training data's questionable origins somehow prevents the technology from functioning at all.

I couldn't convince them otherwise. But, life isn't fair and **both things can be true simultaneously**: the origin of something can be problematic _and_ the results can be real.

This analogy kept coming to mind: If someone steals materials to build a bomb and successfully builds it, they have a functioning bomb. The theft doesn't retroactively prevent the bomb from existing or reduce its explosive capability. Proving the theft might help with future bombs or justify going after the bomb-maker, but it doesn't cause the current bomb to magically self-dismantle.

This seems obvious to meâ€”embarrassingly so. Yet I keep encountering this form of reasoning about LLMs, and it strikes me as a particular kind of denial.

There's something almost magical in the thinking: that moral illegitimacy can somehow negate physical reality. That if we disapprove strongly enough of how something was created, we can wish away its actual capabilities.

**The ethical questions around LLM training data are important and deserve serious discussion.** But pretending the technology doesn't work because we don't like how it was built isn't engaging with realityâ€”it's a form of wishful thinking that prevents us from dealing effectively with the situation we actually face.

Whether we like it or not, the bomb has been built. Now we need to figure out what to do about it.

Someone told me that prompt engineering isn't realâ€”that it's just techbros rebranding "good writing" and "using words well." I disagree, and here's why:

Prompt engineering fundamentally differs from writing for human audiences because **LLMs aren't people**. When done rigorously, prompt engineering relies on automated evaluations and measurable metrics at a scale impossible with human communication. While we do test human-facing content through focus groups and A/B testing, the scale and precision (such as it is) here are entirely different.

The "engineering" aspect involves systematic tinkeringâ€”sometimes by humans tweaking language, sometimes by LLMs themselvesâ€”to activate specific emergent behaviors in models. Some of these techniques come from formal research; others are educated hunches that prove effective through testing.

**Effective prompts often resemble terrible writing.** The ritual forms, repetitions, and structural patterns that improve LLM performance would make a professional editor cringe. Yet they produce measurable improvements in evaluation metrics.

Consider adversarial prompts: they're often stuffed with tokens that are nonsense to humans but exploit specific model quirks. Here, the goal is explicitly to use language in ways that _aren't_ human-legible, making attacks harder to detect during review.

Good writing skills can help someone pick up prompt engineering faster, but mastering it requires learning to use words and grammar in weird, counterintuitive ways that are frankly sometimes horrifying.

All-in-all, prompt engineering may still be somewhat hand-wavy as a discipline, but it's definitely realâ€”and definitely not just rebranded writing advice.

According to the count in my [archives](https://blog.lmorchard.com/archives.html), I've published over 50 blog posts in the past few weeks. That's roughly 50 more than I managed in the previous 10 years!

These aren't masterpiecesâ€”mostly just random thoughts and half-baked ideas. But [as I mentioned before](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/09/blogging-elsewhere-than-into-the-void/), I'd rather throw a bunch of stuff at the wall and see what sticks than spend another decade crafting the perfect post that never gets published.

So, here's how I tinkered my way into a writing setup that seems to actually be working.

## Obsidian daybook

I use Obsidian as a daybook (or [Commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book))â€”one Markdown file per day, created fresh each morning from a template, named something like "2025-06-02.md" and stuffed into a folder for the year.

All day long, I just brain dump into this fileâ€”random thoughts, to-do items, complaints about software, whatever. Sometimes an idea gets interesting enough to spawn its own page. Sometimes I throw tags around to pretend I'm organized. Mostly it's just a place where thoughts go to live and accumulate over the year.

I've been meaning to write some fancy plugins for Obsidian for about six years now. Spoiler alert: I haven't. Turns out the simple stuff works fine, and complicated systems are just more things to break.

## Syncthing

I could use [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync), and it would probably make my life easier. But I'm masochistic and cheap, so I use [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) instead. My notes are just files sitting in foldersâ€”why overcomplicate it?

Syncthing runs on everything I own: my laptop, my phone, my NAS, probably my wifi-connected oven if I tried hard enough. When I edit something on one device, it eventually shows up everywhere else. Sometimes there are conflicts, but they're manageable.

My Synology NAS backs everything up to git and then to the cloud, because I'm paranoid about losing six years of random thoughts. (Also, trying to sync notes with iCloud Drive nearly drove me to therapy, so don't do that.)

## Easy-Blog Oven

A while back, I built my own static site generator. I called it [my Easy-Blog Oven](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2020/05/24/easy-blog-oven/index.html) because naming things is hard and I thought that matched the gravitas of the endeavor. It takes Markdown files and turns them into a website, mostly following [the Jekyll convention](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) of putting dates in filenames.

The system worked fine when I was trying to write Important Blog Posts. But creating a new file every time I wanted to say something turned out to be just enough friction to make me not say anything at all. Laziness is stronger than creativity.

## Daybook blogging

Here's where things got interesting. I was already using Obsidian as a private daybook, just dumping thoughts into one file per day. Then I remembered doing something similar years ago [with Dave Winer's OPML Editor](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/09/new-blog-a-lot-like-the-old/)â€”one file per day as an idea accumulator, but in public.

Why not bring that daybook approach to the blog?

The magic trick was [adding separators](](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/114479665487739422)) so I could put multiple blog posts in a single daily file. Now I start each day with one rambling post full of random thoughts. Some of those thoughts graduate to become their own posts, without me having to do anything fancy ahead of time like "create a new file" or "think of a title before I start writing."

## Putting it all together

So here's my daily routine: Obsidian open on my laptop, split screen. Private daybook on the left, public daybook on the right. Each morning I create both daily files from templates, because I like consistency even if everything else is chaos.

![[attachments/2025-06-02-obsidian-daybook.png]]

Throughout the day, I move ideas between private and public as the mood strikes. I can wander off to get coffee and keep writing on my phone. Syncthing makes sure everything ends up everywhere, including my always-on NAS.

Since my NAS was already committing my private notes to git (because paranoia), it wasn't hard to make it commit my public notes to a different repository on GitHub. From there, [a GitHub Action](](https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/prod.yml)) rebuilds my blog and uploads it to Amazon S3.

And all of this, because apparently I enjoy building Rube Goldberg machines in my spare time.

## Why This Rube Goldberg Machine Actually Works

This contraption works because it removes all the stupid little decisions that used to stop me from writing. No "should I write a post about this?" moments. No staring at blank "New Post" screens. No futzing over titles before I've even figured out what I want to say.

Ideas just start as notes and become posts when they feel like it. There's no ceremony, no artificial distinction between "real writing" and "just thinking out loud."

The whole thing is built on stuff I was already doing anywayâ€”taking notes, backing things up, procrastinating on important work. The publishing just happens as a side effect, which is honestly the only way I was ever going to publish anything consistently.

Sometimes the best system is the one that's too lazy to get in your way.
