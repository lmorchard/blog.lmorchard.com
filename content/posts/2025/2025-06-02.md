- Hello world!
- Jotted down a couple posts today on AI stuff that aren't particularly revelatory.
	- If anything, they're just me trying to think out loud and clarify.
	- I'm probably going to try writing more stuff like this, if only to be Wrong on the Internet and lure someone in to correct me. ðŸ˜…

I found myself in a frustrating argument with someone convinced that LLMs are pure vaporwareâ€”incapable of real work. Their reasoning? Since LLMs were trained on stolen material, the results they produce can't actually exist.

Not that the results should be considered illegitimate or taintedâ€”but that they're literally impossible. That the training data's questionable origins somehow prevents the technology from functioning at all.

I couldn't convince them otherwise. But, life isn't fair and **both things can be true simultaneously**: the origin of something can be problematic _and_ the results can be real.

This analogy kept coming to mind: If someone steals materials to build a bomb and successfully builds it, they have a functioning bomb. The theft doesn't retroactively prevent the bomb from existing or reduce its explosive capability. Proving the theft might help with future bombs or justify going after the bomb-maker, but it doesn't cause the current bomb to magically self-dismantle.

This seems obvious to meâ€”embarrassingly so. Yet I keep encountering this form of reasoning about LLMs, and it strikes me as a particular kind of denial.

There's something almost magical in the thinking: that moral illegitimacy can somehow negate physical reality. That if we disapprove strongly enough of how something was created, we can wish away its actual capabilities.

**The ethical questions around LLM training data are important and deserve serious discussion.** But pretending the technology doesn't work because we don't like how it was built isn't engaging with realityâ€”it's a form of wishful thinking that prevents us from dealing effectively with the situation we actually face.

Whether we like it or not, the bomb has been built. Now we need to figure out what to do about it.

Someone told me that prompt engineering isn't realâ€”that it's just techbros rebranding "good writing" and "using words well." I disagree, and here's why:

Prompt engineering fundamentally differs from writing for human audiences because **LLMs aren't people**. When done rigorously, prompt engineering relies on automated evaluations and measurable metrics at a scale impossible with human communication. While we do test human-facing content through focus groups and A/B testing, the scale and precision (such as it is) here are entirely different.

The "engineering" aspect involves systematic tinkeringâ€”sometimes by humans tweaking language, sometimes by LLMs themselvesâ€”to activate specific emergent behaviors in models. Some of these techniques come from formal research; others are educated hunches that prove effective through testing.

**Effective prompts often resemble terrible writing.** The ritual forms, repetitions, and structural patterns that improve LLM performance would make a professional editor cringe. Yet they produce measurable improvements in evaluation metrics.

Consider adversarial prompts: they're often stuffed with tokens that are nonsense to humans but exploit specific model quirks. Here, the goal is explicitly to use language in ways that _aren't_ human-legible, making attacks harder to detect during review.

Good writing skills can help someone pick up prompt engineering faster, but mastering it requires learning to use words and grammar in weird, counterintuitive ways that are frankly sometimes horrifying.

All-in-all, prompt engineering may still be somewhat hand-wavy as a discipline, but it's definitely realâ€”and definitely not just rebranded writing advice.

According to the count in my [archives](https://blog.lmorchard.com/archives.html), I've published over 50 blog posts in the past few weeks. That's about as many as I've managed to publish in the past 10 years!

Granted, they're small posts and none of them are masterworks. But, [like I wrote earlier](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/09/blogging-elsewhere-than-into-the-void/), I'm hoping to land a few moderately decent things instead of waiting until I come up with something great.

So, I figured I might write something about the assemblage of parts I've accumulated over time that added up to this low-friction writing system I have now.

## Obsidian

I use Obsidian as a daybook, for taking notes and writing in general. One Markdown file per day, created every morning from a template, named for the current date in a folder for the current year.

In that file, I accumulate notions and tasks over the course of a day. Occasionally, something buds off into a linked page devoted to the topic - a project, a person, a train of thought. Sometimes I use tags to index bullet points on themes I might want to collect & review later.

Beyond all of that, I don't use many of the fancier features of Obsidian. There are a few things I do by hand for which I keep meaning to write a plugin or some scripts - but it's been about six years of never quite getting around to it.

## Syncthing

I don't use Obsidian Sync, though it would probably make my life easier if I did. Instead, I use Syncthing - that works well enough since my Obsidian notes are really just a pile of files.

Like Obsidian, there are builds of Syncthing for every desktop & laptop OS. It also works on my Synology NAS for backups. When I had an Android phone, I used a version of Syncthing that ran great. Now that I have an iPhone, I use a version of Syncthing that works as well as it can within the limitations of iOS.

This means that I can edit notes on one of about 7 redundant copies across devices - the changes land everywhere eventually. There are conflicts sometimes, but they're manageable. Periodically, the Synology NAS commits changes to a remote git repository, and the files get included in a big offsite cloud backup.

For what it's worth, at one point I tried using iCloud Drive to sync notes between my iPhone and a MacBook Pro. That worked so horribly that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

## Easy-Blog Oven

Iâ€™ve written about it before, but I built my own static site generator for this blog. I call it my Easy-Blog Oven. It mostly follows [the convention I picked up from Jekyll ](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) years ago - i.e. one Markdown file per post, named for the date and a URL path slug.

But, one thing I've learned is that friction adds up in user interfaces. It can be a squelch threshold that filters out noise that might be worth considering signal. Creating new files worked well enough when I was trying to hold back until I had Big Things to write. But, that was enough of a drag to keep me from posting much at all.

My use of Obsidian as a private daybook got me thinking, though: I used to write that way in public [using Dave Winer's OPML Editor](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/09/new-blog-a-lot-like-the-old/). One file per day as an idea accumulator. Why couldn't I do that with my own system now?

The tweak that seemed to unlock it for me was the addition of a multipart separator to the post format, so I could edit one file per day with multiple blog posts. The file starts with one daily post of miscellaneous ideas, some of which can develop into separate posts without leaving that file.

So, my daily habit now is this: on the left side in my Obsidian window is my private daybook, while on the right side is my public daybook.
