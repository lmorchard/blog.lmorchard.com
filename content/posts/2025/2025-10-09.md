- Hello world!
- I almost hate to talk about it for fear of jinxing myself, but: 
	- I tend to write 3 journal pages every week day. Takes me about an hour, and I've managed to reliably do it for almost 10 years now. I've accumulated a lot.
	- A month ago, I decided to trade that hour on Tuesday and Thursday for creative writing. I've never found a consistent slot in my day for it until now, but for some reason trading out the journal writing never occurred until now.
	- It's ended up being a pretty ideal time, an hour in the day where my brain's not yet entire mush and I've usually been able to carve it away from everything else.
	- Since I started doing that, I managed to finish 3 half-abandoned short stories and then get 2000 words into a brand new one.
	- Crossing fingers I can keep this up, because it's something I've wanted to make work for a stupid long time. I have been able to write in little occasional bursts of hyperfocus, but I need a more consistent drumbeat between those.
	- I've avoided looking for writing groups, because social pressure and accountability doesn't seem to push me to get things done like it does for other folks. So, like, I have to already be getting the thing done to feel like it's worth the social outing.
	- I'm thinking about getting more folks to read my stuff, though I know what I'm doing right now is going to be terrible until I've managed to do it for awhile.
	- That said, I posted [Behemoth](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/10/07/behemoth/) yesterday just to get it away from me. Maybe I'll do more of that as I finish things?
