- Hello world!
- My brain's been eaten by work for most of this week, so the blogging slowed down a bunch. Hoping to pick it up again soon.
- I'm almost afraid to mention that I spent a bunch of this week deep down an LLM vibe-coding rabbit hole.
- We'll see how good it all ends up being, but I cycled through a handful of models and ended up with about 11,000 lines of code with unit tests.
