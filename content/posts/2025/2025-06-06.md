- Hello world!
- My brain's been eaten by work for most of this week, so the blogging slowed down a bunch. Hoping to pick it up again soon.
- I'm almost afraid to mention that I spent a bunch of this week deep down an LLM vibe-coding rabbit hole in Windsurf.
	- Just in time for [Anthropic to cut Windsurf off from Claude models](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/anthropic-co-founder-on-cutting-access-to-windsurf-it-would-be-odd-for-us-to-sell-claude-to-openai/) - oops.
- We'll see how good it all ends up being, but I cycled through a handful of models and ended up with about 11,000 lines of code with unit tests that did what I intended it to do.
	- It wasn't great code - a lot of it was boilerplate - but it's mostly stuff I would have ended up doing myself more tediously while fighting my ADHD.
- Trying to compose some thoughts somewhat along the lines of [Harper Reed's LLM codegen workflow](https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/):
	- As in, I settled on a workflow that wasn't just pestering the agent with wishes.
	- I had a series of sessions, each started by creating a directory named for a new git branch. I wrote a shell script to semi-automate this.
	- In that directory, I wrote a couple hundred words of intention in a **spec.md** file.
	- Then I asked the agent to expand my intentions into a detailed step-by-step **plan.md** file.
	- I edited the plan and asked the agent to review it critically and ask questions. I answered the questions.
	- I asked the agent to review it again and tell me if the plan looked clear enough to start implementing.
	- When it said "yes", I told it to start implementing.
	- The agent started implementing while I watched.
	- Sometimes I interrupted and told it that it was on the wrong track. But, for long stretches I was just reviewing the code as it wrote.
	- When it thought it was done, I asked it to review the current changes against the plan and judge if it was really done. Sometimes it wasn't and it went back to work.
	- When it petered out finally, I told it to make sure all the tests passed and linting errors were fixed. It did that.
	- I made sure the tests made sense, myself, fixed a few that didn't. Then I told it to run the tests some more.
	- Finally, when I was decently satisfied with the results, I told it to review our entire chat history for this session and summarize the results in a **notes.md** file.
	- In particular, I told it to pay special attention to things we did that hadn't been captured in the plan. Try to come up with unexpected conditions and
