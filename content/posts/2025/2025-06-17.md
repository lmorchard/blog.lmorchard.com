- Hello world!
- It continues to be kind of a perfect storm to bring a halt to my recent rapid-fire blogging. ðŸ˜”
	- I'm pitching in on two teams at work, which really cuts down on time to stop and smell the RSS feeds to find things to write about.
	- Even though I'm doing a lot of LLM-assisted coding lately, I'm doing it for more projects than usual.
	- But also, my homebrew RSS feed reader just broke and I've been too busy to fix it. So, I haven't been, you know, reading feeds much lately.
- I did just [reopen the books](https://github.com/lmorchard/pebbling-club/pull/239) on this Pebbling Club side project I've had going off & on since last summer. So maybe I'll resume progress on that too?
	- One of the things I did was to get this thing working on a more mundane stack with redis and postgresql, deployed via docker-compose on a server in my basement.
	- And then I wrote [this post-receive git hook that enables a git-push deploy process](https://github.com/lmorchard/pebbling-club/blob/main/docker/compose/post-receive) like I'm running a real PaaS next to my water heater.
- At some point, I need to sit down and actually write out a pitch or something for Pebbling Club. I'd like to make it into something, but the gears of time and motivation keep slipping.
	- I did make this sorta mind-map in an Obsidian canvas to try to sketch out the general concept though: ![[attachments/2025-06-17-pebbling-club-mindmap.png]]
