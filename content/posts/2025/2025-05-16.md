- Hello world!
- I listen to podcasts at between 1.8x - 2.5x, depending on the day's mental weather. That means, when I've met a podcaster I listen to, they sound drugged or drunk to me.
	- I’ve had folks tell me this sounds stressful. But, I get distracted in the gaps and my mind wanders. Easier for me to follow rapid word dumps. 
	- This is not a flex, this is a coping strategy. 
- The new Peter Murphy album, "[Silver Shade](https://petermurphy.bandcamp.com/album/silver-shade)", sure is Peter Murphy. 
	- I don't hate this at all.
	- I'm really digging the collabs he did here, teaming up with folks like Boy George, Trent Reznor, and Justin Chancellor.
- Hey, you, service provider on the web that I pay for: I am annoyed that I'm constantly signed out when I come to visit. You don't remember me, and you are constantly trying to call-to-action and dark-pattern me into your growth hacks when I already have an account.

Chris Stokel-Walker, "[Why untested AI-generated code is a crisis waiting to happen](https://leaddev.com/software-quality/why-untested-ai-generated-code-is-a-crisis-waiting-to-happen)":

> The fear is of a slow-burn crisis where generative AI engines spew reams of code, stitched from web-scraped snippets with dubious provenance. 
> 
> When that code leaps from prompt to production without being vetted, the potential attack surface balloons in size. The bill for defective code is already sizable: 40% of firms say malfunctioning or miscoded software costs them at least $1 million a year, through staff churn, increased technical debt, and escalating maintenance costs, with losses above $5 million in almost half of large US firms.

So, don't let "code leap from prompt to production without being vetted" - it's not like it happens on its own. Steady hand on the tiller. Vibe coding is fine for screwing around and exploration, but assume you're going to be on pager duty for whatever hits production. And if someday you stick an LLM on pager duty, may Eris have mercy on your soul.

Android Authority, "[YouTube’s new ads will ruin the best part of a video on purpose](https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-peak-points-ads-3557905/)":

> YouTube is always cooking up new ways to show you ads. Be it skippable ads, non-skippable ads, mid-rolls, or bumpers, the goal, as always, is to find more places to make more money. And now, thanks to AI, YouTube has found a brand-new spot to squeeze in ads — right when something exciting happens in a video.

I don't think I quite understand the point of ads on YouTube, these days. Are they there to get me to think favorably of an advertiser and buy something from them? Or are they there to annoy me into paying for YouTube Premium? Does this make anyone happy?

The Verge, "[Anthropic blames Claude AI for ‘embarrassing and unintentional mistake’ in legal filing](https://www.theverge.com/news/668315/anthropic-claude-legal-filing-citation-error)"

> Anthropic has responded to allegations that it used an AI-fabricated source in its legal battle against music publishers, saying its Claude chatbot made an “honest citation mistake.”

This is dumb. Don't do that. That's like blaming your cordless drill for hitting a pipe or wiring in the wall while working to mount a shelf. It's not the tool's fault. A bad workman blames his tools. It's your hand holding the tool—own the mistake.

A little early, but answering with a bottled message of my own here.
