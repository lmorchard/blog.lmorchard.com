- Hello world!
- I listen to podcasts at between 1.8x - 2.5x, depending on the day's mental weather. That means, when I've met a podcaster I listen to, they sound drugged or drunk to me.
- The new Peter Murphy album, "[Silver Shade](https://petermurphy.bandcamp.com/album/silver-shade)", sure is Peter Murphy. 
	- I don't hate this at all.
	- I'm really digging the collabs he did here, especially with like Boy George

The Verge, "[Anthropic blames Claude AI for ‘embarrassing and unintentional mistake’ in legal filing](https://www.theverge.com/news/668315/anthropic-claude-legal-filing-citation-error)"

> Anthropic has responded to allegations that it used an AI-fabricated source in its legal battle against music publishers, saying its Claude chatbot made an “honest citation mistake.”

This is dumb. Don't do that. That's like blaming your cordless drill for hitting a pipe or wiring in the wall while working to mount a shelf. It's not the tool's fault. A bad workman blames his tools. It's your hand holding the tool—own the mistake.
