- Hello world!
- I listen to podcasts at between 1.8x - 2.5x, depending on the day's mental weather. That means, when I've met a podcaster I listen to, they sound drugged or drunk to me.
	- I’ve had folks tell me this sounds stressful. But, I get distracted in the gaps and my mind wanders. Easier for me to follow rapid word dumps. 
	- This is not a flex, this is a coping strategy. 
- The new Peter Murphy album, "[Silver Shade](https://petermurphy.bandcamp.com/album/silver-shade)", sure is Peter Murphy. 
	- I don't hate this at all.
	- I'm really digging the collabs he did here, teaming up with folks like Boy George, Trent Reznor, and Justin Chancellor.
- Hey, you, service provider on the web that I pay for: I am annoyed that I'm constantly signed out when I come to visit. You don't remember me, and you are constantly trying to call-to-action and dark-pattern me into your growth hacks when I already have an account.

The Verge, "[Anthropic blames Claude AI for ‘embarrassing and unintentional mistake’ in legal filing](https://www.theverge.com/news/668315/anthropic-claude-legal-filing-citation-error)"

> Anthropic has responded to allegations that it used an AI-fabricated source in its legal battle against music publishers, saying its Claude chatbot made an “honest citation mistake.”

This is dumb. Don't do that. That's like blaming your cordless drill for hitting a pipe or wiring in the wall while working to mount a shelf. It's not the tool's fault. A bad workman blames his tools. It's your hand holding the tool—own the mistake.

Matt Webb, "[When was peak message in a bottle?](https://interconnected.org/home/2025/05/16/bottle)":

> I grew up with the idea that you could put a paper note in a bottle and throw it into the ocean, and somebody might find it a thousand miles away.

> So maybe this is my message in a bottle, right here? If it’s 2035 for you pls do drop me a note.

A little early, but answering with a bottled message of my own here.
