- Hello world!
- New album from Nation of Language, "[Dance Called Memory](https://nationoflanguage.bandcamp.com/album/dance-called-memory)" - kinda sounds like Talk Talk and The Shins got together?
	- We saw them last year with Blonde Redhead at Revolution Hall.
	- I see they're back at Revolution Hall next month, but already sold out!
- I got my COVID & flu shots yesterday, yay!
	- I kind of expect these to be outlawed soon. (Ugh!)
	- But, [you can get them without a prescription in Oregon](https://sharedsystems.dhsoha.state.or.us/DHSForms/Served/le-1130100.pdf), for now at least.
- I wrote more yesterday, yay!
	- But, I posted [a dumb rant](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/09/18/only-licensed-never-bought/) just to kind of post something.
	- But also, that's kind of what blogging's for sometimes I guess?
- I've managed to do some more creative writing, lately!
	- Pretty much finished 3 short stories that lingered semi-abandoned for a few years. That's a big deal!
	- But, I haven't posted any of it here. Maybe I should?
	- I'm rather pleased with [most of the fiction](https://blog.lmorchard.com/tag/fiction/) I've posted here, but I don't think much of anybody has read any of it.
		- I guess those weren't great [search queries](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query)?
	- Part of me thinks I should refrain from posting more fiction, in case I might someday want to submit it somewhere for sale.
		- Another part of me wants to collect my favorite bits of what I've done and self-publish it all as a vanity chapbook.
		- But, I think this is getting ahead of myself, if no one's read it to tell me how awful it all is. ðŸ˜…
	- I should find a writing group to get some feedback.
