From The Hollywood Reporter, [5,000 Podcasts. 3,000 Episodes a Week. $1 Cost Per Episode — Behind an AI Start Up’s Plan](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/ai-podcast-start-up-plan-shows-1236361367/):

> “We believe that in the near future half the people on the planet will be AI, and we are the company that’s bringing those people to life,” said CEO Jeanine Wright, who was previously chief operating officer of podcasting company [Wondery](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/amazon-wondery-podcast-studio-ceo-jen-sargent-1236336750/), which has recently had to reorganize under the changing podcast landscape.

This is just such a ludicrous thing to drop

>  As for how it stacks up against human podcasts? “I think that people who are still referring to all AI-generated content as AI slop are probably lazy luddites. Because there’s a lot of really good stuff out there,” Wright said. 

This is just a shitty, tone-deaf answer from someone trying to sell 

> The content team, led by Katie Brown, a former lifestyle television host and home goods expert, gives each podcast a title, creates an outline of the podcast, with the content filled out by AI, and assigns it one of the personalities as a host. Other team members do a final check and add in music and sound. The shows are also spot-checked periodically.
