- Hello world! Let's see if I can write more that that, today!

Sometimes startup CEOs say the quiet part out loud. Case in point from The Hollywood Reporter, [5,000 Podcasts. 3,000 Episodes a Week. $1 Cost Per Episode — Behind an AI Start Up’s Plan](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/ai-podcast-start-up-plan-shows-1236361367/):

> “We believe that in the near future half the people on the planet will be AI, and we are the company that’s bringing those people to life,” said CEO Jeanine Wright, who was previously chief operating officer of podcasting company [Wondery](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/amazon-wondery-podcast-studio-ceo-jen-sargent-1236336750/), which has recently had to reorganize under the changing podcast landscape.

When a CEO says something like this, I can't help but imagine the intended audience isn't any sort of street-level consumer or user. This seems aimed at the hopes and dreams of investors. Like, seriously: you're bringing people to life? Are they going to listen to your podcasts too?

>  As for how it stacks up against human podcasts? “I think that people who are still referring to all AI-generated content as AI slop are probably lazy luddites. Because there’s a lot of really good stuff out there,” Wright said. 

Again, the intended audience for something like this just can't be a random human with an iPhone and a set of AirPods. This is such a tone-deaf, shitty answer—unless it's to make an AI-hopeful with heavy pockets feel good about how forward-leaning and industrious they are for already seeing the value in this CEO's endeavor.

> The content team, led by Katie Brown, a former lifestyle television host and home goods expert, gives each podcast a title, creates an outline of the podcast, with the content filled out by AI, and assigns it one of the personalities as a host. Other team members do a final check and add in music and sound. The shows are also spot-checked periodically.

This sounds less like editorial judgment and more like a rubber stamp. If the only safeguard is a spot check, that’s not quality control—it’s plausible deniability in the slop factory.

This is where I think the current era of AI intersects with the current era of enshittification the most: where a company has such an obviously solipsistic view on individual humans interacting with their product.

They [essentially regard users as NPC triggering metrics events](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/27/only-metrics-care/index.html) that drive graphs which ideally impress investors. In this case, who cares if it's slop? Those brainless marks out in the world will eat it up anyway—and now we can produce it on the cheap!

And that's the part that stings. Because I really do think these tools can help augment folks and their capacities to create and share. And the worth of the result rises with the degree of humanity engaged at every stage. Slop is cheap, but it’s not inevitable—as long as we keep the human side of creation in the loop.
