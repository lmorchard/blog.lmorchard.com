From The Hollywood Reporter, [5,000 Podcasts. 3,000 Episodes a Week. $1 Cost Per Episode — Behind an AI Start Up’s Plan](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/ai-podcast-start-up-plan-shows-1236361367/):

> “We believe that in the near future half the people on the planet will be AI, and we are the company that’s bringing those people to life,” said CEO Jeanine Wright, who was previously chief operating officer of podcasting company [Wondery](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/amazon-wondery-podcast-studio-ceo-jen-sargent-1236336750/), which has recently had to reorganize under the changing podcast landscape.

When a CEO says something like this, I can't help but imagine the intended audience isn't, like, any sort of street-level consumer or user. This seems aimed at the hopes and dreams of investors. Like, seriously: you're bringing people to life? Are they going to listen to your podcasts too?

>  As for how it stacks up against human podcasts? “I think that people who are still referring to all AI-generated content as AI slop are probably lazy luddites. Because there’s a lot of really good stuff out there,” Wright said. 

Again, the intended audience for something like this just can't be a random human with an iPhone and a set of Airpods. This is just a shitty, tone-deaf answer—unless it's to make an AI-hopeful with heavy pockets feel good about how forward-leaning and industrious they are by contrast to those lazy luddites.

> The content team, led by Katie Brown, a former lifestyle television host and home goods expert, gives each podcast a title, creates an outline of the podcast, with the content filled out by AI, and assigns it one of the personalities as a host. Other team members do a final check and add in music and sound. The shows are also spot-checked periodically.

If it's not clear from recent posts, I'm cautiously hopeful about the sorts of things this current era of LLMs and AI can unlock for people (myself included). I'm in neither the never-AI skeptic camp, nor the singularity-is-nigh camp.

But, this is what I want to know more about from this product to figure out if it's going to be something interesting—or if it's just going to be a slop factory. How involved are humans in this process? If they're doing "spo"
