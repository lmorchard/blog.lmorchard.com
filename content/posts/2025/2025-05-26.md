- Hello world!
- Figured I might write a bit more here over the weekend, but instead I mostly puttered around the house catching up on some needfuls.
- There's a part of me who kind of wished I'd taken photos and written about it - but meh, not everything needs documenting.

Keith Kurson, "[The End of Glitch (Even Though They Say It Isn't)](https://blog.keith.is/blog/the-end-of-glitch-even-though-they-say-it-isnt/)":

> The thing that breaks my heart isn’t just that another platform is shutting down—it’s that we’re losing one of the last places on the internet that prioritized joy and experimentation over engagement metrics and revenue optimization.
> 
> For a few years, Glitch was the closest thing we had to the early web’s spirit of “view source” and “anyone can build here.” But let’s be honest: we proved that you can’t build a sustainable platform around helping people create rather than consume—at least not in today’s internet economy. The math just doesn’t work when hosting costs real money and creative tools don’t generate the kind of engagement that sells ads or subscriptions.

Glitch has always been one of those things I was rooting for. I've had a few projects there and even had a paid membership for a little while. Still, I never really used it as much as I'd've liked and I didn't get into the community. Kept meaning to do more but kept not quite doing it.

It's always been a thing I liked the idea of and liked that it was there... for other folks. I often wished that Mozilla offered something like it. In fact, I still think every Mozilla (née Firefox) Account should come equipped with a bit of hosting, storage, and compute to help folks more fully participate on the web. Even better if there's a little IDE hooked up, say, integrated with MDN?

But for me, personally, Glitch was never quite a good fit. I kept running into the limits of the editor. And, I always found myself reaching for other hosting venues like AWS, GCP, GitHub Pages, or even just hardware in my own basement.

Maybe if I'd actually gotten hooked on the social & remix aspects of Glitch, I might have found myself tinkering there more often? I think that's more a comment on me than Glitch, though: Being a social human is an uphill effort for me. So, the community never quite drew me. But, I really admired that it was there and how the folks at Glitch cared for it.

And that's the thing: I admire the heck out of pro-social efforts on the web that prioritize joy and creativity and experimentation.
