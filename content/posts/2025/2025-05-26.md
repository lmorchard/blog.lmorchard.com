- Hello world!
- Figured I might write a bit more here over the weekend, but instead I mostly puttered around the house catching up on some needfuls.
- There's a part of me who kind of wished I'd taken photos and written about it - but meh, not everything needs documenting.

Glitch Blog, "[Important Changes are Coming to Glitch](https://blog.glitch.com/post/changes-are-coming-to-glitch/)":

> We’ve got an important update for the Glitch community today: We’ll be ending web hosting for your apps on Glitch.
> ...
> In the last few years, we’ve seen a lot of amazing new platforms that have raised the bar on how we create and run apps, just as Glitch first did almost a decade ago. ... So with so many good options for easily making and running apps, Glitch’s legacy architecture hasn’t been providing something uniquely valuable to the developer ecosystem at this point, and we want to focus our efforts on serving our developer community where we can be most valuable.

> to say it was an honor and privilege to help launch and grow the inspiring, creative glitch community is an understatement, just as much as saying “this news is disappointing yet unsurprising” is. but i know that the glitch team will make this transition as community-focused, fair and smooth as possible for all of us.

"[The End of Glitch (Even Though They Say It Isn't)](https://blog.keith.is/blog/the-end-of-glitch-even-though-they-say-it-isnt/)":

> The thing that breaks my heart isn’t just that another platform is shutting down—it’s that we’re losing one of the last places on the internet that prioritized joy and experimentation over engagement metrics and revenue optimization.
> 
> For a few years, Glitch was the closest thing we had to the early web’s spirit of “view source” and “anyone can build here.” But let’s be honest: we proved that you can’t build a sustainable platform around helping people create rather than consume—at least not in today’s internet economy. The math just doesn’t work when hosting costs real money and creative tools don’t generate the kind of engagement that sells ads or subscriptions.
