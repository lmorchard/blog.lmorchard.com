- Hello world!
- Figured I might write a bit more here over the weekend, but instead I mostly puttered around the house catching up on some needfuls.
- There's a part of me who kind of wished I'd taken photos and written about it - but meh, not everything needs documenting.

Keith Kurson, "[The End of Glitch (Even Though They Say It Isn't)](https://blog.keith.is/blog/the-end-of-glitch-even-though-they-say-it-isnt/)":

> The thing that breaks my heart isn’t just that another platform is shutting down—it’s that we’re losing one of the last places on the internet that prioritized joy and experimentation over engagement metrics and revenue optimization.

> For a few years, Glitch was the closest thing we had to the early web’s spirit of “view source” and “anyone can build here.” But let’s be honest: we proved that you can’t build a sustainable platform around helping people create rather than consume—at least not in today’s internet economy. The math just doesn’t work when hosting costs real money and creative tools don’t generate the kind of engagement that sells ads or subscriptions.

Glitch has always been one of those things I was rooting for. I've had a few projects there, even had a paid membership for a little while.

I've often wished Mozilla offered something like it. I still think every Mozilla (née Firefox) Account should come equipped with a bit of hosting, storage, and compute to help folks more fully participate on the web. Even better if there's a little IDE hooked up, say, integrated with MDN?

But, for me personally, Glitch was never quite a good fit. I kept running into the limits of the editor. And, I always found myself reaching for other hosting venues like AWS, GCP, GitHub Pages, or even just hardware in my own basement.

When [Fastly acquired Glitch](https://www.fastly.com/press/press-releases/fastly-announces-acquisition-of-glitch), I'd kind of assumed they'd carry the product forward more in the direction of [Amazon Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). I've gotten real productive work done with those cloud dev environments, especially when my laptop du jour wasn't up to the job of running a full stack locally. Seems like Fastly has all the pieces to build something like that and Glitch could have evolved into the glue?

Glitch wasn't really a good social fit for me, either. Maybe if I'd actually gotten hooked on the sharing & remix aspects of Glitch, I might have found myself tinkering there more often?

I think that's more a comment on me than Glitch, though: Being a social human is an uphill effort for me. So, the community never quite drew me in, even though I admired the heck out of how the folks at Glitch cared for it.

I love efforts on the web that prioritize joy, creativity, and experimentation. Even if my own social circuits are a bit dysfunctional, my most gratifying work has been when I've helped build that kind of thing. 

But, yeah, it rarely seems sustainable, let alone profitable. The efforts are so often ephemeral at best - except for maybe where they're self-funded labors of love by folks who pay their bills by other means. 

I've [felt like it's 2004 again](https://www.anildash.com/2024/10/15/its-2004-again/) in some corners of the web. But, [the bots are watching us dance](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2024/03/11/dance-for-the-bots/index.html) and getting all the funding instead. That [feels kinda like 2000 - 2002 again](https://skooloflife.medium.com/99-of-ai-startups-will-be-dead-by-2026-heres-why-bfc974edd968) and I'm not yet sure who'll end up being pets.com. I don't expect it all to evaporate, but it's going to be churn city until a new generative loop is formed.
