- Hello world!
- Figured I might write a bit more here over the weekend, but instead I mostly puttered around the house catching up on some needfuls.
- There's a part of me who kind of wished I'd taken photos and written about it - but meh, not everything needs documenting.

Keith Kurson, "[The End of Glitch (Even Though They Say It Isn't)](https://blog.keith.is/blog/the-end-of-glitch-even-though-they-say-it-isnt/)":

> The thing that breaks my heart isn’t just that another platform is shutting down—it’s that we’re losing one of the last places on the internet that prioritized joy and experimentation over engagement metrics and revenue optimization.

Glitch was always one of those platforms I wanted to love more than I actually did. I kept a paid membership for a while, built a few projects there, and genuinely rooted for what they were trying to do. 

But I kept bumping against its limits. The editor never quite clicked for me, and I found myself gravitating toward other hosting options: AWS, GitHub Pages, even hardware in my basement. When [Fastly acquired Glitch](https://www.fastly.com/press/press-releases/fastly-announces-acquisition-of-glitch), I assumed they'd evolve it toward something more like [Amazon Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).—powerful cloud development environments where I've actually gotten real work done. Fastly had all the pieces to build that kind of infrastructure.

The social aspects never hooked me either, though that's more a reflection of my own limitations than Glitch's. Being social takes effort for me, and I never quite got pulled into the community that others found so compelling. I admired how carefully the Glitch team cultivated that space, even if I couldn't fully participate in it.

## The Sustainability Problem
What breaks my heart is the same thing Kurson identifies: platforms that prioritize creativity over metrics rarely survive. The math is brutal when hosting costs real money but creative tools don't generate the engagement that sells ads or subscriptions. Most of these efforts end up ephemeral unless they're self-funded labors of love by people who pay their bills elsewhere.

I keep thinking Mozilla should build something like this—imagine if every Firefox Account came with hosting, storage, and compute, maybe with an IDE integrated right into MDN. But even Mozilla has struggled to find sustainable models for tools that help people create rather than just consume.

## Casualties of the AI Gold Rush
There's something particularly galling about Glitch's timing. We're in the middle of an AI gold rush where venture capital flows freely to companies building the next ChatGPT wrapper, but platforms that actually help humans learn to code and create can't find sustainable footing. The bots are watching us dance and getting all the funding instead.

It feels like 2000-2002 all over again—a lot of frothy investment that'll eventually crash, leaving us to figure out who was pets.com and who was Amazon. I don't expect it all to evaporate, but we're headed for serious churn until new sustainable patterns emerge. Glitch feels like an early casualty of that transition.

The web needs more places that prioritize joy and experimentation. Losing them one by one makes the internet a little less magical, a little more corporate, and a lot less welcoming to the next generation of creators who might have learned to love building things on the web.


I love efforts on the web that prioritize joy, creativity, and experimentation. Even if my own social circuits are a bit dysfunctional, my most gratifying work has been when I've helped build that kind of thing. 

But, yeah, it rarely seems sustainable, let alone profitable. The efforts are so often ephemeral at best - except for maybe where they're self-funded labors of love by folks who pay their bills by other means. 

I've [felt like it's 2004 again](https://www.anildash.com/2024/10/15/its-2004-again/) in some corners of the web. But, [the bots are watching us dance](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2024/03/11/dance-for-the-bots/index.html) and getting all the funding instead. That [feels kinda like 2000 - 2002 again](https://skooloflife.medium.com/99-of-ai-startups-will-be-dead-by-2026-heres-why-bfc974edd968) and I'm not yet sure who'll end up being pets.com. I don't expect it all to evaporate, but it's going to be churn city until a new generative loop is formed. Feels like Glitch is a casualty of that, maybe?
