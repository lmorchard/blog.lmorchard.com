- Hello world!
- Why is [a celebrity podcast starting a mobile phone provider](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/smartless-mobile-jason-bateman-will-arnett-mobile-business-1236261243/)?
- Finally watching [Front 242's final live show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=vbwSXVRwKUo) and... dang.
- Blogging has slowed here, but I'm hoping to pick it back up.
	- It was probably a shiny-new-toy phase for the first few weeks.
	- But also, I just changed projects at work and got suddenly a lot busier. So, my time for idle rumination has vanished for now.
	- I did post [a relatively big thing on AI coding](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/06/07/semi-automatic-coding/) last weekend, so that's pretty good though?
- My brain suddenly demands I play [Terraria](https://www.terraria.org/).
	- This happens every few years. And when it does, I get a sudden hyperfocus rabbit hole thing that lasts a week or so and evaporates abruptly.
	- I've only ever made it past the first few bosses in the game despite playing it since release back in 2011. ðŸ’€
	- I think that's my general M.O. with games: I get to a point where I'm like "ooh novelty" and then "ah, okay, I get how it goes from here" and wander off.
	- I very rarely want grinding or more of the same thing, once I see the pattern. Until, I guess, the anti-novelty wears off and it feels novel again? (Thus the repeat visits to Terraria)
	- Sometimes I'm really jealous of folks who can just lock into a Special Interest like Terraria and just milk endless reliable dopamine from the thing.
	- Meanwhile I'm like BORED NOW and have to go hunting again.

Most of my work has happened in [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/) and [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) over recent weeks. I can picture a future where I'm essentially an LLM managerâ€”keeping code-generation plates spinning and nudging toddling bots away from falling into ditches.

Some folks claim they play games while the agent codes, but I'm actively reviewing as it writes. Turns out watching a bot write code for you takes surprising mental effort. ðŸ˜…

As I get deeper into this, I'm still processing the skeptical pushback. I know I'm drawn to novelty and clever tricks, so I'm trying to temper my enthusiasm and engage seriously with contrary opinions.

Some people haven't had success with these tools, but "you're holding it wrong" is a bad response that doesn't address the real objections. I'm having concrete wins personally, but figuring out the precise how and why feels elusiveâ€”too many variables and RNG elements to be properly scientific about it.

My main stake in AI coding is that it's what I'm paid to do right now in this industry. I am also rather fascinated with the stuff. Not exactly an unbiased position, but at least I'm not trying to sell anything other than my time & labor.

I've seen arguments that this could all be Stockholm syndrome and [excuse-making for the machine](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html). Others warn that I [shouldn't trust my own judgment on AI](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2025/trusting-your-own-judgement-on-ai/) because I'm essentially self-dosing with cognitohazards.

The more antagonistic responses make me sympathize with the guy who says [his AI skeptic friends are all nuts](https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/)â€”which feels like tit-for-tat, since accusations of mental instability seem to flow both ways.

Honestly, I can also relate to just [being done thinking about the whole thing for now](https://blog.glyph.im/2025/06/i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now.html). But, personally, I don't think I can afford to do that.
