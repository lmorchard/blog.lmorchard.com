- Hello world!
- Why is [a celebrity podcast starting a mobile phone provider](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/smartless-mobile-jason-bateman-will-arnett-mobile-business-1236261243/)?
- Finally watching [Front 242's final live show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=vbwSXVRwKUo) and... dang.
- Blogging has slowed here, but I'm hoping to pick it back up.
	- It was probably a shiny-new-toy phase for the first few weeks.
	- But also, I just changed projects at work and got suddenly a lot busier. So, my time for idle rumination has vanished for now.
	- I did post [a relatively big thing on AI coding](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/06/07/semi-automatic-coding/) last weekend, so that's pretty good though?
- A lot of what I'm doing at work right now is living in Windsurf and Claude Code. 
	- I've read folks saying they're playing games while the LLM codes, but I'm actively reviewing as it writes. Surprisingly a lot of mental effort, watching a bot write code for me. ðŸ˜…
	- I can imagine a future where I'm an LLM manager, endlessly keeping a fleet of code-generation plates spinning and nudging toddling bots away from falling into ditches.
- And, as I'm getting further enmeshed in the AI coding vortex, I'm still processing all the skeptical responses.
	- Honestly, I know I'm susceptible to novelty and neat tricks, so I'm trying to moderate my enthusiasm and stay engaged with contrary opinions.
	- I know some folks have not had great success with these tools, and it's frustrating to be told you're not holding them right. I also know that's not the entirety of the objections.
	- I'm personally having concrete successes with them and am trying to work out exactly how & why beyond hand-wavy vibes. These things are just rife with dependent variables and random number generators, so it's hard to be scientific.
	- I don't have anything to sell, except maybe my time & labor. So, my only real skin in the AI coding game is that that's what they're paying me for right now. Which I guess is not an unbiased position?
	- I've seen the case made that it could kind of just be Stockholm syndrome and [excuse-making for the machine](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html).
	- I've also read that I [shouldn't trust my own judgement on AI](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2025/trusting-your-own-judgement-on-ai/) because I'm essentially self-dosing with cognitohazards.
	- Some of the skeptical-to-antagonistic responses make me sympathize with this guy who says [my AI skeptic friends are all nuts](https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/) - which I guess is tit-for-tat in a way, because the assertions of mental instability seem to go both ways.
	- I can also sympathize with just [being done thinking about the whole thing for now](https://blog.glyph.im/2025/06/i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now.html).
- My brain suddenly demands I play [Terraria](https://www.terraria.org/).
	- This happens every few years. And when it does, I get a sudden hyperfocus rabbit hole thing that lasts a week or so and evaporates abruptly.
	- I've only ever made it past the first few bosses in the game despite playing it since release back in 2011. ðŸ’€
	- I think that's my general M.O. with games: I get to a point where I'm like "ooh novelty" and then "ah, okay, I get how it goes from here" and wander off.
	- I very rarely want grinding or more of the same thing, once I see the pattern. Until, I guess, the anti-novelty wears off and it feels novel again? (Thus the repeat visits to Terraria)
	- Sometimes I'm really jealous of folks who can just lock into a Special Interest like Terraria and just milk endless reliable dopamine from the thing.
	- Meanwhile I'm like BORED NOW and have to go hunting again.
