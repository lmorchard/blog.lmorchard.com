- Hello world!
- So, belatedly, I just checked out the iOS feature that lets you set a time limit for using an app.
	- I've been doing a lot of fugue-scrollingâ€”it's like doom-scrolling but not necessarily depressing, except that I come out the other side of it feeling like I've lost time to an alien abduction.
	- I gave myself a 15 minute limit on TikTok.
	- I ran through it *immediately* while making breakfast. ðŸ˜³
	- Like, I enjoyed what I saw. It was better than just dissociating into a thousand-yard stare at the state of the world. 
	- But, I've also got stuff to get on with and do.
