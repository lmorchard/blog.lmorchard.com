- Hello world!
- A thing I have realized: filling all the vents of my Crocs with #3dprinting nonsense makes them a bit too warm to wear. ðŸ¥µ
- I don't often get feedback & comments via the Disqus comments widget I've embedded at the end of every post. That could be because a) folks aren't reading my blog or b) Disqus is too annoying to use these days. Probably both. I can work on the former by posting better stuff more often and sharing it around. As for the latter, I dunno. I don't want to open a spam honeypot, but I think I need to offer some simpler way to at least give a lil thumbs up as a response.
- I'm tempted to hook this stuff up to accounts on the Fediverse and Bluesky, try to get feedback from those channels. That could be worth hacking on for a bit.
- Just like my RSS feeds, though, I don't want to generate churn on those networks as I iterate on posts over the course of a day. I'm still thinking through how to balance editing flexibility with publishing stable things when word goes out to the world.
- Maybe these miscellanea posts get a 24-hour delay, because they're where I expect to futz around the most throughout a day. If you happen to read them, you're an early alpha reader I guess. Other posts that bud off from this daily scratchpad will likely be stable enough to send out immediately. 
- I guess that means I need to implement a defer-until feature in my Easy-Blog Oven ðŸ¤”
