- Hello world!
- I'm probably going to keep #metablogging here for awhile, as I work out the kinks with the revised system. I do have other projects & pursuits that I want to start rambling about here. Also kind of hoping that having an easy channel for show & tell will encourage me a bit to actually spend time on them and document a bit.
- This [Carousel + Lightbox + Glow demo on CodePen](https://codepen.io/tofjadesign/pen/LEExbqr) is too fancy for my blog, but it's really nifty. Maybe I need to just code my own up from scratch and I'm overthinking this lightGallery thing?
- "[Molly White argues](https://flipboard.video/w/p7cECAUgThGrfQo9Cqvb8r) itâ€™s time to reclaim the web: move your work to spaces you control, support open tools, and help build a web that serves people, not profit." She's been banging this drum for a long while, and she's right.
- Considering integrating responses from Bluesky and Mastodon here and posting entries from here to there. Those aren't exactly space I control, but they're relatively open tools, and I can archive things here. Also, I think it'd be meeting folks more where they are. 
- I thought maybe requiring a Bluesky or Mastodon account to respond here would be a pain in the butt. But, I gave my Disqus widget a fresh try over the weekend and it's not exactly pleasant these days. I guess I can see why a lot of blogs just punt and link out to Hacker News threads for their comments - but I am not at all a fan of the orange site, myself.
- I post the occasional toot [on Mastodon](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard) and I post links to my half-baked [Pebbling Club profile](https://pebbl.ing/u/lmorchard?). Tempted to do the [PESOS](https://indieweb.org/PESOS) thing and copy those into daily entries over here.
