- Hello world!
- I'm probably going to keep #metablogging here for awhile, as I work out the kinks with the revised system. I do have other projects & pursuits that I want to start rambling about here. Also kind of hoping that having an easy channel for show & tell will encourage me a bit to actually spend time on them and document a bit.
- This [Carousel + Lightbox + Glow demo on CodePen](https://codepen.io/tofjadesign/pen/LEExbqr) is too fancy for my blog, but it's really nifty. Maybe I need to just code my own up from scratch and I'm overthinking this lightGallery thing?
