Because I've found them handy in creative exercises before, I polished up [a quick MCP server that provides access to Oblique Strategies cards](https://github.com/lmorchard/oblique-strategies-mcp). 

I combined this with a [Tarot MCP server](https://git.moraxcheng.me/Morax/tarot-mcp#readme) - because I've *also* found Tarot interesting in creative writing before. This led to some weird cross-contaminations in a conversation with Claude Desktop where it .

It was kinda neat to watch Claude hit the MCP servers and then mash things together.

Can you draw an Oblique Strategy and see if it relates to any Tarot card in particular?

> **"Retrace your steps"**
> 
> This strategy is about going backward, reviewing what you've already done, and perhaps finding something you missed. Let me search for tarot cards that resonate with themes of looking back, reviewing the past, or revisiting earlier stages.Interesting! While the Six of Cups has the nostalgia element, I think the **Eight of Cups (Reversed)** might be the perfect match for "Retrace your steps."Actually, I realize the **Six of Cups** is the better match for "Retrace your steps"!
> 
> Here's the beautiful connection:
> 
> - **Returning to the past** - The Six of Cups is literally about revisiting childhood, memories, and earlier times - exactly what retracing your steps means
> - **Finding what you left behind** - The card often represents rediscovering simple joys or connections you'd forgotten about
> - **Innocent perspective** - When you retrace your steps, you often see things with fresh eyes, like the childlike wonder in the Six of Cups
> - **Gifts from the past** - The children exchanging flower-filled cups represent finding treasures in what you've already experienced
> 
> The oblique strategy "Retrace your steps" isn't just about going backward - it's about revisiting your path with new understanding. The Six of Cups embodies this perfectly: it's not regression but rather a conscious return to earlier ground to recover something valuable you might have overlooked.
> 
> When stuck creatively, both the strategy and the card suggest the answer might not be ahead but behind you. Perhaps there's an earlier version, a discarded idea, or a simpler approach you passed by too quickly. The Six of Cups reminds us that sometimes the most profound insights come from returning to what we thought we'd outgrown, finding it transformed by our journey.

> **Seven of Cups** - a card of many possibilities and illusions! Now let me search for oblique strategies that might resonate with its themes of choice, fantasy, and multiple options.Perfect! The **Seven of Cups** connects beautifully with **"What is the reality of the situation?"**
> 
> Here's the resonance:
> 
> - **Illusion vs. Reality** - The Seven of Cups is THE card of being lost in fantasies and possibilities, while the oblique strategy cuts straight through asking for reality
> - **Too many choices** - The card shows seven different cups with various temptations (castle, jewels, dragon, etc.); the strategy demands you stop daydreaming and assess what's actually real
> - **Grounding the fantasy** - The figure in the Seven of Cups is literally standing before clouds of illusion; the strategy is the antidote, pulling you back to earth
> - **Decision paralysis** - When faced with seven magical cups, how do you choose? The strategy answers: first figure out what's real and what's fantasy
> 
> The Seven of Cups warns of getting lost in wishful thinking and overwhelming options. The oblique strategy "What is the reality of the situation?" is exactly the question you need to ask when this card appears. It's like a reality check for the dreamer - stop looking at all the shiny possibilities floating in the clouds and ask yourself: which of these cups actually contains something real? What's genuinely available versus what's just an attractive illusion?
> 
> Together, they form a perfect creative tension: the card represents the intoxicating realm of pure possibility, while the strategy is the sobering question that helps you navigate back to actionable reality.
