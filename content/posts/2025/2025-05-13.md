- Hello world!
- I'm in a weird place with this current AI wave in the tech industry.
	- The way LLMs have been trained is dubious at best in most cases.
	- The hype about their capabilities is often overinflated and hyperbolic.
	- And, of course, I'm feeling that my ongoing paycheck currently depends on my having deep literacy with these technologies while abiding all the unpleasantries.
	- Like, yeah yeah, Upton Sinclair, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”
	- But, I do understand it rather decently, distasteful parts and all - and my mortgage doesn't care whether I have qualms. And, really, there's no bottom to the qualms I might have about working in tech in general if I fully committed to looking down. So, what's one more ethical violation under capitalism?
	- None of that's a justification. It's entirely a compromised position with which I'm continually uncomfortable.
	- All that said, it's also hyperbolic to say LLMs are entirely useless.
	- If we lived in a proper society, we could train these models in full consent and with proper reciprocal remuneration to the folks whose intellectual produce was fed into the machines.
	- The closest we get is that access to the models can be rather cheap and often run on your own hardware. [Not quite Open Source, even if they have assumed the label "open source"](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/25/1090111/tech-industry-open-source-ai-definition-problem/) - but still rather tinkering friendly a lot of the time.
	- Once you do have access to LLMs, if you're careful and judicious and honest and savvy about it, they can
