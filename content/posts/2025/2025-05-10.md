- Hello world!
- Nice day in Portland! Took the car to get serviced, walked for a sammich at [Snappy's](https://www.makeitsnappys.com/), then walked over to [TOTL Games](https://totlgames.com/) to see what's what there. Bought myself an Xbox 360 HDD expansion. Someday, I'll get around to hacking that thing and loading it up with all the Rock Band ever.
- Time for a bike ride!
