- Hello world!
- Nice day in Portland! Took the car to get serviced, walked for a sammich at [Snappy's](https://www.makeitsnappys.com/), then walked over to [TOTL Games](https://totlgames.com/) to see what's what there. Bought myself an Xbox 360 HDD expansion. Someday, I'll get around to hacking that thing and loading it up with all the Rock Band ever.
- Time for a bike ride! I've got a 15 mile route in Portland that I take around [the Willamette River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willamette_River) just about any weekend when the weather's pleasant. Not all that long, but rather pleasant, and gets me out of the house.
- I'm still playing with #meshtastic a little, but I think the two devices I have are really only receiving and not managing to transmit to anyone. At least, no one's ever really responded to any of my "ping" messages. Not sure whether I want to go further down the rabbit hole and buy any more robust antennas and the associated paraphernalia that goes along with.
- Responsive CSS is hard, letâ€™s go shopping.

[Snappy's](https://www.makeitsnappys.com/) was playing [The Fifth Element](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116/) when I went there for lunch today. I wonder if I can get image uploads to work? Actually, probably not: I think I need to write the code to copy the images to the site build ðŸ¤”

(...time passes...)

And, [I think I managed to do it](https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/commit/0712506fa593928d8ae4a9b05871aa13b132d37f)? Added code to copy over attachments from Obsidian. Had to rework the URLs for display in post lists, too. And it looks like I fixed my image gallery component by not lazy-loading the images. Not entirely happy with that outcome, so I may bang on it some more. But it seems to be working better now overall.

But, the nice thing is that I can easily add images as attachments to a file in Obsidian. That makes it a comfy user interface for me - even from my phone - and the site generator takes care of the rest!

Next part might be to apply a little image optimization along with the copying, since these images are straight from my phone and probably too huge?
