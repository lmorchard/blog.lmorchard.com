- Hello world!
- Spent the weekend doing [inadvisable things](https://switch.hacks.guide/) with my Nintendo Switch to back up all my downloaded games and game saves.
	- I think this risks getting the console banned from Nintendo's online services? But, the gist I've gotten from Reddit and suchlike is that they seem to reserve that hammer for folks who actually pirate, hack, and cheat in multiplayer games.
	- Me, I just want to dump stuff to my NAS for later restoration if Something Bad happens. I did this with my 3DS, back when the eShop was on its way out, and I've since been able to wipe and restore all my games on there
