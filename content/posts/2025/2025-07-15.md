- Hello world!
- [I printed an Owlcat](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/07/15/owlcat/), but I wanted to try the photo gallery in a different post.
- A "nice" side effect of running up against the token limit in Claude Code is that it's often a good time to, like, take a break.
- Been playing Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom before bed. I'm really digging it, about 2 dungeons in.
	- It seems to use an advanced version of the game engine from the Link's Adventure remake, where everything looks like a tilt-shifted world of vinyl toys. 
	- And the thing is, I'm astonished Nintendo hasn't tried selling a full line of real blind-box vinyl toys of every critter and character in the games.
	- Like, they could just port the 3D models out of the game and send them straight to manufacturing and I'd buy a crate of them. 
	- (Hmm, I wonder if you can port the models out of the game and print them? 🤔)

I've been following this 3D artist for awhile who runs a Patreon called "[Happy Flexi Pets](https://www.patreon.com/happyflexipets)". Last night, she posted this [ludicrously adorable Owlcat](https://www.patreon.com/posts/new-design-75-134119470). So, I practically lunged to download the models, get them sliced up, and started the printer running overnight.

The result was pretty great. Look at those beans! 🐾 Sometimes, I love living in the future.
