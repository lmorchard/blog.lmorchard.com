- Hello world!

I've been following this 3D artist for awhile who runs a Patreon called "[Happy Flexi Pets](https://www.patreon.com/happyflexipets)". Last night, she posted this [ludicrously adorable Owlcat](https://www.patreon.com/posts/new-design-75-134119470). So, I practically lunged to download the models, get them sliced up, and started the printer running over night.

The result was pretty great. Look at those beans! 🐾 Sometimes, I love living in the future.
