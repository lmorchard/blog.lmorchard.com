- Hello world!
- I do feel like I've been kind of absorbed into an AI machine, over the past few weeks.
- Still trying to find a good balance while spinning plates across multiple projects. But, I've gotten a lot done:
	- Vibe coded a demo of a browser-based outliner with a few LLM-powered tools to cluster items and extract items from web pages.
	- Got a Django web app deploying to fly.io. Got frustrated with that. Had Claude Code compose a GitHub Actions + Terraform setup to instead deploy that web app to Google Cloud.
