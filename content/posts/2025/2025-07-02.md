- Hello world!
- I do feel like I've been kind of absorbed into an AI machine, over the past few weeks.
- Still trying to find a good balance while spinning plates across multiple projects. But, I've gotten a lot done.
- For work project 1:
	- Vibe coded a demo of a browser-based outliner with a few LLM-powered tools to cluster items and extract items from web pages.
	- Reworked the outliner into a tool backed by a Django web app.
	- Added some more LLM powered tools to the Django web app.
	- Got a Django web app deploying to fly.io. 
	- Got frustrated with fly.io. Had Claude Code compose a GitHub Actions + Terraform setup to instead deploy to Google Cloud.
- For work project 2:
	- 
- Started hacking in earnest on my Pebbling Club side project again:
	- Switched it over from using SQLite to Postgres.
	- Switched from pip to uv for dependency management.
	- Moved deployment from fly.io to my own machine in the basement using Docker Compose. 
	- Cobbled together my own git-push-based deployment hook for the basement machine.
	- Built up a hybrid dev environment with Docker Compose for the bits I'm not developing and Honcho + Procfile for the bits I am.
	- Added Flower to monitor Celery work queues.
	- Played around with adding metrics for Prometheus and Grafana.
	- Got RSS feed fetching and viewing working, so I can use this as my feed reader again.
	- Installed Django Debug Toolbar.
