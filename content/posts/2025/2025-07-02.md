- Hello world!
- I do feel like I've been kind of absorbed into an AI machine, over the past few weeks.
- Still trying to find a good balance while spinning plates across multiple projects. But, I've gotten a lot done:
	- Vibe coded a demo of a browser-based outliner with a few LLM-powered tools to cluster items and extract items from web pages.
	- Reworked the outliner into a tool backed by a Django web app.
	- Added some more LLM powered tools to the Django web app.
	- Got a Django web app deploying to fly.io. 
	- Got frustrated with fly.io. Had Claude Code compose a GitHub Actions + Terraform setup to instead deploy to Google Cloud.
	- Started hacking on Pebbling Club again. Switched it over from using SQLite to Postgres. Moved deployment from fly.io to my own machine in the basement. Cobble
