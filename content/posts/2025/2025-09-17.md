- Hello world!
- I set up this lovely rapid-fire blogging machine, then I got really busy and stopped rapid-fire blogging (ugh!)
	- Maybe I should take another swing at [weeknotes](https://blog.lmorchard.com/tag/weeknotes/)?
	- If every day is a loosey-goosey opportunity to blog, then no day is a particular day to blog.
	- I lose touch with folks in the world when I get busy and go heads down for long periods. I'd still like to have *some* channel of communication open.
	- I still think that "[A blog post is a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query)" and I keep wanting to revive the habit.
- I've done a few interesting things lately:
	- Mostly shelved my work on [Pebbling Club](https://github.com/lmorchard/pebbling-club), since I realized I'm kind of reinventing a lot of wheels better made by others.
	- I [switched over](https://links.lmorchard.com/bookmarks/shared) to using [Linkding](https://linkding.link/) as a web link collectorâ€”this is one of those aforementioned pre-invented wheels.
	- Built & released [feedspool-go](https://github.com/lmorchard/feedspool-go), which takes OPML lists and produces a static site of RSS items. This has become my new feed reader.
	- Built & released [linkding-to-opml](https://github.com/lmorchard/linkding-to-opml), which allows me to use Linkding bookmarks as my OPML list of feed subscriptions for feedspool.
- I did a lot of the above via throwing specifications at Claude and refining them into code and GitHub Actions workflows.
	- Really quite productive for side-projects.
	- And work projects, too, but those aren't as open-to-the-public these days.
- Next, I'm thinking about what further small composable glue tools I can gin up to essentially build what I wanted with Pebbling Club.
	- Maybe something to turn a day or week of Linkding bookmarks into markdown as the starting point for a blog post?
	- Maybe something to turn a day or week of Mastodon toots into markdown, also as the starting point for a blog post?
	- Also eyeing up all the notes and highlights I accumulate from my Kindle - those could make a good blog post too, since I've been ripping through books as I pedal away on the exercise bike every morning.
- Way in the back of my mind, I still have an impulse to see if I can stitch all the above together into some kind of "[pebbling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebbling)" (i.e. collecting and sharing) club for folks.
	- But, I want to get it all to work happily for myself, first.
	- Maybe there's no particular demand for this thing?
	- I have a vague notion that there is a space for something that helps folks authentically stitch together a human-scale small web?
	- I have scarce energy and motivation for building this, though.
