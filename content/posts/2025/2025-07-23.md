- Hello world!
- I've been trying (and often failing) to be careful about my language around the current wave of LLM-powered tech that folks are calling "AI"
	- Like, the following things can all conceivably be called "snack chips":
		- Potato chips
		- Corn tortilla chips
		- Cheez-It® Original Snack Crackers
		- CHEETOS® Crunchy Cheese Flavored Snacks
		- [Banana chips](https://thehappierhomemaker.com/homemade-banana-chips/)
		- [Baked kale chips](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/176957/baked-kale-chips/)
	- But, I'm sure most would agree that each of these things have significant differences between each other.
	- Just like a bunch of these things could be called "AI":
		- Video game NPC behavior
		- AlphaGo
		- Large language models
		- Movie & music recommendations
		- Self-driving cars
		- Weather forecasts
	- But, we should be able to agree that each of these things have significant differences. They also have significantly different means of production, appropriate applications, and defining characteristics that builders and operators need to know inside & out.
	- I feel like there's a longer blog post here, but I don't have the rest of it right this moment.
