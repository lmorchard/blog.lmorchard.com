Dusty Phillips, [My AI-Driven Identity Crisis](https://dusty.phillips.codes/2025/06/08/my-ai-driven-identity-crisis/):

> So what am I good for anymore? Writing code? Vibe coding hasnâ€™t successfully commodified software development, yet, but there is a reasonable chance it will. Writing fiction? Also not clear whether AI will take that over. Give up and focus on woodworking? Not gonna pay the bills Iâ€™ve accrued over decades of cushy software engineering salaries.
> ...
> So I can still write for fun, even if we end up in a world where AI is definitively better at it than I am. I have no idea if I actually would. I donâ€™t know exactly what my motivation would look like in that world.
>
> I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m going to write this next book.

[I wrote and contributed to a few tech books](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Leslie-M.-Orchard/author/B001JS692K), back around 2004 to 2009. I haven't managed to write any more, and I think about why every now and then.

Working on those books was a dream come true: I love writing and of course I love tech. And, over the early years of my career, I'd gotten a huge amount of value out of my growing library of tech booksâ€”so it felt like a super gratifying opportunity to be a part of that for other folks.

At this point, having gotten a few books out feels like a pretty solid check mark on the bucket list. The books sold okay, but I didn't get rich. Turns out publishing companies are pretty good at calculating advances for anticipated just-okay sales. ðŸ˜… But, that's okay, I didn't expect to buy a private island or anything.

But, putting aside the sales or whether the books were actually any good, I think I started working on tech books at a stage of the web where books weren't quite the right medium anymore. At least, not for things moving as fast as frontend web frameworks or Web 2.0 social media services.

One of the most disappointing things for me back then was finding that nearly all my books were obsolete before hitting the shelves. In one case, I later ended up personally outmoding whole chapters when I joined the company I'd written about and started hacking on the product itself. Not bad for my career, but terrible for book sales!

A few years later, I worked on the Mozilla Developer Network project. There, I didn't really do much writing either. But, I helped overhaul the content management tools to support the technical writers who kept the site growing and fresh. That felt a lot more like the future than trying to get stale paper onto a shelf. It seemed to me like blogs, wikis, online docs and things like Stack Overflow mostly ate the space for the kind of tech books I expected to write.

About 20 years later, it's absolutely obvious in hindsight. But, it's worth noting that a good number of tech books back in the 2000s still came with CD-ROMs slotted into the back cover! There was even a brief discussion of whether my RSS & Atom book rated that treatment, before we decided that a ZIP file of example code at a publisher URL would be good enough.

Obviously, tech books are still written and sold, though. Some of them are even in the same niches as I'd worked in briefly. I don't know how the advances or sales look for those markets these daysâ€”but I don't often buy those books myself anymore and wouldn't feel the same gratification working on them. The tech-flavored books I do tend to buy these days tend toward higher-concept topics & advice and I don't think I have the insight or energy to crank one of those out.

So, maybe that was just my own tech writer identity . But I do think it's ironic that Dusty notes "Stack Overflow usage is in absolute free-fall"â€”
