- Hello world!
- I made lentil stew and roasted coffee. 
- Also cooked some dried pinto beans in the Instant Pot for dinners this week.
- Played a little Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and DOOM: The Dark Ages.
	- The Lampmaster is a jerk
	- Beating a boss demon at tennis is fun
- Wanted to work on some tinkering projects but couldn’t quite find the motivation. 🤷‍♂️
