This all strikes a definite chord with me right now. It's part of what's making me overall sad, lately. Especially when it comes to prospects for what work I might get paid to do to feed my mortgage. Dan write "disheartening" and I'm right there.

He also writes, "It's easy to blame this all on AI, but it's not just that." And that's the thing: a lot of this was in progress before the

> For high-end channels that put out weekly videos, they often have a team of 4-5 people behind the scenes, shooting video and editing it all and getting everyone paid but it doesn't make sense based solely on YouTube/Google's ad income. Instead, they take a break into the middle of their video to talk about SquareSpace or BetterHealth, and the creators I follow admit they get $5k-$30k for those ads, while the same video might only make a few hundred bucks from YouTube. When I hear this, I'm both shocked at how high the ad rates are for an embedded ad read but also how little YouTube/Google pays their creators.

I was [just wondering the other day](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/16/ads-ruining-youtube/) whether YouTube has optimized its ads to make folks think favorably of the advertiser or annoy users into ponying up for a Premium subscription? Really seems like the latter annoyance way more than the former.

Sounds like the cruddy ad interjections don't even make much money for the folks who make the videos that get interrupted—and I've heard from several of those folks that they make more money from Premium viewers anyway.

> Here is a modern version of the tale. Some tech execs came to the village of computer users and said, “We have a magic algorithm that will make artificial general intelligence from just gradient descent, next-token prediction, and transformers.” “Really,” said the users, “that does sound magical.” “Of course, it will be even better and more intelligent if we add more data — especially text and images,” said the execs. “That sounds good,” said the users. “We have some extra texts and images we created stashed away on the internet — we could put those in.”

I kind of like this reframing of the story, except... While the three hungry travelers did provide the cauldron and the stones and the firewood—they just went ahead and helped themselves to the onions and carrots and chickens from the villagers' stores.

Then they sell the soup to the villagers and [cry that there'd be no soup to sell if they weren't allowed](https://www.theverge.com/news/674366/nick-clegg-uk-ai-artists-policy-letter) to dig around in folks' pantries without asking.
