- Hello world!
- Boy, [Sam & Jony really like to talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W09bIpc_3ms). What was that all about?
- After making the tweaks to this blog to make it easier to post and publish more frequently, I discovered that I'd doubled my AWS S3 bill! ðŸ˜…
	- Turns out that the process I set up over 7 years ago just re-uploads the entire site, every time I push a change. That wasn't a noticeable problem until I started pushing multiple times per day.
	- So, I'm looking into a new workflow based on rclone that should be able to do more differential uploads based on changes.
	- The first version of that workflow deleted the contents of my blog. (Oops.) The second version re-uploaded everything in about 6 minutes.
	- One more thing I should write about if I get around to an entry describing the current state of this contraption.
- Juggling a couple AI related ideas in my head that might turn into a longer post:
	- Seems to me like most AI-assisted tools these days are single-player and it's really hard to pass the baton of a project underway to someone else.
	- Seems to me like many folks using AI-assisted tools think they're the only Chosen One in the world with access to those tools and everyone else around is an agency-free NPC
