- Hello world!

[TDD, AI agents and coding with Kent Beck - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSXaxOdVtAQ&t=3713s)
> Now, with over five decades of programming experience, Kent is still pushing boundariesâ€”this time with AI coding tools. In this episode of Pragmatic Engineer, I sit down with him to talk about whatâ€™s changed, what hasnâ€™t, and why heâ€™s more excited than ever to code.

This was a really neat interview. I'm a bit behind Kent Beck in years and industry contributions. But, it's cool to hear how someone with his experience is dealing with the AI era. 

[Taste Is the New Intelligence - by stepfanie tyler](https://wildbarestepf.substack.com/p/taste-is-the-new-intelligence?ref=DenseDiscovery-345)
> We used to associate intelligence with accumulation. The smartest people were the ones who knew the most. But that model doesnâ€™t hold anymore. AI knows more than anyone. Wikipedia is free. The internet has flattened information access so thoroughly that hoarding knowledge is no longer impressive. What matters now is what you do with it. How you filter it. How you recognize signal in the noise.

If I can keep myself motivated to make progress on [Pebbling Club](https://github.com/lmorchard/pebbling-club), I kinda want to build something that's basically a web curation platform with the ability to share your taste with others.

> Ever wanted to check on your AI agents while you're away? Need to monitor that long-running build from your phone? Want to share a terminal session with a colleague without complex SSH setups? VibeTunnel makes it happen with zero friction.

This reminds me of when I once in college when I managed to telnet from a computer lab back into my Commodore Amiga 1200 dialed into a SLIP internet connection. No firewalls. It would have really sucked if someone else had known my IP address at the time. ðŸ˜…

> I've spent a lot of hours this week on this project instead of the usual lucky dip. Here's what I've done so far using my AY tracker terminal-based software

I built an [RC2014 kit computer](https://rc2014.co.uk/), last year. I also built a [Why Em-Ulator Sound Module](https://rc2014.co.uk/modules/why-em-ulator-sound-module/) for it and managed to get it playing some neato tunes. I should check out this tracker and see if I can *make* some neato tunes.
