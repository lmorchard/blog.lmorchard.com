**TL;DR**: Wrestled with my Synology NAS trying to get it to do more than just serve files (finally got a Debian VM running by randomly changing video card settings), populated my BBS with text files from textfiles.com, attended the #nokings festival in Portland but couldn't handle crowds for long, started learning Kubernetes and Argo Workflows, and watched Catsby and Miss Biscuits become friends. Also: no, I don't need to build a BBS Door that controls Home Assistant lights. (But maybe I do?)

## Synology NAS Adventures

I've got a Synology DS723+ NAS. It's been [okay as a file server](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115385530642316129), but part of why I got it was because it claims to support Docker and running VMs.

Well, it does run Docker. But it runs Docker Engine v24 wrapped up in their own proprietary management package. Upstream is at v27 and I can't upgrade it. Also their management package locks up in weird ways and has been unreliable.

It does run VMs. But every time I try to install a simple Debian 13 VM, it ends up freezing on boot. No idea why.

So I dunno, [maybe I expected too much](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115385535225418506) from the thing. This is my 3rd Synology NAS, the previous two have only served as network file servers and done fine at that. This is the first one I thought might do a lil more. I think the next replacement for this thing will just be a plain old Linux server on a surplus PC.

I think these Synology devices are ["apple-like"](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115385556194581318) insofar as they should "just work" but otherwise they're a nightmare to get anything not-Synology running on them as an OS. Ironically, I started getting Synology NASes years ago because I was tired of running my own Linux machines at home. Now the turntables have turned, I guess.

**Update:** Oh hey! I [got a Debian 13 VM running](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115387852121623925) on my Synology NAS. It only took the extremely intuitive step of changing the video card setting from "vmvga" to "vga", which I didn't at all try at random.

## BBS Text File Hoard

While [waiting for tests to run](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115391815918349408), I, an enormous old dork, have figured out how to leech text files from @textfiles and shove them into the text files section on my BBS.

![Screenshot of BBS file section showing textfiles.com archives](https://cdn.masto.host/mastohackerstown/media_attachments/files/115/391/788/382/226/951/original/44c648e60959260a.png)

Don't tell him but I think some dude named Sketch the Cow uploaded his whole site to this hot new Torrent tracker called [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/textfiles-dot-com-2011).

Only got a [couple directories unpacked](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115391837360404256), but I think I might noodle around with dumping in a bunch of the rest just to have them around.

## Learning Kubernetes

Because I want to [make a bunch of computers](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115392122917690377) do a bunch of things, I'm learning me a Kubernetes and an Argo Workflows. I think I might be on the right track.

I think my near-future path is [getting a better old PC](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115386524093278575) to run Proxmox on. I have it on an old underpowered PC just to play with it, but I need to upgrade.

## #nokings Festival

Attended the [#nokings festival](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115397236423108695) in Portland but couldn't hang that long. I just don't do well at all with crowds. But the girl and I did leave the house for a few hours at least and showed our faces, so that's something.

[Sometimes I do wonder](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115397240913641763) what it would be like to be somebody who can tolerate crowds or even gets energized by them. But that ain't me. Not even if I like people in the crowd. Crowd just means trouble to me.

Did a [little Saturday craft project](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115396429064053123) before heading out.

## Cat Updates

I think [Catsby and Miss Biscuits](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115390903621986311) are getting along:

Our cats [just love a thing-on-a-thing](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115386573977854708). Blanket on a blanket? Sold. Envelope that fell off a desk to land on a rug? Occupied. TV remote on a pillow? Incubated.

## Megabonk and Other Diversions

Oh no: I have [installed Megabonk](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115393847159542230).

I took a nap and [dreamed there was](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115381582995478461) a Buckaroo Banzai convention.

## Miscellanea

<div class="weeknote-miscellanea">

- No, Les, you [don't need to build](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115381327181880766) a Door application for your BBS that lets you turn lights on and off in Home Assistant. (But... maybe?)
- Peacocks are [LOUDER than you expect](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115384934890120358). A professor kept one in a courtyard of the building where I had computer science classes in college for awhile and you really knew there was a peacock there.
- IMO, if you can swing an ultrawide, [I think it's worth it](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115390527733542234). I have a Dell U3423WE 34" ultrawide and it's just so nice. I will personally not be [satisfied until I have](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115390583977282061) at least 180 degree coverage of screens in my field of vision.
- [Now if you'll excuse me](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115397253741355392), I'm off to murder some Tree of Heaven in my yard. #pdx #pnw
- I've been buying Sonoff S31 smart plugs because they're [relatively easy to reflash](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115407551073647611) with ESPHome. But if for a buck or two more I can get a Kauf plug that's already had that done, I'll be a happier camper.
- I feel like the irony of these American brands having been sold off to be juiced to death means that any random thing [straight from the Chinese factory](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115386356767023830) that manufactures for them is just as likely to be reliable and probably cheaper.
- I miss [Chicken Shack broasted potatoes](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115392115270087115) (because we used to live in Michigan, but we don't anymore).
- Ross Wintle: [Software can be finished](https://rosswintle.uk/2025/10/software-can-be-finished/?ref=sidebar).

"Every designer now faces a choice... recognize that the paradigm has already shifted. That the work determining design's future is happening now, in rooms where most designers are not present."
- [How I Reversed Amazon's Kindle Web Obfuscation](https://blog.pixelmelt.dev/kindle-web-drm/) Because Their App Sucked. "Decided to reverse engineer their obfuscation system out of spite.

- [pointerpointer.com's use of voronoi, canvas, and javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2ZXW2HBLPM). Can't believe I'd never seen [Pointer Pointer](https://pointerpointer.com/) before, back in the day!
- Suff Syed again: [Designers Have to Move from the Surface to the Substrate](https://www.suffsyed.com/futurememo/designers-have-to-move-from-the-surface-to-the-substrate). "We're still arguing about 'does Figma Make augment creativity' while the actual decisions... are being made in rooms we're not invited to."

A week of technical tinkering and crowd avoidance. The Synology saga continues to be a reminder that sometimes "just works" devices work great until you want them to do something slightly different from their intended purpose. Then it's random video card settings and hoping for the best.

The BBS text file hoard is deeply satisfying in that way that only filling a virtual space with decades-old ASCII art and manifestos can be. There's something beautiful about preserving that era of the internet, even if it's just on a hobby BBS that maybe a dozen people will ever dial into.

The #nokings festival was a reminder that I'm just not built for crowds, but at least we showed up. Sometimes that's enough.

Next week: probably more Kubernetes learning, definitely more cats cuddling, possibly a BBS Door for Home Assistant (no, really, I shouldn't).
