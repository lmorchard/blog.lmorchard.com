**TL;DR**: It was my birthday this week, which my BBS remembered! Celebrated by dialing into BBSes from an actual Amiga 1200 and C64 (over WiFi, not tying up the phone line). Also: wrote a blog post about bring-your-own-data for web apps, evangelized Bazzite Linux for gaming, fell down a Roguelike Celebration rabbit hole of procedural generation and non-euclidean games, shipped a new release of my feed-to-mastodon tool, and bookmarked way too many things about AI hype and data centers using jet engines for power.

## Birthday BBS Adventures

[Today is the day](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115430063851898952) when every internet forum I've ever encountered sends me a celebratory email:

![IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.](https://cdn.masto.host/mastohackerstown/media_attachments/files/115/429/942/278/565/927/original/f7b3fe8d72821eee.png)

Oh hey, [my BBS remembers](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115430894281339458) what day it is!

![Screenshot of 0xDECAFBAD BBS login displaying colorful Happy Birthday messages in rainbow text on a black terminal screen](https://cdn.masto.host/mastohackerstown/media_attachments/files/115/430/894/098/834/380/original/1ff4787aca740460.png)

Spent part of my birthday [tooting from my Amiga](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115431406565966228):

![Amiga 1200 beneath a CRT monitor displaying Synchronet BBS with colorful ASCII art](https://cdn.masto.host/mastohackerstown/media_attachments/files/115/431/406/410/936/672/original/304b812b1ac1f909.jpeg)

A funny thing that [just occurred to me](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115431488777804694): I'm dialing into BBSes over the internet, so I'm not tying up the phone line. Using a wifi232 to "dial" into my BBS via telnet from both the Amiga and an actual C64:

![Dual retro computing setup: Amiga 1200 on left showing ASCII skull, C64 on right displaying Particles! BBS with ANSI art, vintage hardware between them](https://cdn.masto.host/mastohackerstown/media_attachments/files/115/431/479/012/198/610/original/3f00aa4908287fe4.jpeg)

[Actually logged in](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115431621731344102) from a real C64!

I [used this A1200](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115432371386698821) longer into the late 90s than reasonable before I finally splurged on a PC.

Also: Got an email from my alma mater that was like ["happy birthday! hey, you got any money for us?"](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115430347668342213)

## Thinking Different About Data

Wrote a blog post this week after Dave Winer [wrote a thing](http://scripting.com/2025/10/23/133525.html#a133630) about bring-your-own data and compute to web apps:

[Think different about data](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/10/23/think-different-about-data/)

Dave's point: "This is the same problem web devs have, we have to become resellers for Amazon S3. Why can't Amazon, who already has an account for every freaking person in the world, let the user own their own data, which I believe they would reallllly like. I don't want access to it, I just want to make great tools for them to use."

That really resonated with me. The whole post explores how we could build web apps where users bring their own storage and the app is just interface and logic.

## Bazzite Evangelism

I feel like [I'm an evangelist](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115420756284912574) these days... I put a second hard drive in my gaming computer almost 20 months ago, installed Bazzite. It has been happy-making and basically demanded no sysadmin work beyond initial install.

It's run everything from Steam, Epic, and GOG that I've thrown at it—with the exception of stuff with anti-cheat. Also I have an AMD GPU, so mileage may vary. I am fixing to format the original drive with Windows.

I would say that a [second physical drive](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115420759316606587) is key to less-fuss dual booting these days, though. Never again will I try to juggle partitions around and all that noise.

## Roguelike Celebration Discoveries

Fell down a rabbit hole of [Roguelike Celebration](https://roguelike.club/) content this week and discovered some amazing things:

[bleeptrack](https://bleeptrack.de/about/) is a freelancing creative technologist who loves generative stuff of all sorts! Their talk on [From Code to Craft: Procedural Generation for the Physical World](http://roguelike.bleeptrack.de/) [is making me want](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115436402746669844) to get into pen plotters again.

[HyperRogue](https://zenorogue.itch.io/hyperrogue): A roguelike that takes place on the hyperbolic plane. "Witness a grid composed of hexagons and heptagons, straight lines which seem to be parallel, but then they diverge and never cross, triangles whose angles add up to less than 180 degrees." All this matters for the gameplay.

Also discovered [Ada Null](https://worldenddisk.com/), who tells stories of broken pasts, uncertain futures, and the ghosts who never left.

## Feed to Mastodon Shenanigans

Just [pushed a 0.0.2 release](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115436371308633944) to my feed-to-mastodon tool, which let me get @blog working to auto-post my blog entries to the fediverse.

It's a big fat hack! My blog entries are in markdown. They get rendered to HTML. The HTML gets extracted and escaped and shoved into RSS. The description from the RSS item gets converted back to markdown. The markdown gets posted to GoToSocial. GoToSocial renders the markdown as HTML.

I should really blog about this.

[Sometimes I like building](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115436374532120507) loosely-coupled Rube Goldberg machines with computers where every step along the way sort of makes sense, but then the whole thing looks stupid when you take a step back. Yet, at the same time, it still sort of makes sense overall.

## Miscellanea

<div class="weeknote-miscellanea">

- The mascot character for Mico, the new Microsoft Copilot assistant, [looks like a drop of pee](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115424853608009107)? ![Copilot Mico - an amber-colored cartoon smiley blob](https://cdn.masto.host/mastohackerstown/media_attachments/files/115/424/853/410/499/043/original/682ff037c26c933e.png)
- A lot of times, I [take a day of PTO](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115430122099039625) but still end up doing some work. So sometimes PTO just means it's a day wherein I feel less-than-troubled about entirely ignoring Slack and email.
- I see all the hoops folks jump through to [carve out something they can own](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115425098909553115) from the Bluesky machinery. And I'm just like... maybe set up a Mastodon instance? Maybe a GoToSocial instance? Even just federate them with a whitelist? It would be easier. Like, yeah yeah yeah, Mastodon and ActivityPub are [funky and obscure](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115425104181202335), but is it worse than what they're trying to do with ATProto?
- I [think I really like](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115426139352259741) The False Dawns: "Come monsoon season, expect a flood / So when you visit you'd do well to bring your ark / More street cred than your Subaru and much less grief to park" ([Our Tanks Your Lawn](https://thefalsedawns.bandcamp.com/album/our-tanks-your-lawn))
- [ERROR EXIST. PLEASE STAND BY.](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115426255010405635) ![TV test pattern with error message](https://cdn.masto.host/mastohackerstown/media_attachments/files/115/426/252/837/915/324/original/55d12c8d3ad16ec7.png)
- I [miss ye olde Electronic Arts](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115426314055031734) when they had "software artists"
- Reading Frankenstein [for spoopy month](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115431717835235733). It's weird [reading the original thing](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115432376069951530) after taking in years of stuff inspired by it!
- I [just keep thinking](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115435873493536821) - who's asking for this stuff? Some of this current era of gen AI is really very useful. But so much of it reads like "we bought all this peanut butter so everything is peanut butter flavored now" press releases aimed at investors, fully ignoring how many folks are allergic to peanuts. ([Only the metrics care](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/27/only-metrics-care/) gets more true over time.)
- Listening to My Brother, My Brother, and Me doing the Munch Squad - the podcast-within-a-podcast on brand eating and press releases from QSR companies. [Kinda wish someone](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115435899548145552) did that with press releases from AI companies.
- Pedantically: Zork and Infocom were [popular in particular](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115435981778471939) because they had a parser that upgraded from rigid "TAKE ROCK" to more natural things like "open mail box, take leaflet, then read it". But still, even Zork wasn't perfect. "Trying to guess what to type to make something happen is a terrible and exhausting user interface" - still a good point, IMO.
- Thought this lil book ["Of Monsters and Mainframes"](https://binderybooks.com/books/of-monsters-and-mainframes/) had a [neat riff on Frankenstein's monster](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115435997821080629).
- It's [#caturday again](https://masto.hackers.town/@lmorchard/115436175018370071), and everyone is tired: ![Cosmo curled up on couch](https://cdn.masto.host/mastohackerstown/media_attachments/files/115/436/168/971/608/250/original/dd6b38880d531cb9.jpeg) ![Miss Biscuits and Catsby lying back to back](https://cdn.masto.host/mastohackerstown/media_attachments/files/115/436/169/001/150/642/original/0f9f295d00326126.jpeg)

"Faced with multi-year delays to secure grid power, US data center operators are deploying aeroderivative gas turbines — effectively retired commercial aircraft engines."
- 404 Media: [Breathing Through Our Butts Declared Safe After First Human Trial](https://www.404media.co/breathing-through-our-butts-declared-safe-after-first-human-trial/). Enteral ventilation—administering oxygen with a liquid delivered through the rectum—has been tested in humans for the first time.
- Frank Chimero's [Beyond the Machine](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2025/beyond-the-machine/?ref=sidebar): "Eno often says while making music he feels like a gardener: planting loops and textures, then watching them sprout into something unexpected... The machine may produce material, but the job of shaping it into something meaningful still rests with him. It is creativity as cultivation."
- [The smallest Docker image to serve static websites](https://lipanski.com/posts/smallest-docker-image-static-website): ~80KB using busybox. [lipanski/docker-static-website](https://github.com/lipanski/docker-static-website) on GitHub.

A week of nostalgic computing mixed with modern web development shenanigans. The BBS adventures on actual vintage hardware were deeply satisfying in that way that only firing up a C64 can be. There's something beautiful about using WiFi to simulate a dial-up connection to a BBS—it's like the best of both eras without tying up the phone line.

The bring-your-own-data discussion continues to rattle around in my head. We keep building these walled gardens when the web already had the answer: let people own their stuff, give them great tools to use it. Somehow we forgot that and now we're all resellers for cloud storage providers.

Next week: probably more retro computing, definitely more Rube Goldberg machines made of loosely-coupled web services that somehow make sense but also don't.
