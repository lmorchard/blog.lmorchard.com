I&#39;ve also come to appreciate nicer paper, having upgraded my Moleskine habit to a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2kSYMW0\">Leuchtturm1917</a> habit. I&#39;ve come a long way since a drug-store spiral notebook and a No. 2 pencil would do.</p>\n<p>But anyway, back to the routine: I make coffee &amp; oatmeal. I start some music.

I attract a cat or two.

That ends up being about 750 words. I started this habit at my office desk, but I would get distracted by my laptop. At our old house, I moved to the kitchen island downstairs and kept my phone just out of arm&#39;s reach once I got the music started. Since we moved to Detroit this past fall, we&#39;ve got a breakfast nook with a little table near a window overlooking the backyard. It&#39;s embarrassingly precious, but I manage.</p>\n<p>When I&#39;m lucky, I get myself into a good mindful state for a solid block of time. Sometimes, the writing is rewarding and dislodges interesting stuff from my head. More often, the writing is just random blather that spills out to fill pages. And every once in awhile, the writing is about the fact that I&#39;m writing random blather for the sake of writing—at which point the journal implodes into itself and I have to buy a new one.</p>\n<p>The thing is, though, that I sit down and that I finish it. Three pages every time. It&#39;s an interesting way to start the day, accomplishing a moderately strenuous mental task not unlike physical exercise. When it works, I untangle my brain while also exercising focus and willpower to complete the task. Some days, that focused feeling spills over into the rest of the day&#39;s work. Sometimes it doesn&#39;t <em>quite</em> work. A few times, I&#39;ve experimented with writing these pages while I ride an exercise bike to kill two birds with one stone—but the result was disastrous and messy. Really, it&#39;s just best to stick to a simpler ritual.</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/31960336615/in/datetaken/\" title=\"20161229_103704\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/762/31960336615_790c96f099_c.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" alt=\"20161229_103704\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>So, where do I go from here?</strong> I had an interesting time <strong>reviewing</strong> entries when I had vacation time at the end of 2016. It was a pretty good year, <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/2016/11/11/heartbroken/\">until it wrecked me</a>. But, I&#39;d like to do better in 2017. And, of course, this new year brings new challenges and pushes me to do <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/821789340355428352\">things that I&#39;ve never really done before</a>. I&#39;ve got a lot of tangle to straighten in my brain.</p>\n<p>I also want to <strong>publish</strong> more consistently &amp; effectively. I wrote 200,000 words this past year, but it&#39;s unlikely anyone will ever read them but me. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to be a historically significant figure and see all these journals end up in an archive somewhere.

But, I&#39;ve also been considering writing here about more general topics—and whether that might work better than snipey little junk food retweets and Facebook threads. You know, versus just keeping my mouth shut altogether. I&#39;ve never really gotten all that <strong>political</strong> on a blog before, but maybe it would help me clarify my thinking by doing it out loud and inviting some push back.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve also really wanted to get myself writing <strong>stories</strong>. I&#39;ve got <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/tag/fiction/\">a little bit of fiction on my blog</a>, but I&#39;ve always wanted to do more. The engine never quite catches, though. Maybe I can find a way to translate or replicate this daily pages habit as a regular creative writing habit. Maybe start with some flash fiction again and work my way up to extended works.</p>\n<p>All in all, I love writing. I&#39;m not sure why I have such a hard time doing it more out in the open, but I&#39;d like to solve that.

Mouse &amp; keyboard &amp; headphones are also easy—USB cables come in long lengths and Bluetooth is a thing.</p>\n<p>No, the hard part was the monitor. I had been gaming on a 2012 15&quot; MacBook Pro—which was physically convenient but lacking in performance. A gaming PC solves the latter, but no one seems to sell 15&quot; standalone monitors equivalent to my laptop screen. That was when I discovered <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Laptop-to-Desktop-Conversion/\">an Instructable article</a> about how to turn an old laptop into a desktop panel. <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch/#Laptop_decapitation\">That gave me ideas</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-10---artisanal-acrylic\">Version 1.0 - Artisanal Acrylic</h2>\n<p>Turns out, there are <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/usr/chinatobby2011\">vendors on eBay</a> who offer complete kits for hooking a laptop display panel up to a PC. They just don&#39;t come with any kind of enclosure like your typical computer monitor. So, <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/02/10/building-my-couch-computing-station/\">I ordered one of those kits and tried handcrafting a case</a>. It turned out crude yet functional:</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8439217201/in/photolist-5m6a-dRKcfR-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRk8-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"First fully assembled power-on of my DIY monitor\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/8439217201_6eea54c3e5_z.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"First fully assembled power-on of my DIY monitor\"></a></p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8447859933/in/photolist-5m6a-dRKcfR-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRk8-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"Rear view #2 of DIY monitor and IKEA DAVE\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/8447859933_c1bf2c05aa_z.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Rear view #2 of DIY monitor and IKEA DAVE\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"version-11---custom-picture-frame\">Version 1.1 - Custom Picture Frame</h2>\n<p>I used that first version for a year in my living room.

Mouse & keyboard & headphones are also easy—USB cables come in long lengths and Bluetooth is a thing.\n\nNo, the hard part was the monitor. I had been gaming on a 2012 15\" MacBook Pro—which was physically convenient but lacking in performance. A gaming PC solves the latter, but no one seems to sell 15\" standalone monitors equivalent to my laptop screen. That was when I discovered [an Instructable article][instructablepanel] about how to turn an old laptop into a desktop panel. [That gave me ideas][laptopdecapitation].\n\n## Version 1.0 - Artisanal Acrylic\n\nTurns out, there are [vendors on eBay][monitorvendors] who offer complete kits for hooking a laptop display panel up to a PC. They just don't come with any kind of enclosure like your typical computer monitor. So, [I ordered one of those kits and tried handcrafting a case][buildingv1]. It turned out crude yet functional:\n\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8439217201/in/photolist-5m6a-dRKcfR-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRk8-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"First fully assembled power-on of my DIY monitor\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/8439217201_6eea54c3e5_z.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"First fully assembled power-on of my DIY monitor\"></a>\n\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8447859933/in/photolist-5m6a-dRKcfR-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRk8-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"Rear view #2 of DIY monitor and IKEA DAVE\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/8447859933_c1bf2c05aa_z.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Rear view #2 of DIY monitor and IKEA DAVE\"></a>\n\n## Version 1.1 - Custom Picture Frame\n\nI used that first version for a year in my living room.
