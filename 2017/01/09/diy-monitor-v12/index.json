Mouse &amp; keyboard &amp; headphones are also easy—USB cables come in long lengths and Bluetooth is a thing.</p>\n<p>No, the hard part was the monitor. I had been gaming on a 2012 15\" MacBook Pro—which was physically convenient but lacking in performance. A gaming PC solves the latter, but no one seems to sell 15\" standalone monitors equivalent to my laptop screen. That was when I discovered <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Laptop-to-Desktop-Conversion/\">an Instructable article</a> about how to turn an old laptop into a desktop panel. <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch/#Laptop_decapitation\">That gave me ideas</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-10---artisanal-acrylic\">Version 1.0 - Artisanal Acrylic</h2>\n<p>Turns out, there are <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/usr/chinatobby2011\">vendors on eBay</a> who offer complete kits for hooking a laptop display panel up to a PC. They just don't come with any kind of enclosure like your typical computer monitor. So, <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/02/10/building-my-couch-computing-station/\">I ordered one of those kits and tried handcrafting a case</a>. It turned out crude yet functional:</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8439217201/in/photolist-5m6a-dRKcfR-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRk8-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"First fully assembled power-on of my DIY monitor\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/8439217201_6eea54c3e5_z.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"\" alt=\"First fully assembled power-on of my DIY monitor\"></a></p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/8447859933/in/photolist-5m6a-dRKcfR-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRk8-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"Rear view [#2](/tag/2) of DIY monitor and IKEA DAVE\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/8447859933_c1bf2c05aa_z.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"\" alt=\"Rear view [#2](/tag/2) of DIY monitor and IKEA DAVE\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"version-11---custom-picture-frame\">Version 1.1 - Custom Picture Frame</h2>\n<p>I used that first version for a year in my living room. It was ugly &amp; heavy &amp; awkward. Happily, I fell upon <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Raspberry-Pi-Media-Panel-fka-Digita/?ALLSTEPS\">this Instructables article</a> that pointed me to <a href=\"http://www.americanframe.com/\">American Frame</a>. They'll produce a rectangular picture frame in just about any custom size you'd like—height, width, <em>and</em> depth.</p>\n<p>So, I ordered a nice matte black metal frame close to the size of my display panel. I ended up with this:</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/12222356524/in/photolist-dRKcfR-7aTRk8-dSvv2a-dSvurt-jC3LLU-5m6a-58SNWo-e3Nbyu-7FS8wi-7FS8pc-e3NbtC-e3Nb3W-4P3uQw-3RZHaZ-RQPr4-RNZRY-RQPwv-7aTRTz-7aXEAw-dSmDqf-5m5D-5EBhpP-7HvphU-cVUcz-cVXdK-5EFzQf-cVV14\" title=\"Updated Couch PC monitor\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/12222356524_fcbd4cf0b4_z.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"\" alt=\"Updated Couch PC monitor\"></a></p>\n<p>Sleeker and lighter. The back of the picture frame was just <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foamcore\">foamcore</a> and I used double-sided tape on the monitor arm and all the electronics. Luckily, the panel and all were light enough for these hacks. But, it kind of fell apart across two house moves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"version-12---mic-stands--laser-cutters-ftw\">Version 1.2 - Mic Stands &amp; Laser Cutters FTW</h2>\n<p>I decided I wanted to minimize things.

I skilled up on laser cutters and <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/2016/08/29/gamechord/\">made a DIY keypad that I showed off at the Detroit Maker Faire</a>. Things that, you know, <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/topic/i3detroit-public/Qv1P91ySqWo/discussion\">I should have done years ago at the start of this whole DIY monitor project</a>—rather than cutting things by hand and with a Dremel.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I discovered that there's a such thing as <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2jccG5D\">a VESA mount</a> for <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2jcc93M\">microphone stands</a>. I bought those and threw in an <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2j1YpeM\">adapter</a> &amp; a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2j1VYZq\">gooseneck</a>—all of which let me strip my rig down like so:</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/32182700386/in/datetaken/\" title=\"20170109_221645\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/32182700386_4320d2a1d0_z.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"\" alt=\"20170109_221645\"></a></p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/31845156280/in/datetaken/\" title=\"20170109_221722\"><img src=\"/uploads/2017/diy-monitor-v12/31845156280_d16551c8df_z.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"\" alt=\"20170109_221722\"></a></p>\n<p>By this point, the double-sided tape and the foamcore just weren't up to the task.
