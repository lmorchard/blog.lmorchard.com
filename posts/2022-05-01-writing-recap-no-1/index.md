**TL;DR**: I've gotten through twenty days of writing posted here. I thought it might be worth recapping the last few things I managed to post.

<!--more-->

Last month, I started [trying to build a daily creative writing habit](/2022/04/20/building-a-new-creative-writing-habit/).

As of Thursday, I've gotten through twenty days of writing here. After that, I decided to take a couple of days off. And rather than jumping right back into it, I figured I might write a little status report.

When I first started, I wanted to establish this as a *Thing I Do* - just a regular, everyday fixture. I figured that I really needed to make it happen *every single day* in order to lay down the grooves of the habit. But, I've started feeling a little crispy around the edges trying to muster daily motivation without fail.

By now, I'm very familiar with the signs of burning out [an enthusiasm](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast/). So, some regular breaks sound good for the sake of sustainability. I'm just going to have to trust myself - which is a hard thing - to start the habit back up next week. That said, the other regular writing habit I've managed to establish - i.e. morning journal pages - only happens 5 days a week. Maybe I should take the hint from that?

With that reflection out of the way, I also thought it might be worth recapping the last few things I posted here:

- "[Mala's Daring](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/24/malas-daring/)"
  
  I had a dream about these clever lemurs who are about as smart as humans, but haven't quite developed advanced technology yet. Here's a little sketch in that setting. üêí

- "[Jacob's Drive](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/25/jacobs-drive/)"

  I've been thinking a lot about burnout lately, and [the Tarot prompt](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/25/jacobs-drive/2022-04-25-prompt.png) pointed me at thinking about wanting something better. I haven't had a job nearly as bad as Jacob's and I've never really wanted to be a trucker, but that's the magic of fiction! üåà‚≠ê

- "[Cyril's Wisdom](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/26/cyrils-wisdom/)"

  The [Tarot prompt](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/26/cyrils-wisdom/2022-04-26-prompt.png) seemed to point me toward a self-help guru or a cult leader who got too high on their own supply. I settled on an author who might have actually written something worthwhile but couldn't handle the success. üç∏

- "[Garth's Acquisition](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/27/garths-acquisition/)"

  A shoplifter seemed suggested by [the Tarot prompt](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/27/garths-acquisition/2022-04-27-prompt.png), but I wanted to write about a character who wasn't entirely a villain but also not at all justified in the act. (It's not like he stole a loaf of bread.) üí∏

- "[Finley's Overtime](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/04/28/finleys-overtime/)"

  This one is a continuation of the story between [a human / AI couple](https://blog.lmorchard.com/tag/finleyandcharley/) that I've had in mind for most of a year. I've got a much longer story written around them, but I'm starting to think I might tear most of that up and rewrite it in pieces like this. ü§ñ

Alright, that's enough for this recap. Let's see how next week goes!
