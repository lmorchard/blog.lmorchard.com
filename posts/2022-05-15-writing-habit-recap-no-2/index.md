**TL;DR**:  I've gotten through over a month of writing posted here. I thought it might be worth reflecting and recapping things up to now.

I've been working on this writing habit for just a bit over a month, now. That's pretty good as habits go. I'm starting to think about what I want to do next. I've been thinking of these little exercises like marathon training—and at some point, I want to try an actual marathon.

It's also occurred to me that doing fresh characters & settings & scenarios every day—even if they're just over 300 words—might be a bit harder than building momentum with an established story from session to session when I sit down to write. So, maybe shifting over to a few continuing stories might be a good idea? Might be more worthwhile to read, too. 

What I really want is a Couch-to-5k of writing: a plan for doing regular exercises that incrementally build to larger goals over a course of weeks. I had a lot of success with that program for actual running. It does what it says on the tin—I literally went from sedentary couch life to jogging 5k every other day after 9 weeks, which was completely inconceivable to me before I'd started the program. 

Over a decade ago, I did the 4am wake-up thing. That did indeed let me regularly crank out a few thousand words before the day job. While I did finish a few books that way, I feel like I've fully burnt out the mechanism. The notion of writing a book like that ever again just seems like a nonstarter. 

Whatever I do now has to be sustainable. Relying on willpower and threatening myself with shame whenI stumble just leaves me in a bad place. It's hard to find forward-reaching, positive motivation, but I think it's what I need to somehow methodically do.

Apropos of that, I'm finding it rewarding to review what I've managed to write lately:

- "[Koga's Cauldron](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/02/kogas-cauldron/)" - the lemurs are back, but this time they cross over with the demigod AI setting that I've been toying with.
- "[Avery's Deployment](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/03/averys-deployment/)" - another scene in the demigod AI setting, which I want to expand into at least a short story
- "[Yasir's Getaway](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/04/yasirs-getaway/)" - I was thinking, what if a space ship is just a nicer place to live and not necessarily a way to travel?
- "[Ivo's Act](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/05/ivos-act/)" - the Tarot prompt just kind of summoned up an on stage performance for me, so I ran with it
- "[Vincent's Voyage](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/08/vincents-voyage/)" - the Tarot prompt suggested a kind of misguided hoarder of needed wisdom, not sure I got there though
- "[Familiar Strangers](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/09/familiar-strangers/)" - the Tarot prompt got me thinking about someone shying away from asking someone on a date, but pandemic times got to me.
- "[Megachurch of the Shattered](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/10/megachurch-of-the-shattered/)" - this one was about a religion I dreamed about a few weeks ago, which I might build into a longer story
- "[Roxy's Faceroll](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/11/roxys-faceroll/)" - the prompt made me think about being productive despite burnout because they paycheck still needs to roll in
- "[Left on Read](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/12/left-on-read/)" - I want to work on writing more imperfect characters and their relationships, so this one kinda does that.
- "[Unheeded](http://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/05/13/unheeded/)" - the prompt brought to mind a smug elder unwilling to hear new perspectives, which often leads to a disaster trope, so I went with it
