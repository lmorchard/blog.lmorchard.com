Last fall, we bought a house with a pond in back. At first, I didn't really want it. I had a notion to fill it in, maybe replace it with a fire pit. By spring, we decided to keep it.

It's not a large pond - 6' x 7' x 2' and roughly butterfly-shaped. It's got a little turtle that spits water pumped up from a filter box on the bottom. The pond liner is hard plastic, like a kiddie pool, covered in gravel and rocks to add a more natural look. The whole arrangement is probably 10 years old.

In March, I drained it, cleaned it, and started the fountain again. As I got busy over the next weeks, I discovered the liner had leaks - mainly cracks from the aforementioned rocks over many seasons' freezes & thaws. I had to keep adding water to maintain the level: if it dropped below the fountain's filter box, the pump made horrible noises as it ran dry.

I got tired of adding - and wasting - water. So, I turned off the pump and let things go while I researched next steps. It was about a week before I acquired a new rubber liner - and then another few days of rain before I had a sunny day to work on it over the weekend.

As it turns out, that's just enough time in May for a not-quite-empty backyard pond to transform into a murky swamp teeming with wriggling life. Mostly mosquito larvae, but there were plenty of other things I didn't quite recognize. So, I cleaned the whole thing out again, starting over with the new liner. It's back in business again - the water's stayed put and been clear for a week so far.

TL;DR, Here's the thing about a pond in your backyard: It's a responsibility. Water and debris collect. It attracts wildlife - some kinds less desirable than others. Left unchecked, it becomes a smelly, stagnant soup that can presents a hazard to yourself and your neighbors.

Thinking about this reminded me of something else: A few weeks ago, I was tinkering with setting up Mastodon instances. I bought some cheap domain names, set up some virtual hosts on my hobby server. They're all working - but I stopped short of opening up account registration. 

I was suddenly aware of a feeling of anticipated responsibility. Each of these Mastodon instances would be backyard ponds. I'd have to keep the pumps running, make sure to skim debris. I'd have to monitor for wildlife setting up homes in and around them. I'd have to work to keep these things from becoming hazards to myself and my neighbors.

And, for what? The pond in our backyard has been a nice feature. I've spent a few hours by it with my laptop. Maybe some friends & neighbors will enjoy gathering around it this summer. In contrast, the prospect of hosting social media watering holes for internet randos - let alone acquaintances and friends - fills me with dread.

So, that's me. I'm not going to stand up a public Mastodon instance unless I convince myself that taking on the responsibility will pay off. I haven't imagined a good scenario yet.

But, what about other folks? 

Consider the generous admins who run instances of Mastodon & GNU Social & PostActiv & everything else that participates in the OStatus federation. Those folks all have their reasons and I think they've accepted the responsibility to keep their ponds running clear. At least, with consideration for varied local definitions of "clear" in codes of conduct and whatnot.
  
But, what about Twitter and Facebook and Reddit? Hell, what about game companies running servers for multiplayer games?

These ponds smell swampy. Their filtration pumps are nowhere near big enough to keep the water from stagnating. Their owners have decided that there's value to be extracted from entertaining whatever wildlife arrives - even if that results in sizeable pockets of wriggling things that hatch into neighborhood hazards. 

I think these pond owners leave things unchecked because treating the water would eat into (or completely wipe out) the value extracted from monetized attention. The usual excuse is expense and difficulty, with an occasional lazy handwave at "radical free speech" as a rationalization. But, could I get away with that if I left the pond in my backyard as a Petri dish? I suspect the neighbors - and maybe the local authorities (including my wife) - would have something to say about it.

If they're mainly incentivized by the value they extract from the sludge, what could possibly motivate them to clean things up spontaneously? That said, I'm not sure who could effectively nudge these pond owners into cleaning up their water. Maybe there'll be some law - doubtful at best, disastrous at worse. Maybe all the valuable wildlife needs to migrate away - hard to predict and probably just dooms the ponds before they decide to change things.

But, you know what? I don't care about their ponds or their value extraction. I care about hanging out with the wildlife and the water.

Maybe where we need to get to is more ponds run by people who care and get rewarded for the effort. It feels like we need more cooperatives and more volunteer efforts. Each on smaller scales, because people can only take care of so much water. But, I don't really have great ideas on how to make this happen. I guess that's what inspired me to tinker with Mastodon instances. I'd like to see cleaner ponds. I just fall short of actually wanting to take on the responsibilty. Or feeling like I'm the right guy to do it.

Anyway, I guess that's a fuzzy realization I've had: In more traditional other social gatherings, there's so much emotional labor and organizational effort that chews up value. In trying to mechanize things, the whole ad-supported social media industry seems powered by as little care as possible to extract as much value as possible - in a way, the value is skimmed from monetized neglect, not monetized eyeballs. It kind of feels to me like the whole structure will fall over if we ever really figure that out or decide this sort of thing is no longer acceptable in a society.

Is that a good conclusion? Not sure. Still thinking.
