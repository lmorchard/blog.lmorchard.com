So, in a few hours, it'll have been a week since I rendered myself couchbound for the foreseeable near future.  I hopped off a bus on the way home last Monday and through a bungled confluence of toes, curb, heel, and street, I managed to rupture my left Achilles tendon.  That's pretty much made my left leg useless, and I've been growing roots on the couch with occasional crutch-based expeditions to other rooms.

I've spent the last 7 days in a bit of a drug haze with doctor visits; attempts at getting work done with mixed success; and some marathon World of Warcraft sessions to distract myself from this predicament.  (I'm [a Gnome mage named Fizlfry on Eitrigg](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/06/world-of-warcraft-is-my-world-of-warcraft) who's [just joined the We Know guild](http://weknow.to/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=52&page=2#Item_17), say hi!)  Midweek, I got a nicer cast and an MRI, and I stepped down from the strong stuff.  So, things are stabilized as I wait to hear if I need surgery this week.  At least I can think better now, for whatever that's worth.

I'm pretty despondent about the whole thing:  We just moved here, just got settled, ready to start exploring the Valley and the City and get free of the hermitage - and here I am stuck on the couch while the kids all play outside.  I'm told that this will heal, given time and some rehabilitation.  I've also heard that [I'm in good company with this injury](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=336497).

It's just so frustrating to have been rendered so immobile.  Alexandra has been amazing, taking care of everything for me, and I'll owe her some big time pampering once I'm back on my feet.  But, in the meantime, maybe I'll have to invite some people by to visit me on my microfiber throne.  We have plenty of attractions:  Gaming consoles from many generations, witty banter, and a mini-zoo of cats and bunnies.  Suggestions on couchbound entertainments and socializing options welcome.  :)

I've already implemented one of your tips to help me auto post my del.icio.us bookmarks to my wordpress blog.  Haven't had much time to mess with it beyond that.</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>Sorry to hear that. I've had a partial rupture before. Although it healed without needing a surgery, it's never the same. I had to quit basketball and pickup cycling. I no longer run across the street when I can walk across it. As you probably know, one of the reasons it's a tough area for surgery is because there isn't whole lot of blodd circulating down there to speed the recovery process. If you do go ahead with the surgey, be as sure as you can about its condition before trying to get back to normal activities. That's a sure way to re-rupturing the tendon. It happened to me.</p></div>
