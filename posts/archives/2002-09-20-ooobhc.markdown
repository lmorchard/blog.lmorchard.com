<p>John Robb <a href="http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/09/19.html#a2542">writes</a>: "Wouldn't it be interesting to have an <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> variant (new name obviously) for subscribing to personal contact data off of weblogs?"</p>
<p>I read that DJ Adams <a href="http://www.pipetree.com/qmacro/2002/Jul/15#foaf">was just playing</a> with <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF</a> not too long ago, and at the time it made me want to dig into <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a> more.  But, work got busy and I promptly got distracted away.  If anything, though, I could see something like <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF">FOAF</a> being really nice as a start for this purpose.  Of course, there's <a href="http://www.imc.org/pdi/">vCard</a>, but I think it wouldn't be very hard to convert to it from <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF">FOAF</a>.  The universality and connectivity that <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a> could bring to this seem terribly nice.  Throw in periodic auto-refresh, either literally by scheduled re-query, or by pub/sub notification, and you've got a neat auto-updating address book just for starters.</p>

            <div class="content">I think it's sad that (a) FOAF is so poorly documented, and (b) so few people, even from the RDF/SW community, have entries. It seems like this is a great "starter app" to try and build critical mass on, but RDF crowd seems to prefer being a puddle than a pool, or something....

            <div class="content">Sort of related: Ben's talking about converting OSX address books to FOAF.

One possible snag in using FOAF: it's mostly aimed at identifying who you are and who you know/knows you, rather than distributing contact info, so although it uses email addresses as identifiers, it allows a SHA1 hash rather than the actual address. I guess it would be reasonable to have your public throwdown address in clear text, ready for yet another spambot to grab, with everything else hashed.</div>

It's where? :)  I installed an LDAP server at my company, but I doubt UserLand will install an LDAP server for everyone.  And I don't think they should.

What appeals to me about something like FOAF (or something better) is that it's a file you can throw up at a URL.  It's dumb.  Everyone can get cheap hosting these days.  The smarts go into your address book, or maybe a centrallized contact info aggregation server somewhere that polls your registered URL.  Maybe *that* aggregation server has an LDAP interface to use as a bridge.

This appeals to me as a nice compromise between centralization and decentralization</div>

            <div class="content">LDAP is an implementation of identification control rather than a generic, "here's who I am" statement. One could easily incorporate FOAF into LDAP, but one couldn't easily incorporate LDAP into anything else (unless one stripped out the data structures and incorporate them -- interesting idea worth exploring further).

I think there needs to be more discussion of FOAF and what type of information should be recorded to 'identify' oneself.

Also, I think the important thing to start focusing on is the focus of the vocabularies and implementations, such as FOAF, rather than the fact that they use RDF. RDF is a model, and RDF/XML is a serialization, but the real business is FOAF (or whatever is being discussed).

BTW, there was effort to translate vCard into RDF at http://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf. I don't believe it reflects recent activities associated with RDF.</div>

You can then place a "Kunekt Card" button on your web site that points to this URL. I'm using Drupal (PHP based Web Log) to develop a contact manager for these files.</div>
