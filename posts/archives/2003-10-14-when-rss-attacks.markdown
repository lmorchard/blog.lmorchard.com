<p>
For anyone who wonders why people talk about politics and animosity in
the tiny sphere of web syndication tech, here's a case in point.
</p>

<p>
You see, there was a private event over the weekend, called Foo Camp.
To this, many smart people were invited, and many more weren't.
Grousing about invitations, funding, and elitism aside, it sounded
like a great time and a cool change from your average conference.  I
hope it turns into a regular event, and hope that someday I'm given
the opportunity to go to something like it.  I'm sure a lot of us
out here would like to make it to something like that.
</p>

<p>
But, for what it was, you can only gather so many people before it
becomes a circus (or a conference).  Charging a price serves as a
limiter, while making the event invitation-only works as well.  The
difference is whether you're bringing in people who can afford it
versus people who are favored by the organizer.  Either way, someone's
going to be pissed about not going.  The difference is whether you're
pissed off at the organizer's economics or the organizer's
personality.  Oh well.
</p>

<p>
So anyway, around mid-September, Jeremy Zawodny had floated
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000967.html">an idea</a>
involving publishing and discovery of lists of RSS feeds.
He was one of those invited to Foo Camp, and in one of their
huddles, he brought the idea up for a brainstorming session.
From the sounds of it, they tossed around a few ideas, but
didn't really come up with much other than that it was an idea
worth discussing.
</p>

<p>
No sooner than the camp breaks up, though, and the angry buzz
has already started.  How dare a bunch of geeks talk about
technology they're interested in while at a private gathering?
How dare they not invite all of us?  Conspiracy!  Elitism!
They didn't pick me for their kickball team!  By the way,
this isn't an attempt to put words in mouths.  This is my
off-the-cuff impression of what I read yesterday.  It all
seems repeatedly and unnecessarily childish to me, and it's
certainly not limited to one person.
</p>

<p>
So, by today, there's already
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/fdml/FrontPage">a wiki</a>
devoted to exploring this idea, along with a scattering of blog
posts. This seems pretty speedy to me,
considering campers returning to the work-a-day world after
a geek retreat.  This doesn't seem at all the work of a sinister
cabal bent on wresting control and domination over a technology,
as what I saw implied in the first comment I quoted above.
</p>

<p>
Dave Winer's already posted a
<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/myPublicFeedsOpml">first proposal</a>
toward implementing the idea.  And, believe it or not, as Sam comments
on above, this approach has not been ruled out.  In fact,
Jeremy had suggested using OPML in his original posting of the idea.
</p>

<p>
Why couldn't we just have seen the collaboration without the
antagonism, in at least this case?  Yeah, there was a small, private
gathering at which discussions were had.  Sounds like what happens at
work, or with friends, or in classes.  Granted, I suppose an argument
could be made concerning the relative openness of these gatherings as
compared to Foo Camp.  But, this is mooted by the fact that the
people involved were already moving toward sharing the discussion.
</p>

<p>
For all the grousing about flame wars and personality clashes on
mailing lists and working groups, sometimes it's nice to work on an
idea in a smaller group with a good dynamic.  It helps to get
something together before throwing the doors open to have the thing
buffeted by opinions and criticism from all sides.  It's one way to
avoid <a href="http://www.userland.com/whatIsStopEnergy">"stop
energy"</a> while trying to build some momentum.
</p>

<p>
As Dave himself wrote, "I heard at a working group meeting that things
like SOAP can only happen when no one is paying attention."  So, it
sounds like a bunch of geeks tried to get something rolling before the
attentional heat lamps turned on it.  Had they wanted to be a sinister
cabal, we certainly wouldn't have heard about any of this until long,
long after the event.  It would have been kept behind closed corporate
doors until the day of embrace-and-extend.  Then, profit!  As it is, I
think they erred on the side of throwing open the discussion
<i>too</i> early.
</p>

<p>
So anyway, the reason I write at such length about this is that I
don't think that this should be let to pass without comment or
consideration.  This kind of thing is what's wrong.  We need to take
at <i>least</i> three deep breaths before reacting like this, whether
or not we've taken 900 beep breaths in the past already.  It's the
nature of these things.  As an interested but outside observer, the
atmosphere created by such reactions makes me very sad.  And it's not
just one person doing this, either.
</p>

<p>
So, chill out.  It's just data.  In fact, the proposal at question
here is just <i>a friggen outline of feeds</i>!  It's just a list of
lists!  Most of the geeks out there just want to play, and are happy
to have more geeks to play with.  Can't we just get along and play the
game together, rather than gaming each other?

            <div class="content">Actually, there was a reasonable amount of work done back when Jeremy first came up with the proposal, most of which I codified here  and here.  It was done without acrynomy, too. Maybe that's why people were not interested in starting from there and instead preferred to start all over again.</div>
