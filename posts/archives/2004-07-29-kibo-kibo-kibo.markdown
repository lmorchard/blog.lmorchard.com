A tiny bit of a [post from Rafe Colburn][rc3] today reminds me:  Thanks to sites like [Technorati][technorati] and [Feedster][feedster], along with maybe some Google-scraping (careful though, since [Google hates scrapers][noscrape]), we can all now egosurf and be [Kibo][kibo] potentials.  

I, for one, would welcome a [Kibo][kibo2] of blogs, because it would be a hell of a lot more amusing than comment spam.
