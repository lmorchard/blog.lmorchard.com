Look at what <a href="http://dave.editthispage.com/myNameIsDaveWiner">Dave</a> has done to me!  My <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/deus_x/radio/">Radio weblog</a> is sitting over here if you want to tune me in, and an explanation of the madness is <a href="http://radio.outliners.com/beta">over here</a>.<p>3/27/02; 1:25:43 AM by LMO<p>   This is pretty swanky.  Swanky indeed.  Instant messaging meets outlining.  It seems that it's not <strong>quite</strong> there yet, but I understand that's not what this beta is about.  <p>   But as a beta, this is a swanky mind bomb indeed.  Especially if, as Dave says, we start to see who's watching whom in outliner land.  This is what I want for all the weblogs.  Hot hot hot.<p>   Now maybe I can get off my butt and work on <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Arboretum">Arboretum</a> some more and get it in on this action.  From what Dave's saying, anyone who can speak <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML">OPML</a> (and I assume maybe XML-RPC and maybe Jabber) can play.<p>3/27/02; 1:37:05 AM by LMO<p>   Of course, one other thing:  Why didn't I pay attention to Frontier and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand">UserLand</a> sooner?  :)  This is what I've been trying to make with Perl, <span style='background : ;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/MySQL?topicparent=."><b>?</b></a><font color="">MySQL</font></span> and friends for years now.<p>3/27/02; 1:57:32 AM by LMO<p>   I really should be in bed by now, but I'm subscribing to outlines like a madman:<p>      Dave Winer, Scott Loftness, John Robb, Laurence Lee, Jake Savin, David Brown, masukomi, David Davies, and Jeremy Bowers<p>   I'm also thinking that there's some kind of unholy symmetry between me @ decafbad.com, my obsession with coffee, Dave @ userland.com, his affinity for coffee-- and of course, insomnia stemming from the fact that what you're doing at the moment is so much more fun than sleep.
