Whew.  Things have been busy lately, and there've been at least a half-dozen things I could-a-should-a blogged.  Maybe I'll play catch-up soon and make another try at making this blog more active.

In the meantime, how's moving to a new server for shaking things up?  I just requested the Open Source developer discount over at JohnCompanies and qualified for it, so here I go.  My time at JVDS.net has been grand for the price, but I liked things with JC &#38; co better.

If you're reading this, it means I've thrown the switch on the new server and hopefully haven't broken too much.  (Crossing fingers... now.)
