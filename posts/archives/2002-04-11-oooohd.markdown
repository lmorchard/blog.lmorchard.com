<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/">new Google Web API</a> is a mind bomb, but I feel a bit slow because my head hasn't raced out to find a bunch of nifty uses yet...  it'll come to me though.  And I'm sure I'll be seeing the other smart people on my aggregator start doing some amazing things.  I haven't quite caught on fire with <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001015/2002/04/10.html#a1152">Dave's Google Boxes</a> yet, but I feel a slow burn going.  Long running searches.  Changing results.  Makes me itch.</p>
<p>I guess a mind bomb wouldn't be a mind bomb if it didn't take a few to build up power.</p>
