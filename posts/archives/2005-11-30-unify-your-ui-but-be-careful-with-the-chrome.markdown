I ran the UNO installer on my PowerBook a few weeks ago, hoping to smooth out the scourge of inconsistent UI themes that have accreted around OS X.  And pretty much, that's what it's done. 
 
In fact, that installer went so far as to tweak my *Firefox* UI by replacing my `userChrome.css`, which I just realized as I was poking around in it to [make my Tab Sidebar smaller][sm].

On one hand, I really appreciate the thoroughness.  But on the other, I had [a few tweaks of my own in there][own] that this thing blew away.  I wish they'd *appended to* and not *replaced* this file.
