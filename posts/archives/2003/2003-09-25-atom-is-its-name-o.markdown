<blockquote cite="http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/mail-archive/msg00571.html">I would like to propose, nay, admonish, that the name of the format and spec
should be Atom, that the current naming vote should be killed, and we should
move on to grander things without the auspices of "what's it called?!" over
our heads. This has been going on far too long.</blockquote>

<p>I haven't been anywhere near the epicenter of Atom/Pie/Echo much,
so this is mostly a 'me too' kind of posting.  But, you know, as an
interested hacker waiting for dust to settle before I start paying
much attention, the decision on a name, as superficial as it is,
seems telling to me.</p>

<p>On one hand, I could take it to be representative of what's going
on inside the project as a whole.  (If they can't settle on a name,
how can they settle on what's included in the spec?)  On the other hand,
it could just be that naming the thing is the least interesting aspect
of the project.  But I consider that because I'm a nerd, I've been
there, and I want to see the project thrive.  Others might not be so
charitable or patient. :)</p>

<p><i>So just name the dang thing Atom already.</i></p>
