After making those RSS namespace examples, I was thinking aloud about
SOAP on #joiito yesterday and how it compares to what I did with the Amazon
data.  <a href="http://www.intertwingly.com">Sam Ruby</a>
happened to be in the room:
</p>
<pre>&lt;rubys&gt; deusx: want a quick primer?

&lt;deusx&gt; rubys: I'd love one, though unfortunately at the moment,
I'm about to be off to a meeting :(

* f8dy would like a quick primer

&lt;rubys&gt; This is really quick.  Take some XML.  XML that doesn't
have a DTD or any PI's.  Put it in a soap:Body.  Put the soap:Body in
a soap:Envelope.  Voila', you have valid document literal SOAP.</pre>
<p>
That <i>was</i> a quick primer, and though I know there's more to
it, putting it like that makes me see SOAP a little differently.
