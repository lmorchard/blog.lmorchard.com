 <p>A few featured bullets from over on my other blog:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>
     <span>I am, of course, a hopeless <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neophile">neophile</a>.  I believe it's the only correct orientation toward the future, especially the future as it looks from here.</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span><a href="http://blogs.opml.org/vacuum/2006/02/13#opmlEditorAndSpotlight">Ed says that OPML isn't caught by Spotlight on OS X.</a>  Hmm, I know how to make Spotlight plugins.  I should add that to my <a href="http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/instantOutliner/l.m.orchard.opml">Maybe Do</a> list.</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span>It'll take me awhile to get down to that Maybe Do list, though, since I've got book chapter deadlines as a steady drumbeat on through until mid-March that leave me just a sliver of time for side-hacking in the meantime.</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span>Also, Ed: If you're still having trouble assigning links to blogroll items, I'm wondering if you've tried right-clicking / control-clicking on an outline node triangle?  There should be a context menu offering "Add Link..." as an option.  That'll spawn a dialog you can use to add or modify a URL associated with an outline node.</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span>By the way, is anyone else back to using the Instant Outliner these days?  My <a href="http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/instantOutliner/l.m.orchard.opml">IO is here</a>.  Apologies in advance though:  I'm still trying to work out quite what to use it for, or if the stuff there really belongs somewhere else.  I used to have an IO a few years ago, but drifted away from the habit.</span>
     </li>
     </ul>
