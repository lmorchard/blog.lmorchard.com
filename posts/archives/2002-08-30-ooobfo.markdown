<p>Kick.  Ass.  Now we're cooking with gas.  I think I need to get a fresh install of Radio going on this iBook again, especially since it seems renice works now and can tame the CPU hungry beast to managable levels.  I was kinda waiting to see if/when the people hacking with IM in Radio would close this loop.  Now I want to see what this can do to news aggregation, pub/sub, change notification, etc and more.  </p>
