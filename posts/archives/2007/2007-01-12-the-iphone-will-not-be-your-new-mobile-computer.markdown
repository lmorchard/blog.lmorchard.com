The last thing you want is to have loaded three apps on your phone and then you go to make a call and it doesn’t work anymore. These are more like iPods than they are like computers.”</blockquote><div class="quotesource">Source: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/technology/12apple.html?ex=1326258000&en=905b9e9dd858350d&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">Steve Jobs Walks the Tightrope Again - New York Times</a></div>
I understand what Apple's after here - a mobile environment is a whole lot less palatable when it's got crashes and glitches like the desktop and laptop world.  But, I have been known to [run Linux on my iPod](http://ipodlinux.org/Main_Page), so I like to crack the closed shell on devices that go in my pockets.  Hopefully the iPhone's lockdown is more of a "keep out" sign, rather than a sealed vault.

            <div class="content"><p>Of course there are hardware manufacturers that build smartphones which are interested in an open platform and a software eco-system. Like the greenphone (trolltech) or the FIC Neo 1973, which I am personally more excited about, because all of the phones software will be opensourced (and the first gen has a more affordable price, too). Iin fact the software of the phone is more like a platform (openmoko) that will in the long term hopefully run on all kinds of hardware, and it decidedly different than all the other platforms, because it is not restricted to a sandbox, but allows access to all the software and hardware.</p></div>
