You know what I *have* had some enthusiasm for lately?  [My renewed fiction writing efforts.][skein]  My latest exercise into [7th Son / Infection podcast fanfic][pf] might seem a bit precious and / or silly — at least, I know *I've* always turned my nose up at fanfic, or surreptitiously checked out examples of the genre after making sure no one was watching.  But, the guys behind [7th Son](http://jchutchins.net/7Son/Home/Home.html) and [Infection](http://scottsigler.podshow.com/podcasts/) are both very appreciative of fans and are quick to give shout-outs — so, it's providing me with a bit of fun and motivation to actually get something fictional written after years of sputtering activity.  So, hey, whatever works.  :)
