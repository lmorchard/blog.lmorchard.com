Crap.  Somehow, someone's gotten access to edit my posts on this blog and have crapped in loads of viagra linkspam.  I've probably destroyed the evidence already by deleting the spam as soon as I saw it â€” and as soon as some friendly readers emailed me pointing at more.  I've done the obvious, changed my password and tried to lock down the admin pages a bit.  But, I don't know who, how, or why.  Ugh.

So, my apologies if anyone sees any offers for penis pills around these parts.  A heads up would be kindly appreciated as I scour my records and grumble.

            <div class="content"><p>I have heard that wordpress needs to be updated to the security point releases consistently. 
This is something that I try to stay on top of. Don't remember this being that big a deal with movable type. Could be a design flaw for wordpress, or perhaps PHP.</p>

<p>At one point I was using rsync to synchronize the new default files, and then hitting the dashboard to update the db design if it had changed. last update I did manually since I needed to move some photo links around in mysql. I still think rsync is a good tool for this task. Though lately they have been obseleting some files and they probably shouldn't be left around. what were the permissions on your files?</p>
