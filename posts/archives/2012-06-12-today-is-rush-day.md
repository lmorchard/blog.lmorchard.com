The new Rush album, [Clockwork Angels][1]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=0xdecafbad01-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B007I2BZIE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, is out today. Anyone who knows me, knows I&#8217;m a Rush fanatic. I have all the albums so far on CD &#8211; except for the latest, which I&#8217;m listening to on Spotify. It&#8217;ll be in my hands eventually, though.



This is a band that&#8217;s been around, still making music, [for most of the past 40 years][2]. They&#8217;ve shifted styles for each decade, never going on hiatus, never doing a &#8220;comeback&#8221; tour.

Well, there was *one* major hiatus, and I think they had a good excuse: The drummer, Neil Peart, [lost his daughter to a car accident and his wife to cancer, both within a year][3]. He retired from the band, and took a mostly-solo tour on a motorcycle **55,000 miles** around the Americas to collect himself, [and wrote a book about it][4]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=0xdecafbad01-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=1550225480" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. If that&#8217;s not a bad-ass, Joseph-Campbellian response to personal tragedy, I don&#8217;t know what is. Though that epic trek, he found a new wife, reconnected with himself and family, and came back to the band.

And if that weren&#8217;t enough, he came back better than ever and the band blew the roof off [Vapor Trails][5]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=0xdecafbad01-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B000065DTE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> with the first track, One Little Victory:



So, today is Rush day.
