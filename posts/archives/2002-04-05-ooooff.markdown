<p><i>From Radio <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand">UserLand</a>'s Outliner @ 4/4/02; 10:24:32 PM</i></p><li><b>Outlog</b></li>   <ul>   <li><b>Current status:</b> Online, working.</li>   <li>4/4/02; 10:11:30 PM by LMO</li>      <ul>      <li>Were I insane (perhaps criminally so), and if I knew elisp in emacs better, I would stick instant outlining into Emacs' outline-mode.</li>      <li>Then we might truly have the "emacs of outliners".</li>      <li>Or something like that.</li>      </ul>   <li>4/4/02; 9:22:13 PM by LMO</li>      <ul>      <li>My cats demand my popcorn.  The two of them work in tandem, one distracting and the other snatching.  Astonishingly, they share the spoils.</li>      </ul>   <li>4/4/02; 9:14:24 PM by LMO</li>      <ul>      <li>Concering Arboretum, Mark Paschal says: "No matter what I do, <b>Les Orchard has done it first.</b>"</li>      <li>Heehee.  Funny, I've never had that said about me before :)  I always feel like I'm behind.</li>      <li>But, Arboretum as "emacs of outliners" is a boast / pipedream.  The current state of affairs is not quite that.  At present, it's more like My First Cocoa Program [tm]</li>      <li>Actually, I think a Python/Tk (or maybe some other GUI toolkit, say <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/WxWindows?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">WxWindows</font></span>?) would have a better chance at making it to being a cross-platform "emacs of outliners".</li>      </ul>   <li>4/4/02; 7:51:13 PM by LMO</li>      <ul>      <li>Been sick.  Have to recover.  Too many exciting things happening.</li>      <li>Many many things I want to pick up and run with.</li>         <ul>         <li>Instant Outlining</li>            <ul>            <li>Arboretum needs to do it.</li>            <li>I want diff for outlines.</li>            <li>It'd also be neat to do some mining to conserve my attention span.</li>               <ul>               <li>Has someone mentioned my name (or a given pattern) again since the last time I read their outline?  Maybe <b>bold</b> and <i>italicize</i> my buddy's name to tell me that I'm really interested in what they just posted.</li>               <li>In IRC, using X-Chat, the name of a channel I'm in turns blue on changes, and turns red on changes <b>and</b> a mention of my nickname.</li>               </ul>            <li>I want to write some CGIs that produce <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML">OPML</a>.</li>               <ul>               <li>Link them live into my I/O, or allow others to subscribe to them.</li>               <li>Will they bolden on subscribers' lists iff they change?</li>               </ul>            </ul>         <li>Arboretum</li>            <ul>            <li>It's been a little while, but I have been working on an outliner.</li>            <li>This seems even more important now.</li>            </ul>         <li>Radio</li>            <ul>            <li>I really like <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PipeFilters">PipeFilters</a>.  Need to finish it, at least on the web preferences side of things.  Do you like <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PipeFilters">PipeFilters</a>?</li>            <li>I want IMAP support in Radio <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand">UserLand</a> so I can use it as an email client, and possibly to <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MailToRSS">MailToRSS</a> within Radio.</li>            </ul>         <li>Jabber</li>            <ul>            <li>Firewall traversing RPC is dead sexy.</li>            </ul>         <li>Wiki</li>            <ul>            <li>Why do I like wiki?</li>               <ul>               <li>An interface which steps out of one's way is a productive interface</li>               <li>Dead simple markup for humans</li>               <li>Dead simple collaboration &amp; versioning</li>               <li>Dead simple, almost automated document structure</li>               </ul>            <li>...and Cocoon</li>               <ul>               <li>Seems like a natural.  Transform from human-oriented markup shorthand to an intermediate XML format and run from there with the transformations.</li>               </ul>            <li>...and Python</li>               <ul>               <li>MoinMoin seems to have a bit of a primitive pipeline going on with formatter classes.</li>               </ul>            <li>...and <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/DocBook?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">DocBook</font></span></li>               <ul>               <li>We want to collaborate on book authoring at work.</li>               </ul>            <li>... and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML">OPML</a></li>               <ul>               <li>Maybe along with Cocoon, make <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML">OPML</a> one of the serializations, with hierarchy determined by a sections/headings analgous to HTML's H1-H4 and <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/DocBook?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">DocBook</font></span>'s sect1-sect4</li>               </ul>            </ul>         </ul>      </ul>   </ul>
