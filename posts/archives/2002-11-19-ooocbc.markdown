Just fixed the download links on these projects:  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RssDisplay">RssDisplay</a>, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShowReferers">ShowReferers</a>, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/GoogleToRSS">GoogleToRSS</a>.  Just took me awhile to circle back around to it, ugh.  So if you were ever interested in those projects, please try grabbing them again for ridicule.  :)
