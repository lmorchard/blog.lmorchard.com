title: FeedBurner feeds give heartburn to PHP XML parsers?
wordpress_id: 805
wordpress_slug: feedburner-feeds-give-heartburn-to-php-xml-parsers
wordpress_url: http://decafbad.com/blog/?p=805

**Final Update**: *Actually, it turns out that feeding raw, uncompressed gzip streams to PHP XML parsers causes heartburn.  Go figure.  [I guess that teaches me to poke the lazyweb with a stick.][poke]*

[poke]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/19/sometimes-the-lazyweb-delivers-with-a-deluge

I'm trying to chase this bug down, but is it just me or do FeedBurner feeds give trouble to PHP XML parsers? (*No, it's just me.*)  These three scripts <strike>break</strike> *do not break*:

* FeedBurner feed - <http://feeds.feedburner.com/AVc>
* JSON via Magpie parsing — <http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/www-bin/as-json.php?in=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.feedburner.com%2FAVc>
* Passthough with SAX parsing — <http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/www-bin/passthru-sax.php?in=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.feedburner.com%2FAVc>
* Passthough with DOM parsing — <http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/www-bin/passthru-dom.php?in=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.feedburner.com%2FAVc>

I'm willing to blame my own ineptitude, except that the error in MagpieRSS parsing happens in the bowels of that beast, right where the XML parsing happens... and that's not *my* code.

*Update*:  Actually, I think it's a different problem, but just one that FeedBurner feeds all happen to trigger.  Maybe something to do with the initial tag separated from the XML declaration by some whitespace?

*Update:* By the by, I don't *really* think MagpieRSS is a beast.  Although, I do feel like I'm in the belly of one when I'm wandering through PHP code in general.  And the "not my code" bit is mostly me trying to figure out what's breaking where and why—since Magpie works in other cases except where I'm abusing it.  More like *head-scratching* italics, not *finger-pointing* italics.  Seems like my code's breaking it, but it's not breaking *in my code*.

For what little it's worth, it works for me in Gregarius (which is some 0.7x MagpieRSS, though I'm not sure quite which).</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>there are 2 different PHP XML parsers (expat based and libxml based) depending on which version of PHP you're using, and a number of minor inconsistencies in the various implementations between versions using the same parser.  without knowing which PHP its impossible to speculate. </p>

<p>though Phil's suggestion seems like a good place to start.</p>

            <div class="content"><p>Would you mind giving me more details as to what you think is giving the parser fits? I'm pretty sure the XML we send down is valid, but we've had to put workarounds in place for other user-agents. Right now, the only thing we have special for Magpie RSS is that we don't serve Atom to that user-agent if the version is 0.5.</p>

<p>If there's something we can fix on our side that would reduce breakage, I'm all for it.</p>

            <div class="content"><p>I probably should have done some more digging before posting, but I just ran into this problem and figured I'd throw up a flag hoping someone on the lazyweb knew just what the problem is.</p>

<p>I'm going to be poking into it more as I have time, though at the moment I don't even know enough to say for sure that FeedBurner's the culprit--just that every FeedBurner-processed feed triggers my bug.  Since no one else seems to know what the issue is right off the bat, my current thought is that it's something I've fumbled.  :)</p></div>
