Yay!  Today <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner">DaveWiner</a> gave a shout out for this: <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi">RFC: <span style='background : ;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/MetaWeblog?topicparent=."><b>?</b></a><font color="">MetaWeblog</font></span> API</a>.  It's exactly, precisely, what I wanted.  Not perfect, but allowing arbitrary metadata, with a preference toward <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> attributes,  is pretty much what I wanted.  It's basically what I was going to try to do in a hackish workaround way with in-blog-entry directives processed by a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster">WeblogMulticaster</a>.
<br /><br />
Oh, and in other news, there's a quick and dirty implementation of the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilterService">XmlRpcFilterService</a> for Win32 in the wiki now.  More work to do...
<br /><br />
(Oh again, the content of this entry is a test of the pipeline hardcoded into the Win32 service.  Not perfect yet, but getting interesting at least.)
