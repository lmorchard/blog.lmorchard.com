 <p>After reading <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/05/indiekarma-micropayments">Kottke's post</a> about <a href="http://www.indiekarma.com/">indieKarma</a>, I've signed up and dropped the code into my blog template in a crass and bald-faced move to monetize my blog.  We'll see what happens - and let me know if the thing becomes too annoying or whatnot.  It seems like an interesting concept.</p>
 <p>Just thinking further about this thing - it would be neat if they could eventually include some further features to exploit the cross-blog placement of that JS include.  Maybe some metrics and reporting in general, maybe some more blog-shiny whizbangs, maybe a small indicator of how many other indieKarma-capable visitors hit the site in the last 5 minutes.</p>

            <div class="content"><p>I like it.</p>

<p>Except that, from the reader's end of things, the fact that I'll automatically drop 1Â¢ on a participating weblog the moment I visit for the first time, regardless of what I think of it, is a bit troubling. I'd be pretty miffed if I unknowingly followed a link to, say, a far-right racist weblog and therefore provided them with financial support, however tiny the amount.</p>

<p>Just my two cents. Or one cent, in this case.</p></div>
