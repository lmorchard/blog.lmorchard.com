title: LiveJournal for K-Logs?!

<p>Here's a crazy idea I'm considering:  Deploy the <a href="http://cvs.livejournal.org">LiveJournal source</a> as our company-wide k-logging service.  Definitely make some cosmetic tweaks, possibly make some backend tweaks, but it might just be crazy enough to work.  This just struck me today, remembering back when <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000148.phtml">I'd last thought about this</a>.</p>
<p>LiveJournal can support a for each employee.  It has communities, which I can use for projects or special topics, or other forms of narrative pooling.  It has the concept of friends and friends pages, or in other words: subscriptions and aggregators.  There are friends groups, which we could use as aggregator feed groups.  And the laziness threshold is demonstratedly low, seeing the ease and frequency with which 14-year-old spew trash around their journals.  :)</p>
<p>And I'm thinking that any things missing from the LJ source I might want will be easier to add in than to build the whole thing up from scratch.  And it's completely Open Source and free, though I might be able to convince some donated funds out of this place if the experiment is successful.  Hell, if not, I'd consider grabbing a permanent account the next time they offer them.</p>
<p>Hmm.  I still, someday, would like to see a decentrallized, server-less desktop answer to LJ, but this might work for now.  Radio + Frontier might get there someday, but the idea of K-Logs has such tenuous support in my organization that any cost whatsoever would kill it.  </p>
<p>Must play with this idea.  Must insinuate it like I did with the wiki.  It was accepted and made policy almost before anyone knew what hit them.  That was fun. :)<br />
