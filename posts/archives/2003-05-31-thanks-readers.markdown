Oh, and I've been meaning to post a little note of thanks to everyone
who're still reading this blog.  I haven't done or said much of note
around these parts in some time, with the only saving grace being my
automated <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger">BookmarkBlogger</a> posting every night.  More than I expected,
those posts have actually caught the interest of a few people.
<br /><br />
But I never wanted this
place to turn into just another link-blog.  And I also have been feeling
a bit guilty that my Quick Links give no indication of source where
I found these tidbits.  They are, more often than not, gleaned from
the 320 or so sites whose <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feeds I slurp down 12 or so times a day.
I really need to get some sort of blog roll going again, but somehow I
doubt that everyone wants to download my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feed list when they visit
here.
<br /><br />
Anyway, that's all.  Thanks for reading and sticking around as I get
things sorted and stitched back together in the offline world.  I hope
to come back with some nifty things soon, since I'm itching to hack.
