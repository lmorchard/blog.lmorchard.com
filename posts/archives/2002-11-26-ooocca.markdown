In the other corner, we have the document format taking over the syndication format!  <strong>FIGHT!</strong>

Yeah, yeah, it's not quite <em>that</em> simple - but the opposed directions are interesting.

            <div class="content">Well, presenting this as a "fight" was more or less me trying to be silly.  I don't really expect a fight over it - er, well, yes I do, but then the contestants in that fight will be silly anyway.

It's just very interesting to watch things go in both directions.  In the end, hopefully, either or both ways end up being so simple that it's just a bare hiccup to support in aggregators.

(Though I *do* worry about too many divergent standards.)</div>

shows what you can do via XSLT with an RSS based site.  It's an XML based site, that displays formatted HTML in a browser.  This is cool, since the site is now more accessible - both to those who prefer RSS aggregation, and to those who prefer a 'normal' browser</div>
