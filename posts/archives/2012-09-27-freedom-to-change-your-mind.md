I posted a few days ago about [freedom of and from choice][1], but I think there&#8217;s something [orthogonal][2] to that spectrum: The freedom to change your mind, both figuratively and literally.

<!--more-->

## <span id="Fractal_of_choice">Fractal of choice</span>

To sum up what I [wrote][1] earlier, there&#8217;s a spectrum of what choices you make and what choices you leave up to someone else:

*   You might choose to [live entirely within the Apple ecosystem][3], relying on expert designers to provide elegant and beautiful experiences.
*   You might decide to [buy a PC laptop with Ubuntu pre-installed][4] and embrace the gritty world of open source software.
*   You might build a PC desktop from parts [ordered ala carte][5]—maybe even compile your OS and all applications from source, [Gentoo][6] or [FreeBSD][7] style. 
*   You might decide to construct [an 8-bit CPU out of ICs and a big mess of wires][8], and cobble together [your own port of Microsoft BASIC][9].
*   You could gather piles of various exotic materials and bake your own semiconductors and ICs at home—[but really, who does that][10]?

There are many choices to make, and it&#8217;s even your choice to decide at which fractal level of complexity you&#8217;re most comfortable. So far, so good.

## <span id="Changing_your_mind">Changing your mind</span>

But, what about after you&#8217;ve made your choices about choices—can you change your mind later?

*   Can you take your tools with you to a new ecosystem? 
*   If you can&#8217;t take them with, can you find alternatives?
*   Are your thoughts and work expressed in ways that leave you free to change tools?
*   Can you take possession of the thoughts you&#8217;ve poured into a tool or service?
*   What happens when your relied-upon experts go out of business?
*   Or, better yet, [what happens when they cash out to Google or Facebook or Yahoo][11]?
*   Do you own the device in your hand? Or, have you just gotten a limited license to use it?

And, this is probably overly clever, but when I write &#8220;change your mind&#8221; I mean both:

1.  reconsidering your decisions and
2.  *altering your cognitive system*. 

Because, as I&#8217;ve written before, these things are [cognitive prosthetics][12]—they&#8217;re a part of your thinking apparatus. Again, it goes back to how much time you&#8217;re willing to devote to [sharpening your saw][13] with intentional use of technology.

Personally, I resist the notion of allowing parts of my extended mind to be controlled more by third-party experts than me. Even if I choose *for now* to leave myself in their hands, I want clearly marked exits and an escape plan.

## <span id="Intersection_of_axes">Intersection of axes</span>

So, if freedom {of,from} choice and freedom to change my mind are [orthogonal][2], what does that look like? (Maybe I&#8217;ll come back to this post with a drawing.)

I would think that a high degree of freedom of choice would leave you quite free to change your mind later. But, I could imagine reworking that [Big Mess &#8216;o Wires][14] would be a huge pain. So, I probably wouldn&#8217;t use a [BMOW][14] as my daily workstation.

On the other hand, some of the best designed systems [are trending][15] toward [hoods welded shut][16]. Shouldn&#8217;t it be possible to start from a product of expert design (an iPhone, for instance), only later to pop the cover off (literally or virtually) and do your own thing? There are jailbreaks—but why are you in a jail? And, doesn&#8217;t it seem like they&#8217;d make it airtight if they could?

Is it just that [app pirates are ruining it for the rest of us][17]? I mean, it&#8217;s mighty convenient to have your customers [locked in the trunk][18]: It&#8217;s harder for them to hurt themselves or the upholstery, and they can&#8217;t easily wander off if you make some turns they don&#8217;t like. But, that&#8217;s tinfoil-hat territory, and I could rant all day.

Android seems to be doing well, and it&#8217;s *mostly* open. I&#8217;ve switched device vendors a few times, and all my apps have survived the changes. I&#8217;ve flashed my own choice of firmware on a few of my phones, and have been pleased. I have a sense of deeper choices available, should I ever want to chase after them.

Palm&#8217;s webOS devices were *crazy* open—not open source per se, but [you could unlock root with the Konami code][19] and [apply patches to core applications][20]. Alas, webOS crashed and burned at HP. My hunch is that [being open isn&#8217;t what did them in][21], though.

<a target="_blank" title="Mozilla" href="https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn">Mozilla</a> (disclaimer: my employer) is headed into that webOS territory with [FirefoxOS][22]. In that currently-coalescing ecosystem, the [apps come from the open web][23], aren&#8217;t gate-kept by a single <a target="_blank" title="marketplace" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/Marketplace?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn">marketplace</a>, and can even run on non-FirefoxOS devices. I suspect it won&#8217;t be as slick an ecosystem as Apple&#8217;s, [because the loosely-coupled gates will let in more dirt][24]. But, it will be high on the freedom-to-change axis, and the quality of freedom-from-choice options will limited only by the talent of the designers involved.

## <span id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span>

So, I didn&#8217;t *really* mean to write an advertisement for [FirefoxOS][22]—I work for <a target="_blank" title="Mozilla" href="https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn">Mozilla</a> because I love the mission, I&#8217;m not trying to shill. Really, I just think it&#8217;s very important to have a sense of your choices and freedoms when you accept technology into your life. And, of course, I have some very strong opinions, but this post and the one before it are intended as more about choice in general than my own choices or angst. If you&#8217;re happy with your choices, even upon close examination, then that&#8217;s great—just keep your wits about you.
