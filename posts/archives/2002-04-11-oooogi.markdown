<p>I feel like I'm discovering <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI">SSI</a> again, as if for the first time.  I'm using it around here to piece together a few pages with dynamic elements, among other things.  Seems like all I need most times for this, as opposed to a more general web app framework or <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/CMS">CMS</a>.  I'm sure eventually I'll get tired of it after having run into all the problems everyone else in the world has, and roll my own <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/CMS">CMS</a> again.  Maybe this time I'll stop before I get to that point and adopt someone else's before I get down to wheel re-invention work.  :)  But it's <em>so</em> fun.<br />
Anyway, my latest tinkering with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI">SSI</a> can be seen on the right side of 0xDECAFBAD's front page:  Sibling blogs. <br />
 <br />
So far, I've got my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> blog over there, along with my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand">RadioUserLand</a> weblog.  Maybe in listing a few headlines over there, I can entice a few readers to my other spaces.  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> is where I do most of my general blogging, link posting, and general grousing.  (I think that's my new favorite word)  The <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand">RadioUserLand</a> weblog is just an experiment at this point, but it may eventually consume the whole site.</p>
<p>Basically, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand">RadioUserLand</a> is competing with server-side CGIs and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI">SSI</a>s at this point.  Eventually, they will cooperate.  After that, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand">RadioUserLand</a> may take over.</p>
<p>Anyway, enjoy <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RssDisplay">RssDisplay</a> if you like-- you can either download it, or <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PipelineTheWeb">PipelineTheWeb</a> and use it straight from my site.</p>
