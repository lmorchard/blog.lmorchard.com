<p><a href="http://otlml.org/faq/">OTLML</a> makes me think that I need to play more deeply with XML.  I need to learn XSL, how to use Xpointers, I really have to spend more time with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a>, and I need to work with SOAP more.</p>
<p>I think I see the difference between things like <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> 0.92 and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> 1.0, and between <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML">OPML</a> and OTLML, now.  Not quite sure if I can explain it precisely enough yet, but I have a slight groking of it.  The upshot of it is that I really need to throw myself toward the side of latter in both cases.</p>
<p>Back to work.</p>
