<p>Well, I haven't gotten around to writing the proxy yet, so <i>you</i> can beat <i>me</i> to <i>that</i> still. :)  I've had a metric ton of good and sometimes new ideas throughout my relatively short life, but I have a habit of not getting very many of them done.  <i>That's</i> where it counts, not necessarily in the novelty of the idea.</p>
<p>I mean...  just look at Microsoft.</p>

            <div class="content">Oops.  I would have responded sooner but somehow I missed this post.  Forgive me, I was in a mood.

Here's an update: I've written a small proxy server or two in Perl for debugging, but I'd rather use someone else's proxy code.  If this thing works, I'd use it full-time, so best to start with something that's production-ready.  I played with Squid thinking I could use a redirector but that only seems to modify requests, not responses.  Apparently what I want is a "reverse proxy," which they're still working on.

So now I'm thinking either Apache with mod_proxy and mod_perl or a personal proxy server like  Muffin.

If anyone has thoughts, I'd like to hear them.  I'm gonna write this code eventually, I swear :-)</div>
