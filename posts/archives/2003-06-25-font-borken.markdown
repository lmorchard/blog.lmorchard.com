title: Why is my Monaco Borken?

Okay, what's wrong with this picture?
<br /><br />
<div align="center"><img src="http://www.decafbad.com/blog-images/font-issues.gif" /></div>
<br /><br />
Each of those lines is from a terminal I have open, trying to find
one of my monospace fonts that works correctly and I don't hate.  My
past favorite has been Monaco for the longest time, but recently (when,
I can't quite remember) it seems that it likes to combine "l" and "/"
into one symbol.  So does Courier.  
<br /><br />
On the other hand, I have this font
called Monaco CY which looks close enough to my favorite Monaco, until I 
discover that it mashes double dashes together.
<br /><br />
This leaves me with only two monospace fonts on my <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/PowerBook?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">PowerBook</font></span> that don't
mangle things (however minor) in the terminal. They are Courier New and
Andale Mono, both of which I very much dislike.
<br /><br />
So, though I've found <a href="http://www.dsandler.org/entry.php?1004" target="_top">one other person</a> 
complain a bit about this, I can't seem to find any explanations why.  Best
I can figure is that I had to dump a slew of fonts onto my system recently
in order to be able to do some client work, so maybe I clobbered an out-of-box
version of my previously favored Monaco.  But that doesn't make much sense, since
I tried snagging a copy of Monaco from my girlfriend's iBook to no avail.
<br /><br />
Anyone out there have a clue as to what this is?

            </div>
            <div class="content">This exact thing happened to me, and I tracked it down to a particular version/copy of Monaco that was behaving badly.

I don't remember if I had done this myself or if some errant installer had foisted this upon me, but I had Monaco 3.5 from Mac OS 9.2.2 installed in my account's font folder (~/Library/Fonts), and it was overriding all other copies of Monaco on the system, even Monaco 4.0d3, which was in /System/Library/Fonts/Monaco.dfont.

I removed that "bad" copy of Monaco 3.5 from my account's Fonts folder, and then quit and re-launched the apps that had been using it, and that cleared everything up.

BTW, in the process of figuring this out, I went and got Apple's free OS X font tools from here:
http://developer.apple.com/fonts/OSXTools.html (here's hoping that URL doesn't get stripped by the comments system)

...and then used "ftxinstalledfonts -rlf" to see what all fonts and versions I had installed on my system, and what their precendence was.

Hope this helps,
