<p>Is it just me, or is it mildly frightening that a <a href="http://chello.sourceforge.net/index.shtml">Hello World</a> app in <i>any</i> language or on any platform would call for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=34620">73 commits, 43 adds in CVS</a>?</p>
<p>Yes.  It is frightening.  But...  <a href="http://chello.sourceforge.net/features.html">look at all the features</a>!</p>
<p>(To be fair, yes I know that "hello world" is not the point.  It's still funny.)</p>
<p>On with further Cocoon newbee wandering...</p>
