Not only that, but you added a scroller to my news aggregator page, too!  :)  Gah.
While not as dramatic as
<a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/2003/06/12.html">Platypus Day</a>, it does
have me adding an item to my TODO list to
<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/12/how_to_consume_rss_safely.html">more safely consume <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a></a> in my aggregator.  I feel like I'm tooling around the blogosphere
with my pants off.
<br /><br />
And, it makes me want to get back to working on <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AgentFrank">AgentFrank</a>, so I can insert some
filters to block <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> code that hijacks my status bar.  Bah.  No offense,
since the message itself is worth attention, but scrollers are so...  1998.
<br /><br />
<b>Update:</b> And, John Robb 
<a href="http://jrobb.userland.com/2003/07/05.html#a3323">has removed</a> 
the scroller.  Thanks!  I still need to look into securing my aggregator
though.  Whether I like status bar scroller or not, my news aggregator
should keep them out anyway.
