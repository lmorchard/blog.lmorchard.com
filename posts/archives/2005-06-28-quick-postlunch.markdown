* [iTunes podcasting support][it]... I want it all, and I want it now, because it has *so* much potential in and of itself, and *so* much potential for driving podcast tuner UI into the future.  

  The subscriptions are listed alphabetically?  Come on, let me sort them in last-updated order.  And what, no OPML import / export?  

  Not many podcast-related additions to the AppleScript scripting dictionary for iTunes.  I see a `subscribe` method, but I was hoping I could at least hack in some support for subscription list import / export.  Not having access to the subscription list puts a crimp in that. 

  **Update:** Hooray for [people who know what they're talking about][itapp].  Turns out there are a few more additions to iTunes' AppleScript support I missed, but I'm still not finding my way down to accessing the list of podcast subscriptions.

  **Update 2:** Looks like someone's already worked on the *import* side of things: [OPML2iTunes : AppleScript to import OPML podcast subscriptions into iTunes](http://log.hugoschotman.com/hugo/2005/06/opml2itunes_app.html)

* And in the Bizzarro-Verse, [Microsoft is more community-oriented than Apple when it comes to RSS extension creation][biz].  Pretty odd.  I can see a few spots where the iTunes tags are defensible, but couldn't most or all of these have been established [using Dublin Core or other prior work][suk]?

* Bummer.  It seems like the [new podcasting support in iTunes][it] doesn't use `Syndication.framework`, or at least the feeds subscribed in iTunes don't show up in the Sources table in [the database I was snooping around in][sdb].

  And here I was hoping for Tiger to have already quietly included a shared syndication feed architecture similar to [what's proposed for Longhorn][arch]. 

  Otherwise, podcasting in iTunes seems interesting so far.  *Now, if it used BitTorrent out of the box...*

* Can I just say I hate the new binary plists in OS X Tiger?  I got so used to futzing with them using `vim` and shell-side friends that it's jarring to get a face full of garbage now when I poke at them.

  And yeah, I know about `/usr/bin/plutil`--but, yuck.
