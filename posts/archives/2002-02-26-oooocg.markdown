Brief server outage, swift support response from my friendly local host:<blockquote><i>It is always something with that wretched httpd. Afew days ago it was a php exploit, preventing the restart of apache, and now this. All the pids which run under httpd must be killed, in order for a restart to take effect. This does not happen automatically, so I must kill them all, manually and with extreme vengence.</i></blockquote>
