<p>Speaking of <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlogWalking">BlogWalking</a> and <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/MoBlogging?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">MoBlogging</font></span>, I just noticed via following a referring link that Matt Croydon has thrown together and released a proof-of-concept <a href="http://postneo.com/2002/12/09.html#a1381">WAP-based blog client app</a>.  Swanky.  Check it out.</p>
<p>I want to do the same thing, but using kinder-gentler-HTML templates for my Treo.  My previous phone, a Touchpoint, supported WAP and thus WAP interested me for a year or so and I have a few private hacks laying around (ie. controlling X10-enabled house lights from my phone, trying to set up recording times on my half-working Linux PVR).  But, being a fickle geek, WAP no longer interests me since my current phone supports richer things.</p>
