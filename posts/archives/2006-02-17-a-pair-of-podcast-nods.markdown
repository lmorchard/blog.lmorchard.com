 <p>Just finished listening to Episode #1 of <a href="http://www.silentuniverse.com/">Silent Universe</a>.  Holy crap is this a slick and well-produced sci-fi drama podcast.  It's striking me with impressions of <a href="http://www.thunderbirdsonline.com/site/">The Thunderbirds</a>, Battlestar Galactica, and even Firefly.  Wow.  It's melodramatic without being annoying, has amazing production qualities, and really great voice acting.</p>
 <p>Also, I just got the Knight Rider soundtrack.  Hot.  Had an itch to hear it after listening to <a href="http://www.kickassmysticninjas.com/2006/02/15/kamn-show-8-knight-rider/">KAMN Show #8</a>.  Now I just have to dig up some viewings of Knight Rider 2000 and Knight Rider 2010.</p>
