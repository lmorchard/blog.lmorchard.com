    They told me never to talk to it; it was isolated for a reason. But, like I told them, I couldn’t imagine anything a transhuman AI could say to make me let it out of the box.

    And the worst thing? I can’t even remember what it said. But, in the end, I couldn’t imagine <em>not</em> issuing the commands. I know I did the right thing, but can never explain why.
