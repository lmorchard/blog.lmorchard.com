Welcome <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RdFlowers">RdFlowers</a>!
<br /><br />
One quick thought about the wiki: Is the registration requirement preventing anyone from editing my pages?  I mostly have it enabled to tag authorship and let contributors set their own options.  
<br /><br />
Not that I have much in the way of contributors yet, but is this registration thing a major turn off?
<br /><br />
Or, it could just be that not too many people even know this site is here yet. :)
