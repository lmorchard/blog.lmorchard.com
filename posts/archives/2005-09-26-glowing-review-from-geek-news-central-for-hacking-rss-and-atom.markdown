Hacking RSS and Atom has gotten [an absolutely glowing and enthusiastic recommendation from Todd Cochrane of Geek News Central](http://www.geeknewscentral.com/archives/004907.html)!  I was flipping through a few pent-up podcasts I had laying around before purging the backlog, and found this mention at the tail-end of GNC #101.

Not only did he call my book "totally, totally amazing," but he also called me a gentleman.  Thank you very much, Todd!  And with this sort of glowing review, I'd feel remiss without mentioning that [Todd's book <i>Podcasting</i>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597787/0xdecafbad01-20) is mighty fine as well.

**Update:** Holy crap--looks like Todd liked my book well enough to toss a panel into his sidebar to buy it from Amazon!

            <div class="content"><p>I was browsing through the downtown Seattle Barnes &amp; Noble when I ran across this book. Looked at the title and thought, 'hey, I remember a Les Orchard from Magnet Detroit." Sure enough it was you.</p>

<p>Great book, well written...wish I was more of a hands-on code jockey and I'd probably get a lot more out of it. As it is, I have to stick with XHTML and CSS and work my way up from there. :)</p>

<p>Nice job. Take care.</p>
