So, it's been almost a month since my last post here.  I didn't mean to go directly into radio silence, but I'm almost ready to deliver on that first article [I'd promised][lastpost].  I think I may have overdone it a bit, since I was shooting for 2500 words and have landed somewhere around 7000 words.  For the first time ever, I've been going over a first draft hardcopy of something destined for my blog with a pen, and am asking [my girlfriend][missadroit] to help me out with some proofreading and editing.  Once we've gotten this thing in some semblance of presentability, I'll let you all decide whether its worth the verbosity.

Until then, I leave you with this bit of 0xDECAFBAD zen courtesy of [one of my old pals][stingthebee]:

(Which reminds me, I think I need to get to rotating those images over there soon.)
