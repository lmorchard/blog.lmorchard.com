<p>So, I finally got my iBook into and out of the shop, and I'm back on the reinstallation road to recovery.  Not only that, but I got a little bit extra - seems that since my model of iBook is no longer available, the repair tech found that he was required to replace my dying 9GB hard drive with a quieter 15GB drive.  Not a gigantic improvement, but it ends up being just enough to be nifty and was free to boot.  Also, I splurged a little bit before starting Christmas shopping, and replaced the 256MB of RAM with a 512MB module.  The improvement from 384MB to 640MB under <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOSX">MacOSX</a> was much more marked than I'd anticipated.  I don't know what kept me so long.</p>
<p>So, my desires for a new iBook or a glitzy <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/TiBook?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">TiBook</font></span> are dampened for now, and my pocket book thanks me.  And, if/when I decide to toss this thing up onto eBay, the extras couldn't hurt the value.  Also, I imagine that my expectations of OS X will have set me up for amazement once I get to play with a machine that supports Quartz Extreme and has a more decent processor speed.</p>
