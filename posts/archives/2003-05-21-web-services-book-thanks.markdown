A copy of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pwebserperl/">Programming Web Services with Perl</a>
surprised me yesterday by arriving on my doorstep.  I'd forgotten that back in March,
<a href="http://www.kulchenko.com/">Paul Kulchenko</a>
(<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/catalog/view/au/208">one author</a>
of the book's two) had offered me a free copy of it response to
<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/web_service_pipelines.html" target="_top">a quick thought of mine</a> about
a more Unix-like model for filtering web services (something I want to get back to).
<br /><br />
Anyway, I've yet to get very much into the book, but a cursory skim tells me
that this looks like a great book.  Thank you very much for sending me a copy, Paul!
