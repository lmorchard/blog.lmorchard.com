<p>Ziv Caspi of <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106548/">Y. B. Normal</a> thinks that "<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106548/2002/06/13.html#a25">Aggregators should bring more, not less, information</a>", and I'm inclined to agree.  Also, Adam <a href="http://ipwebdev.com/radio/2002/06/11.php#a193">wants to take the aggregator</a> even further: "...I think the entire computer interface should be overhauled to be more aggregator like, events streaming by."</p>
<p>Along these lines, has anyone played with <a href="http://www.scopeware.com/products/prod_overview.html">Scopeware</a>, built from the research of <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_cluture/bios/gelernter.html">David Gelernter</a>?    I think it used to be called "<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigchi/chi96/proceedings/videos/Fertig/etf.htm">Lifestreams</a>" before it was made into a product.  I first heard of this work back when I read <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/046504316X/0xdecafbad-20">Machine Beauty : Elegance and the Heart of Technology</a>, and was very interested but haven't seen anything other than screenshots and mock-ups.  From what I can tell, this interface is literally "events [and documents] streaming by".</p>
<p>The little I've picked up from Gelernter's work, along with a few other influences (ie. David Brin's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055329024X/0xdecafbad-20">Earth</a>), has really stuck the picture in my head of how I want my future info-sieve to work.  </p>
<p>Along with all of this, something else I was vaguely considering adding to my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000187.phtml#000187">AmphetaDesk outliner skin</a> was an IFRAME attached to <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> items under a collapsed node.  When the node gets expanded, the IFRAME is loaded up with the item's link.  The notion is that you do all your browsing from your <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feeds in a single window and within the same context.  Neat idea, I think, giving a hook to pull more information into the aggregator upon request.  But of course if I do it, it'll likely be messy as hell for a zillion obvious reasons and catch my iBook on fire.</p>
<p>Probably have more to ramble on about this later, but it's time for the first meeting of the day...</p>
