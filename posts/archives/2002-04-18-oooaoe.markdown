<p>Now this is pretty cool (via <a href="http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/z2002-04-17-a">Bill Seitz</a>):  <a href="http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/linkback.html">Disenchanted has referral-based automatic backlinks</a>.  Funny thing is, since I started using the little <a href="http://www.sitemeter.com">SiteMeter</a> web bug, I've been refreshing the referrals fun.  But, constructing the referral report right in the entry is another sort of <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki">WeblogWithWiki</a>-esque feature I hadn't even thought about.  Now if only I had access to my access_log here.  Maybe I'll be checking out another host soon.  There's got to be a way to make this work with Movable Type and / or Radio <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand">UserLand</a>.</p>
