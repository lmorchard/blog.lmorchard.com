## What's this page?

In the ancient past and still today, UNIX users have made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.plan"><code>.plan</code> files available via the `finger` protocol</a>.  This page is my attempt to provide something with similar intentions, mashed up with [Instant Outlining](http://radio.outliners.com/beta), presented by way of [Dan MacTough's OPMLRenderer plugin for WordPress](http://www.yabfog.com/wp/opml-renderer/).

If you're using the [OPML Editor](http://support.opml.org), you can [subscribe](http://127.0.0.1:5337/outlinerSubscribe?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhosting.opml.org%2Fdecafbad%2FinstantOutliner%2Fl.m.orchard.opml&author=l.m.orchard) to [this outline](http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/instantOutliner/l.m.orchard.opml).
