When I got up this morning, this was my sad state of affairs:

But, I'm back at the office now, albeit at reduced capacity for zooming around - unless said zooming may be done on crutches.  And, let me tell you, zooming around on crutches is both hazardous and exhausting in an office environment.  Also?  I want my hands back.  It's hard to carry hot coffee or oatmeal with no hands.

I haven't been posting much around here, thanks to various moments in a drugged up haze or just plain wallowing in [convalescent marathon WoW sessions](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/06/world-of-warcraft-is-my-world-of-warcraft).  The only real productive work I've gotten done was for [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us).  Over the past few weeks, I just haven't felt like doing much or hacking anything at all.  However, I am pretty sad that I missed Yahoo! Hack Day.

On the bright side, I'm planning to be propped up in a corner at least for the [del.icio.us birthday bash](http://upcoming.org/event/109550/).  Come sign [the cast](http://flickr.com/photos/missadroit/251064139/), or plaster me with a sticker while I'm too immobile to do much about it.
