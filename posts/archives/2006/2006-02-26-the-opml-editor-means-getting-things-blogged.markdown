 <p>Lisa Williams points to <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/thisislisa/2006/02/26#offlineEditorsAreFromMarsTheOpmlEditorIsFromVenus">OPML blogging bewilderment</a> from authors of a desktop blogging client, <a href="http://qumana.com/">Qumana</a>.  <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2006/02/12#lightningFastBloggingWithTheOpmlEditor">I compared the OPML Editor to a cavitating torpedo.</a>  It's just fast and uncomplicated - it's light on formatting features, but that itself is a feature.  I type, and save, and I'm published.  I could post 60 entries in a minute, maybe more.  (I type pretty fast, think faster.)  When I open the day's outline, I'm not Faced with the Task of Composing a Document, I'm faced with a structure based on luring atomic thoughts out of my head.  Ready, fire, aim.  That's the blogging style here.</p>
 <p>I come back here later; I can post another entry; move it around; expand on an idea; restructure atomic ideas into a molecule of a larger entry.  The day's context and history remain splayed out for my perusal.  The day is a fine unit of continuity for a run of thought.  Further on through the course of thought, I can move into a richer tool if I feel I've got enough from which to Compose a Document - but until then, at least I haven't wedged the mechanisms.  I've gotten it out of my head.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gtd" title="GTD rests on the principle that you have to get things out of your head and recorded into a system you can trust.">Getting Things Done, blogger style</a>.</p>
 <p>Since I started playing with this tool for blogging, I'll bet that I've gotten more out of my head and onto the web in just over two weeks than I have in the past six months.  <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/03/26/oooofa">This has been a theme in my blogging for quite some time now.</a>  So, you can probably imagine why finding what looks like a solution to the problem has induced such enthusiasm in me.</p>
