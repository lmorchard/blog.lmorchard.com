Just installed [Firefox 2.0 RC 2][ff] this week, and I've got to say that it's pretty keen.  Doesn't seem like a revolution in browsers or anything, other than what it already was.  But, everything seems tighter, quicker, slicker, and more like a polished product.  My CPU usage is flatter than ever before, and it actually looks like I've got some free memory left over after running it for a few days.  And this is speaking as an infovore who regularly has a dozen or so tabs open, with a turnover of at least a hundred a day.  All the extensions I really care about still work, a few have been forced to work using [Nightly Tester Tools][ntt].  And, one that stopped working (SessionSaver) has now been rolled into the browser itself.  Swank all around.

            <div class="content"><p>No Greasemonkey, No installey.</p>

<p>It's pretty slick otherwise.  Seems spritely and a tad bit more svelt (I'm noting about 35-40% less memory hoggage.)</p>

<p>But had to revert when greasemonkey died.</p></div>
