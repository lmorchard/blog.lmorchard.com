 <p>The <a href="http://technorati.com/account/importfaves.html">import page for Technorati Favorites</a> mentions that it supports XOXO as a format along with OPML.  Cool!  <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/16/just-put-on-your-xoxo-colored-glasses">I'm a known XOXO lover.</a>  So, I tried importing <a href="http://decafbad.com/2006/02/subs-amusements.opml">my OPML "amusements" reading list</a> as an <a href="http://decafbad.com/2006/02/subs-amusements.xoxo">XOXO outline</a>.  I used the XSL transformation I mentioned a few weeks ago, tweaked to follow some ideas for <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo-brainstorming#Subscription_information">subscription markup in XOXO</a>.  Well, it looks like <a href="http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/gems/xoxo-faves.jpeg" target="_blank">it worked!</a> </p>
 <p>So, what's the moral of the story?  I can use the <a href="http://support.opml.org/">OPML Editor</a> and still use XOXO, thanks to my <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/16/just-put-on-your-xoxo-colored-glasses">stylish glasses</a>.  Although, it would be nice to have a profile, spec, or guideline as to what XOXO is expected by Technorati Favorites - XOXO is a pretty wide open microformat.  I mainly made an educated guess, followed a wiki brainstorming example, and crossed my fingers as I hit submit.</p>
