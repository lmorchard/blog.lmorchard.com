While being crazy busy, I've been thoroughly enjoying these podcasts:

* [Ancestor][anc] by Scott Sigler.

  "*On a remote island in Lake Superior, scientists struggle to solve the problem of xenotransplantation -- using animal tissue to replace failing human organs. By getting back to the root of our creation, biotech firm Genada hopes to create an animal with human internal organs. Genada's collective genius gives birth to a fast-growing evil that nature eradicated 250 million years ago -- an evil now on the loose, and very, very hungry...*"

  I've [written about Ancestor][wa] before, and I can't believe it's already over.  It's been a great ride, and if you haven't been listening, subscribe and catch up.  Scott's really continued to raise the bar on himself from EarthCore through to the end of Ancestor, and he's got a third tale coming in March.

* [I Should Be Writing][isbw] by Mur Lafferty.

  "*A podcast by a wanna-be writer for wanna-be writers. Let my stack of rejection letters and battle scars benefit you.*"
  
  Oh yeah, I should be writing.
  
* [Voices of Tomorrow][vot]

  "*The Official Podcast of www.365tomorrows.com*"
  
  These are the sorts of stories I want to write soon.  [The Bitter Kiss of the Ronin's Cup][tb] is this blog's patron story.  Well, if there can be such a thing.

* [Brave Men Run][bmr] by Matthew Wayne Selznick.

  "*What If John Hughes Wrote Comic Books? 'Brave Men Run' is the story of Nate Charters. Born different, unsure of his origins, he's an outcast at Abbeque Valley High School, a self-proclaimed "boy freak" with few friends and low self-esteem.*"

  This really is like X-Men crossed with Pretty in Pink—and it works for me.  I got the e-book, but I just can't bring myself to read it and spoil the rest of the reading.

* [The Radio Adventures of Doctor Floyd][drf] by Grant Baciocco & Doug Price.  

  "*If Jay Ward, creator of Rocky & Bullwinkle, had created Mystery Science Theater 3000 mixed in a little Time Bandits and gave it an educational spin, the result would have been...*"
  
  Short, tight, fast paced, and incredible punny radio adventures of time travelling absentminded scientists.  They're back from an end-of-year hiatus and going super strong.  In particular, check out the fight scene (*to the end!*) in the middle of [Episode #402][e402]—and wear headphones.
  
  "*Combo attack! Body blow! Body blow! Boot to the head! Trip!*"

            <div class="content"><p>Hello!</p>

<p>I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you for directing your readers to The Radio Adventures Of Dr. Floyd.  Even though you obviously forgot to mention it, I am sure you are telling people to listen because of My performances in each episode.  Though, that's just one of those "given" things.  'Humans Need Air To Live' and 'Dr. Steve Is Always Great!'</p>

<p>Anyway, keep listening and stay rotten!</p>

<p>Yours,</p>

<p>Dr. Steve
Evil Mastermind</p>

<p>P.S.  Fidgert says, "Hello!"</p></div>

<p>Many thanks,</p>
