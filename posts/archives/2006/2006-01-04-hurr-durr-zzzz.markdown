Time consumed with late work nights.  Brain replaced by cotton.  A few thoughts leaking out ear:

* `svn durr` is not, in fact, a valid invocation—no matter how many times I retry it or how much I swear.

* A caching HTTP client won't help speed up response time on two PHP pages which fetch each other via circular references.

* Seeing files updated on 1/7/2005 and wondering how the timestamps jumped into the future makes me headdesk.

* Sleep is good.

* *Durr.*
