Oh, and apropos my [serial enthusiast][se] ways, I've shacked up with a different news aggregator again.  I [was using newsRiver][nr] again, but the temporary lack of a spare server to run it on in the midst of [the move][mo] had me feedless.  So, after a brief flirtation with [Bloglines][] - which went down promptly after I started using it - I switched using [Gregarius][].  I have to say:  This is a pretty keen aggregator.  It doesn't support [reading lists][rl], but I have an itch to implement that support.  Otherwise, the feed folders work pretty much how I'd like them to work - as a [prioritized and stratified River of News][st]. I might also think about hacking [my evolving feed reader template][ma] as a drop-in theme for [Gregarius][].
