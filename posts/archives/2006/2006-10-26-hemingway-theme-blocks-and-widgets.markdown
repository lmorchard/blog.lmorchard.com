So, after reading a [comment from Brian Cors][cb] and wandering by [his site][hs] again, I've suddenly gotten more interested in the [Hemingway][hw] theme for [WordPress][wp].  One problem, though:  Although the [WordPress Widgets][ww] plugin (about which [I've raved][ir]) was based on [Hemingway][hw]'s Blocks feature, it's not apparently compatible.  So, anyone know how to make it compatible, or where I can get more Hemingway blocks?

*Update:*  Actually, Hemingway blocks look pretty easy to make, and the [inlineRSS][irss] plugin makes for easy external site integration so I can pull my output together here.  Now, if I can just get around the bugs in word-count-limited front page excerpts with Markdown.

            <div class="content"><p>You nailed it.  I use inlineRSS to suck in feed info from other sites, and place the php code into a new "block" for each section.  </p>

<p>It's pretty cool - once you add code into the "blocks" directory - then go back to your WordPress admin site, it will know that you added new code and ask you for the name of the new block.</p>

<p>Be warned - name the block as you want it the first time - from what I can tell [and confirmed by the theme author] - you can't rename it once you do so.</p>

<p>Have fun, and good luck!   There are a few special xslt files that I use - one in particular for my del.icio.us links - that I can pass along, if desired...</p></div>
