Two Firefox / MacBook Pro oddities I've discovered:  First is that Firefox's popup menus appear on the wrong monitor, when I've got a second one plugged in at work.  That includes everything from context menus to URL-bar suggestions.  I can't remember where, but I think I saw a bugzilla entry on this.  The other is that, when I want to use Ctrl-PageUp/PageDn to flip tabs, I have to rock my fingers leftward from Ctrl-to-Fn when holding down the modifiers before hitting a cursor key.  That, or manage to hit the two simultaneously.  If I rock rightward from Fn-to-Ctrl, no joy.  Weird.
