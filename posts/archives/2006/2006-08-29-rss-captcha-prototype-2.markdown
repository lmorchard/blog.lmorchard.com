I didn't really dislike Kent's original prototype - although I think [it came off that way](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/25/rss-captcha-prototype#comment-34842).  However, with a direct link there, I think there is a definite improvement.  I was also happy to see the linked blog open in a pop-up window - which is something I *usually* despise, but works for this application.  Seems like a neat way to get something CAPTCHA-like, while also promoting traffic to your friends in your blogroll!  The one bad thing would be if I were to decend too many levels deep into reading interesting things and commenting as I chase down post titles.  :)

<p>I showed it around at <a href="http://barcamp.org" rel="nofollow">BarCampStanford</a> and other places over the weekend, and talked to a <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com" rel="nofollow">Famous Blogger</a>, who swears his site is darn near botproof just because he requires people to type in his first name before posting.</p>

<p>I like the social-networking aspect enough to keep it.  If people get distracted by my blogroll, so be it ... and if the bots get smart enough to beat what I have there now, I can go back to the prototype.</p>

<p>Thanks (again) for checking it out.</p></div>
