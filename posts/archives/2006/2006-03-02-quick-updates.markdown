 <p>I've mostly been in radio silence over here, while the real action happens over on <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/">my OPML blog</a>.  Eventually, I'll iron out a better integration process - but for now, here's a mini dump:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>
     <span>The last episode of the first installment of the <a hreef="http://www.bravemenrun.com/">Brave Men Run</a> fiction podcast just landed in my iTunes tonight.  The author / narrator expresses such a great deal of appreciation for his listeners, it makes me want to run over there and give him a standing ovation.  Even if I am the only guy doing it.  I really hope there's more coming in the <a hreef="http://www.bravemenrun.com/">Brave Men Run</a> story universe!</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span><a href="http://blogs.opml.org/amyloo/2006/02/28#speakingOfMichiganPeopleSpeaking">Amyloo writes about speaking of Michigan people speaking.</a>  I should do a little podcast sometime - I don't figure I sound any different, but then I wouldn't think that would I?</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span>Of course, one thing I'd like to do this summer, maybe after the wedding, is to get some of my fiction ideas and half-starts finally fleshed out and in short story form.  Maybe I could do a podcast with some of those stories.</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span><a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/articles.php?a=2777&p=">This series of remade Choose Your Own Adventure book covers on Something Awful</a> has practically made me wet myself laughing this morning.</span>
     </li>
     </ul>
