Grr.  Last night, My PowerBook suddenly started making the oscillating, growling noise of a fan with built up crud rattling against the blades.  I'd thought it was the hard drive at first, knowing my luck, but I narrowed down the sound to the fans in the back and could make the sound go away by cutting back CPU usage.

Normally, as with all the other machines I have, I'd open the sucker up and clean that out with a q-tip or cotton ball.  However, this is still under AppleCare for another year or so, and I doubt they'd look kindly on me pawing around inside this thing yet.  But, I really don't want to part with it for most of a week, just so they can ship it to someone with a more official screwdriver and Apple-branded cotton swabs.
