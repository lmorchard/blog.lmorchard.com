If you're a tinkerer and you've never checked out the [XboxMediaCenter](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/), you really owe it to yourself to do soâ€”there's just so much potential in this project.  Did you know that it comes with a Python interpreter, and that there's a [scripting community](http://www.xbmcscripts.com/) building really cool living room apps for it?  Did you know that it bundles the [GoAhead webserver](http://www.goahead.com/products/web_server.htm) along with [Spyce Python Server Pages](http://spyce.sourceforge.net/)?  

I'd never heard of GoAhead's tiny webserver before, but Spyce looks interesting.  Overall, XBMC is surprisingly polished for an "amateur" effort, and it's certainly more [maker friendly](http://www.makezine.com/03/welcome/) than anything else in our living room besides our laptops.

            <div class="content"><p>Wow, I had no idea all this was going on. I setup my XBox, XBMC (and ol' XBMP), and Xebian about 2 years ago and never really kept up. It was a huge effort at the time to get it going, and I just counted my lucky stars.</p>

<p>However, all this progress really makes me want to go back and start mucking with it again. Hrm - view my home automation &amp; home intranet from my XBox. View MythTV from within XBMC? Sounds very yummy.</p></div>
