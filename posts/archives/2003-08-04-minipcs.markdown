<blockquote cite="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blosxom.cgi/2003/Aug/3#ukuug-1"><i>And the next thing: at a very specific level, mini-ITX motherboards and cases are The Way To Go. Tiny, cheap, fanless PCs with trailing-edge processors -- only  1GHz -- are nevertheless a really amazingly cool idea, especially when you start thinking in terms of turning them into personal video recorders (running things like FreeVo) or in-car GPS navigation systems. Or Beowulf clusters.</i></blockquote><div class="credit" align="right"><small>Source: <cite><a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blosxom.cgi/2003/Aug/3#ukuug-1">Charlie's Diary   </a></cite> (via <a href="http://boingboing.net/2003_08_01_archive.html#200443863">Boing Boing</a>)</small></div>	<p>Although I currently am on the low end of disposable income, I&#8217;m keeping my eye on tiny cases, motherboards, and just-slightly-slower-than-insanity CPUs for projects just such as these.  I want a <span class="caps">PVR</span>, a few file servers, maybe a homebrew game console.  I also wouldn&#8217;t mind buying a pile of <a href="http://www.openbrick.org/">OpenBricks</a> for general living-in-the-future purposes around the house, and to experiment with clustering and networking.  Would also be neat to learn some hardware hacking again to build some clever devices like <a href="http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/tech/changer.html">this CD changing robot</a></p>
