So, I&#8217;ve been working on [a retro space game for the web][1]. I planned it as a fun project to &#8220;[sharpen the saw][2]&#8221; and get myself more current on some newer technologies. I also planned to use it as blog fodder, writing little diary entries about what I&#8217;ve been doing & discovering along the way. But, [147 commits and almost 4 months later][3], I&#8217;ve had fun doing the coding and have totally neglected the writing.

<!--more-->

[I just brainstormed a topic list][4], so maybe I could back-fill with posts about things I did a few months ago. Last month&#8217;s stuff is boring to write about, though. Meanwhile, today&#8217;s stuff is fresh and exciting. But, since I&#8217;ve told myself that I should write about all the things, I feel obligated to go back and do the chores first. So, nothing gets written.

<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://www.memecenter.com/search/procrastination"><img alt="" src="http://global3.memecdn.com/_o_102096.jpg" width="500" height="407" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">
    Bah.
  </p>
</div>

But, wait! It just occurred to me that I can do whatever I want! [I can totally have pudding before I have any meat.][5] So, I can go all non-linear and just start writing about whatever seems fun, in whatever order strikes my fancy.

Take that, [internal editor / critic][6]. Prepare for random access crap!
