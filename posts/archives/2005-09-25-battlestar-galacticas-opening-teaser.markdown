Speaking of opening credits and truncation: I'm also happy that the Space 1999 inspired, drum-driven episode teaser sequence on Battlestar Galactica has returned, despite the SciFi Channel's strategy of short opening sequences this season.  I know a lot of people have complained about it, as I heard in [the podcast][bsgpod], but I think it's a nice touch.
