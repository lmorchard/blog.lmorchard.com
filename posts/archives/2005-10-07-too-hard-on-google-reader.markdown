You know after I posted that [semi-rant on Google Reader][gr], it occurred to me that I was maybe being a bit too hard on it.  I mean, obviously, there's evidence of hard work put into this thing.  And although I haven't bothered to view source yet, I imagine there's some cool AJAX-style magic going on under there.  And, for some (most?) users, this way of viewing feeds is nice and pleasant to use.

But, man... all that hard work, and I just can't shake my impression of how *slow* this thing is.  And I don't mean how slow it is to load from the server, but the whole UI experience once it's loaded: That is, how slow all the scrolling and the clicking and the navigating is.  Wasn't this AJAX thing supposed to be all about quick, slick, and snappy web apps?

I guess I feel a bit let downâ€”with all the time it took Google to make a move in the feed aggregator space, and with those PhD's they have laying around, I expected they'd finally have something revolutionary.  Not this, not a cute toy *I* could've cobbled together *myself* in short order with Flash or AJAX.  (But I haven't, because it'd be useless to me.)

For example, take the [Google Maps API][gma].  I just happened to be working with it for a project this week, and I have to say that that's some nice stuff there.  That's a platform that feels like some magic.  I don't think I could've built *that* from scratch, though it sure is fun building things atop it.
