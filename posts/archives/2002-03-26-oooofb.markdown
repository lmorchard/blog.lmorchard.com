So..  What <em>have</em> I been working on?  Well, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe">XmlRpcFilteringPipes</a> via <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RUPipeFilters">RUPipeFilters</a> in <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand">RadioUserLand</a>.  I'm soaking in it right now.  So far, the text I'm writing will be piped through my local <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand">RadioUserLand</a> instance, with filters on the built-in glossary and macro system.  After that, I send my content out for a trip through the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DecafbadWiki">DecafbadWiki</a> to pick up a few links from there.<p>For example, these should be some wiki links:  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BootToTheHead">BootToTheHead</a>, <span style='background : ;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/EnlightenedSelfinterest?topicparent=."><b>?</b></a><font color="">EnlightenedSelfinterest</font></span>, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WebChanges">WebChanges</a>, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WebIndex">WebIndex</a><p>This should be the time via the statement <code>clock.now()</code>: 3/26/02; 5:46:22 PM<p>This should be a link to something truly evil from the bowels of my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand">RadioUserLand</a> glossary: <a href="http://www.hamsterdance.com/">Dancing Hamsters</a><p>I've got the whole shebang working in <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand">RadioUserLand</a> right now.  The only thing keeping me back from a release is building a friendly-ish web interface on managing pipelines.  Maybe I should say screw it to that for now and just release it.  It's useful right now, and managing pipelines is a matter of editing the preferences database, which is a breeze for early adopters.  There are even convenience methods to do it with.  And in-the-moment usage of the system is easy:  select your text, copy it into the clipboard, bring up Radio's tray or dock menu, pick Pipefilters->Apply Pipeline to Clipboard, and away you go.<p>Maybe I'll do this tonight.  I think it's incredibly useful, and odds are someone else will too.

<b>Update @ 2:14am</b>:  Ooh, <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/03/26#l22fd24cb85118be484040146a8496563">Dave linked to me</a>.  He called me weird.  This makes me blush.  If you're looking for the goods of which I speak, try coming back in about 8-10 hours.  I've gotten sucked into playing with Dave's <a href="http://radio.outliners.com/beta">Instant Outlining</a> bomb drop and have forgotten about packaging and uploading my own.  Funny how I'd just <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/radio-dev/message/5457">posted a message</a> to the radio-dev mailing list, jokingly demanding his goods.  I go to dinner with my girlfriend, come back to find that he  came through with it.

I'm going to bed now, the alarm clock rings too soon.
