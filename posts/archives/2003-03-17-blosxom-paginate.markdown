title: Pagination for Blosxom
wordpress_id: 394
wordpress_slug: blosxom-paginate

Here's a little something I whipped up last week:  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlosxomPaginate">BlosxomPaginate</a>.
<br /><br />
I've been using Blosxom and Blagg for my news aggregator lately, just
for a change, and one thing I was really missing was some way to see
entries that fell off the end of the front page.  
<br /><br />
So, I made this.  It
lets me flip back and forth between pages of Blosxom entries, and I
even went so wild as to include full flavour-based template support of
the display of the navigation elements.

            <div class="content">Looks cool, i've been playing with blosxom on my powerbook. Even wrote a small script to convert all my MT entries over. But have went live or anything yet. This looks like a very handy plugin.

I've played with blagg as well. Mainly at work with a very limited set of sites to check. The one thing that i didn't like was that everytime I run it, i get a full list of entries instead of just the new ones since i last read it. To bad there is no aggregator for Pine, short of running your own nntp server and rss2nntp scripts :)</div>

            <div class="content">Ah ha...do it in sort!  I hadn't even considered that.

I'd still like a second shot at filtering, though, with the list of stories that match the category/date requirements -- that way this could worth with subpages too, not just the main index.</div>

            <div class="content">There actually *are* a few scripts that've been set up to read rss feeds in email. The one I'm using is at http://www.w3.org/2002/09/rss2email/ but there are a couple of others. Believe me, if it hadn't existed, I'd've had to write it myself, since I didn't much like any of the in web browser rss clients, most of which had the same problem, downloading everything, not just new entries. Yuck! And I can't easily run any of the other rss clients due to spending all my time in emacs.</div>
