It feels all old-school like my first days of posting link blog entries, but I've [added a "thingy" over at del.icio.us][thingy] to schedule nightly posts from my day's bookmarking activity.  I was feeling a bit of a lack here, since I completely detached my links from the site after [the reboot this past fall][reboot].  So, I hope you don't mind the new daily linksâ€”and if you do, tough.  They're good for you.  Like roughage.
