Hope no one minds the flood too much, but I just remembered that there was a such thing as [FlickrExport](http://connectedflow.com/flickrexport/) and that I hadn't posted anything at all to [my Flickr account](http://flickr.com/photos/deusx) in over a year.  So, I present to you the following new photo sets which pretty much summarize the past year:

* [<img src="http://static.flickr.com/29/60965572_c327d5a5e0_s.jpg" /> We Got Engaged!](http://flickr.com/photos/deusx/sets/1316877/)
* [<img src="http://static.flickr.com/27/60971492_9379a66a66_s.jpg" /> random pets](http://flickr.com/photos/deusx/sets/1316941/)
* [<img src="http://static.flickr.com/25/60964174_f17514ccbb_s.jpg" /> Hacking RSS and Atom Arrives](http://flickr.com/photos/deusx/sets/1316791/)

May these amuse you to some degree.
