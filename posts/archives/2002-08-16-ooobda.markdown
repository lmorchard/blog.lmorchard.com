<p>Just read this <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/08/16#When:4:37:18PM">on Scripting News</a>:<blockquote><i>Heads-up, some time in the next few hours (Murphy-willing) we're going to release tcp.im, which allows Radio and Frontier to be an instant messaging client or server (either can be either).</i></blockquote>Okay, this is insanely great, or at least has gigantic potential to be great.  I just hope <a href="http://www.instantmessagingplanet.com/public/article/0,,10817_1446781,00.html">ActiveBuddy</a> doesn't swoop in and claim to have invented the whole kit and kaboodle.  Barring that, I can see a whole suite of new P2P apps with desktop servers, kicked off by the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand">UserLand</a> crowd.</p>
