<p>I've amassed <a href="http://del.icio.us/deusx">9681 bookmarks on del.icio.us</a> as of right now.  Quick napkin calculation:  I post an average of 7 bookmarks a day, over my lifetime of 1353 days using the site.  Within the next 45 days or so, I should reach 10000 bookmarks at this rate.  I wonder if I should throw a party?</p>
