 <p><a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/02/16.html#When:9:27:52AM">Dave says</a>: "I'm starting to get a new release of the OPML Editor together, as part of the release I asked Andre Radke to prepare a download for the kernel source. The OPML Editor is an open source app, licensed under the GPL."</p>
 <p>I can certainly <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2006/02/13#When:7:59:00PM">attest to the fact that the OPML Editor is Open Source</a>, and not vapor or a mirage of any kind.  In fact, I'm writing this on version 10.1a6 that I compiled myself with Apple's Xcode from a SourceForge CVS check-out.  It's a serious effort to have made it this easy.  I didn't have to tweak or coax anything - I just clicked on the Build hammer.</p>
 <p> And, to expand on what I said earlier this week:  The OPML Editor and <a href="http://frontierkernel.sourceforge.net/">Frontier Kernel</a> is an Open Source release of a project with a decade or more of legacy as a commercial product - yet, it still compiles into a useful application and runs without much fuss.  That was the big thing that Mozilla missed when it was first released as Open Source.  This is exciting stuff and a hard thing to have accomplished, me thinks.</p>
