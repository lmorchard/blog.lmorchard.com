I still want to get back to that [address book web app][abook] I started babbling about before Christmas, mostly to exercise my working skills with REST, XML, Javascript and XMLHttpRequest--[now known as Ajax][ajax]?

I feel like I should work on FeedReactor, but I started work on that to scratch an itch and  exercise my RSS, Atom, and Ajax skills.  But, lately, I've been made reasonably happy and itch-scratched by the latest [betas of NetNewsWire][nnwb], and my RSS/Atom skills are getting quite exercised by writing a book.  

Furthermore, I had [brief, weak delusions of toppling the Bloglines empire][biz], but I'm not really devoted to that idea as a venture of my own.  Been there before (sorta), never got anywhere, [left a domain name and two dead-and-deleted SourceForge projects behind me][iai].  (And, a project *really* has to be dead for SourceForge to delete it.)  

Though, if someone else wants to hire me to build it for them, I don't think I'd turn down the offer.
