 <p>"<a href="http://www.sef.org.pk/educatewebsite/educate2fol/glosiconedu2.asp">Praxis</a> is a complex activity by which individuals create culture and society, and become critically conscious human beings. Praxis comprises a cycle of action-reflection-action which is central to liberatory education. Characteristics of praxis include self-determination (as opposed to coercion), intentionality (as opposed to reaction), creativity (as opposed to homogeneity), and rationality (as opposed to chance)."  (See also: <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Consolidated/_/Praxis">"Praxis" by Consolidated</a>, which is what got me googling for the term.)</p>
