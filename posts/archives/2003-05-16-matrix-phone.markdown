Okay, no.  
<br /><br />
<a href="http://www.samsungtelecom.com/matrix/">This new Matrix-inspired phone</a> is ugly as hell and not cool at all.  Do they actually use this thing in the movie?  I hope this isn't a sign for what the movie will be like -- clumsy, bulky, cartoonish and not at all subtle like the original.  See, the first movie had a phone.  I forget the model number, but I think it was a Nokia.  its sliding keypad cover was modified especially for the movie with a switchblade-springload action for extra cool factor.  And, unlike a lot of phones at the time, it was slick and sleek and tiny.
<br /><br />
So what the hell is this thing?  It looks like a walkee-talkee for grade school kids, not the "ultimate conversation piece".

            </div>
            <div class="content">They do use it, but its not as prominent as the last movie from what I remember. 

I thought the movie was excellent and this phone doesn't reflect what its like -- though with a much larger budget and studio support they went all out.

The last movie used a Nokia 8110. It was a dual-band GSM phone so it never made it to the US. Right after the first movie, when I would travel to England half the brits I met with had one. It was discontinued because the springload action kept breaking and in some cases shot the cover clear across the room. 

Interestingly one owner told me that the phone was quite popular in a pub game where it was used to launch bottlecaps across the table into a make shift goal.

Your're right this phone is a disappointment. I'm sure Samsung called the shots and for their promotional contribution, they had little room to say "this is ugly." I'd still buy the 8110 with a few upgrade to it.</div>

            <div class="content">The phone in the movie was actually a 7110 (http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,135,00.html) with extra metal trim (a specialy mock-up made for the movie). There is no 8110, just the 8210 (http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,138,00.html), which I still carry around occasionally. But yeah, the Samsung sucks bigtime. They could have used the Symbian license they own to put out a Series 60 phone like the 7650 (http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,137,00.html), but with a Matrix theme.</div>

            <div class="content">Hmmm... Could be an 8110 with extra metal trim under the buttons, of course. But I do recall that Neo's phone looked just like mine (I had a 7110 then). Anyone got the DVD handy and can take some stills from the section where he is talking on the windowsill? :)</div>

            </div>
            <div class="content">OK, It _is_ an 8110. I actually went and dug out the DVD - Chapter 5 of the DVD shows Neo taking a 8110 out of an envelope, and the phone is also seen dropping to the streets below later on. The power button _is_ red, and it also has a metallic "sheen" around the display that under the lighting looks like the 7110's metal band.

I tried taking some stills of the sections where it actually looks like both a 7110 and 8110 due to the lighting, but the second pic Bryce posted shows the lighter band around the display clearly ;)</div>

and even for it's time it was a complete piece of crap. it wasn't tiny and sleek, it was big and ugly, kind of like this one. the only cool factor was the sliding cover thing, which wasn't even that cool.

so things haven't really changed, have they?</div>
