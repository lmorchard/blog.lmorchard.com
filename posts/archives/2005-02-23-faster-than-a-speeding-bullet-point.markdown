* Morning is not my friend--and I have struggled with this for so long that I have become all but convinced that I'm part of an evolutionary branch of humanity who stayed up late and kept the fire going while the day shift slept.  Sometimes I think I should try making a career out of doing long-distance freelance work for another time zone whose morning starts several hours later than my own.

* I knew that my iPod had a Notes menu fed from the Notes folder, but I didn't know [that it did inter-note hyperlinks][podlinks].  This rocks my book-authoring socks.

* The lack of a [decent Python interpreter for PalmOS][palmpy] is making me want to [learn Lisp][lispme] again.

* Taking screenshots of an iPod sucks.  This does not rock my book-authoring socks.

* Have I mentioned lately that I hate, *hate*, **hate** character encoding issues on the web?   Mmm, ISO-8859-1 characters pasted into a file claiming to be UTF-8...

* MJD's [_Higher Order Perl_][hop] is out! And I also just noticed Randal's [_Perls of Wisdom_][perls]  Man, it's been a long, long time since I was last excited by Perl--and I used to *live* in it.

            <div class="content">Back in my college days I had at least one semester where my classes ran from Noon to 9 PM, then I'd stay up until AM and wake up around 10 AM... That was the best schedule I ever had...

And as for character encoding issues, yeah, I hear ya, try dealing with 5 years of 'badly formed content' in files on disk, in a Microsoft SQL database, and from an old HP that's still running. Nightmare, truly a nightmare.</div>

            <div class="content">Which time zone are you in?  If it's PST, try doing consulting for New Zealand or Australian companies.  The exchange rate isn't good for you, so you'll need to charge a LOT to make decent money, but you'll be able to sleep in ...

Alternatively, pretend you're in New Zealand, and work for American companies remotely!</div>

            <div class="content">Have you seen Pugs yet? It's the first Perl6 implementation, written in Haskell, and intended to work out the kinks in the specs for the later real Parrot-based implementation. But it's evolving jaw-droppingly fast. Autrijus started on it a month ago, then the project started picking up members two weeks ago, and it already implements a substantial subset of Perl6. It's like all those years of waiting have culminated in an implementational flashbang.</div>
