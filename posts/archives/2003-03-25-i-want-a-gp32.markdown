It comes out the box with an English manual, a PC link cable, the GP32
uses PC smartMedia as its Hard disk and has 8meg of internal ram + its
(upgradeable) OS, a USB port, a large hires screen (which is SO much
better than the GBA one), two stereo speakers (one on each side), a
joypad and 6 buttons (4 on front and 2 shoulder buttons), a 3v in
socket, a headphone socket, volume control, battery compartment (2xAA
for 10-14 hours) &amp; an EXT out port which allows you to do many things
including using the gp32 on your TV or for wireless multiplayer.
...The console is open source and fully supports people making their
own programs for it, there is a GCC based devkit complete with
graphics and sound libs.

Just read a <a href="http://www.gbax.com/gp32review.html" target="_top">review of the GP32</a>,
a handheld game console I'd never heard of before.
<a href="http://www.gbax.com/gp32pics.html" target="_top">Pictures of it</a> look amazing,
and the specs aren't too shabby either.  Powerful enough to run
emulators of a sickening array of game platforms, uses <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/SmartMedia?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">SmartMedia</font></span>
cards, support wireless multiplayer via cell phone.  And, oh yeah, it
looks like you can actually see the screen.
<br /><br />
The biggest flaw I see in this thing is that it would be so easy to
pirate games for it.  Supposedly there were some attempts to provide
for a mechanism to "lock" games to a particular handheld, but that
appears to already have been circumvented.  So, while the thing looks
like a dream machine to me, it probably looks like a nightmare to game
producers.
<br /><br />
Still, though, I want one.  And I bet Russell Beattie wouldn't mind
one either, if he hasn't heard about it yet, given his
<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/20021201.html#184646" target="_top">professed love for his GameBoy Advance</a>.
And, speaking of Russell, I wonder just how well that wireless
multiplayer support works...
