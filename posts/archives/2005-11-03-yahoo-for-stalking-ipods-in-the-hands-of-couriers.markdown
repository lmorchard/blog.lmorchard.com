If the new [Yahoo! Maps][ym] were *really* cool, they'd've already done a mashup with [DHL][] to let me obsessively stalk the courier in whose truck my returning iPod repair currently rests.  

Come on, get with the program!  When we've got [GPS watches][gw], "`Status: With delivery courier / Location: (blank)`" is no way to track a package!  In the meantime, my [repetitive information injury][rii] is flaring up as I refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh...
