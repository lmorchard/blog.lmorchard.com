<p>Okay, I've lost count of how many times I've seen a referer like this:    <a href="http://google.yahoo.com/bin/query?p=Tiffany+Playboy+Pictures&amp;hc=0&amp;hs=0" target="_top">http://google.yahoo.com/bin/query?p=Tiffany+Playboy+Pictures&amp;hc=0&amp;hs=0</a>  How the hell did I become a destination for the web's nekkid Tiffany needs?  They're not here.  Seriously.  Otherwise I'd be charging, at least $14.95/month.</p>
<p>From what I can see by chasing the Google referers, it's my old stats page that got indexed, and that's gone now!  I can't remember ever having mentioned the name "Tiffany" on this site (until now), and doing a complete text grep through every file on my server yields no hits.</p>
<p>So, somehow the rumors of Tiffany pics over here got started, and then Google must've initially gotten the notion to index my stats pages when I mentioned them <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/mt/mt.cgi?__mode=view&amp;_type=entry&amp;id=109&amp;blog_id=3">back in April</a>.  Indexing my stats page further fed Google from Google's own keyword referers already present in the stats page.  Gah.  But where's the initial Tiffany-link event?</p>
<p>This is all highly confusing, yet amusing as hell.  I wonder if I can work this somehow to further and gaslight Google, making me a definitive source for other things?  Say, "wil wheaton monkey sex"  :)  Naw, I have better things to do.</p>
<p>Okay, back to work.<br />
