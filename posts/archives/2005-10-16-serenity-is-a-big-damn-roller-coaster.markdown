title: Serenity is a Big Damn Roller Coaster

I've just finally seen [Serenity][ser].  So, if you're concerned about spoilers, bugger off now—if you cared about spoilers, you should've already seen the big damn movie.  

Some quick, fully spoiled thoughts:

  * I'm fairly certain it was the best science fiction movie I've seen in about 10-15 years.  I'm only just about to turn 30 this month, so I'm not old by any stretch—but I've watched a lot of sci-fi in my time.  Probably too much sci-fi.  

  In any case, this was the first movie I've seen in at least a decade that had me wanting to walk out, go straight to get another ticket, and watch it over again.  Like I remember doing a few times with roller coasters when I was little.

  * Many classic snips of Whedonesque dialog.  If they aren't coming out now via geeks with recorders in theaters, they'll be out in soundboards by December when the DVD arrives.
  
  * "Dozens of planets, hundreds of moons"?  Well, I guess a single solar system alleviates the need for any sort of faster-than-light travel loopholes—but damn, that makes our solar system look *sparse*. 
  
  * River as a psychic, having mentally scooped up state secrets from visiting politicians gave a very nice and sensible motivation to everyone after her.
  
  * I missed the men with blue gloves.  They were *creepy*.  The operative seemed like part 2 of the last one they'd left drifting in space, only maybe more finely honed.  He was rather fearsome, but didn't give me the willies.

  *  The operative's total psychological conversion to *the mission* as a "believer" was a great concept, though.  I could imagine some future tech being used to tickle the "God spot" or something in a Pavlovian/Skinnerian approach to bind a person to an objective.  
  
  I *am* surprised that the truth managed to snap him out of it, though.  Religious zealots seem very rarely turned by the facts.  It was a good admission at the end though, having failed the mission, when he said "there's nothing left to see".
  
  * When the Shepherd died, I wasn't *too* choked up.  I mean, he was a good character, had a crapload of mysteries worth exploring, but he was ultimately an outsider and a passenger on the ship—maybe *because* of all those mysteries.  
  
  And, of course, in the movie as independent from the series, the Shepherd wasn't given much story to become a central concern.  But, he got his dying scene and a fairly closure-rich exit.
    
  * The landing on Miranda and the subsequent explanation of the Reavers struck me as a bit of classic Star Trek *done right*—done *better*.  And, having demystified the Reavers—from victims of *spaaaaace madness* down to better living through government chemistry—did nothing to make them any less scary.

  * Does anyone out there remember when they used to play 3-D movies on TV?  They'd have a signal at a certain point, when you were meant to don the glasses.  
  
    When that spike nailed Wash and he died without a few minutes' scene of melodramatic, coughing last words—that was the signal for, "In this next fight?  They're all fair game.  *Start worrying*."  
    
    He was just *gone*, like people really go when they're not characters in a story enjoying the benefits of *deus ex machina*.  It's a very rare story where the author's gutsy enough to do permanent damage to the fictional universe itself in order to raise the stakes.  
    
    I'm sad and pissed, but this was a hell of a lot better than [wrecking the Enterprise][enter].  Hell, they did wreck the ship, but Serenity already got rebuilt by the end of the movie.  There will be no Wash 1701B.

            <div class="content"><p>My wife and I were both deeply disappointed by Serenity... and part of it is was the treatment of Wolver-- I mean, River. To my mind, her character was completely trivialized as Joss recycled yet another plotline from 70-80's X-Men stories. </p>

<p>RE: the guys with the blue gloves... see the Serenity prequel for more on them.</p>

            <div class="content"><p>I feel the same way - the first movie, perhaps since Star Wars, that I wanted to watch again as soon as it was over the first time. I think Wash's death traumatized some of the Firefly fans (one guy I talked to asked "why would you do that to yourself?" when I told him that I planned to see it again) but it's what makes Whedon's stories believable -- people actually die, in pointless ways that make the stories more real. Sadder, perhaps, but more real. </p>

<p>Based on its box office performance, I'm not optimistic that there will be a Serenity II -- but if not, it was a very suitable way to close the book on those characters.</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>I too wanted to see the Blue Gloves.  I thought the prequel story was weak closure on that thread.</p>

<p>If there is a Serenity 2, they better find someone to fill Wash's void.  He was my favorite of the series...  </p>

            <div class="content"><p>I remember a theatre director once telling me that you shouldn't have a gun on stage because everyone knows it's not going to go off. I thought of this when Wash was killed (after my heart broke) - the gun went off this time. And then I had the same thought you did: <em>Damn, they might all die. Mal may lose, after all this.</em> You have to respect that lack of conceit, that unwillingness to be precious, on Whedon's part.</p>

<p>But, sadly, I think it was also a signal to all the fans: There will be no encore.</p></div>
