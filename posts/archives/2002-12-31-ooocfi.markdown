Following in Russell Beattie's outliner brain dump footsteps, I revised my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy">PersonalWebProxy</a> page with cut-and-paste from my own outline in the works.  It's far, far from complete, especially in the planning department, but I figure it could be worth poking at just to check out the developing direction.

Having trouble getting to Russell Beattie's blog at the moment, so a link will have to wait.
