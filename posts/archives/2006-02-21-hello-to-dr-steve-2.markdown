 <p>Heh, heh - looks like I got <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/25/podcasts-i-like-lately#comment-6111">a response from Dr. Steve</a> to my mini-review of <a href="http://doctorfloyd.com/">The Radio Adventures of Doctor Floyd</a>.  Very cool - and, of course, I only listen to cheer for the masterminded schemes of Dr. Steve.  Oh, and to try to figure out what Fidgert's saying.</p>
