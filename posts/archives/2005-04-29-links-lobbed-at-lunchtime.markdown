* Makes me feel a bit slow, but I just now discovered the `for:{username}` tag convention on [del.icio.us][del], via [revgeorge][revgeorge] / [George Hotelling][gh].  Just subscribed to my own [`for:deusx`][fd] tag.

* I really want to upgrade to [Tiger][tiger], but I'm afraid of killing any part of my main work machine's setup (ie. Fink or anything under ~/local/bin) until after I've gotten this book done.

  Although, on the other hand, it might be nice to start the machine from scratch and recheck all my instructions for installing Python modules and getting things running.  Hmm!  

* Oh, and I'm sure that Dashboard-based feed readers will flood the web in the next week or two--but that doesn't keep me from wanting to make one.  In particular, I want to play with those SQLite bindings for JavaScript whose use was mentioned in [WikityWidget][ww].
