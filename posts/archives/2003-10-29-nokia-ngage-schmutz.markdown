After playing with an N-Gage, I think <a href="http://www.sidetalkin.com">sidetalkin.com</a> is freakin' hillarious.  One thought on this sidetalking thing, though:
</p>
<p>
At least it keeps the screen from getting all schmutzed.  My Treo 300 screen gets absolutely filthy, due to me pressing the slab up against my head to talk.  Also, there seems to be a defect in the LCD developing, which seems to have something to do with, again, being pressed up against my face.
</p>
<p>
In most other ways, this thing looks to be a flop...  but the sidetalking thing might just not be such a bad idea.
