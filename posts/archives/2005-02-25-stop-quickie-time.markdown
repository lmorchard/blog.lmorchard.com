* I've got ["Cover Me" from Bruce Springsteen][cb] stuck in my head--thanks [Coverville][cv].

* Okay, so let me get [this][misme] straight: The fact that Canada exercised it's sovereignty in [refusing to join up with us][ref] on the brain-dead missile defence plan means that it's [reliquished its sovereignty][noref].  Double-speak and bullies, hooray!  Somehow, I think this sort of thing makes us the target of more missiles than Canada--and keeping US military assets out of your country seems like a better missile defense to me.

* Just heard an *awesome* mashup on Adam Curry's [Daily Source Code][dsc] podcast, [Seether by Veruca Salt VS. Don't Go by Yazoo][mash].

* Oh, and speaking of podcasts.  My pet peeve:

  <font size="+8">For</font> <font size="-2"> the</font> <font size="+1">love</font> <font size="+8">of</font><font size="-3"> Bob</font> <font size="+2">please</font> <font size="-1">watch your</font> <font size="+5">audio</font> <font size="-2">levels</font><font size="1">!</font><font size="+5">!</font><font size="0">!</font>
  
  Is there anyway everyone could take some cues from radio and maybe try to agree on a decibel level common between podcasts?  And maybe even within the same podcast?  I mean, maybe this is where the thousands of dollars of equipment in a studio comes in handy, with compressors and such, but there's gotta be something to be done.

            <div class="content">Audio levels are hard. On LugRadio (www.lugradio.org) we used to have all sorts of issues with the sound balancing. The reason it's now fixed is that we use the not-very-cheap Cubase SX for mixing. While I take your point entirely, saying "you've gotta pony up a lot of money for decent mixing software" raises the bar to podcasting enormously. It's be like only allowing weblogging with a paid-for TypePad subscription.
I wish there was Free software to do this, but there isn't, really; I mean, we're a Linux radio show and we're not doing it...</div>
