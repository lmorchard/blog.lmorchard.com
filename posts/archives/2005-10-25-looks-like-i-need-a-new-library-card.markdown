title: Looks like I need a new library card

You know, I just realized that I haven't stepped foot in a public library since I graduated college.  

You know what else I realized?  Our local library has [a great card catalog online][ro], in which I've found everything I tried looking for.  It even seems to have a queue / wishlist feature!  Don't I feel behind the times?  (Though, on the downside, they don't have a copy of *my* book.  Damn, so much for egosurfing in the stacks.)

Now, if only they shipped books around like Netflix.  But, I suppose it wouldn't kill me to talk to a few librarians.  :)

            <div class="content"><p>I use my library <strong>just</strong> like Netflix, using the <a href="http://www.bpl.org/catalogs/frame_mbln.htm" rel="nofollow">website</a> to have all my books shipped to my nearest branch, and getting notified by email when they arrive. (that the nearest branch is only 3 blocks away helps maintain the Netflix-like feeling )  </p>

<p>The library bcomes a convient shipping kiosk (which given that our local branch can't have more then 500 books, is really all its opitmized for anyway)  </p>

<p>Be great to see a library system embrace this model, and start rolling out micro-branches.</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>I also discovered the wonders of the online library when I moved last year. They might not ship the books to your door, but as the others said, you should be able to get them transferred to a branch near you and get an email when they're ready. They'll even email you to let you know when they're due.</p>

<p>You could always donate a signed copy of your book to your local library as a thank you and encourage them to get the <a href="http://www.sirsi.com/Newsevents/Releases/20050625epsrooms.html" rel="nofollow">updated Sirsi system with RSS feeds</a>.</p>

            <div class="content"><p>The SouthEast Michigan Library system has made me a believer again in the modern library. I already did manual searches now for books to be shipped to my local library instead of buying from Amazon, et al. Those greasemonkey scripts should be very nice.</p>

<p>Of course, the Royal Oak library (orig link) is currently closed for renovations. :p But then again, most of the libraries in the area were recently built/upgraded and each has a unique, and interesting thing to see - so I highly suggest a sojourn to the Livonia, Redford, and Northville libraries at the least.</p></div>
