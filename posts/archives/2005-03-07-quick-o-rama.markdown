* I really shouldn't mess around with my caffeine intake: I really can't get started until after the first pot of the day--it's all self-doubt and spinning wheels until then.

* I kinda miss my Trackbacks.  Have been insanely busy for about 3 months now--and at the first sign of Trackback spam, I just renamed the `mt-tb.cgi` and took it out of circulation rather than give it another thought.  I still have comments, but since MT 3.0, they're in full moderation mode.

* I also miss IRC.  I haven't been putting any "quality" wasted time in there lately, and when occasionally I have poked my head in, it seems like all the channels I was idling in have gone quiet.  Or maybe they're just quieting down when I look.

* Moving again - only this time, it's not between servers.  

  With a week's notice and our current lease up at the end of the month, The Girl and I discovered a wonderful townhouse with cheaper rent and coveted wood floors about 8 blocks away from where we are now.  So...  here's hoping that the transfer of cable, internet, gas, and electric all go smooth this weekend!
  
  Oh yeah, and I hope all the heavy furniture makes it, too.  Maybe the heavy lifting will make me lose some weight.  Last year, I threw an old mattress and box-spring from a third-floor balcony--too bad there'll be no such pleasures this time.

* Oh and I never mentioned it, but toward the end of last year I moved decafbad.com to new digs with [George Hotelling][george] and company.  And, not long after settling in, [I helped get the server hacked][aws] - hooray!

  Now I just have to get some spare time to execute my yearly refresh.  And get back to blogging in earnest.
