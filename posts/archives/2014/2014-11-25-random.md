TL;DR: Living in the future with spreadsheets and DOS games.

<!--more-->

* Hello world. I've not gotten any better at keeping these posts going.

* A reminder that we're living in the future: 

  * A [powerful spreadsheet package][docs] is available online, free to use.
  
  * It offers the ability to fill in cells with live data queried from
    services all over the world.

    * This is serious gee-whiz stuff. I seem to remember first getting fired
      up by the potential after reading [Practical Internet Groupware by Jon
      Udell][group], circa 1999.

  * Oh, and I mainly use it to [plan business activities in a video
    game][evesheet].

* Speaking of living in the future: [bbs.decafbad.com][] lives again! 

  * [<img src="/uploads/2014/decafbad-bbs.png" style="width:66%">][bbs.decafbad.com]

  * In a spasm of nostalgia-ception, I set up [Synchronet][] with a handful of
    [BBS DOOR games][door].

    * e.g. [LORD][], [BRE][], [SRE][], [Usurper][], and a few others.

  * The last time I did this was [back in 2002][lastbbs], on a
    little 70mhz PC rescued from a dumpster.

    * *Holy crap over 12 years ago*. So, there are like 2 layers of nostalgia
      going on here.

  * This time around, I first tried installing Synchronet on my
    [couch gaming PC][couchpc].

    * The BBS itself works. But, alas, Windows 8 has
      largely left the old DOS games behind. Also, and having this stuff
      going on this PC is annoying.

  * My second attempt was to [try running Windows 98 in QEMU][win98] on my
    hobby Linux VM.
    
    * [It was hilarious.][winfunny] But, it chewed up 100% CPU
      while running. After I slapped it with [cpulimit][], it performed
      about as well as that 2002 trash computer.

  * My third attempt saw me [building the Linux port of Synchronet][sbbsport].
  
    * This involves wrestling with [DOSEmu][] to run the old-school games.
      There are a few hitches, but the games are far more playable than I
      expected.

    * I expect this Linux-based install to be a lot easier to keep running,
      since it doesn't depend on hardware in my own house and I can mostly
      forget about it.
