This past Thursday night, I was asked to dial in as a guest on [Computer Outlook][co], a radio talk show hosted by John Iasiuolo out of Las Vegas, Nevada.  We rambled on a bit about [Hacking RSS and Atom][book] and my experiences in writing it.  

To hear the show, you can check out the [audio archives][coa] of the show or even [subscribe to it as a podcast][cop].  Not having lived in the broadcast area, I hadn't heard of this show beforeâ€”but they seem to have a lot of fun on it, and I'm tuned in now via iTunes.

It's the first time I've been asked to take part in something like this, so I was a bit bewildered by the whole event.  I tend to feel a bit stymied on conference calls, so I kept worrying whether I was talking too much or too little.  I haven't had a chance to listen to the whole show yet and squirm at the sound of my own cell-phone mangled voice, but it was a very cool experience!
