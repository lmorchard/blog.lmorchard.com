Okay, cheesy entry title.  
<br /><br />
Anyway, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MailToRSS">MailToRSS</a> got mentioned on <a href="http://aaronland.info/weblog/">aaronland</a>.  Imagine my surprise when I see <i>my name and blurbage</i> come up on someone else's weblog in my Radio feed.  Yeah, yeah, happens every day.  But I'm happy to get this stuff noticed and found useful.
<br /><br />
Thanks :)
