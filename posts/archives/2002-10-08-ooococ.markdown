Hello everyone out there.  I've been busy as hell these last weeks, for reasons personal and professional, but I wanted to take a second to say something:
<br /><br />
Thank you for writing.  You make me <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/01.html#there_are_four_lights">cheer</a>, and you make me <a href="http://snowdeal.org/section/ex_machina/archives/2002_10_06_index.html#85536636">cry</a>.
<br /><br />
This makes me think about being a bit more human in this space, along with being the tech obsessive here.  My <a href="http://deus-x.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> has caught most of my personal entries and rants, but maybe I'll finally merge the two.  Not that I've had much time for writing lately, unfortunately, but it's heading toward colder and longer nights here, and I'm sure the urge will strike.
