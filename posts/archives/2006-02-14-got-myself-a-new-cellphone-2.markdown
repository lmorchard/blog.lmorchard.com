 <p>Whenever I get a new gadget, no matter how low-powered, I try to <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/08/09/homebrew-productivity-via-rube-goldberg">wrap my brain around it</a> in a very real sense.  I try to explore the features and see how useful they can be as things I habitually reach for in the course of thought.  </p>
 <p>So, I've been having fun lately with a new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000BYEUUG/104-3738331-5415167?v=glance">LG PM-225</a> cameraphone from Sprint.  It's certainly no mega-nifty smartphone, but it's a hell of a step up from my trusty old <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/03/26/a500-not-3g">Samsung A500</a>.  A few initial thoughts:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>
     <span>It's nice having a cameraphone, period, as well as having a much more capable web browser and SMS messaging built right into the phone (as opposed of accessible from web forms).</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span>I've installed <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/operamini/phones/?phone=lg_pm225">Opera Mini</a>, and started playing around with a <a href="http://decafbad.com/phone/feeds/">mobile reading list</a> of feeds using some code from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1">my first book</a>.</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span>It's been nice to skim some feeds and email myself links to items I'd like to read on a larger screen - which the built-in OpenWave browser does, but not Opera Mini.</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span>I've played just a bit with setting up some <a href="http://www.ii.com/internet/robots/procmail/">procmail filters</a> to route email from the phone to various folders or scripts.  For instance, I've got a notion to send myself captured thoughts and notes to be added to an <a href="http://support.opml.org/stories/storyReader$27">Instant Outline</a> hosted on my server and monitored from my PowerBook running the OPML Editor.  </span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span>I've also been considering some homebrew moblogging tools for the camera side of things.</span>
     </li>
     </ul>
