<p>More on aggregators and extending the concept further into the desktop, Ziv writes about <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106548/2002/06/13.html#a27">aggregation as a tool for the exterprise</a>.  This is starting to cross over into the <a href="http://searchebusiness.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid19_gci804078,00.html">digital dashboard</a> buzzword area, but I'm thinking that what we're all <a href="http://www.syndic8.com/~wkearney/blogs/syndic8/archives/000023.html#000023">converging </a> on will be the real deal.</p>
<p>I had to giggle though, because the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/scripts/pubs/view.asp?TR_ID=MSR-TR-2001-83">Sideshow</a>  project from Microsoft Research looks like my OS X dock on steroids.  Even down to the vertical arrangement, mail indicator, weather reports, IM buddy display (no faces, though), and a few other information readouts.  Of course, my dock doesn't have the neato pop-out in-context mini-browser windows that connect to the icons, but that could be a keen OS X project.  Have to think about that.<br />
