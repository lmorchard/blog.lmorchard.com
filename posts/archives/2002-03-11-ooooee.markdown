This was easier than I thought it would be:  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilterService">XmlRpcFilterService</a>
<br /><br />
Basically, this is my first application of the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe">XmlRpcFilteringPipe</a>.  On the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOsX">MacOsX</a> side of things, I implemented a quick standalone service using <a href="http://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/software/XMLRPC/" target="_top">Marcus Muller's XMLRPC Obj-C framework</a>.  On the filter side of things at 0xDECAFBAD, I added the filter methods to my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki">XmlRpcToWiki</a> interface I have running on the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DecafbadWiki">DecafbadWiki</a>.  So, now there's a filter named 'wiki' on the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DecafbadWiki">DecafbadWiki</a> that I call with the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilterService">XmlRpcFilterService</a> under <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOsX">MacOsX</a>.
<br /><br />
The nutshell version of this is:  I write something somewhere, select some of it, click "Appname -> Services -> <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilterService">XmlRpcFilterService</a> -> Apply to Selection" in my menu (or use the hot key), and the selected text is filtered through my remote wiki to pick up links and filtering.  In the context of a weblog entry, this means that what I write in the weblog is now bound to the wiki.  Hell, I can even make my postings to message boards and replies to email pick up links to my wiki.  Now that I think of this, I might want to have a selection of an alternate rendering for email, where the links appear at the end of the message as footnotes.
<br /><br />
Anyway, it still needs a bit of work to make it more generally useful.  It needs some preference panes to change and construct the filter pipe, support multiple pipes, and I need to bundle the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc">XmlRpc</a> frameworks up in the app for easy installation (or switch to Apple's built-in <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc">XmlRpc</a> API).  But the point is, it took me all of 2 hours between server and client side work to get this working, and it's already useful for me.  I'll see soon if the sudden population of links in all of my communication from my laptop annoys anyone.  :)
<br /><br />
This is one solution for a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki">WeblogWithWiki</a>, but I still want to play around with making the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster">WeblogMulticaster</a> and enabling it to use <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe">XmlRpcFilteringPipes</a> also.
<br /><br />
And, somewhere, this figures into <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand">RadioUserLand</a>.
