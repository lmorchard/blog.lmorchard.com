title: Firefox 2.0 breaks client-side XSL for RSS and Atom feeds
wordpress_id: 1012
wordpress_slug: firefox-20-breaks-client-side-xsl-for-rss-and-atom-feeds

This seems like a small thing, but it bothers me:  For RSS and Atom feeds, Firefox ignores client-side XSL transformations in favor of its own new enhanced rendering.  The only way to work around this issue is to stuff 512 bytes or more of XML comment text before the initial feed tag.  [It's been marked as a bug][bug] for some months now - but after reading the discussion therein, I don't have much hope of this being fixed.  The gist of the discussion appears to boil down to this: "Firefox knows best, consistency is good, and anyone using client-side XSL on feeds is really after what we're doing anyway.  Thus, WONTFIX."

This strikes me as a bit condescending, presumptuous, and quite broken.  I don't care if [it's what IE 7 does][ie7] - they're broken too.  This breaks [FeedBurner][fb]'s XSL presentation, which I like though admittedly don't use for my own stuff.  This breaks the feed-styling XSL I've done at jobs past, which rolled in customer-demanded metrics tracking and branding.  And I don't care whether or not the Firefox team considers these or other use cases valid - that's up to me to decide.

This "feature" makes a special case breaking client-side XSL for XML documents that happen to have an "&lt;rss" or "&lt;atom" in the first 512 bytes.  That sucks.  I'd rather the browser left it up to me as a site author whether to follow Firefox's idea of consistency, or whether to happily shoot myself in the foot with my own decisions.

            <div class="content"><p>Thatâ€™s fine in theory.</p>

<p>In practice, aggregators tend not to care about the MIME type of feeds, so most feeds today are served as <code>text/html</code>. (Yes, you read that right. A whole lot of the rest are served as <code>text/plain</code>.) The same is true of images and videos, btw. There is no way to avoid content sniffing.</p>

<p>The ideal approach would have been to honour the PI <em>only</em> if the feed is served as <code>text/xml</code> or <code>application/xml</code>, eg. explicitly as generic XML rather than as a feed. In case of sniffed feeds or feeds served with the proper MIME type, the PI would be ignored (as client apps are free to do; they are under no obligation to honour the PI), but authors would still have a clean and obvious option for getting what they want.</p>

<p>Except that RSS 2.0 does not have a MIME type and is therefore served as <code>text/xml</code> or <code>application/xml</code>.</p>

<p>This is what happens when people who have no clue of how the web works come up with things to put on the web: you end up with no good way of implementing their crud.</p>

<p>The only thing I can think of that could have been better than what we have now would be to specify a new PI to explicitly disable the default feed view. (Although Iâ€™d want to have maybe add a yellow strip that lets me disable the custom view or something like that; withholding from the reader the ability to be the ultimate arbiter of his own experience is Wrong.)</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>Yes, this is MOST annoying. I had put off writing a feed waiting until the formats should settle out. I ended up delaying first until Atom 1.0, and then longer yet until I should have some free time...until just a couple of weeks ago. Then, working in Firefox 1.5.0.1 I blissfully labored over an XSLT to go with it. Spent quite a while at that. Only when I have it working pretty much as desired do I bother to check it at work in IE7...and ARGHHH!...all my time and effort wasted.</p>

<p>And oh, by the way, I had also written a howto for Atom 1.0...and XSLT. So I search GOOGLE high and low until I find someone who writes of how to turn the feature off in IE7...and ammend my howto for that instruction. Now I must do so for Firefox 2.0...and Safari...it seems. Alas and alack.</p>

<p>How about Opera? I recall from some years back that Opera was among the first and best of early adopters for XSLT. It looks as if my howto for Atom 1.0 and XSLT is going to be largely composed of workarounds for this mis-feature.</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>what a pain.  fixing this will definitely get my vote.  I do some things in XSL stylesheets beyond just showing the straight feed text, so overriding it just blows all that away.  Grr.</p>

<p>They should definitely show the user's stylesheet if one is spec'd, and only use their own if there is none defined from the RSS/XML.</p>

<p>fwiw, here's the one feed that's broken by this:

            <div class="content"><p>I resisted upgrading to FF 2.0 for quite awhile and just took the plunge. I've very disappointed that Firefox took this route of overriding XLST. I like Gan, I spent quite awhile designing an XLST stylesheet to render Quikonnex.com produced feeds in a user readable format to include providing many quick subscribe links for popular aggregators. At least IE7 allows for their default view to be turned off. Firefox and Safari do not even provide an option.</p>

<p>AND... the options Firefox provides: Live Bookmarks, Google, Yahoo, and Bloglines. Who did they sell out to?</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>i found that when an absolute URL is used for the  tag in FF 2.0.0.12 (maybe elsewhere) the specified XSL stylesheet is ignored. remove the http:// in the tag and the styling comes back. very annoying. removing the  tag seems to be the solution.</p></div>
