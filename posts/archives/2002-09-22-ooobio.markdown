After following the <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/836.html">thread on Sam Ruby's blog</a> about <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/09/20#When:8:39:43AM">Dave's  comment tracking feature request</a>, I figured I'd try <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a>-izing comments on each of my posts.  As things seem to have been going lately, I'd underestimated <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType">MovableType</a>, and it turned out <strong>so</strong> much easier than I'd thought.  :)  I'd had an <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/recent_comments_rss.xml">RSS feed for comments overall</a> on my site, but now I have individual <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feeds for each post.  (Notice the <img src="http://www.decafbad.com/images/xml.gif"> in the comments section now.)  The <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feed is also linked in the head as per <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/31.html#more_on_rss_autodiscovery">RSS autodiscovery</a> discussions.
<br /><br />
I don't think aggregators are really ready yet for these per-post comment <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feeds, but the availability of the data gives food for hacking.  Being that they're pretty disposable and of interest for a very short time, aggregators will likely need to implement expiry times for feeds, or watch for a period of inactivity before unsubbing.  Grouing feeds would be nice too, in case I wanted to round up all my points of weblog discussion participation.  I've got a few things of this sort in my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlinesWishList">AmphetaOutlinesWishList</a>, with which I hope to play with further aggregator ideas.
<br /><br />
If you use <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType">MovableType</a> and you're interested in trying this, check out these two templates:  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/recent_comments_rss.xml.tmpl">recent_comments_rss.xml.tmpl</a>, for blog-wide comments; and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/archive_entry.rss.tmpl">archive_entry.rss.tmpl</a>, for per-post comments.  The former template is added as an index template in <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType">MovableType</a>, whereas the latter is an archive template.  Also, the per-post archive template will need to be added to the list of individual archive templates in the <strong>Archiving</strong> section of your blog config.  You'll want to give it a template for the filename, perhaps something like <code><$MTEntryID pad="1"$>.rss</code>.
<br /><br />
At present, I'm publishing in what I think is vaguely <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> 0.92 format.  Whether it complies with the spec, I'm not quite sure because I was lazy.  I plan to revisit this soon to make it at least comply with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> 1.0.  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.

I just this minute got the parsing and storing parts of my RDF in RSS project working, and now I'm on the prowl for things to feed it.

            <div class="content">I'd second that about aggregators not being ready for per-thread feeds ;-)

I implemented per-thread feeds (rather than per-user feeds, for some perverse reason) in the Python Community Server a while back, but have found that they weren't really that useful.

Some poor aggregator has been faithfully downloading http://www.pycs.net/system/comments.py?u=0000003&p=69&format=rss 20 times a day for months, despite the fact that it has *never* contained any items.  Aggregators need to have exponential backoff times or something.

BTW, I have a script to make RSS feeds from RCS comments.  At http://dev.myelin.co.nz/commentmonitor/tracker.py you can generate an RSS feed for anybody on radio.weblogs.com, blogs.salon.com or www.pycs.net.</div>

Phillip: Yeah, I'd definitely like to see some more smarts in the polling frequency of aggregators.  Got a little blurb about that on my AmphetaOutlinesWishList.  Maybe a combo of manual preferences and automatic back-off would be a start.</div>

            <div class="content">While an RSS feed of the comments for an individual entry might be useful for archival purposes (just as weekly, monthly, and/or yearly archive RSS feeds would be) I believe ONE feed for comments might be easier to chew on. As long as each item in the comment RSS feed references a URL that exists in the article RSS feed, aggregators should have little trouble matching one to the other. Having a separate RSS feed for comments per article means that aggregators would have to first get the RSS feed for the articles, then use RSS auto-discovery (as there would be NO other way) to locate the comment feed for each new article, then go get the comment RSS feed. This is a lot more work, not to mention more network bandwidth.</div>
