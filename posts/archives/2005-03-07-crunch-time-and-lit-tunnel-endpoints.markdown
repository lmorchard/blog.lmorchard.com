  Hmm, yeah, that's about where I think I'm headed toward the end of my continuous crunch for the past 3 months or so.
  
  Thing is, it's all been mostly extracurricular crunching, and work has only been gearing up over the past month or so.  My days have been almost one continuous meeting.  Hopefully, I'm seeing a non-locomotive light at the end of the tunnel, though.
  
  I'll be planning for some laziness in-between book writing as the weather gets nicer.  I'm one geek who actually has a bit of sun-worship in me, rather than yearning for lightless basements, so I'm looking forward for the sun-god's return and triumph over Winter.  
  
  Of course, sun-worship would seem a bit in conflict with [my hatred of mornings][mornings].
