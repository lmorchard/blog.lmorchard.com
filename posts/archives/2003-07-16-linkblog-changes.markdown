You might notice a sudden rise in link-quote-comment entries around
here, depending on how well this works for my lazy self.  I just threw
together a quick bookmarklet and aggregator-integrated posting hack
for myself, hoping it will be as easy as <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger">BookmarkBlogger</a> for noting
down URLs of interest throughout the day.  Nothing revolutionary,
just slightly new for me in daily use.
<br /><br />
But, I was starting to wish that I could provide a little more info
around my posted links, such as <strong>why</strong> I was sharing the link and
from where I found it.  So, I'll be trying a slightly different
approach.  Let me know if it gets annoying.
