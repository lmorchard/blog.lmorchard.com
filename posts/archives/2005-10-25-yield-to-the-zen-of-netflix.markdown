I've realized an irony with our Netflix usage:  When we get a DVD that we *really* want to see, it usually gets watched and sent back on the same day it arrives.  But, when we get a DVD that maybe only I want to see, or maybe neither of us ends up in a mood to see, we end up keeping it for a few days—sometimes for a whole week.  We've yet to "declare defeat" on many choices and just send them back unwatched.  

This is weird, when I think about it: It actually costs more money to hang onto the DVD—in a rentals-per-month sense—versus sending it right back and possibly requesting it again in the future when we're in a mood to see it.  Of course, lots of back and forth with unwatched videos costs postage, but that's not our problem.

This seems like a sort of Zen of Netflix thing I should wrap my head around.  And, if Netflix *really* wanted to save some money and exploit this bug of mine, they should recommend things that I kinda-but-don't-really want to see—so that I hang onto them longer and don't squeeze so much value out of my flat monthly rate.

            <div class="content"><p>That would be easy. They just need to keep track of how long people keep movies for, and recommend movies that are similar to the ones they kept for longer.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be surprised if that were standard procedure already.</p></div>
