title: A bit of newsRiver hackery

**Update:** *I moved this code over to [my space over at hosting.opml.org][ms] and added some updater code from [Nicholas Riley's webdav tool][nu], so that you should be able to just "Get Latest Code..." once you've got this installed.  (Or reinstalled, if you grabbed last night's version.)  Also, I fixed a bug or two.*

So, I couldn't resist poking around with Dave Winer's [newsRiver][] in the [OPML editor][oe].  For whomever's interested in this sort of thing, here's the result of a couple of hours' hacking this evening:

* [`decafbadNewsRiver.root`](http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/decafbadNewsRiver/decafbadNewsRiver.root)

In this is a tool to be dropped into your OPML Editor install's Guest Databases / apps / Tools directory, right alongside `newsRiver.root` itself.  You may need to restart the OPML Editor.  Once installed, you should see a new "DecafbadNewsRiver" menu item under the Tools menu, allowing you to view your news in this new UI.  Expect *lots* of bugs, though.

Basically, this provides an alternate DHTML outline rendering of the news items gathered by newsRiverâ€”quite similar to [what I did back in October for FeedSpool][fs].  I'm not sure how far I'll take this, if I take it any farther.  I've got a bit of a notion to tackle some REST/AJAX interaction with newsRiver for on-the-spot item deletion, and maybe on-demand item content retrieval.

But, for newsRiver hackers:  You might like what I've done with the `viewNewsItems` script under `decafbadNewsRiverSuite`.  I've made an attempt to pull all of the HTML out of the midst of the processing code.  That's was icky, and I hated it back when I first ran into it in Radio UserLand.  

I've broken all of that out into smaller external templates for page, feed, and item under `decafbadNewsRiverData`.  This should allow for easier styling and customization of the code that newsRiver produces, as well as maybe swapping themes on the fly with a preference that points the rendering process at a different root table for templates.

In any case, do what you like with this work.  I hope it's useful to someone out there.
