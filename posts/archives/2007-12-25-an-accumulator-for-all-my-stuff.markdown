No one's really noticed, but I've changed email providers about a dozen times in the past decade.  And, that's because my email address hasn't changed — thanks very much to the wonderful and awesome <a href="http://pobox.com/">Pobox.com</a>.

Likewise, I've hopped from platform to platform in blogging and writing and generally emitting memelets from my brain.  In contrast to <a href="http://pobox.com/">Pobox.com</a> though, anyone who could be bothered to follow me would have had to keep track of every new feed and site which happened to strike my fancy.  Knowing myself, I don't expect that my wandering ways to change — so the number of feeds in which my stuff lands will only increase.

So, I'd like to fix that.  In case you haven't seen it, <a href="http://decafbad.com/accum/">I've started building an Accumulator</a> for all the various feeds and accounts between which I'm distributing my attention and User Generated Content these days.

I'm hoping to make this the definitive one-stop-shop for following me and my crap, eventually offering feeds at the root of <a href="http://decafbad.com/">decafbad.com</a> with facilities for picking and choosing what to include and what to leave out.  Hopefully, this will leave me able to just simply point interested parties at <a href="http://decafbad.com/">decafbad.com</a>, and let them explore from there — rather than wandering over to this blog that's mostly quiet these days.

And, of course, if in the end no one actually cares about my spew anyway — at least I'll have had fun with yet another new project.

Oh, and Happy Holidays to you and yours!
