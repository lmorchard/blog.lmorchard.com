 <p>So last night, I started making good on the implied threat contained in <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2006/04/03#When:3:26:56PM">yesterday's idle musings about Amazon S3</a>.  I've started building <a href="http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/S3Ajax">S3Ajax, an AJAX-based wrapper for Amazon's S3</a>.  Between S3, the OPML Community Server API, and what will hopefully come out of the Atom Publishing Protocol - I think web-based filesystem APIs have the potential to be a Next Big Thing.</p>
 <p>Imagine if Amazon S3 offered filtered RSS feeds of new files uploaded to a bucket.  And, imagine if that RSS feed listed those new files as BitTorrent enclosures, with a few item elements fed from metadata headers (ie. title, description, etc).  Instant podcasting.</p>
 <p>Also, imagine if Amazon connected an XSLT processor to S3 like they do with product searches.  You could turn a bucket listing into an RSS feed with an XSLT uploaded to S3 itself.</p>

  Please make clear the license and known issues with S3Ajax.  I may use it as a basis for the GM API...</p>

            <div class="content"><p>Hmm... license - one of these days I should settle on a license for my stuff, more specific than Share and Enjoy.</p>

<p>For S3Ajax, as it stands right now I'm happy to call it Public Domain.  I'd like it if my name were mentioned somewhere in relation to it, but I won't raise a fuss if it isn't.  If you can find a use for it, you're welcome to have at it!</p>

<p>At some point in the future, I may attach something like an MIT or BSD license to it.  The SHA1 implementation I'm using is under MIT, which is the lynchpin of the authentication bits.</p>

<p>As for known issues, it's had about 4 hours' exploration and testing so far and seems to work fairly well.  It's had no stress testing, but I've been able to authenticate, upload/download content, and set metadata attributes through headers.  However, it could certainly use some test cases.</p></div>
