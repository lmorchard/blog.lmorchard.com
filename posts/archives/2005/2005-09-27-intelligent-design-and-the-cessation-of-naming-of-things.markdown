I can't wait until the day that right-wing fundie whackos and their [Intelligent Design shills](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9452500/) fade back into the woodwork.  Maybe it'll take [putting another man on the Moon](http://www.space.com/news/050920_nasa_moon_response.html) to make the role "rocket scientist" a non-ironic hero again.

In the meantime, although I'm no religious scholar and will resort to sheer snark during debate, here's my angry answer to ID proponents:  

When did God tell you to give up your mind and stop naming things?  Intelligent Design is "[utterly boring](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9452500/page/2/)" and doesn't help you at all to fulfill one of the first and most basic of mandates in the Bible.  Given this, how can ID be anything but poison?

**Update:** Dahlia Lithwick at Slate says it all in "<a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2127054/">Mind the Gaps - Intelligent design as an answer to all life's great conundrums</a>"
<blockquote cite="http://slate.msn.com/id/2127054/">ID says we shouldn't bother ourselves with resolving scientific inconsistencies or untangling puzzles. We should recognize that what God really wants is for us just to stop learning.</blockquote>

**Update 2:** Also, because I thought it was so apropos:

            <div class="content"><p>Have a look at http://talkorigins.net/ it has all sorts of interesting refutations of intelligent design. It is a great place to point people who believe it to.</p>

<p>Also if you Google about, you can find Pope John Paul's encyclical on evolutions, which says it isn't inconsistent with Christianity.</p></div>
