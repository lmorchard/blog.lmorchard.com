[Facepalm][fp], [headdesk][hd].  As it turns out, the issue I was having with my PHP XML parsing was that I was trying to cram raw gzip streams down its throat, caused by some odd things I was trying to do with HTTP headers copied cargo-cult style from [a Python module I've tried reinventing in PHP][htc].  

In other words, completely braindead work by someone who should know better, even though he's relatively new to PHP—where *he* is defined as ***me***.

But, kudos to the people of the lazyweb for taking the time to triangulate me and remove all doubt within scant hours of my post.  Not counting a half-dozen private emails, I got very quick responses from [the author of MagpieRSS][k], [the CTO of FeedBurner][e], and [the creator of PHP himself][r]—each very nicely, clearly, and rightly saying: 

**"...and that's not *my* code."**

Be careful when you attempt to invoke the lazyweb, because it might just respond!
