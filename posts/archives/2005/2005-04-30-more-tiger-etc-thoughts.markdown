* **Update #1:** <blockquote>Java 1.5 was released early on Friday for 10.4. Just because it wasn't in the box doesn't mean it's not available. :P</blockquote>

  Hooray!  I stand corrected, and a [Java 1.5 update for OS X Tiger is, indeed, available][up].

[up]: http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/java2se50release1.html

* You know, episodes of the new Doctor Who seem so short, after having gotten used to story arcs spread across multiple episodes.  Lovely baby-faced aliens, though.

* I was a little afraid that, after installing Tiger, I might not be able to use MS Word.  On the contrary, it seems to be working even <strike>vaster</strike> faster (update: oops, Freudian slip) and better than it was under Panther!

* [New Quicksilver][nq] for Tiger.  Catalog fed by saved spotlight searches, hooray!

* <strike>[No Tiger on Tiger][tig].  Bah.</strike>

* Safari's back to being non-ugly, since I applied [Brent Simmons' suggestion][bss] to hack it in Interface Builder.  Also, Mail is less assy since I found [Cage Fighter][cf].

* I think I'm really going to like `mdfind` and `mdls`, even more so than the GUI support for Spotlight. (Although, you can [do raw queries][rq] in the GUI.)  Poking around, I just noticed this little bit of metadata captured on files downloaded with Safari, found via `mdls`:
    <pre>
kMDItemWhereFroms              = (
    "http://www.otierney.net/files/cagefighter-1.0.dmg", 
    "http://www.otierney.net/cagefighter/"
)
</pre>

    I can't wait until third-party apps like [Path Finder][pf] and [Quicksilver][qs] do a better job with the end-user interface on Spotlight's underpinnings than Apple's first offering.

            <div class="content">I thought the same thing about the new Doctor Who so I looked up the first few seasons of Tom Baker and was surprised to see that most of the stories were four episodes (the equivalent of two episodes in the new longer format).

http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/doctorwho/episodeguide/index_fourth.shtml

The total length of episodes is actually shorter than what we are getting in the current season. Supposedly we are getting two more two part stories in the rest of the season, that will put us on par with the first Baker season (Robot, The Ark in Space, and Revenge of the Cybermen). The Sontaran Experiment was only two episodes, the equivalent of one current episode.  Typically only one story per season was six episodes (like Genesis of the Daleks) and that is where we are going to come up short in the current season.</div>
