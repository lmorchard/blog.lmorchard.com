A quick further thought I had, regarding [the Internet Oracle][ora]:  What if I built a Jabber/AIM Oracle?  You send it an IM with a request; you're asked, in turn, to answer another request; eventually you receive an answer after a period of Oracular ponderance.

Now, I've already found [one impedance mismatch for chatbots][bot], in converting an IRC-based bot to an IM-based bot.  In particular, a privately-messaged automaton loses all of the shared context built up in a public chatroom.  For infobots on IRC, often the users manual is found in watching how everyone else interacts with it.  You lose that in 1-to-1 IM.  

I'd imagine going from an email interface to IM would narrow the amount of context available, but would it still be a fun hack?  Waste of time?
