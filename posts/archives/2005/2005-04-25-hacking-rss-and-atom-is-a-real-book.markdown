<b>Update:</b> [<i>The book is out!</i>](http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/13/hacking-rss-and-atom-is-out)

So, I've been in a bit of blog silence for the last month or so, backing off even from [my fledgling habit of quick posts][quick].  

I've been spiraling down toward getting the final chapters of my book's first draft done.  There've been notions here and there I wish I'd captured and posted--*OmniWeb's been treating me nice; been tapping my foot for Tiger; Greasemonkey seems damn cool; I want to learn Lisp again; gee my site needs a refresh*--but, I'm trying to maintain focus here.

Hoping to get these last few chapters wrapped up quick, then take a run through revisions and reworking bits that seemed to makes sense weeks and months ago but now seem a bit wonky in the light of later developments.

But, as you can see, the book has a cover now, as well as its [own page on the Wiley site][wbook].  That, and it's been [available on Amazon][abook] for awhile, as well.  Since this is my first time through this whole process, I'm just a tad bedazzled by it, and seeing this thing ready for pre-order (and with a really keen cover!) just cements some reality for me.

I'm a bit leery of posting too many details--not because anyone's told me not to, but just because I haven't asked whether I can.  But, I'm hoping at some point to throw an outline out there to give a bit of a peek at where my hacking energies have been going lately.  

I've got this sort of pride/anxiety complex going on, alternating between thinking I've got a few really nifty tricks in there and thinking that anyone who's worth their salt will be able to see just how mediocre it all is.  But, I suspect this all ties back to my [Beginner's Mind][bmind] complex.  I did get some unexpectedly nice words from one of my editors after a submission this past weekend, so that bolstered me quite a bit.

In the meantime...  hello world.  Still here, almost there, and see you soon.
