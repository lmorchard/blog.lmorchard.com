No time for much in the way of coherent thought expressed, but here are a few stray bullets:

* ["It is the engine that drives itself / But it chooses the uphill climb."][ly]  
  Yeah, I feel that.

* Lots of great things happening at work that are demanding cool things from me.  But alas, I feel I'm neither at liberty nor at an opportune moment to talk about them.  (But, let's just say that I'm glad I wrote [that first book][book1].)

* After a brief pause for the holiday season and for a bit of a shift in focus and format, work on [the new book][book] has continued apace.  And boy howdy, do I know [how Meredith feels][she].

* Work is gradually trickling in on [FeedMagick][fm].  It's in an entirely too-rough-for-comfort state at the moment, but give a shout if it looks interesting to you.

Time for lunch and pizza.  See you soon.
