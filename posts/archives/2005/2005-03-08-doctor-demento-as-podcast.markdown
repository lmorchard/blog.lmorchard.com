title: Doctor Demento as Podcast?

[The Doctor Demento Show][demento] *so* needs to be a podcast.  I wonder if [this fan site][demento2] could do it without getting in trouble?  (Probably not, but I'd gladly seed torrents!)

  Back when I was in 6th grade, the show used to play on the local oldies station, KISS FM, Sundays at midnight.  I used to record the show to tape every week, staying up through the first half of the show so I could flip the tape when it ran out, school night be damned.
  
  Unfortunately, I only had a few spare tapes, so other than copying a few favorite songs to another tape or two, I overwrote the same tape every week.  So, no archive--until I met the Internet!  And although I certainly don't begrudge a show supporting itself with advertising--at least I don't have to hear that damned annoying Betty-Boop-esque Bubble Yum commercial on my 90-min tapes anymore.
  
  Anyway, I'm idly scheming to make the Doctor Demento a podcast, at least for my own use, by doing something unnecessarily complicated involving Usenet and `alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.dr_demento`.  (Too bad [Unison][unison] doesn't already do something like this.)  
  
  I think this would be my first foray into podcast scraping, having [already done plenty][scraper] of scraping for feed-deprived sites.  Then again, I might get busy/distracted and never get around to it.

            <div class="content">I'd love a podcast of car talk and prairie home companion, but I figure I'd get the smackdown as well. There is a service, http://www.radiotime.com/ that is like tivo for radio. You pick the program and it records it as an MP3. I'm thinking i could probably hook it up myself but I'm far too lazy to do it.</div>
