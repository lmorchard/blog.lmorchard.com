**Well, then!**  del.icio.us has come a long way since I abandoned my own Safari [Bookmark Blogger][bb] hack to finally try this "multiplayer muxway" thing Joshua was playing around with.  From the apartment servers, to the start-up offices with patio chairs, to the <span style="color: purple; font-weight: bold">Yahoo!</span>  I'm guessing this will make my job a little harder on the book-writing front, but nonetheless: **congratulations!**
