 16:06:23 [neo85] DO I NEED TO GO TO A SPECIFIC FOLDER TO LOAD 
                  THE HTMAL?
...
 16:07:37 [Ash] neo85: you may need to clear out the old HTMAL 
                files first with DELTREE C:\ /y
 16:08:10 [Ash] Anyway, then type 'LOAD HTMAL'
 16:09:11 [Ash] neo85: Did that work?
 16:09:30 [neo85] I PUT IN /Y?
 16:09:36 [Ash] Yes.
 16:10:02 [neo85] THATS ALL?
 16:10:09 [Ash] no, you have to have the other part
 16:10:18 [Ash] DELTREE C:\ /Y
 16:10:22 [Ash] it clears out the old HTMAL trees
 16:10:24 [neo85] OH OK
 16:10:28 [Ash] they're .TREE files
 16:10:59 [neo85] IT SAYS DELETE SUHDLOG.DAT
 16:11:37 [neo85] DETLOG.TXT?
 16:11:47 [Ash] yeah, just delete all the trees
...
 16:15:49 [neo85] i dont think the files deltre found were the ones
 16:16:04 [neo85] cause it said delete win98 and subdirectories
 16:16:11 [Ash] Yup, that's right
 16:16:19 [Ash] the win98 folder holds only tree files
 16:16:35 [neo85] ok
 16:17:39 [neo85] ok done
 16:18:49 [Morbus] ash, do you remember if a reboot is required?
 16:18:58 [Morbus] i keep forgetting, and all  my notes are on my 
                   other machine.
 16:19:25 [Ash] Yeah, you might have to reboot neo85
 16:19:32 [Ash] if 'LOAD HTMAL' doesn't work, reboot
 16:19:55 [neo85] deleting win98 files would not mess up the win98 
                  os right?
 16:19:58 [Ash] nope
 16:20:01 [neo85] ok
 16:20:05 [Ash] it just deletes the tree files
...
 16:26:43 [Morbus] neo, having any luck with the LOAD command?
 16:45:09 [neo85] *** neo85 has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection 
                  timed out))
