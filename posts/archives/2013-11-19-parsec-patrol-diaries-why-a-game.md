I decided to start writing [a retro space game for the web][1], because I thought it might be a good way to exercise a lot of interesting technologies and have fun to boot. You know, like how [sending rockets into space yields astronaut ice cream & anti-shock trousers back down on Earth][2]. But, I&#8217;ve also wanted to make games all the way back to my Atari 2600, Commodore 64, and Apple ][ days &#8211; because [Warren Robinett][3] is my hero.

Warren Robinett is the very model of the programmer-hero: He single-handedly created [Adventure][4], then signed his work with [the gaming world&#8217;s first easter egg][5] when they wouldn&#8217;t give him credit.

If that weren&#8217;t enough, this guy also [started his own company][6] after Atari and made [Rocky&#8217;s Boots][7].

It was only very recently that [I pieced things together and realized][8] that [Rocky&#8217;s Boots][9] is basically Adventure 2, except the bats and dragons and skeletons were drafted into warping wee brains like mine to understand binary logic and digital circuitry. I spent hours in that game, wrapping my 7-year-old head around things that wouldn&#8217;t be on exams until about 12 years later in my college compsci courses.

That&#8217;s not to say Mr. Robinett is the only game-programming hero from my youth.Â Back then, you didn&#8217;t need a full-on studio to produce something impressive, at least speaking relative to the state of the art at the time. I couldn&#8217;t name all my 8-bit heroes &#8211; but consider folks like [Andrew Braybrook][10], [Jeff Minter][11], [David Braben & Ian Bell][12]. Along with old-school music makers like [Rob Hubbard][13] and [Martin Galway][14], these were the rockstars of my pre-WWW youth.

Today, you&#8217;d call these folks *indie game developers*. Sometimes you still see the solo heros, sometimes teams of under a dozen. Still, it looks more like rock & roll than an orchestral production. The games are often somewhat constrained in tech, relying more on clever gameplay and the kind of character that never survives design-by-committee.

Of course, a lot of that rock & roll stands on giant shoulders these days, thanks to abstractions like [Microsoft XNA][15] (R.I.P.) and the [Unreal Engine][16]. There are also a bazillion other little game engines, web-based and native. But, there&#8217;s still a sweet spot for these indie rockstars to carve out a game using mere human-sized brains.

For my part, I feel like the web is my new Commodore 64. So, [Parsec Patrol][1] is my little project to play at being a game building rockstar. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll land somewhere on the scale between actual rockstar and playing Rock Band on Novice mode.
