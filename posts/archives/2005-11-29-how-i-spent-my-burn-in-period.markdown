Nat's recent series, [Burn In][burn] reminds me a bit of Adam Kalsey's [Newly Digital][nd] from a few years ago.  (*Man, has it been **a few years** since that, already?*)

Unsolicited, I'd [written up my own newly digital experiences][mine].  There I was, in the fourth grade, reverse-engineering the C64 kernel from a disassembly dump of the 6502 code I'd printed out.  I can't say it really hurt my chances with the girls, though.  On the contrary, [it eventually attracted just the right one][girl].
