It's been awhile since I was last very active on IRC.  For awhile, you could find me squatting in <a href="http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi">#joiito</a> along with a smattering of other channels.  Needing focus at work during the day, and for writing during the night, I just kind of dropped off the face of the networks.  

Thanks to <a href="http://dircproxy.securiweb.net/">dircproxy</a> and a machine with a very high uptime, though, my nick kind of lingered zombie-like.  The lights were on, but I wasn't home.  I've dropped in from time to time over the past few months, but things always seem dead compared to when I was frequenting as a regular.  Maybe the party moved on and I just didn't follow it.  These things seem to go in waves.
