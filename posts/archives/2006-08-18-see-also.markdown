I love the lazyweb - [post a gripe](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/17/dont-ask-me-who-i-am), get a dozen or more helpful responses.  At [Terrell Russell's suggestion](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/17/dont-ask-me-who-i-am#comment-33167) I just signed up [at claimID](http://claimid.com/lmorchard), and dropped in the WP widget under the ["See Also" header](#claimid) over there in the sidebar.  I'm getting ideas from this, but not sure what I might do with them.
