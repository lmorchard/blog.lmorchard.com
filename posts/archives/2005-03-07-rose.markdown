I hate to admit it, but I've seen the leaked premier.  After reading [the glowing review on Warren Ellis' blog][we], I couldn't resist.  
  
  Within the first 15 minutes, I knew what I was watching.  (And, in fact, I recognized [the Autons][autons]!)  Other than the lack of a long coat, big hair, and scarf, this guy is him.  (Though, I don't think I'll be shaving my head to continue [my fashion tutelage][fashion].)
  
  It's like things picked up right where they left off--cheesy plot, goofy incidental music, sonic screwdriver, and all.  Most important of all: I'm so glad that it didn't get a revival by way of an American studio, although I do wish it'd gotten picked up by the SciFi Channel.
  
  Just as soon as there's a DVD for sale, I'll be ordering it.  I don't suppose they take foriegn donations?  Or maybe I could just pay off some Briton to offset the taxes or license fees they paid to support the show's production?  I don't even care if this was [a promotional stunt][stunt].
