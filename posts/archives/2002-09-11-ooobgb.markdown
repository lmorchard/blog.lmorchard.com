<p>Neat!  I love the blogosphere.  Bryce is <a href="http://radio.ntwizards.net/2002/09/10.html#a976">attempting to implement</a> what <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000270.phtml#000270">I'd babbled about</a> last week: <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlogWalking">BlogWalking</a> with a Zaurus.  I'm still saving my pennies, and I've yet to acquire a Zaurus of my own.  So, I'll be watching this experiment eagerly.</p>
<p>I don't expect it to be perfect or necessarily go smoothly, but it's a first step.  Someone had mentioned that a PDA is inappropriate to host something like <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType">MovableType</a>, since it's usually off or easy to lose.  Personally, I want to head toward having an easily wearable or pocketable device that contains (or at least has seamless access to) all my personal data, so a PDA seems ideal to me.  However, maybe a large server at  home behind my cable modem would work better as a personal data sink, with the the PDA being more like a personal data <i>buffer</i>.  This was suggested in comments on my previous entry as well, I believe.</p>
<p>So, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType">MovableType</a> itself on a PDA and paired with rsync may or may not be nifty in the end.  I'd like to try it, and then maybe think about doing something like a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BloggerAPI">BloggerAPI</a> / metaWeblogAPI client that can buffer up entries and fire off the XML-RPC calls at a given sync time.</p>
<p>Hmm...  more to think about.</p>
