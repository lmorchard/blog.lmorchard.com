<p>Neat!  Now...  can we do something about making access to those services a bit more prominent?  System-wide functions buried in a menu obscurely labeled "Services" under an app-specific menu label doesn't seem very inviting or intuitive.  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AppleScript">AppleScript</a> gets insanely better treatment than this.  I'd like to see these services pushed just as far forward, and more easily discoverable.  It's been awhile since I played in Cocoa, but for awhile I was wondering if rearrange things a bit, maybe pull the service items for the currently active app into a menu extra or something.  Or, at least pull the menu up a level, maybe stick it next to the "Script" where appropriate.  And, I'd love to be able to customize the keyboard shortcuts assigned to them - some have shortcuts and I'll rarely use them, while others have no shortcut and I wish I could use them all the time.</p>
<p>It's good stuff, Apple, show it off.</p>

            <div class="content">Hey, if you want to do a cocoa project to make services more visible, you might want to take a look at one of my old projects - I called it Self Service. http://disco.ucsd.edu/blog/computers/apps/SelfService 

The idea was to make Services into floating windows that you could drag and drop to. It works fine, but I keep forgetting to use it. (And Safari doesn't have a service)

If you want the code, just ask.</div>
