<p>With regard to some new things in <a href="http://bitworking.org/Aggie.html">Aggie</a>, <a href="http://chris.wiw.org/2002/06/05#200206051930">Chris Heschong writes</a>: "<i>If only Microsoft (or Mono would get a .NET runtime out for <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOSX">MacOSX</a>.</i>"  I say, "Ditto."  I'd like to play with Aggie, and .NET for that matter (evil empire notwithstanding), but I don't really use Windows on a daily basis anymore (evil empire withstanding).  I have a box at home running <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP">WinXP</a>, but I only really use it for games (less often these days), and for recording my shows.  The rest of my daily use machines are either Linux or OS X.  Hmph.</p>

            <div class="content">Have you tried compiling Mono on OS X?

There's a good chance that much of it will compile.  Of course there are big bits of the class library that are yet to implement, but you may find that some C# code will run.

(System.Windows.Forms is the most notable omission - currently you can make desktop apps with Gtk# and run them with the Mono interpreter, but the plan is to make S.W.F a wrapper for Gtk#.  Not yet though.)</div>

            <div class="content">Hmm.  I haven't tried compiling it yet, no.  I should try.  My laziness threshold toward .NET so far has been just waiting for someone else to try it and talk about it :)</div>
