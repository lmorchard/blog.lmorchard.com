<blockquote cite="http://vrypan.net/log/archives/2006/01/19/delicious-as-fedd-manager/">As far as I know, the most popular link managment tool is del.icio.us, a tool I love for its power and simplicity. del.icio.us allow you to export all your links in RSS which is cool. So, I wrote a quick and dirty PHP script that converts this RSS export to an OPML list (see at the end of this post).</blockquote>

I haven't had much chance to dig into Dave Winer's new [newsRiver][nr] tool for the [OPML Editor][opml], but I've at least installed it and nodded at it.  It's not much more than the aggregator I used to use in Radio—but the big difference is the [promise of fresh new development][dave].

And yeah, I know, I [groused about OPML versus XOXO][gro] not more than a few months ago.  But, although I still would prefer cool things being done in XOXO, Reading Lists (in OPML) would appear to be one way to get [the stratified River of News][sron] that I'm looking for.  That is, a Reading List can be a news strata in an aggregator.

But, beyond my prioritized folders in NetNewsWire, a Reading List in OPML can be ***serialized*** and ***shared*** and ***subscribed***.  Yeah, aggregators can already import and export OPML subscription lists—but I've never seen this feature *automated by subscription* until now.    This is the difference between an MP3 download and a **podcast**.

And, if you check out the above-quoted blog post, these could even be *collaboratively maintained* by way of del.icio.us and a simple RSS-to-OPML gateway service.  I've got to say, this could be one of the niftiest bits of mojo to hit syndication and aggregation tech in awhile.
