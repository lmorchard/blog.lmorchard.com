I haven't really gotten around to making [that blogroll I was promising][blogroll].  But, for the hell of it, I tried cleaning up an OPML export from my aggregator to remove my private feeds and for-pay feedsâ€”which, incidentally and unfortunately were some of my most interesting feeds.

But, that said,  here's [my feedroll][fh].  It's the result of some more [URL-line magic][ul]:

* Take one OPML file: [feedroll.opml][opml]
* Grab this XSLT: [opml-to-hblogroll.xsl][hblog]
* Run them both through the [W3C XSLT Service][xsl] to get this: [feedroll.xhtml][run]
* Got some OPML on the web?  Paste your URL here and hit return:
  <form action="http://www.w3.org/2000/06/webdata/xslt" action="GET"><input type="hidden" name="xslfile" value="http://decafbad.com/2005/11/gopher-ng/opml-to-hblogroll.xsl" /><input type="text" name="xmlfile" size="45" value="http://www.opmlmanager.com/opml/alexbarnett.opml" /><input type="hidden" name="transform" value="Submit" /></form><small>Note: Doesn't like OPML that's invalid XML.</small>

If I were less lazy, I'd've included some unobtrusive JavaScript to give this thing expand/collapse handles.  And, I'd also like to work on making it less of a cluttered and raw mess.  So, it's not quite yet what I'd like to share as a proper blogroll.

But, for what it's worth, view source on that feedroll.  I came up with a tentative "hBlogroll" microformat for it, based on XOXO and some OPML semantics.  I haven't written the code for it yet, but I imagine that this should be pretty easily parsed.
