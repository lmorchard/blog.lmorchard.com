excerpt: I tell ya, this is an idea that's catching.  Feeds go into a searchable
    stew, come back out as new synthetic feeds.  What comes out looks like
    what goes in, and there's a well-defined spec behind it.  Sprinkle in
    the elegance of loosely coupled UNIX pipelines and filters, REST interfaces,
    and XML tech like XSLT for munging, and you've got the makings of the
    next generation of syndication and XML feeds.

I've talked before about why I like Atom. It's because it's the fixed point around which all the rest can crystallise...</p>

One, that by using Atom as input format, you could simplify entry into this black-box system and use it, for example, on the receiving end of a UNIX pipe. Content on the source could be either straight Atom or come in some other form that would require transforming it into Atom, but that'd be easy to do, since transforming XML is pretty easy these days.

 Two, that by using Atom as the output format you'd have the same flexibility. To generate a feed if you wanted, or transform it into something else, say, a weblog.

So, first I discover [Urchin][urchin], and now I read [this][matt].  I tell ya, this is an idea that's catching.  Granted, Urchin's all about RSS, and [atomflow][atomflow] and [dbagg3][dbagg3] are all about Atom, but the spirit's the same:  

Feeds go into a searchable stew, come back out as new synthetic feeds.  What comes out looks like what goes in, and there's a well-defined spec behind it.  Sprinkle in the elegance of loosely coupled UNIX pipelines and filters, REST interfaces, and XML tech like XSLT for munging, and you've got the makings of the next generation of syndication and XML feeds.

I guess maybe I should start checking into this Java stuff again, since smart guys like [Diego][diego] and [Matt][matt] are making noises I like, over in that sandbox.  Well, at least I'll have things like [Jython][jython], [Beanshell][beanshell], and [Groovy][groovy] to toy with over there.  And it's not like I haven't [played with Java][agentfrank] before.

So who else has something like this brewing?

            <div class="content">AtomFlow really sound like an nice proof of concept to me. Interestingly (talk of synchronicity) Kottkes "Noodlings" (http://www.kottke.org/04/08/web-platform) inspired me to a similar concept, which I'm trying to demo together with a few friends. We would very much appreciate your suggestions/comments on the concept especially because dbagg looks like a nice "persistent storage" for aggregating feeds and - together with the tools you showed in the post "Introducing dbagg3, an Atom-powered client/server aggregator" should also be usable as a kind of debugger for feed-munching tools ...
