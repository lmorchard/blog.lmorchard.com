<blockquote cite="http://www.flickr.com/photos/plasticbag/63592141/in/photostream/">Funny story - it looks like you'd pull this door, but actually you have to push it. I got confused and thought it was engaged and stood outside for thirty seconds before accidentally pushing.</blockquote>

This gave me an idea for a scifi story:  One day, you wake up and find that nothing seems to work right.  All the affordances you've been used to from everyday things have flip flopped, and all the little things no longer make sense.  Pretty dumb / silly, but might make for a good Twilight-Zone-style story.

            <div class="content"><p>Ever since I learned about affordances and such in my senior design class, I can't help but notice when the cues are wrong/missing in buildings/objects/software.  It's uncanny how many things are just terribly designed in the most basic ways.</p>

<p>Take for instance the iPod nano click wheel. The center button and wheel are both smooth and at the same elevation -- I can't use it without looking at it! Luckily the little adhesive protective thing I put on has a raised center over the click wheel -- an intentional feature so that I can now feel where it is.  This is especially important because I like to wear it under my shirt on the lanyard phones all of the time, and operate it through the shirt.</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>@Hadley: That's the first thing that hit me, too. When I moved to Germany, I noticed the light switches were upside down, as well as all switches on, for example, coffee machines.  You push them up to turn them off.  Also, the titles on the spines of books are written from bottom to top, so you have to tilt your head to the left to read them.  Then there's the whole using a comma for a decimal point thing, and periods for thousands-separators.  And the ginormous electric plugs.  </p>
