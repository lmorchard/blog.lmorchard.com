   <li>4/6/02; 6:51:52 PM by LMO -- Outline diffs and Jabber?</li>
      <ul>
      <li>Is Jeremy Bowers doing outline diffs as a Jabber conference?</li>
         <ul>

         </ul>
      <li>If so...  <b>WOW</b>.</li>
      </ul>
   <li>4/6/02; 4:58:40 PM by LMO -- Comments in my buddy list</li>
      <ul>
      <li>So I hope this doesn't break anything.</li>
      <li>I did a "Get Info" on a few of my buddies in my list, and edited the author line to add some parenthetical comments.  Just a note on why I'm interested in this buddy's outline.</li>
      <li>It seems to work without a problem, and the note appears when next the buddy updates his or her outline.</li>
      <li>Seems like this needs a more accessible UI.  Like...  how about allowing me to edit the names right in my buddy list?</li>
      </ul>
   <li>4/6/02; 4:55:12 PM by LMO -- Auto-archiving script?</li>
      <ul>
      <li>Just got around to splitting off the last week or so's archives into separate files.  There's got to be a better way.  I wonder how hard it would be to make a script that does it nightly, or at least with a high degree of automation after being pointed at a branch of my outline?</li>
      </ul>
   </ul>
