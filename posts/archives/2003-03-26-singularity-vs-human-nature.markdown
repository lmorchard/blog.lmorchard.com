Apologies in advance if this post-cum-essay runs a bit long...

<blockquote cite="http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/humanity/brainbuilder.html?id=8Mir9Pz5">We could conclude that modern human intelligence is an unfinished product, and something that nature hasn't quite got around to polishing yet. The problem-solving intelligence part can be tuned and revved up to high levels, but it becomes unstable like early supersonic jet prototypes that shook themselves to pieces just after reaching the sound barrier. Nature has outstripped itself, producing a freak organism with a feature that's obscenely over-developed but under-refined. We've seen examples of evolution getting ahead of itself before, like the rapid conversion to an erect, bipedal skeletal frame without properly modifying the spine to withstand the back-aching load of pregnancy. To get a better grip of human failings, and human stupidity, you have to realize that modern Homo sapiens sapiens just isn't done yet.</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/technology/mediated.html?id=AtW2JdUp">When our own instincts are inadequate, or become a hazard, and the surrogate activities to control them aren't sufficient anymore, then there certainly will be a push to change human nature to fit his new, self-crafted niche. And the answer to my original question?that man will invent something that knocks him out of his niche with fatal consequences?is yes. Homo sapien will die, and homo modified will inherit the earth.</blockquote>

There's only an essay or two per month published over at Disenchanted,
but they're gems, each and every one.  And what I read almost never
fails to resonate with something I've been thinking or musing about,
from my perspective as a geek wondering about life, the universe, and
everything and as a fan of Kurzweil, Vinge, and all of post-humanity.
But my anticipation of the Singularity is constantly swayed by things
such as the theses of the above quoted essays.
<br /><br />
See, as an irredeemable believer in the ways of better living through
technology, I look forward to our increasing ability to further
self-improve and bootstrap to higher levels of living, longevity,
ability, understanding, and exploration.  But, there's a neopagan
mystic and naturalist in me who keeps looking for the catch.  There
must be natural limits we don't yet understand.
<br /><br />
No matter the precocious cleverness of our species, there's got to be
plenty of good reasons it takes millions of years to achieve progress
in forms and patterns of life.  There are lots of little subtle
details to be easily missed.  We're smart, but not yet endowed with
the patience and wisdom that eternity grants.  I both breathlessly
await and fear the arrival of our ability to fundamentally change
human nature directly through genetic manipulation and device
implantation.
<br /><br />
As the first essay quoted above asserts, I believe the human species
is unfinished.  But as with the second essay, I think we've outpaced
evolution in terms of changing the conditions under which the process
itself occurs.
<br /><br />
Just look around you.  You're likely indoors, in a building composed
of simple straight lines which register easily on your visual pattern
recognizers, with corridors and doorways and rooms proportioned to
your bodily dimensions.  The air is conditioned to your respiratory
and temperature tolerances.  Things are padded and accessible.  Food
and drink are likely plentiful.  The only predators you're likely to
meet up with during your day are of your own species.  Nothing really
challenges your basic nature.
<br /><br />
Yet, this is just what the universe has been doing to forms of life
throughout the history of evolution.  Only now, we've jumped the
tracks, reversed the flow of control, and have reshaped our corner of
the universe to fit our status quo.  So, where does that leave the
natural process of evolution with regard to us?  Stopped or slowed to
a crawl, that's where.  Maybe falling backward, since we have
prosthetics, glasses, and other forms of propping up imperfections
that would have otherwise been faced with disincentives by natural
selection.
<br /><br />
So, where are we without a natural evolution?  We're left as an
unfinished species, with a peculiar mix of awesome abilities matched
with amazing disabilities.  Very clever people, but with a lot of
blind spots.  There are certain ways in which it is very difficult and
sometimes nearly impossible for us to think.  We have biases toward
grouping things by similarity, dividing them by difference - which
allows for a very elegant economy of memory and thought, but allows
for peculiarly devastating things like racism and xenophobia.
Critical thinking is counterintuitive, yet is one of our most powerful
tools.
<br /><br />
And there are definite flaws in our perceptions of reality, as any
book of optical illusions will tell you.  One thing that struck me
like a thunderbolt came from a human biology class: Ever try following
a common housefly with your eyes?  Isn't it frustrating how it just
seems to <strong>vanish</strong> from your sight?  I can't find a reference to back
me up, so this is just from memory: I was taught that flies have
developed a particularly zig-zaggy and erratic flight pattern to evade
just our kind of mammalian vision system.  But, studies of fly-eating
frogs have shown that their vision systems appear particularly tweaked
to react to a fly's midair dance.  Imagine what else slips past us, or
comes to our attention garbled because our very apparatus contains
biases of which we're yet to even conceive?
<br /><br />
Here we are, then, flawed and incomplete yet with a growing ability to
self-modify.  As an amateur computer scientist, I shudder a bit at any
code that's self-modifying.  It can be done, and it can be powerfully
enabling, but it's just so damn easy to blow a foot off with the
technique.  So too with ourselves, then.  There's a possiblity that we
can push ourselves into a richer level of thought and perception and
ability without destroying ourselves completely.  But, we're going to
miss things, important things.
<br /><br />
If we're lucky, we'll roll with it and survive.  But, as the second
Disenchanted essay explores, we'll most certainly render the species
as we know it extinct, and push ourselves our of a natural niche and
into a wholly artificial niche in need of perpetual maintenance and
renewal.  Maybe this artifical niche will be easily sustained and
portable enough to take with us if we want to leave the planet.  On
the other hand, maybe this artificial niche will prove our undoing as
it outstrips our ability to keep it up.
<br /><br />
So, given all this, I think the inevitable predicted verticality of
the Singularity's curve has an incredibly strong counter-force
stemming from human nature itself.  What does this mean?  Not sure.
What to do?  Not sure.  But it tells me that the Kurzweilan and
Vingian predictions of which I'm so fond face some severe reality
checks.
<br /><br />
More thinking to do.  Thanks to Disenchanted for making me think this
far today.  :)

            <div class="content">It occurs to me that creating a situation we're not entirely prepared to face would, in fact, be tantamount to forcing ourselves back into Darwinian evolution. There may be a holocaust, but I find it highly unlikely that there will be too few survivors for Earthly sentience to continue.

We may not like it very much. But then, neither did the trilobites. Just depends on how personally you take it all. And of course, as would any selfish little gene, I plan on doing my damnedest to figure out the niche.</div>

            <div class="content">I've been struggling with this idea for a while.

I've thought about learning some base-level skills such as hunting with bow or woodworking "just in case".

It does seem a matter of time until nuclear winter, airborne, long-incubating fatal virus, smart-enough microbes, or natural selection in the form of a cataclysm.

Agile development has taught me many things, and one of those is that communication and small changes are much more effective than isolation and marksmanship precision.

The human race has been shielding itself for a long time, and I suspect the potential difference will arc before we finish building our happy cocoon.

What to do?

It's a tough question.  Suggestions, such as "allow the diabetics to die", are viewed as morally flawed.  I am conflicted with myself over it, but really... are we -that- confident that we've got a handle on this whole thing?  

Aren't we better off with Darwinism (viz. agile evolution)?</div>

            <div class="content">Has anyone ever shouted FIRE in a crowded theatre?  How many people kept their calm and asked where it was?  
It puzzles me that we as a species are so fatally attracted to confidence; a single leader with charisma and conviction can take a group anywhere.  Obvious examples include Nazi Germany, Soviet Communism, American Democracy...  The idea that there is something fundamentally wrong with our society circulates in whispered tones, always hesitant lest we should say something immoral or politically incorrect.  I shudder to think of the barrage of hate mail when someone seriously suggests that we eliminate the diabetics ... and yet I also shudder to think what we will do when the man on horseback rides into our theatre and shouts "Darwin."</div>
