 <p>So, to anyone who's wondering about my <a href="http://del.icio.us/deusx/geotagged">recent flood of geotagged bookmarks on del.icio.us</a>, it's honeymoon research.  Sorry if it's getting annoying.  I've also been getting quite a lot of sudden mileage out of <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a>.</p>
 <p>But, for what it's worth, here's <a href="http://decafbad.com/2006/04/honeymoon/geotags.html">a sneak preview of a small project covered in Hacking del.icio.us</a>.  That is, a del.icio.us JSON and Google Maps API mashup.  We're using this to get a sense for where things are in town, and how to plan out the days.  And, yeah, I know:  I've run out of letters.  Ugh.</p>
