One of the ideas behind what I'm trying to do with this new WordPress install and the hacks I've done thus far is to treat categories as "classes" of posts and use tags for topical / conceptual organization of posts.  

So far I have what basically amount to essays and asides, but I'd like to move next into hReview posts and reintegrated links from del.icio.us.  And, hopefully, not too many people mind a more frequent posting stream from me (if I manage to keep it up, that is).
