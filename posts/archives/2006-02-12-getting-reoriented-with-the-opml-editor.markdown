*Let's see how this works.  I've been spewing over on my [OPML blog](http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/) for awhile today, and going to try pasting some excerpts here.*

As I play more with the <a href="http://support.opml.org">OPML Editor</a>, I wonder if I might not be able to mash it up with my <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog">WordPress</a> installation for more spontaneous editing of daily asides.  The wordpress.root tool isn't quite working for me, but I have a few ideas for alternatives or fixes.

It's been awhile since I seriously an outliner for blogging, if I ever really did.  I can see how it biases toward quick blogging and spew.  And that's a good thing.

I do wish that the OPML Editor had some modernized font handling on OS X, though, so my Georgia font looked anti-aliased in the outliner.  But alas, I don't know the first thing about getting that hacked into this tool.


Next, looking for the glossary table, so I can author my own things like... ";->"  Oh, yeah, there it is: <code>user.html.glossary</code>


Also, I've started keeping the OPML Editor open instead of Tinderbox.  And, while I don't get the richer visualization tools that Tinderbox offers, I <i>do</i> get a ton of nigh frictionless network connectivity via upstreaming and outline publishing.  So, I lose maps but I gain sharing.


On the down side, there's a ton of tinkerable code under the hood that I keep having to herd myself away from to get anything done on what I'm <i>supposed</i> to be accomplishing.  But, that's just a tinkerer's occupation hazard.


Let's see, what else?  I'm wishing for <a href="http://del.icio.us/deusx">my del.icio.us bookmarks</a> as an OPML outline now, so I have a palette from which to draw in composing little asides here.  I wonder if it'd be nasty to pipe some del.icio.us bookmarks into a Glossary?  I tried playing with <a href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/2006/02/07/delicious-reading-lists/">some XSLT found by way of Danny Ayers</a>, with <a href="http://decafbad.com/2006/02/delicious-to-full-opml.xsl">some tweaks of my own</a>, but I think it's producing OPML that gives the editor some indigestion.  (Danny's original XSLT seems to work, though.)
