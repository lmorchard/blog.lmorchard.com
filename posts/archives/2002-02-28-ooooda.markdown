Tweaking around some fonts, layout, etc.  Silly me, I've been looking at all of this in Mozilla and haven't touched IE in a week or two.  It wasn't pretty when I checked it out there.  If anyone ran screaming from this site in funky horror after looking at it in IE, I offer my apologies.  Now if only I can get MT to stop doing funky things with apostrophes.
<br /><br />
Working on the site design itself more, stripped away the frames (MT's pings to weblogs.com didn't like 'em anyway), having more <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI">SSI</a> fun, and generally trying to clean up the second level pages of the site (ie. individual story pages, etc.)  Next, I should be making pages to each individual category, if I can figure out what kind of seconday sidebar &amp;etc I want on those pages.  Obviously something more understated than the major sidebar on the front page.
<br /><br />
This is fun, my first website to actually be up and doing something, even if no one's paying attention yet :)
