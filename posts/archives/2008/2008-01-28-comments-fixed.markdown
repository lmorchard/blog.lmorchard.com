Oh, hey.  Nothing like putting out a request for comments and then learning that my comments are broken, and have been since I upgraded to WordPress from SVN.

Not that it's the fault of WordPress - I renamed my comment form on the filesystem and in my theme to obscure it from spambots, but then blew away the renamed PHP file with the SVN upgrade.  Blah.

<p>http://decafbad.com/blog/feed</p>

<p>Sorry about that!  I suspect one of the feeds clobbered after getting my accumulator running had once upon a time been a feed of just my blog entries.</p>

<p>I should take a look at backing that out, since I'm guessing if you took the time to comment on it there at at least a handful more who were annoyed enough to just quietly unsub.</p></div>
