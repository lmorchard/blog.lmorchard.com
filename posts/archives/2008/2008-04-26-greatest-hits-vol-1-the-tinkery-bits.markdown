As you may have noticed, I've been shaking things up around here a little.  Sorry for turbulence in the feeds!  I've moved to a new server, and I've been trying out Movable Type again, but with mixed luck.

Why?  Because I've been using WordPress for a few years, and I felt like a change.  Maybe in another few months I'll convert over to [Blosxom](http://www.blosxom.com/) again, or try [ExpressionEngine](http://expressionengine.com/) for the first time.  Now, if only I could get all the timestamps right so some of my late-night posts don't have broken permalinks due to day changes.  Maybe I'll end up just sticking with WordPress after all.

But anyway, I'm also having [another bout][navel1] of [periodic existential doubt][navel2] about what I'm doing here with a blog.  So, in navel-gaze mode, I spent time a few nights ago skimming and reading through all 1000 or so entries I've written here.  I do this periodically with the scores of paper journals I've accumulated to recenter and reconnect with myself, but I've never done it here.

So, for my own reference more than anything, here's 0xDECAFBAD Greatest Hits Vol 1, the Tinkery Bits.  

It may be presumptuous to ask, but if anyone actually reads through this list and thinks of something worth surfacing that I missed—by all means, let me know.  I'm trying to remind myself what I started this thing for.
