So after taking a lazy look at a variety of smartphones and whatnot for my next upgrade, I figured that I just couldn't beat this cheap Centro, and so far I've not been disappointed.

That's partially because it's cheap, and partially because Palms and Handsprings have been my main mobile platform for almost a decade now.  Seeing as my last one was a Treo 600, this thing is a big upgrade.

Now, let's see how well this blog-by-email thing works.
