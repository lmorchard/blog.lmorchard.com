Following right on the heels of [Greatest Hits Vol. 1](http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/04/26/greatest-hits-vol-1-the-tinkery-bits) is another volume, this time including the entries that were more made of babble or ramble and not so much with code.  Again I welcome additions, comments, criticisms, and complaints.
