<p>I installed Mac OS X Leopard back in November, and up until the end of January I'd been getting reliable backups from Time Machine.  At that point, for some reason, it stopped working silently and I found out about it with a message dialog 10 days later.  Coincidentally, shortly thereafter I needed to completely restore from backup.  So, 10 days in the past was better than nothing, and that restore worked.  </p>
<p>Since then, though, I can't seem to get Time Machine working again after the restore.  I've tried via AFP network share, I've tried with a drive hooked straight up to the machine, I've wiped all existing backups and tried starting with a fresh drive&mdash;basically I feel like I've tried every combination afforded by the black box, and it always seems to fail partway through.</p>
<p>Today, this is the cherry on top:</p>
