 <p>Oh yeah, and "<a href="http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/03/01/opml-20/">Today the public review of OPML 2.0 begins</a>"</p>
 <p>I don't know what I'm doing, posting to the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/opml2-review/messages">OPML 2.0 spec review mailing list</a>.  I've stayed out of all spec and format discussions on general principle so far, avoiding the Atom process like the plague.  Life's too short for sausage making, I believe in general.  But, maybe this OPML thing will be different.</p>
