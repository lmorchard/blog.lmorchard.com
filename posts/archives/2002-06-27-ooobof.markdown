<p>So I broke down finally, and bought a digital camera.  The excuse ends up being that I'll be needing it on my <a href="http://www.synthpopgoestheworld.com">trip to Toronto this weekend</a>.  I got a <a href="http://www.powershot.com/powershot2/s200/">Canon <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/PowerShot?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">PowerShot</font></span> S200</a>, a 128MB CF card, the belt case, and two extra batteries.  That should be enough to cover a rampant nerd photography spree.</p>
<p>I love this little thing, and I've been going insane with it.  After some twiddling and organizing in <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphoto/">iPhoto</a>, I uploaded a metric ton of photos and grabbed <a href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net">Gallery from <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/SourceForge?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">SourceForge</font></span></a> to show them off in the new <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/gallery/">0xDECAFBAD Gallery</a>. </p>
<p>Then, I stuck a lil <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP">PHP</a> block that rotates random thumbnail images from the gallery into my busy and crowded right-side bar.  I can hear the woefully overburdened design of this site creaking and about to fall over.  So, next project in  a week or two is to tear this place apart and make it a bit easier on the eyes.</p>
<p>That is, after I take a few hundred more pictures.  Been thinking of joining one of those online DP clubs to play around in a photo scavenger hunt.</p>
<p>More soon.</p>
