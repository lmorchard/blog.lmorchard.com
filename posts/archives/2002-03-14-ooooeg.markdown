I need to get more active with the blog on this site.  I've been kind of holding back due to lack of a few blogging tools I wanted to work within (ie. <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogMulticaster">WeblogMulticaster</a> for one,  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/GroupWeblogWithRadioUserLand">GroupWeblogWithRadioUserLand</a> for another), but I really need to start making this place more worth visiting.
<br /><br />
So, if I can get my butt moving, I'll start babbling more into the Tech category and maybe create a few more categories.  I'll also try giving access to the categories split out into their own <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> streams and maybe bring more of my personal spews over on <a href="http://deus-x.livejournal.com" target="_top">http://deus-x.livejournal.com</a> into the fold here.
