* I'm not supposed to [link to this column by Bill O'Reilly][bor]--[here's why.][borwhy]

* About Podcasts, [Bill Seitz rants][brant]: 

  > alternative idea for filling your dead passive-listening time - have software to generate speech from RSS and make that into an MP3 file

  This makes me giggle because, well, it's one of the hacks I wrote up for my book, last week.  I probably need to edit things, but I hope the goofiness and sheer hack value comes through. 
  
* Speaking of Podcasts:  Check out the [Battlestar Galactica Podcast][bgal].  It's like getting the DVD commentary track, but about a year early.  Finally, my hunch is confirmed that Battlestar Galactica's opening sequence with episode preview is "an homage to Space 1999".

* Lately, my favorite thing to toss back at Podcast naysayers: Dismissing Podcasts because of issues of quality or amateurism is like dismissing eBay because people try [selling their used sneakers][sneakers] there.

  Meanwhile, I've just about got a full commute to and from work filled with pretty good quality content--or at least decently entertaining content (to me)--to the point that I've almost stopped listening to NPR.  Also, it's becoming a rapidly heating issue at work--not sure if it will go where I hope it does, but I've started getting drafted to educate some co-workers in other departments.

            <div class="content">I haven't been able to find much in the way of podcasts that I enjoy nearly as much as National Public Radio from end to end.  But I really like the other aspects of podcasting: timeshifting, listen anywhere you have your iPod, etc.

So, I created an application to help me listen to NPR on my iPod.  Let me know what you think.  I have the initial exploratory announcement on my website ->  http://cleverdevil.org</div>
