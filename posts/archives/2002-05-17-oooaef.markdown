<p>Oh... I'm looking around for some sample code &amp; docs for this, but maybe someone out there could drop me a few quick pointers:</p>
<p>I'm using Mac OS X.  I have a <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/audio/imic_main.html">Griffin iMic</a> and a <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/usb/dsbr100/">D-Link USB Radio</a>.  I can control the radio with <a href="http://www.pth.com/DSBRTuner/">DSBRTuner</a> (with source code!)  I thought that <i>that</i> would be the hard part.  Now, what I want is a simple way to record sound to disk in AIFF format, preferably from the command line or at least with source code.  I've tried a few other sound recording apps, but they're all mostly inadequate and overkill at the same time.  Most of them won't record to disk, so capturing 4 hours of audio into memory hurts a lot.</p>
<p>I want to, in part, record radio shows with cron jobs.  This shouldn't be rocket science.  So, anyone know how to write a simple audio-to-disk app for OS X?</p>
