 <p>I was chatting briefly with <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/vacuum/">Ed</a> last night about chatbots and Jabber.  And, apropos my recent enthusiasm for the OPML Editor platform, it's just come back to me:  <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/tcpIm">Frontier and Radio UserLand have support for instant messaging via AIM and Jabber</a>.  I wonder how up-to-date that support is in the OPML Editor?  It's like 2002 all over again.</p>

            <div class="content"><p>hm, the first bit of the example works, and then it talks about needing to "jump"" somewhere to update a table.  </p>

<p>ah, jump is in the programmer's menu...hold on - there's something herem, but there was nothing simple that made it work the first time around.  someone else will need to dive in.</p></div>
