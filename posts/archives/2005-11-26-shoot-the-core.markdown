I spent an hour or two this morning relaxing, playing a few classic arcade shoot-'em-ups by way of emulation.  However, the unfortunate side effect of pumping an unlimited stream of quarters into games like [DoDonPachi II][ddp], [Mahou Daisakusen][md], [Esprade][esp], and [Mars Matrix][mm] is that I have perpetual blossoms of blue and pink neon bullet patterns spreading behind my eyelids whenever I blink.
