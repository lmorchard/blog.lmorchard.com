What I'd like to do is set one of them to behave as a second mouse button. That sounds like it should be possible. All of the usual suspects have thus far failed me.

            <div class="content">I imagine having the left button only available from tapping would make dragging operations tricky. My touchpad (on a PC) has a tap-and-drag feature but I'm pretty hit-and-miss on successfully performing the maneuver and have it disabled because I'm always accidentally triggering it. Do Macs do tap-and-drag too?

I guess Macs don't have a "right-click drag" maneuver as Windows does, so the tap could be the right button, but that would just freak me out.

My touchpad driver has a feature where it picks up a finger moving up and down the right edge and scrolls in response, which I think is much nicer than using a scrollwheel on a mouse. I keep doing it on my friend's iBook and wondering why it isn't working :)</div>
