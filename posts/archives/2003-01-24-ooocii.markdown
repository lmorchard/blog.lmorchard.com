title: Super-lazy link blogging & in-bookmarks RSS aggregation via AppleScript?

<p>And one more post for the night:  I wish Safari gave <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AppleScript">AppleScript</a> access to read and manipulate bookmarks.  If it does, I can't find it.  I've been playing around with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AppleScript">AppleScript</a> folder actions, <a href="http://interconnected.org/notes/2003/01/Lazy_MacOSX_Weblogging_1.shtml" target="_top">Matt Webb's link blogging folder hack</a>, and <a href="http://www.webentourage.com/blogscript.php" target="_top">BlogScript</a>.  I've been thinking, for good or bad, I'd like to do more link blogging.  Well, in Safari, I've created a toolbar bookmark folder called "READ/BLOG QUEUE" into which I drop links for later reading and/or blogging.</p>
<p>So...  If I could get at that bookmark folder via <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AppleScript">AppleScript</a>, I could schedule and generate a templated blog entry for auto-posting every night, listing just the links I've left in that bookmark folder, and clear it out when it's all done.  I <strong>could</strong> do the same thing with just a Folder Action enabled desktop folder, but it's just so much more convenient to drop things on the toolbar.</p>
<p>And then, there's the other wild idea I'd use scriptable bookmarks for:  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> aggregation.  Imagine bookmark folders dynamically generated and updated from <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feeds.  Maybe even one big bookmark folder with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> items aggregated from many feeds.  This seems somewhat appealing to me.</p>
