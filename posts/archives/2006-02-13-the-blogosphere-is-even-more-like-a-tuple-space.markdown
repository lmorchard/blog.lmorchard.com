The idea's been bouncing around my head more and more lately: <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/12/the-blogosphere-as-a-tuple-space">The blogosphere is like a tuple space.</a>

I'm pushing tuples via outline nodes and essays, augmented by tagging and suchlike.  You're matching tuples by way of Technorati, Feedster, FeedBurner, and coComment RSS feeds.  We can all be <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/07/29/kibo-kibo-kibo">Kibo</a> now.

The more we can extend executable representations of our mental <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Abaleen">baleen</a> out into the web, the more relevancy comes to us.  It makes no sense to expect all of a person's blogging output to make sense to you - if someone goes "off topic" on their own blog, it's likely that they're just pushing tuples that don't match your patterns.  But, they probably match <i>someone's</i> patterns out there.

In fact, watching individual blogs may start making less sense if people were to start authoring for the tuple space directly.  That is, posting thoughts without constriction to topic, relying on filters elsewhere to sort things out for a non-premeditated audience.

These are all just kind of fragmentary thoughts that I'd like to elaborate further, but I needed to get this tuple out of my head for now.

Although, "deusx" is still pretty widespread in its attachment to me.</p></div>
