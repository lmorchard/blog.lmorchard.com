So, yeah, I had some spare time at lunch and I started expanding [my little XOXO linked outlines thing][xoxo] into a more fully-fledged [Gopher NG][gng] with [OPML support][xto].  But, I'm not sure if I'll really do much more with it.  It started on a lark, really.  But after awhile, I realized that I don't have any use for it other than as an interesting exercise.  Moving along...
