I doubt that I have much of an audience yet, still, so I suppose this will be just thinking out loud... but hey, that's pretty much the express purpose of this site.  The historical context is useful, nonetheless.
<br /><br />
Speaking of the purpose of this site: what about the purpose of this weblog?  Should this just be for general site news and calls-to-attention, or should I start all out nerdy musing about tech and what's going on out there?  I'm thinking the latter, since any glance at the wiki's <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RecentChanges">RecentChanges</a> will get you that.
<br /><br />
I have a half-thought notion that I might enfold more people into 0xDECAFBAD eventually, so I'd like to keep the place from being <i>too</i> centered on <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LesOrchard">l.m.orchard</a>, but seeing as I'm the only denizen here for now, it will be. 
<br /><br />
So, maybe I should elucidate a bit within the site purpose up there in the corner.  This is a place for exposed thought processes about developing technologies.  Developing being used in a double meaning here-- both as an adjective and as verb.  
<br /><br />
<b><i>The purpose of 0xDECAFBAD lies in both discussing the state of and participating in the process of technology building.</i></b>
<br /><br />
How's that?  Great.  (Suggest refinements, if you like.)  Now...  "technology" is a fairly broad topic.  <i>What</i> technology, exactly?
<br /><br />
Seeing as I am the sole dictator of the site's direction so far, I will define this to be technologies that suit my fancy.  This, however is no definition-- it's more of a redirection.  A see also.  So, what technologies, in particular?  Here's a list off the cuff:<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Collaboration">Collaboration</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WritingOnTheWeb">WritingOnTheWeb</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/InformationManagement">InformationManagement</a></li>
<li><a href="<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/KnowledgeManagement">KnowledgeManagement</a></li>
</ul>This probably needs some fleshing out.  In general, the focus is on web and internet tech with a lean toward that which enables human beings to work with information and each other.  Mainly, I'm interested in <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PowerToThePeople">PowerToThePeople</a> rather than <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TechQuaTech">TechQuaTech</a>.
<br /><br />
How's that for a start?
