I like animals, and I&#8217;ve been told that I&#8217;m good with them. I&#8217;d like to think that&#8217;s due to a mix of empathy and respect that I&#8217;ve developed over the years.

It occurred to me the other day that my favorite online services treat me like I imagine my pets like to be treated.

It might be worth noting we have cats and rabbits, which are both rather independent kinds of critters. That said, being treated like a pet might sound demeaning. But, consider these pointers for being nice to animals:

*   Give them a reason to come to you. Don&#8217;t chase after and grab.
*   If they want to leave, let them. Don&#8217;t hold on and squeeze tight.
*   If you are allowed to pick them up, hold them gently yet offer enough support to make them feel safe.
*   Pay attention to their reactions, learn what kind of attention they like. This gives them a reason to come back when you let them leave.

Consider the above with respect to [Dropbox][1], a service I use more every day:

*   They give me a place to put my files, like a thumb drive installed all the time on all my computers regardless of vendor or OS.
*   I can quit Dropbox whenever I want &#8211; all my files are safe on multiple hard drives, and won&#8217;t disappear if Dropbox goes away.
*   Dropbox has never lost a file, never spammed me, never done anything that suggested they&#8217;re spying on me. I mean, they could, but they haven&#8217;t. I also asked a support question once &#8211; they answered it.
*   The people at Dropbox keep doing more of the above, and releasing things like [the JavaScript API][2] that makes them useful for <a target="_blank" title="web apps" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Apps?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn">web apps</a> I like building.

I can tell a similar story about [Disqus][3], the service I use for comments here:

*   Disqus takes care of my comments and keep spam away. They were easy to set up with a WordPress plugin.
*   The [official WordPress plugin][4] mirrors every comment into my site&#8217;s database. I can turn off the service at any moment without a problem.
*   Disqus [does run some advertising and off-site recommendations alongside my content][5]. But, even though I could turn it off, I haven&#8217;t because it seems like a genuinely interesting aspect of the service. They&#8217;re also quick to answer questions.
*   Disqus continues to work well, add features I like, and have yet to disappoint me.

Now, how about [Evernote][6]? They&#8217;re neck-and-neck with Dropbox for me:

*   They store all my random thoughts & notes, make them available on all my computers regardless of vendor or OS.
*   I can backup or export my notes and quit whenever I want, and they&#8217;re stored on all my computers.
*   Evernote hasn&#8217;t done anything nasty with my notes, and have only ever made gentle suggestions that I pay or use other services.
*   The Evernote team just keep improving things &#8211; and every time I switch to something like [Notational Velocity on Dropbox][7], I find myself coming back.

So, that&#8217;s it: Just a quick handful of thoughts that occurred to me when I was on a walk. I&#8217;m not entirely sure how this translates into execution and a successful business, but I know I like it when it works out this way.

Might be interesting to muse on this further: Sometimes being treated like a pet is a trap. Sometimes it&#8217;s demeaning. I&#8217;m not entirely sure it&#8217;s a good thing all the time, mostly my point in this post is to describe the feeling.
