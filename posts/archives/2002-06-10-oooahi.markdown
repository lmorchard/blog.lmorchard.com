<p>Awhile back, I <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000142.phtml#000142">was musing</a> about linksback, robots, and the web semantic - and to my dumb idea about scraping metadata from HTML comments, <a href="http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki">Bill Seitz</a> recommended I put my metadata into meta tags in the HTML header.  Duh.  So today, I pick up this post by <a href="http://www.syndic8.com/~wkearney/blogs/syndic8/">Bill Kearney</a> on "<a href="http://www.syndic8.com/~wkearney/blogs/syndic8/archives/000020.html#000020">Real Neighborhoods</a>" via <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/2002/06/09.html#a2227">Jenny Levine</a>.  (Man do I enjoy being fed by her site!  She gives me a whole new respect for librarians.)</p>
<p>So it's likely not news to you, and there's probably been talk about it already, but I just caught on to <a href="http://www.syndic8.com/help_metadata.php">Syndic8.com's metadata support</a>.  Brilliant.  I need to dig into the <a href="http://www.purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements">Dublin Core elements</a> more, as well as other attributes to put in meta tags, but I think this would be another great addition to weblog software out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>Lower the laziness threshold for managing this meta data, increase the ubiquity and coverage, and spread another layer of tasty goodness on the <a href="http://www.microcontentnews.com/articles/blogosphere.htm">blogosphere</a>.</p>
<p>What's next?</p>
