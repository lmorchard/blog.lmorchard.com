<p>Found these hot little things <a href="http://philringnalda.com/archives/002218.php">via Phil Ringnalda</a> and <a href="http://matt.griffith.com/weblog/2002/05/31.html#a65">via Matt Griffith</a>: Mark Pilgrim's <a href="http://diveintomark.org/projects/autorss/amphetadesk.html">Amphetadesk Auto-subscribe bookmarklet</a> and <a href="http://diveintomark.org/projects/autorss/radio.html">Radio auto-subscribe bookmarklet</a>.  So, now when you visit the site of someone who's <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000170.phtml#000170">joined the  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> autodiscovery via HTML LINK element bandwagon</a>, you can snag their <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feed into your aggregator.</p>
<p>This makes me really want to get back to studying some in-browser scripting and DOM manipulation.  It's been awhile since I played with that, and I see <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000166.phtml#000166">more cool things</a> done with it all the time.</p>
<p>Tasty.  Now I just have to wrap a few more things up, and I'll hopefully be contributing an updated Cocoa-based OS X faceplate/installer for <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk">AmphetaDesk</a> to <a href="http://www.disobey.com/about/morbus.shtml">Morbus</a> before the weekend's out.</p>
