No, 0xDECAFBAD is not dead... it's just been left out of my pipeline stream.  I need to work it back in, otherwise this place will never do what I want it to.
<br /><br />
I've been doing most of my babbling <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/deus_x/radio">over here on my Radio weblog</a> and even more obscurely, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/deus_x/radio/instantOutliner/l.m.orchard.opml">over here in my Radio instant outline</a>, not to mention <a href="http://deus-x.livejournal.com/">over here on my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a></a>.
<br /><br />
Need to get all my tools and channels straight. :)
