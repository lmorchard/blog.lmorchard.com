After just [having proclaimed my effort toward maintaining focus][focus], however, I couldn't resist letting these things slip out of my head:

* The new [ecto][ecto] is pretty sexy with its pre-Tiger hints and new icons, I must say.

* I really want to read [Practical Common Lisp][lisp].  My *meta-sense* is tingling.

* Whether good or bad, I've got almost month-old tabs sitting in [OmniWeb][ow].  In other browsers, this would have been inconceivable.  Barring an OS update, my trial period will be up before these tabs go away.
  
  On the bright side, those other browsers gave a sort of limited shelf life to things waiting for my perusal--between now and the next rude crash.  But now, they can just stick around until that scroll bar in the tab drawer gets too small for me to grab.

* [Greasemonkey][gm] has me wanting to switch back to Firefox, though.  That, and it has me wishing I knew enough about writing Firefox extensions to steal my favorite feature from OmniWeb: That being the tab drawer, of course.  

  I have doubts that I could replicate the page thumbnails--although I did have some odd thoughts of farming that out to some web service that took page snapshots.

* Another thought: Seems like things like [Greasemonkey][gm] may enable much of what I wanted to do with [Agent Frank][af] before I wandered away from it.
