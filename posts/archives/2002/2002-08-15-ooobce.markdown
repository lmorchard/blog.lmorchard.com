<p><a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/15.html#better_living_through_regular_expressions">Better living through regular expressions</a> from Mark Pilgrim.  This has got me thinking of two things:<ol><li>I need to hack together some MT macros or a plugin that finds &amp; links wiki-words in blog entries to my wiki, and I need to start writing in the wiki again.</li><li>I really dig his blog's skin, and I need to finally read though all of his <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/">accessibility tips</a> and re-skin this site.  This place is butt-ugly.</li></ol></p>

            <div class="content">Hmm, I could think of 3 good ways to do this...Run my MT entries through TWiki via a little bit of hackery.  But of course, that leaves users of other wikiclones out.Use Text::WikiFormat  from CPAN, which seems like a nifty self-contained implementation of classic wiki formatting.  This choice, though, leaves MT unconnected to the content in an existing wiki.Use a combination of two of my pet projects: XmlRpcFilteringPipe and XmlRpcToWiki.  I'm not sure how MT tags work yet, but I suppose I could make a tag that filters its contents through an XML-RPC-based filter service that happens to run it through an XML-RPC-enabled wiki.I'm leaning toward #3, since with the XML-RPC pipeline concept I've been tinkering with, you could line up a series of transformations (not just wikification) on your blog entries, some of which could be performed via services offered at other websites.

Of course, #2 is the probably the simplest, if all you want is just wiki formatting in MT.

Hmm.  I think I'll have to tinker with this.</div>
