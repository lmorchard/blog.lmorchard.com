title: More Google API musing -- "404 Correction" in a personal HTTP proxy
    via Google's cache
wordpress_id: 67
wordpress_slug: oooohg

<p>Hmm... now that I finally stopped babbling and read the docs, I just noticed that the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis">Google APIs</a> has methods to access their cache.</p>
<p>Sounds like I need to write a personal HTTP proxy that includes "404 Correction" by consulting Google's cache whenever one encounters a 404.  Could be a new project, too, since someone I was talking to wanted searchable personal web browsing history and I think a personal HTTP proxy could help with that.<br />

            <div class="content">The problem is that it wouldn't help the most common case, which is where someone like Time mag or the NYTimes moves their archives into a Paid category. I never find those things in Google.

(But I haven't looked that carefully, so I could be wrong...)

(Hmm, I wonder whether the Wayback machine holds such things? Quick check shows the NYTimes blocks robots from content.)
