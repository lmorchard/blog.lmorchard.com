title: A warning about MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin use
wordpress_id: 231
wordpress_slug: ooobed

<p>A few words of warning, which should be pretty obvious, with regard to <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> use:  Every appearance of the tag makes a separate web service call.  This could be painful if you stick it in your individual archive item template, and then rebuild your site.  (ie. at least one hit on the filter service for each item in your weblog)  :)</p>
