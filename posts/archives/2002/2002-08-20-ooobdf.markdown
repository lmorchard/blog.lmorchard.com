<p>Well, it looks like <a href="http://www.10500bc.org/">Josh Cooper</a> has gotten the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a> and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki">XmlRpcToWiki</a> working on his blog.  Yay hooray!</p>
<p>Now, I just have to see about improving this thing if I can, and to make this place look better.  This sudden easy abundance of links makes me think that they draw too much attention from the surrounding text.  This is desirable, but not to the degree that they do now.<br />
