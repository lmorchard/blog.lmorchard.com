<p>Heh, nothing like a <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/04/16#lf2aacb8c904c3a8ee36e96711527cf1c">link from Dave Winer</a> along with some very nice compliments to make my traffic spike up ten-fold.  :)</p>
<p>Thanks, Dave, for the kind words and the link.  Oh, and I'm very glad you got the joke!</p>
