<p>In doing some poking around about <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST">REST</a>, I'm trying out a topic-specific Google search in the wiki via <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/GoogleToRSS">GoogleToRSS</a> and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSSDisplay">RSSDisplay</a>.    (Thanks for the pointers, by the way, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/">Sam</a>!)</p>
<p>I called it a "permasearch", just because it's kind of a permanent search-in-residence.  Basically a <a href="http://radio.userland.com/googleBox">Google Box</a>, only I didn't use <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserLand">RadioUserLand</a> to make it.  (That wouldn't've been as much fun, since Radio's already got verbs to handle it! :) Sometimes reinvention is fun.)  I think I need to do some more homework on it to make it worth of a new name, like do searches when visitors aren't visiting it.  (Currently, it updates at most once per hour, at least once per visitor.)  Maybe do some time-series search differences...  hmm, but what can one do with just the top 10 results?<br />
