<p>Though I'm far, far from being an "artiste" of a photographer, I want to do <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/gallery">neat things</a> with my camera.  I want to capture some moments, some feelings, try some odd things.  It's like hacking with light.  I see the kinds of things done with the <a href="http://www.lomography.com">Lomo cameras</a>, warm and in-the-moment images.  Sometimes they're blurry, but that just lends them a rough handmade voice.  I read the <a href="http://www1.lomography.com/0001/about/lomopop3.htm">10 Golden Rules of Lomography</a> and think, yeah, that's what I want to do with this new gadget.    But I hope that the lens and the digital doesn't kill too much of the warmth.  There's a certain style that the Lomo gives to things that I doubt my gadget will get, but I want to capture the moments now that I have something small enough to be omnipresent with me.</p>
<p>Hopefully this doesn't just degrade into <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/gallery/the-kitties">101 pictures of my cats</a>. :)  We'll see.</p>
