 <p><i>This is a really rough draft of a scene that popped into my head this morning...  No offense intended to any Opie's, Randolf's, or Xavier's out there - and all apologies in case I've misrepresented your respective lunchtime positions.  Laugh, it's funny.</i></p>
 <p><b>Opie</b> (entering): Hey, guys!  How's it going!?  Have I got some stories to tell you!</p>
 <p><b>Randolf</b>: <a href="http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-06-27/Wow___XML_">Jesus, that's an ugly shirt!  And how'd you learn to walk that way?</a></p>
 <p><b>Xavier</b>: Your shirt isn't much better, Randolph.  <a href="http://microformats.org/about/">At least mine's made from natural fibers.</a></p>
 <p><b>Opie</b>: Eh, my shirt's fine.  It was free, it fits, and it was in the closet when I got up.</p>
 <p><b>Randolf</b>: And did you have to come in that gas-guzzling smogmobile of yours? <a href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/2006/02/10/feedlists-in-rdf/">I wish you'd driven an electric car.</a></p>
 <p><b>Xavier</b>: ...or maybe <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/11/27/i-wish-it-were-in-xoxo">a bicycle cleverly constructed from coconuts!</a>  It's biodegradable and partially digestible!</p>
 <p><b>Opie</b>: Er, um, okay.  My car's pretty cool!  <a href="http://support.opml.org/download">It was free, it runs, and it came with a steering wheel and automatic transmission!</a>  It could do with a wheel cover and a seat belt, though.</p>
 <p><b>Randolf</b>:  <a href="http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-07-06/OPML__XOXO" title="I use emacs plus the command line for most of my coding, and after trying out a half dozen blog posting tool for posting to Copia, I ended up writing an e-mail-to-post gateway so that I can enter text (markdown) into a UI I'm already familiar with, Evolution's e-mail composition window.">When I drive, I prefer a stick shift and a system of ropes and pullies to steer.</a></p>
 <p><b>Xavier</b>: <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/faqs-for-rdf">I like a conveyance that helps make me one with the nature of the world.</a></p>
 <p><b>Opie</b>: That all sounds like a pain in the ass.  How'd you guys get here?</p>
 <p><b>Randolf</b>:  I walked - <a href="http://www.dajobe.org/2004/01/turtle/">I've got comfortable shoes</a>.  I do <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/11/IsaViz/">have a fun scooter</a> in the garage, though.</p>
 <p><b>Xavier</b>: <a href="http://wordpress.org/">I took the bus</a>, though sometimes I walk.  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo_outliner_experiment">I'm seriously working on that coconut bicycle, though.</a></p>
 <p><b>Opie</b>: Yikes!  How do you guys get much done during the day?</p>
 <p><b>Randolf</b>: Oh, I get by.  I get up really early and start writing, having woken from dreams of electric <i>flying</i> cars I'll have in the future.</p>
 <p><b>Xavier</b>: I blog and write search engines.  That keeps me plenty busy.</p>
 <p><b>Opie</b>: Ugh.  So, anyway.  <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/16/just-put-on-your-xoxo-colored-glasses">I'll shop for a hybrid or something this week</a>, but I'm not giving up my car.  Now, do you guys want to hear my stories, or what?</p>
