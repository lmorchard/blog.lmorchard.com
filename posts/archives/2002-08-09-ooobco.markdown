<p>When I see links in my referrers <a href="http://www.joueb.com/niutopia/news/155.shtml">like this from Niutopia</a>, it makes me wish I had <a href="http://www.scifi.com/farscape/notes/translator.html">translator microbes</a> instead of <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/urltrurl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.joueb.com%2Fniutopia%2Fnews%2F155.shtml&amp;lp=fr_en&amp;tt=url">the Babelfish</a>.  But, at least I have the Fish, and for free!  (Thanks <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/AltaVista?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">AltaVista</font></span>!)  The translation is sketchy and random at best, but it's decent enough for me to get the gist of things.  Now if only I could respond to things in a foriegn language and not accidentally start a war or insult someone's relations, or at best sound like a moron.  It is nice, though, to be reminded that English is not the only language of the web.</p>

            <div class="content">I'm sure you can write english on Niutopia and have some good soul acting as a better fish to translate so everyone can be in the loop.
(Anyway this article is already there, because of the LinkBack features).
You can also mail Biz directly.</div>

            <div class="content">On Niutopia, linkbacks appear as comments to the article. Those remote comments are mixed with the local comments entered by users directly on the site.

E.g. when someone clicked on your link to Niutopia, Niutopia crawled back, got your link and the context and posted this comment automatically :

0xDECAFBAD : " When I see links in my referrers like this from Niutopia, it makes me wish I had translator microbes instead of the Babelfish. But, at least I have the Fish, and for free! (Thanks AltaVista!) The translation is sketchy and rand"

Comments (remote or local) are ordered chronologicaly. I prefer it to the "top referer" way.

Thanks a lot for the original linkback idea. :-)</div>
