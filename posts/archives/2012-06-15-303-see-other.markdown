**TL;DR**: <em>I'm switching to a new blog and a new domain, because
0xDECAFBAD is not my name and WordPress is stupidly simple.</em>

This is probably the last post you'll see from me on this blog. End of
an era, and all that. I think I'm going to leave this thing as it is,
as a pile of static HTML with mostly-working 10-year-old URLs.

You'll probably see more from me, [over at
blog.lmorchard.com](http://blog.lmorchard.com). And, you can [read
more about my thoughts on the matter](http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/06/16/blogging-like-a-blogger)
as well. Mainly, I think I missed the simplicity of WordPress, for a
certain definition of simplicity.

That, and `0xDECAFBAD` is not my name. It's a pun I thought was neat,
about 12 years ago. I'm not giving up the domain, but I think maybe I
should start doing more things with a domain that's closer to what I
call myself online and off. Some people like using handles and
psuedonyms, and I respect that, but `0xDECAFBAD` was more of a *place*
than a name and no one's ever called me that. 

Well, you know, other than maybe in a context like "Hey, aren't you
that decafbad guy?" But, it turns out that [there's more than one person in the
`decafbad` namespace](https://www.google.com/search?q=decafbad), 
so I thought I might start drifting closer to the one my Mom gave me.
I've grown to like it, despite some misgivings earlier in life.

Anyway, cry not for this blog, for it had a great run. Maybe I'll
change my mind; maybe I'll redirect the feeds to the new place. Who
knows?
