I'm guessing Nova's never seen [Sphere XP][sxp], which is a nifty but not quite useful spherical desktop manager for Windows.  Although, where Nova's talking about being *outside* the sphere and dealing with the surface, Sphere XP is about living *inside* the sphere and spinning around near the center.

            <div class="content"><p>I'm highly partial to my "cubic" desktop manager - the unimaginatively named "Desktop Manager" for OS X.  Set the switch transition to cube, and now you have all the desktop space you could possibly want on a "cube."</p>

<p>But I'm guessing most of us are already aware of its existence, since it tends to be among the very first programs placed upon the disk of any new Powerbook.</p></div>
