About the coming spring, [via Flashes of Panic][flashes]:

  > The trees are starting to show that brown haze which will be leaf-buds soon. In a few weeks that will be a greenish haze, and then the leaves will be here before we&#8217;ve noticed the change.
  
  This sums up my anticipation toward the arrival of green things every year, since this tends to be one of my busiest times of the year, yet I'm such a [SAD case][sad] that I'm desperately pining for leaves and the change in sunlight that comes with Spring.  
  
  I notice the bud-haze because I'm always staring at the trees hopingly, but then I'll get dragged into something all-consuming and miss them popping out.
