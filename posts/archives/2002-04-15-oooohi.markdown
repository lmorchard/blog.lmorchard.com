title: web bug / cgi-based access_log emulator?

<p>I'm running decafbad.com on some pretty cheap hosting that gives me most of what I need, but it's missing one annoying thing:  access_log.  I'm playing around with Site Meter, but I do have my own CGI hosting (obviously), so I'd like to find something that can closely emulate an Apache-style access_log with web bug images.  The Apache format would be nice because then I could use any of a number of standard log analysis packages.  Referrers would be a problem, of course, but I think some Javascript could hack around that.  Maybe I'll just end up writing it meself. </p>
<p>Hmm..  Looking...</p>
<p><i>(Or I suppose, if I wanted the access_log badly enough, I could upgrade my hosting.)</i></p>
