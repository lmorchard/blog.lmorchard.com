<p>John Robb <a href="http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/09/05.html#a2464">says</a>:<blockquote><i>Damn.  I have 95% of my PC's processer available at any given moment.  In a year that will probably be 98%, in three years it will be 99%.  This model of the Internet is so messed up.  The fact that over 90% of the computing horsepower on the Internet sits idle at any given moment is insane (in fact, 98% of my DSL connection is dead too).  It is going to change.  It has to change....</i></blockquote>Exactly.  This one of the main reasons I don't think I want to run a "LiveJournal done right, according to me" site.  I'd rather help build a decentralized mutant spawn of LJ, Radio, Gnutella, JXTA, and other things I've yet to realize I should be looking at.  I really need to get some time this Winter to research, think, write, and tinker.</p>
<p>And the thing John says about everyone converting to notebooks is dead on for me.  I haven't touched my desktop in ages.  My iBook is becoming more and more my primary computing device.  When I first got it, I thought it would be a satellite.  Instead, all my other computers have become peripherals for it - extra storage, little daemon processes, all serving me via my laptop.  Now I just need an excuse to go get myself a <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/TiBook?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">TiBook</font></span> :)</p>

            <div class="content">Until laptop keyboards improve (and improve vastly) I won't be getting rid of my desktop unit any time soon.  I have two laptops (only one of which has a halfway decent keyboard but alas, that style of keyboard is no longer being used on laptops) that I rarely use, and two desktop machines I use all the time.

Guess that makes me the exception rather than the rule.

            <div class="content">I'm another desktop user, laptops cost quite a bit more than desktops, I don't have a wireless network, or even high-speed access (at home anyway...) That aside, I did just get a used PowerBook G3, though it's quite a bit older/slower than my desktop G4, it actually will be a satellite, if I can get OS X working properly on it.</div>
