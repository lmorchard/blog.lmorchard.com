<p>Tinkering around with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/CSS">CSS</a> again for this site.  Getting a bit busy and crowded around here, and <a href="http://www20.brinkster.com/liorean/wcd/new/">Liorean</a> had mentioned to me in a visit to my blogchat that things were a bit hard to read and for want of white space.  I think I agree on this.  Though, I don't want to explode everything out with huge fonts and spacing...  Hmm.</p>
<p>Anyone have some hints, suggestions, or complaints about how things look now?</p>
