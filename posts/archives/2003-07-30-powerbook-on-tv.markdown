I don't gush about it very often, but I love my 12" Powerbook.  Since
I got it this past March, it has been my primary machine for both work
and home.  And other than wishing that there was a 1GB memory module
out for it and grumbling that I've lost one of the rubber footies on
the bottom, I've been extremely happy with it.
<br /><br />
And just last night, I was reminded of yet another feature that's made me
glad I got it: the included
<a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/71505/wo/uo52A1Y3Ktac2nzhqf9RjQrQd5i/1.3.0.5.8.3.29.13.0" target="_top">Composite/SVHS video adapter</a>.
I'd had the <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/71505/wo/uo52A1Y3Ktac2nzhqf9RjQrQd5i/1.3.0.5.8.3.22.13.0" target="_top">AV cable</a>
for my iBook before it, but the use of the adapter on the Powerbook
has a very important difference: <i>dual display mode</i>.
<br /><br />
See, when I connected my iBook up to my home entertainment complex,
I got reduced resolution back on the LCD, and anything I did that went
full screen (ie. playing a DVD or a movie file) took over the machine.
But with the Powerbook, its connection to my television is just a second
desktop, not much different than the second monitor I use at work.
<br /><br />
So, while I'm at home on the futon with my girlfriend, I often stream
videos off a PC in the next room that's been recording TV shows for
me, and present them on this second desktop.  Most apps I use to view
movies, such as <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/upgrade/" target="_top">Quicktime Pro</a>
and <a href="http://www.videolan.org/" target="_top">VideoLAN</a>,
allow me to pick a monitor for fullscreen mode. Meanwhile, the LCD on the
Powerbook is still available for other work while we watch.
<br /><br />
It's just a little thing, but it's a thing that lets me get much of the
benefit of a dedicated
<a href="http://www.digitalconnection.com/FAQ/HTPC.htm" target="_top">Home Theater PC</a> without
having to buy or build a box that looks nice alongside all our
<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/games_stuff.html" target="_top">video game consoles</a>.
While I'd still like to take on the project someday, my Powerbook does
just fine for the display and audio end of things, while an aging Windows PC
in the next room <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooach.html" target="_top">snags a few TV shows</a>
for me.
<br /><br />
Of course, if all you want is an HTPC, the Powerbook is expensive
overkill.  But, if you're shopping for a laptop and want some fringe
benefits, I think this is definitely one that doesn't get much attention.

            <div class="content">have you had any issues whatsoever with the closing of your powerbook? after a week mine refused to latch shut, it no longer seemed magnetic. when i sent it back to apple they returned it in the same shape and said "push harder." i've talked to one other person with this problem, and i just wondered if it was widespread. other than that i'm having a ball authoring DVDs, and it's going to be great keeping my lap nice and warm during the cold michigan winters.</div>
