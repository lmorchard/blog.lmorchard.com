* I'm at once repulsed and attracted by all these one-cup coffee machines, with their pods and buttons and [false promises of crema][false].  But, there's the waste, and the fact that I *never* just drink one cup.  And the little filter-pucks of coffee just seem like they'd be impossible to be anything but stale.

  However, with respect to that last point, I've just found the [Keurig B50][b50] and its [K-Cups][kc].  These are little foil-sealed cups of ground coffee that only ever get unsealed when you turn on the machine.  Seems like this might be a better way than filter pucks.
  
  But then, I've never tried a Senseo, and will likely never buy that or a Keurig B50.

* Just noticed that my [DecafBland style for Colloquy][db] has been sucked into the nightly builds.  Hooray!  Glad it's still living on despite my not having touched it in about a year.

* Something damn cool I just discovered about OmniWeb's tab drawer: 
  
  You can group-select the window thumbnails.  Once having done that, you can close them in groups, as well as drag them in groups into the drawers of other windows.  This is a power-user's dream.  It's one of those things that made sense to try, so I tried it, and was happily surprised to see it actually work.  
  
  OmniGroup is [*teh greetest!*][greet]

            <div class="content">I've tried most of them, the DouweEgberts, the Nescafe, the Nespresso, the Illy machines, the Senseo with regular/strong/Milano coffee pads.
Fact is, they never deliver the excellent expresso you find in cafes in Italy or Portugal. It's just a fact of life, I guess. Small machines => no great coffee. Here in Belgium it's even difficult to find good expresso in bars or restaurants.</div>

            <div class="content">Being an Italian living in Scotland I believe that you cannot get the same coffee anywhere else, since the quality of the water makes a big difference, even between cities in Italy coffee tastes completely different. I use a little mocha and buy Italian coffe but still..... not as good as a proper espresso!

And yes, Omniweb is the browser. I have tried all of them and despite not being the fastest one, I still go back to it. Best surfing experience!!</div>
