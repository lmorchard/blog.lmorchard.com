<p>In happier news, I'm very glad to see <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/>Jenny Levine'a Radio</a> is back on the air.  My condolences on the <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/stories/2002/09/15/onBeingTheDigitalJob.html">string of annoyances and disasters</a> along the way.  I still think she should've switched to a Mac though.  :)</p>
