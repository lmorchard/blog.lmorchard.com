 <p>To anyone who's following along:  We're on <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/04/25/a-honeymoon-in-san-francisco">our honeymoon</a>!  Which means that the wedding went overwhelmingly well.  We missed our plane on the way out here - overslept due to complete exhaustion - but then lucked out on standby and got seats next to each other.</p>
 <p>If you're lucky and interested, you might be able to find <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/deusx/">updates via my Flickr account</a>.</p>
 <p>Also, I see that <a href="http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/06/links-from-the-harris-ranch">Marc has wished us well</a> - thank you much!</p>
