<p>Grr again.  As a few of you have told me in email, and as I noticed toward the end of yesterday, my comments feature here is dead.  Seems that as the disk filled up on this server, someone tried leaving a comment, and as Murphy came into play, the comments DB file got corrupted.  The odd thing, and fortunate thing for me anyway, is that I'm still getting the comments emailled to me.  So if/when I get this DB file recovered, or if I wipe it and start over (not happy about that option), I might try re-posting the comments.</p>
<p>Got some good pointers on some hosting options and may be checking out one or another of them soon.  Also looks like there are still issues with my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines">AmphetaOutlines</a>, even after a re-release.</p>
<p>More soon.</p>
