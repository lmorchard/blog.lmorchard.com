As I briefly mentioned in [an earlier post][reader], I've been tinkering with the Google Maps API for a project at work.  I'm cagey about it, but I'd really like to link to it once it's live.  It's an integration of Flash and DHTML that seems to be working out well so far.

The thing that I'm wondering now, though, is this:  I wonder how hard it would be to code up some form of MMORPG or Legend of Zelda derivative using Google Maps as the overworld?
