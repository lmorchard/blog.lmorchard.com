<blockquote cite="http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb#comment-3165">The column names were inspired by the freebie game <a href="http://www.atomicsockmonkey.com/freebies/MNPR.pdf">Monkey, Ninja, Pirate, Robot</a> published by Atomic Sock Monkey. It’s fun! Try it!<br /><br />The fact that there are weird column names was inspired by sqlite’s (then-)inability to add columns to existing tables. So the last time I had to break the schema to add a new column, I added four more as a reserve.<br /><br />Needless to say, the contents, schema and very existence of that database are subject to change without notice, etc. etc.</blockquote>

Remember [when I wrote about the SQLite DB backing Safari RSS][sr]?  I found a veritable zoo of natural enemies lurking in there.  Jens Alfke was nice enough to leave the above comment today, and I thought it was worth calling out.  I love hearing about this sort of trivia behind the code!  :)
