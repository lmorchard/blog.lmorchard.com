I went a little nuts tonight with shell scripting.  It started off with a few innocent bits of [`cat`][cat] and [`grep`][grep] piped together.  But then I invited trouble [started using][parse_log] [`sed`][sed].  Pretty soon, I was bringing in [`cut`][cut] and [`sort`][sort] and [`uniq`][uniq].  I knew I was doomed when I made the whole mess [start emailing me][mail400report] with [`sendmail`][sendmail].  

Oh, but then I went completely off the deep end.  I looked up [RSS 3.0][rss30], since that's so much easier to generate on the fly.  I started producing that with a little help from [`echo`][echo] and [`awk`][awk].  From there, I whipped up [a quick v3.0 to v0.91 converter][rss300to091] so I could get something [my aggregator][dbagg2] could understand.

It was all a very iterative process down a slippery slope of geekiness, and the resulting scripts are nothing that I'd've designed as such from scratch.  But, one thing led to another, and now I've got a [nightly report emailed][mail400report] to me of pages that have gone 404 and 500, and an [RSS feed of referers][referrers_rss] to boot.

I'm sure it looks like completely braindead work, but it was fun!

            <div class="content">> I donâ€™t pay any attention to any of the blog world bullshit. (Maybe I should.)

No!  No, you shouldn't!  Do not, under any circumstances, get sucked into that grungy, petty, venom-soaked little world!  Anyone who knows what I'm talking about will back me up on this, including Les.</div>
