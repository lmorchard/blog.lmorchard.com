Oh yeah, and, just noticed this upon arriving at work.  In the past 6 months, forgotten mounted shares and the subsequent filesystem-related lockups and beach-ball-spinnings in Jaguar have been my sole reason for reboot.
</p>
<p>
As it would happen, I forgot to disconnect from shares on my home LAN again, and awoke my PowerBook on the work LAN.  Before Panther, this would have lead to a reboot within 10 minutes.  This time, it did the Right Thing.  Yay hooray!

Oh, and the Grab application works for individual windows now-- something which seemed to always be greyed out before.
