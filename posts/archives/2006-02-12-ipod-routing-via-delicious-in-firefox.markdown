A cool use for the <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/extension">del.icio.us extension for Firefox</a> which just occurred to me:  Since you can bookmark & tag links directly in place on the page with a right-click, without visiting them, I can pluck an MP3 straight <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2006/02/12/530652.aspx">from an inline link</a> and route it to my iPod by way of a podcast subscription to my <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/deusx/system:media:audio">system:media:audio tag</a> feed.  I'll be listening to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2006/02/12/530652.aspx">this OPML podcast</a> on the way into work in the morning thanks to this trick.
