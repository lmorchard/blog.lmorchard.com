Bastards.  I was looking forward to that concert, too.  When the girl and I saw the commercial for it, we looked at each others' dropped jaws and I went off to get the scoop.  What's worse is that although we got the price of tickets refunded, Ticketmaster kept my service fee.  **What wonderful service!**
