So... yeah.  I watched the keynote, and I'm lusting over the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index12.html" target="_top">mini-me <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/PowerBook?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">PowerBook</font></span></a> with a plan to purchase in the Spring.  I was aiming at a high end iBook but holding out for something better, and well, this new <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/PowerBook?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">PowerBook</font></span> is the precisely what I was holding out for.  It appears to be the rightful successor to my formerly beloved <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=sony+vaio+505tr&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" target="_top">Sony Vaio 505TR</a>.
<br /><br />
Then there's Safari.  Mark puts it <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/01/07.html#safari_review" target="_top">under the microscope</a>, as <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/01/initial_reactio.shtml" target="_top">does Mena</a>.  On the other hand, <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/archives/003460.html" target="_top">Ben writes</a> that it's almost-shit.  Oh yeah, and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/talkpost.bml?journal=jwz&amp;itemid=132696" target="_top">JWZ reports</a>: "Apple says 'fuck you' to Mozilla"  But he's not bitter.
<br /><br />
I haven't got the chops to seriously test the thing, so I'll be watching the more spec-wise out there for info.  But, what I do think about it makes me sound like an Apple fanboy:  I think it's great.  
<br /><br />
It's not perfect at the moment, but I've got a feeling that this will change.  And fast.  Mozilla's shipped with talkback, but Safari's got a bug submission button right up front.  And the fact that they <strong>did</strong> snub Mozilla for a dark horse like Konqueror seems a bit provocative (at least in techie / Open Source circles), and after all that talk of innovation I doubt that they're going to let it rest as-is or back down.  I expect lots of movement from here.  Think different and all that.  And, from my minuscule bits of Cocoa dev, I'm looking forward to poking around with <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/WebCore?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">WebCore</font></span> and the <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/JavaScript?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">JavaScript</font></span> framework.  Unless it's a complete disaster, I expect the building blocks of Safari to pop up in projects everywhere.
<br /><br />
These things tell me to expect good things from Safari.  I hope Mozilla can keep up.  As for IE, well, I deleted that a long time ago.

            <div class="content">Right on. Actually, I was /most/ impressed by the bug reporting feature. If you've not already noticed, the "More" feature of the reporting dialog permits one-click sending of a screen shot and source. Brilliant!</div>
