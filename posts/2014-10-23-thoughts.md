TL;DR: This is a bunch of stuff I just randomly collected throughout the day.
[Look here for a bit of explanation][look]. I may or may not do this again.
I'm experimenting and entertaining myself.

* As a remote worker, I think this is a splendid insight:

  > If you focus purely on the job, and not the industry, you realise airlines
  > selling business class seats are competing with Skype for customers, as they

* I've got a notion to crawl through all my blog archives, harvest all the
  links, and see which are still reachable - starting from the oldest.

* I miss web mashups.
  
  * So I made a couple of mashups against my own blog - look in the sidebar.

* I've installed [Emphasis][] on this blog.

  * Tap Shift twice and see what happens. Permalink ALL the things!

* [I've been running.][running]

  * I'm not a champ by any means, yet, but it's looking like it's stuck as a
    habit. 
    
    * I start to feel antsy when I haven't managed to get around to it.

  * Winter in Michigan will be interesting.

    * Last year, the sidewalks were break-neck dangerous for walking let alone
      jogging.

* I read a lot; I think a lot. I am well versed in [omphaloskepsis][].
  
  * I have a lot of notions about psychology & life in general.

  * [Watching Justin Hall speechify][jah] got me thinking again about posting
    them here.

  * But, this has typically been a techie place.

  * Still, that's what personal blogs are for, no?

    * Or, at least a [LiveJournal](http://deus-x.livejournal.com). 
    
      * Wow, I haven't written there in a very long time.
