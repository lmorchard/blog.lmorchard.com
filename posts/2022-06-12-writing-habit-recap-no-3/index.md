**TL;DR**:  I'd meant to do these recap posts every week. But, oops: it's been a month since the last one. Now that I sit down to write this, though, I think I've done more than I thought.

## Finley and Charley, a short story
<img src="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/06/07/finley-and-charley/cover.png" width="150" />

It took me about two weeks, but I took a break from daily writing exercises and finished a 5,359 word short story called "[Finley and Charley](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2022/06/07/finley-and-charley/)".

It's neither the story I started with, nor the story I expected to end up with. But, it's a finished story, and that's more than I've managed in years.

In short, it's the story of a human named Finley and an asteroid terraforming AI named Charley. There are also humans named Quinn and Wren who make things complicated. Hopefully it's a decent story. I have half a hope to write more about these folks.

## DALL·E Mini
First quick thing is that—along with what seems like the rest of the internet—I've started playing with [DALL·E Mini](https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini). It's turning out very handy to generate little cover images for my writing exercises. It also feels like it's got some promise to use in story prompts, where I generate the image first before diving into the writing exercise proper.

[Initially, I felt squicky about it possibly ripping off images from the internet](https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/1534952790698577920). But, as I've played with it and read about it more, the squick factor is fading a bit. I've got it running on my own hardware now. And, rather than just directly using the first thing it comes up with, I'm trying to tinker a bit to add my own tweaks. Maybe I'm just filing the serial numbers off clip art? Feels like more than that, but I might be fooling myself to play with a new toy.

Who knows? Maybe I'll delete all the cover images in another week or two and feel bad about the whole thing again.
