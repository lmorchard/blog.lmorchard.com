TL;DR: More [random stuff][why] collected and updated throughout the day.

* Hello world!

* "[Harvard cracks DNA storage, crams 700 terabytes of data into a single
  gram][dnadata]"

  * Can you imagine what it would be like to have a personal device that
    could store all the data you would ever need?

  * And stored on media that's made for copying?

* Dave asks, "[What's the best desktop node.js shell?][nodeshell]"

  * Could be an odd question in the age of CPUs in pockets
    & clouds and the desktop in decline.

  * But, [fractional horsepower HTTP servers][frac] and [desktop
    websites][deskweb] are powerful notions.

    * Back in the day, [Radio UserLand][ruser] and [AmphetaDesk][] were
      marvels.
      
    * First time I realized that a web server in my
      house *just for me* was a good idea.

  * I've also tried to say a few things about [aerostats and base
    stations][aerostats].

  * [node-webkit][] seems like something I should check out.

    * It's like [Perl2EXE][] all over again!

* It seems like the sizes of mobile computers are trying to find some
  [Lagrange points][] where the influences of human hand size and demand for
  screen real estate balance.

  * Yes, I'm trying to talk myself into [buying a Nexus 6][n6].

* Do we really all *want* to live in the same big room on the internet?

  * I've [long thought][] some separation between groups can help things scale
   socially and tech-wise.

  * Reddit gets a lot right with subreddits. Kind of a
    silo, yet avoids a most of the problems.
