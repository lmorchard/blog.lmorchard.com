* Hello world. Going to try this outline blogging thing, again.
  Doing it straight in the file editor on GitHub, so the tooling is awkward.
  But, maybe it will work well enough for now.
  
  * Going to try some dancing with branches and pull requests against 
    my own repo to see if that helps me save drafts with occasional publishing.
    It's nowhere near as smooth as the [OPML Editor][] was for me.

* Thinking about [Survivorship Bias][] lately.
