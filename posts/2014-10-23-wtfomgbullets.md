Did you see [that thing I just posted][bullets]? Weird. Back when I used [Dave
Winer's OPML Editor][opml], I used to have [a daily habit][habit] of opening a
new outline and popping over to it throughout the day to collect random
thoughts. 

<!--more-->

I might build on one thing or another, and sometimes a full blog post would
sprout out of one of them. Otherwise, I might just hit publish and put the
whole outline as-is on the web.

I also tried using [Eastgate Tinderbox][tinderbox] for awhile like this. That was
interesting for capturing constellations of thoughts, but I found it harder to
put that into [a web-ready form][tinderblog] without reworking things into proper posts. An
outline just seems to work as a bullet list.

These days, this sort of microblogging happens on Twitter. But, that's like
dropping seeds into a running stream. In they go, and then they're gone. The
impulse to get something out of my head is satisfied, but I never really come
back to look at what came out [or cultivate more][today].
