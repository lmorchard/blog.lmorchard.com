<p>Yesterday in Detroit, I volunteered at <a href="http://www.alterconf.com/conferences/detroit-mi">AlterConf in
Detroit</a>. I watched the food
for a bit, then I folded some chairs. Nothing to brag about - they barely
needed me. That left me largely free to sit in on the rest of the conference.</p>
<p>It was nice. In fact, the whole afternoon was <em>all about</em> being nice. I don&#39;t want
to trivialize it, but the core themes had a lot to
say about empathy and inclusion and kindness - all things I file under &quot;being
nice&quot; in my head.</p>
<p>When I walked in, I got a name badge. I was asked to write my personal pronouns
on it along with my name - &quot;he/him&quot; for me. That&#39;s a kindness: I don&#39;t
want to insult anyone by misgendering. I have enough problem remembering names,
let alone navigating gender concerns in a crowd of strangers more diverse than
I usually encounter.</p>
<p>Then, in the main room, the speaker&#39;s podium stood next to a big screen for
slides. But, on the other side, there was another big screen with a live
transcript and a sign language interpreter on standby. That transcript turned
out to be another kindness: I don&#39;t have hearing issues, but I&#39;ve always found
it easier to absorb complicated things from written text. Among other things, I
can catch what I missed while taking notes or re-read what I had trouble
grasping at first.</p>
<p>And, of course, there was a <a href="http://www.alterconf.com/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>. I skimmed through it on my
phone during the opening address. Not many surprises, mostly just specific ways
to not be a jerk. It was nice to be reminded of a few more things about which
to stay mindful. I&#39;m not <em>entirely</em> inept in social situations, but I&#39;m not
great and I like hints.</p>
<p>I know everything I just wrote was about me. That&#39;s a poor way to talk
about empathy. But, so many objections I&#39;ve seen about inclusion &amp;
consideration at an event center around gripes about personal inconvenience for
folks like me who don&#39;t need as many considerations. &quot;Can&#39;t we just do the
thing? Why do we have to be distracted by all these special needs? Can&#39;t they
just deal with it? Don&#39;t bother me with all that.&quot;</p>
<p>I know I&#39;ve been dealt a good hand in life. Call me privileged, though I know
that word sets some people off. Hell, it&#39;s set me off before. But, it just
means there are lots of things I don&#39;t have to deal with. So, I can afford
to be generous. I can try to be more mindful for awhile, tread carefully, apologize
when needed. I can share some burdens, make some room, hold back, bear with a
few minor inconveniences.</p>
<p>To me, it&#39;s just being nice. I like to be nice. I try to be kind. It doesn&#39;t
cost me anything I&#39;d miss. The end result usually brings unexpected benefits
and I get exposed to interesting people &amp; ideas who would otherwise be squeezed
out.</p>
<p>To keep this short, I&#39;ll save writing about the ideas presented at AlterConf
for other posts. I just wanted to get these general things about the structure
of the day out of my head first. It seemed like a short afternoon with a nice
foundation of little considerations I don&#39;t usually see. It made me glad to
be a small part of it.</p>
