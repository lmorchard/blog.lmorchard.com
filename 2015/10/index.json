Well, today I finally did it. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Just to test the cloud machinery I&#39;m (ab)using here, I&#39;m writing this post as a new commit on GitHub in a browser. When I get done and commit this, Travis CI will fire up, install my node-based blog code and build all the content. Assuming that goes well, my code on Travis will then publish any changes in the content to Amazon S3. And, voila, I will have blogged via the magic of cheap cloud infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Up until now, I&#39;ve been doing this all from my laptop: Write a post in Vim, commit to git, build &amp; deploy from my local machine. I&#39;d push to GitHub to work in the open and have a handy backup. But from here on, the push to GitHub will actually make the magic happen!</p>\n<p>If you&#39;re curious about the plumbing, <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/compare/5992311ade7acc0e9dbeb0352ac4097c687be1a5...10149c0e520f7e75536535ff563dfe42aa30b960\">the changes in my recent commits</a> can tell the exact story.
