<p><em>If anything still sounds dumb, it&#39;s totally my fault.</em></p>
<h2 id="no-such-thing-as-a-free-lunch-anymore">No such thing as a free lunch, anymore</h2>
<p>The year is 2020. The consumer revolt against tracking &amp; advertising on the web
is here to stay. </p>
<p>The fallout has been brutal: Every &quot;one weird trick&quot; and
&quot;you&#39;ll never believe&quot; viral headline site has evaporated. Nine out of ten
daily news sites across all topics &amp; interests have gone under or consolidated.
A few favorites have gotten by on a surprise surge of &quot;premium&quot; memberships,
but it&#39;s a lot quieter on what&#39;s left of the web.</p>
<div class="pullquote left">
Catbear... The browser so great, we're going
to let you pay for it!
</div>

<p>Out of nowhere, a new startup bursts onto the scene:
&quot;<em>Catbear... The browser so great, we&#39;re going to let you pay for
it!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Catbear launches as a subscription service. Five bucks a month in the US - $50 for
a year and save! It comes with a wallet you can fill with Catbearcoins. A $5
subscription gives you 1000 Catbearcoins each month.</p>
<h2 id="at-least-its-not-socks">At least it&#39;s not socks</h2>
<p>At Christmas, you get a card from a relative you haven&#39;t seen in a few years. A
gift card falls out - it&#39;s worth 2500 Catbearcoins.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#39;s this crap?&quot; you think.
Curious, you go on the web to redeem it. It turns out you can get
a month of Catbear for 2000 Catbearcoins. You shrug &amp; sign up.</p>
<div class="pullquote right">
This page costs 1 Catbearcoin to view.
</div>

<p>Catbear is nice. It&#39;s fast. It has clever features. After a night of
poking around blogs &amp; games &amp; baby animal pictures, you notice the Catbearcoin balance in
the corner of the screen has ticked down to 450.</p>
<p>You follow another link and the balance drops to 449.</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks, your balance runs out. The next link shows
an annoying warning: &quot;<em>This page costs 1 Catbearcoin to view</em>,&quot; along with a
link to top up your wallet at the Catbearstore. </p>
<p>You ignore it and keep browsing on
to other free sites - those are getting harder to find.</p>
<p>By the end of the month, Catbear just stops working. It shows a form to
reactivate your subscription. </p>
<p>You go back to your old copy of Lodestone Navigator. But, every site
wants Catbearcoin now. You bite the bullet: You pull out a credit card and
start a Catbear subscription.</p>
<h2 id="information-wants-to-be-expensive">Information wants to be expensive</h2>
<p>Things are good again. The monthly allowance of 1000 Catbearcoins feeds
your habits. But, you&#39;ve noticed a few places have started asking for
more.</p>
<div class="pullquote">
Soon, you find your Catbearcoins running out in the middle of the month.
</div>

<p>Your favorite beer homebrewing forum asks you to bump up to 2 Catbearcoins per
view. In exchange, you get a gold border around on your avatar and you can use
some fun emoticons in posts. Feeling magnanimous, you agree.</p>
<p>An arcade site asks 50 Catbearcoins to unlock every game for a few hours. The place
is pretty fun, so you splurge some nights.</p>
<p>You find a weekly podcast that&#39;s 150 Catbearcoins per episode - or 500 per month to
subscribe. After listening to some free samples from the archives, you&#39;re
hooked.</p>
<p>Soon, you find your wallet running out early. You bump
your subscription up to $10 and get 2500 Catbearcoins every month. But, with so
much good stuff out there, you start using up even that allowance. There are
still higher subscription levels, but you decide something&#39;s got to give.</p>
<h2 id="audience-participation">Audience participation</h2>
<p>The easiest thing to do is just deal with it - when the wallet&#39;s empty, you
do without the web. You make an effort to budget. But, that&#39;s
no fun after a few weeks. So, you look into more options.</p>
<div class="pullquote right">
You can opt into ads to earn Catbearcoin
</div>

<p>Turns out you can opt into ads to earn Catbearcoin. You don&#39;t like
the sound of that, but you give it a try - you can always turn it off
whenever you want. </p>
<p>It&#39;s not like the old days, though: Ads aren&#39;t plastered all over. Instead,
Catbear shows you something every now and then between links. Usually it&#39;s a
quick interstitial image with some text. Occasionally it&#39;s a video.  Sometimes
it&#39;s a survey or even a puzzle. </p>
<p>You&#39;re surprised at how little you&#39;re annoyed -
and how often you actually engage. There are other ad services to
try: They offer higher payouts, but they feel too intrusive for your tastes.</p>
<p>By the end of the month, you&#39;ve gotten an extra 750 Catbearcoins. Not terrible, but
you keep looking around.</p>
<div class="pullquote left">
You can earn Catbearcoin for moderating forums.
</div>

<p>Lots of your usual haunts have started offering some kind of payback scheme for
taking on odd jobs. On the homebrewing forum, you notice folks pitching in to
help run the place. You can earn Catbearcoin for moderating discussions and weeding
out spam.</p>
<p>You apply &amp; get approved - you now have an even more special border around your
avatar and you help douse flame wars in a few topics. This nets you about 200
Catbearcoins - plenty to offset your use of this particular site.</p>
<h2 id="your-information-wants-to-be-expensive-too">Your information wants to be expensive, too</h2>
<p>You find yourself writing long reviews &amp; how-tos on the
forums. One day, someone snarks that you should start a blog if you&#39;re going to
keep posting walls of text.</p>
<p>It gets you thinking. You had a TumblJournal, like 10 years ago. You just used it for
random GIFs and general life complaints. After a bit of research, you find
NileMart&#39;s web services: They support blogs and just started accepting Catbearcoin to
pay for hosting. What&#39;s even more interesting is that they let <em>you</em> accept Catbearcoin!</p>
<div class="pullquote right">
Come to find out, you like writing.
</div>

<p>So, you pick a clever name &amp; create a site. Whenever you&#39;re tempted to post a
few paragraphs on the forum, you publish to your blog instead and link to it
with a TL;DR summary. Come to find out, you really like writing.</p>
<p>Even better, folks from the forums - and beyond - like reading what you&#39;ve got
to say about weird &amp; exotic beers and how to brew them. Word spreads. While
NileMart takes a cut of the Catbearcoin flowing your way, you&#39;re surprised to find
that your balance grows every month. </p>
<p>By the end of summer, you stop paying cash for your Catbear subscription.</p>
<p>You&#39;ve even totally covered your web habits with plenty left over.</p>
<h2 id="catbearcoin-gets-real">Catbearcoin gets real</h2>
<p>Someone on the forums snarks that you must be rolling in it now, thanks to all
your fans. </p>
<p>You&#39;d read about it awhile back, but totally forgot until just now:
Catbearcoin can be redeemed for cash. In fact, as kind of a reverse subscription,
you can have an amount deducted every month and deposited directly into your
bank account. So, you set that up.</p>
<div class="pullquote">
Catbearcoin can be redeemed for cash.
</div>

<p>By the end of the year, your earnings get to a point where you actually have to
declare them on your taxes. </p>
<p>You&#39;re far from quitting your day job, but your
blog buys you a lot of nice beer and a great splurgy dinner here &amp; there. </p>
<p>All of which, you know, is technically research for more writing.</p>
<h2 id="social-media-stars-rise-again">Social media stars rise again</h2>
<p>Social media becomes a thing again: It had mostly died when companies &amp;
investors realized ad money was drying up. </p>
<div class="pullquote right">
A few stars are making a living from their fans
</div>

<p>But, with the advent of Catbearcoin,
someone comes up with the idea to share revenues with folks posting
little quips &amp; videos. For most users, it&#39;s like any old chat site. </p>
<p>For a group of popular folks, the pay out overtakes
what they pay in - and suddenly a few stars are making a living from their
fans.</p>
<p>You&#39;re nowhere near that yourself, but it&#39;s good for driving traffic to
your blog.</p>
<h2 id="competition-grows">Competition grows</h2>
<p>And of course, Catbearcoin isn&#39;t the only game in town for long: Gahoo revives
the Lodestone Navigator team and unveils their own subscription-free currency.  Allen &amp;
Gates and Pomegranate both unveil their own browser refreshes &amp; currency
offerings. The browser wars start all over again - this time with even banks &amp;
credit card networks jumping into the game.</p>
<div class="pullquote left">
The browser wars start all over again
</div>

<p>Your cousin is a web developer. She grouses constantly about having to
support all these browsers. But, she&#39;s never been so in demand.</p>
<p>Exchange services pop up to trade currency between browser wallets. You make
a small profit by playing the markets, but you decide it&#39;s not really your thing.</p>
<p>Fraud &amp; scams grow - you get bitten more than once. But, Catbear &amp; Lodestone &amp;
Sojourn &amp; Trident are all in a race for user protections and offer generous
refunds, so it&#39;s never really a big problem for you. It&#39;s a little annoying to
keep up to date with the tech on your site, but NileMart mostly just takes care
of it as part of the hosting package.</p>
<h2 id="good-times">Good times</h2>
<p>After a few years, it feels like another dot-com boom - just with fewer
billionaires and many more hundred-thousand-aires. Armchair analysts everywhere
enjoy the earnings as they weigh in with opinion pieces about when the bubble&#39;s
going to burst.</p>
<div class="pullquote right">
You really do quit your day job.
</div>

<p>You keep writing for your blog. Your traffic grows as you diversify
into other beverages &amp; food. You really do quit your day job. </p>
<p>You bring in guest writers - with revenue sharing, of course. They become
permanent staff.</p>
<p>You find yourself traveling a bit for exclusive interviews with up-and-coming
microbrewers &amp; restaurateurs.</p>
<p>You adopt a cat with huge ears and name her Foxy. She&#39;s cute and has her own
hilarious microblog - ghostwritten by you. It pays for her kibble. </p>
<p>Life is pretty good on the paid web, even for pets.</p>
