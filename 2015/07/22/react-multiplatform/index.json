My hunch is that there are qualitative &amp; quantitative benefits to reducing context switching. You can focus development &amp; testing efforts on JavaScript &amp; React as opposed to multiple native &amp; web toolkits (e.g. Objective-C &amp; Swift &amp; Java - oh my!). But, measuring that hunch is beyond the scope of what I tried doing here.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, I&#39;ve raised some interesting features of the terrain.

The subclasses just need to implement the platform-specific storage methods. A different mechanism than [React mixins][], but for basically the same purpose.\n\n[using-localstorage]: https://github.com/lmorchard/react-multiplatform/blob/3fd16fe31473f249d8a54020ef252f524dd17d70/lib/models/web/TodoCollection.js#L14\n[using-asyncstorage]: https://github.com/lmorchard/react-multiplatform/blob/3fd16fe31473f249d8a54020ef252f524dd17d70/lib/models/ios/TodoCollection.js#L9\n[basecollection]: https://github.com/lmorchard/react-multiplatform/blob/3fd16fe31473f249d8a54020ef252f524dd17d70/lib/models/TodoCollection.js#L8\n\n[AsyncStorage]: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/asyncstorage.html\n[localstorage]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API\n\n## Sharing by the numbers\n\nThe main goal of this experiment is to get a feel as to whether a hybrid React approach is worth considering versus building totally separate apps for native and web platforms. The metric I decided to use for this is counting lines of code (LoC), and this is what I found:\n\n* Overall, ~30% shared LoC (226 / 748).\n\n* For Models, ~74% shared LoC (159 / 215).\n\n* For Views, ~12% shared LoC (67 / 533).\n\nBecause I like showing my work, here's how I came up with those numbers:\n\n```bash\n# Total LoC for models = 215\n$ cat lib/models/**/*.js | wc -l\n     215\n\n# ~74% common model code\n$ cat lib/models/*js | wc -l\n     159\n\n# ~12% iOS specific model code\n$ cat lib/models/ios/*js | wc -l\n      25\n\n# ~14% web specific model code\n$ cat lib/models/web/*js | wc -l\n      31\n\n# Total LoC for views = 533\n$ cat lib/views/**/*.js | wc -l\n     533\n\n# ~12% common view code\n$ cat lib/views/*js | wc -l\n      67\n\n# ~44% iOS specific view code\n$ cat lib/views/ios/*js | wc -l\n     235\n\n# ~43% web specific view code\n$ cat lib/views/web/*js | wc -l\n     231\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUsing React for both web & native looks promising. However, the toy app I've built is too simple to present an overwhemingly compelling case.\n\nWhat I tried to do here was get a quick feel for the shape of things and where the code multipliers can be found. Your mileage will vary on app features and code refactoring ability.\n\nIn particular, this toy app's models are very simple. So, even though there's a lot of sharing, it doesn't make a big impact on the bottom line. In an app with more complex business logic, that could change favorably.\n\nOn the other hand, Views between platforms will have a greater impact as they get more complex in dealing with divergent UI elements. You could paper over many platform differences with reusable components that normalize APIs & usage patterns - hopefully while not squashing unique advantages of each platform. So far, this app is too simple to really expose those opportunities.\n\nAnd, of course, all bets are off once you've left React for straight native development. My hunch is that there are qualitative & quantitative benefits to reducing context switching. You can focus development & testing efforts on JavaScript & React as opposed to multiple native & web toolkits (e.g. Objective-C & Swift & Java - oh my!). But, measuring that hunch is beyond the scope of what I tried doing here.\n\nHopefully, I've raised some interesting features of the terrain. But, I know this is a very shallow look at things and I'm learning as I go along. Feel free to poke holes in this stuff and throw some suggestions at me!\n\n[ampersand-subcollection]: https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-subcollection\n[ampersand-collection]: https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-collection\n[ampersand-state]: https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-state\n[ampersand-view]: https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-view\n[Backbone.js]: http://backbonejs.org/\n[ampersand.js]: http://ampersandjs.com/\n[flux]: https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html\n[TodoMVC]: http://todomvc.com/\n[react-multiplatform]: https://github.com/lmorchard/react-multiplatform/\n[react]: https://facebook.github.io/react/\n[feels-like-web]: https://code.facebook.com/posts/1014532261909640/react-native-bringing-modern-web-techniques-to-mobile/\n[rn-devtools]: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html#content\n[react-api]: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html\n[React Native]: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\n",
