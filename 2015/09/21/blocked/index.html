<p>With iOS9, Apple just went and did it. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_9.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014305-CH9-SW8">They opened up the ability to implement
content blocking extensions for Safari</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5150498/50-of-the-most-insane-things-never-seen-on-google-street-view/"><img id="thumbnail" class="lazyload" style="width: 400px" src="/uploads/2015/blocked/damnyoualltohell.png" width="" height=""></a></p>
<h2 id="who-did-what-now">Who did what now?</h2>
<p>To hear some folks tell it, Apple just blew up the web. Those maniacs! In
reality, Apple haven't blocked anything themselves.  Rather, they
opened up the <em>capability</em> to block. It's up to app developers to decide what
to block. From there, it's up to users to decide whether &amp; what app to
install.</p>
<p>There's a lot of choice to go around: If this is a nuclear strike, many
hands happily turned their keys in the launch silos. It's a big nasty veto
against the current state of affairs on the web.</p>
<div class="pullquote right">
True to form, Apple didn't invent the content blocker. **They made
the tech more accessible.**
</div>



<h2 id="apple-didnt-start-this">Apple didn't start this</h2>
<p>Let's not pretend this is some sinister battle between corporate entities as
an excuse to ignore or continue to discount the people in the middle.</p>
<p>While Apple does do lots of things I dislike, <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/it-life/tim-cook-customers-not-companies-should-control-their-data/d/d-id/1320684">they tend to champion user
experience for their many paying customers</a> - i.e. mainly the
folks who buy hardware.  In other words, none of this would be possible if
there weren't already people asking for it.</p>
<p>Apple opening the door to
content blockers that improve the user experience on the mobile web makes
perfect sense. So does Apple's News app, considering that it serves to exploit
the opportunities offered by the self-inflicted wounds evident on today's
tracking and ad laden web sites. (Of course, even there, <a href="https://twitter.com/khoi/status/645226687685337088">the experience
still has wrinkles in need of ironing</a>.)</p>
<p>We've had things like <a href="https://adblockplus.org/">Adblock Plus</a> for years. But, practically speaking,
that's been an obscure convenience reserved for folks in the know. True to
form, Apple didn't invent the content blocker. They made the tech more
accessible. If this whole thing is a master stroke by Apple to stab at any
competitor's heart, the blade was gladly thrust by the disgruntled masses
assumed until now to be <a href="http://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/08/microblogging-like-its-2002/#Free_as_in_Lunch">a passive compost heap</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Going after Apple on this wave of ad block news is a red herring. This is user choice. Hi. I'm blocking your code on my computer. Negotiate.</p>— Les Orchard (@lmorchard) <a href="https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/645015287713124352">September 18, 2015</a></blockquote>



<h2 id="babies-bathwater-and-ultimatums">Babies, bathwater, and ultimatums</h2>
<p>While the shock may be understandable, publishers facing reduced revenues do
themselves no favors with panicked reactions to these content blocking
extensions. </p>
<p><a href="http://fortune.com/2015/09/18/dear-apple-i-may-rob-your-store/">Proposing theft from an Apple Store</a>, for example, is just stupid.</p>
<p>Branding ad-block users as thieves also earns little sympathy. Especially not
when the surveillance-driven infrastructure of delivering unwelcome messages
grows daily - all while user-owned data &amp; attention &amp; computing resources are
taken for granted. I'm sure to some folks - for right or wrong - the score
feels even.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The reckoning is coming for an ad industry that grew reckless with user's bandwidth, privacy, CPU, and attention. About time.</p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/644517154046410752">September 17, 2015</a></blockquote>



<p>Claiming that some ad networks are the "good guys" is a too-subtle point
when the crowds are looking to throw the bums out. That said, I do think
making the distinction clear and aligning with user choice will be crucial
for the future.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber">@gruber</a> they just want to block all ads, seeing all as garbage. <a href="http://t.co/jsq5UdVqo5">http://t.co/jsq5UdVqo5</a> <a href="http://t.co/21Vcksj4jA">pic.twitter.com/21Vcksj4jA</a></p>— Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) <a href="https://twitter.com/dannysullivan/status/645634044558884864">September 20, 2015</a></blockquote>



<p>Then, there's this proposition: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9338963/welcome-to-hell-apple-vs-google-vs-facebook-and-the-slow-death-of-the-web">Accept surveillance &amp; marketing - <em>or face the
death of the web you love</em>.</a> </p>
<p>Given the presumption - and frankly, the
arrogance - behind that stark ultimatum, it's no surprise that "Tough, adapt or
die!" is the response from many. Seriously? Those are the only
choices? Frankly, this strikes me as a failure of imagination. And, possibly
<a href="https://blog.growth.supply/content-used-to-be-king-now-its-the-joker-d40703c18c73">an overestimation of value</a> versus the price of the hassle.</p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe class="lazyload" width="560" height="315" src="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IVXJmfd3cmg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>



<h2 id="who-knew-they-could-talk">Who knew they could talk?</h2>
<p>Yes, I understand that today's ad-funded model has been insanely successful.
Turnkey services have empowered lots of folks to do their thing without
worrying about inventory or implementation or influence. Frankly, even my own
employer Mozilla has benefited - and me along with it by way of a regular paycheck. </p>
<p>Still, this ad-supported web was built on quiet acceptance by an audience who
never gave consent except by default. These are shaky foundations:
<a href="http://blog.lmorchard.com/2015/08/07/web-awesome/#users-have-leverage">Browsers weren't really written to make computers do things their owners
don't want</a>. So, refusal has long been possible. <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/ad-networks-beware-firefox-block-third-party-cookies-147513">And defaults
can change</a>. If this spike of consumer revolt grows &amp; deepens,
acceptance can evaporate and all the finger-wagging in the world won't un-pop
the bubble.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reminder: the ad debate is a proxy war for people's right to own and control a general purpose computer.</p>— mhoye (@mhoye) <a href="https://twitter.com/mhoye/status/645014642075435008">September 18, 2015</a></blockquote>



<p>No, I think digging out of this mess will require some thought &amp; creativity -
after first accepting the possibility that the old model might actually
collapse. Have some empathy &amp; listen: If your users are
blocking your ads, maybe stop treating them like livestock and ask what's up. </p>
<p>This <em>could</em> be the first round in a negotiation ends up with a better deal
for everyone involved. <strong>Who knows?</strong> This opening salvo of
block-all-the-things could be a first crude spastic kick from stakeholders
who were rarely asked or given seats at the table until they took them
just now. </p>
<p>Or, I guess lot of us could just be jerks who want something for nothing
and that's why we can't have nice things. I hope that's not the case.</p>

<h2 id="to-be-continued">To be continued</h2>
<p>I've got a few ideas. They're terrible, or else I'd already be a
billionaire. In the interests of keeping this short, I'll save them for 
another blog post. Either way, I suspect that shaking the web out of comfy
ad-supported complacency could just possibly lead to interesting things -
provided we get the the finger pointing &amp; wagging out of our systems and get
down to facing the challenge.</p>
<p>Or, this could all blow over, and things will be back to business as usual
in no time at all. Best not to rely on that, though.</p>
