Take care not to diminish their threat with familiarity, even in your own mind.\"</p>\n<p>\"Understood,\" he said, sitting up straighter. \"But, if they're so dangerous... 'treats'? That's verbatim from the brief.\"</p>\n<p>The Captain took a thoughtful sip. She sighed. \"They think it's cute,\" she said. </p>\n<p>\"Leviathan 12 thinks nukes are cute?\"</p>\n<p>\"Our nukes? Yeah.\" The Captain leaned forward and peered at the main viewscreen. Rocks tumbled serenely, wan light from a distant sun filered through. \"Ensign, have you ever had a cat?\"</p>\n<p>His brow furrowed. \"Me? No. I grew up on a miner. Barely enough to go around for the people, let alone a pet.\"</p>\n<p>She shrugged. \"Some ships keep cats. Haulers,  especially, if they carry food. Some cats have jobs, catching pests and managing morale. It's an ancient relationship.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay,\" he said, nodding. \"So we're cats?\"</p>\n<p>\"We might be, someday,\" she said. \"Right now, we're pre-domestication. Feral. Still, Leviathan 12 seems fond of us.\"</p>\n<p>The Ensign opened his mouth to reply, but snapped his attention to the console. \"Sir, contact at 23-mark-12, ten klicks out. Might be an echo.\"</p>\n<p>\"Weapons, fire on that position.\"</p>\n<p>\"Firing, aye.\" The crewman next to the Ensign tapped out a quick sequence and, on the viewscreen, a missile flared away from the ship and into the rocks.</p>\n<p>\"Contact vanished.\"</p>\n<p>\"Recall the missile. No sense in wasting it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Recalling, aye.\" The missile arced around back toward the ship.</p>\n<p>The Captain sighed again. \"You see,\" she said, \"we think cats endeared themselves to humans through play - and by doing things like this: comms, execute the transmission protocol.\"</p>\n<p>\"Executing, aye.\"</p>\n<p>A series of discordant scrapes and squeals issued from the bridge audio monitors, ending in a sort of sizzling warble.</p>\n<p>\"That's an audio representation of the EM burst that we just emitted,\" continued the Captain. \"Some PhDs back home say this reminds Leviathan 12 of juvenile offspring. Cats learned this, too, meowing at us like babies.\"</p>\n<p>\"Huh,\" said the Ensign. \"So that means we-- sir, contact at 110-mark-46, eight klicks out.\"</p>\n<p>\"Weapons, fire on that position.\"</p>\n<p>\"Firing, aye.\" The missile, which hadn't quite yet made it back to the ship, took another turn to zoom past the ship to a new target.</p>\n<p>\"We're being toyed with,\" said the Captain. \"Is that what you were going to say?\"</p>\n<p>\"More or less, yeah. Also: contact vanished.\"</p>\n<p>\"Recall the missile.
