          <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: My new Synology NAS supports Docker and I can connect to it with VSCode for tinkering with all my horrible projects!</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Over the past couple of decades, I&#39;ve had a Linux box kicking around on a basement shelf. It&#39;s a Ship of Theseus, composed of parts filtering out of my gaming PC after upgrades. This box tends to host my random experiments and learning projects - and it also tends to be broken in some way or another. That&#39;s fun for tinkering, but frustrating for things I want to stay working in between bouts of tinkering.</p>
<img src="./vscode-ds210j-nas.png" alt="Synology DS210j" class="inset left" />

<p>Enter my discovery of low-end Synology NAS devices: They&#39;re tidy little things, like the size of two Nintendo Wii taped together.</p>
<p>My first was a <a href="https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/Hardware/DataSheet/DiskStation/10-year/DS210j/enu/Synology_DS210j_Data_Sheet_enu.pdf">DS210j</a> in 2010, followed by a <a href="https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/Hardware/DataSheet/DiskStation/14-year/DS214play/enu/Synology_DS214play_Data_Sheet_enu.pdf">DS214play</a> in 2015. They reliably take on the boring jobs that I&#39;ve gotten tired of maintaining on my perpetually janky hobby server.</p>
<img src="./vscode-ds723-plus.png" alt="Synology DS723+" class="inset right" />

<p>And then, just this week, I acquired a <a href="https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/Hardware/DataSheet/DiskStation/23-year/DS723%2B/enu/Synology_DS723%2B_Data_Sheet_enu.pdf">DS723+</a> . This one is quite an upgrade: My first NAS had 128MB of RAM and the second sported 2GB. This latest one has been upgraded with a whole 32GB. Along with that, I&#39;ve slapped in a pair of  <a href="https://www.newegg.com/seagate-ironwolf-st10000vn000-10tb/p/N82E16822184973?Item=N82E16822184973">10TB IronWolf hard drives</a> in a RAID1 configuration.</p>
<p>Beyond backups and media storage, why bother with all that for just a NAS? Well, this one supports Docker. And, as it turns out, a great many of my tinkering projects fit nicely into Docker containers.</p>
<p>So, in other words, it appears that this latest NAS can even take on the boring job of hosting <em>many</em> janky little hobby servers - virtually! This, while continuing to reliably do everything else a Synology NAS does. </p>
<p><img src="./vscode-docker-web-ui-3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With Docker containers, I don&#39;t have to try crapping up the Synology host OS with attempts at installing assorted programming languages and tools (ahem, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optware">optware</a>). </p>
<p>I have a long history of ill-advised attempts to turn a NAS into a dev machine, going all the way back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSLU2">Linksys NSLU2</a>, circa 2004. But, if I crap up a Docker container, I can toss it and rebuild without disturbing, say, <a href="https://www.silicondust.com/dvr-service/">the DVR</a> for my TV antenna or <a href="https://tt-rss.org/">the self-hosted RSS reader</a> we use at home.</p>
<p><img src="./vscode-devel-container.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The web UI even has a cute little in-browser terminal for access to the container:</p>
<p><img src="./vscode-docker-terminal.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Of course, I&#39;ll likely find limits to this. I can imagine there&#39;ll be some tinkery projects I don&#39;t want moshing around on the thing that lets us watch Seinfeld reruns after dinner. I&#39;ll still have my Ship of Theseus on hand for that stuff. But, that still leaves a great many things I can just toss onto the Synology for fun.</p>
<p>And speaking of my network, I just discovered how to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/ssh">connect VSCode via SSH to a Docker container on a remote host</a> - i.e. my shiny new Synology DS723+ server. This makes for a kind of fiddly self-hosted alternative to <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a> in my basement.</p>
<p>Key to this are <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/working-with-contexts/">Docker contexts</a> - they&#39;ve been around for a few years, and I&#39;ve likely been using tools that use them, but I hadn&#39;t really learned about them until this week. Long story short, I can switch <code>docker</code> on my Mac laptop over to managing Docker on my NAS like so:</p>
<pre><code>docker context create castiel --docker &quot;host=ssh://lmorchard@castiel&quot;
docker context use castiel
docker ps
</code></pre>
<p>(Yes, I named my new server &quot;<a href="https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/Castiel">Castiel</a>&quot; after <a href="https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/Castiel">the angel from Supernatural</a>. Watching over our files, he&#39;d probably think we&#39;ve hoarded too many episodes of Frasier and Star Trek.)</p>
<img src="./castiel.gif" />

<p>Anyway, once I have a new working Docker context defined, I can access it from VSCode for tinkering. First thing is to select the Docker context. On my Mac, that means hitting Command-Shift-P and typing &quot;<code>dockeru</code>&quot; until the <code>Docker Contexts: Use</code> command appears:</p>
<p><img src="./vscode-docker-contexts-use-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Selecting that gives me a selection of contexts, which includes <code>castiel</code>:</p>
<p><img src="./vscode-docker-context-select.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I pick that, and VSCode confirms the selection:</p>
<p><img src="./vscode-docker-context-selected.png" alt="">
Now, when I click on Remote Explorer in the sidebar here, all the running containers on my Synology soon appear. From here, I can click on the &quot;Attach to Container&quot; button:</p>
<p><img src="./vscode-docker-containers-3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once attached, I can add a folder from the container and start tinkering away on this very blog post!</p>
<p><img src="./vscode-editing-blog.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Oh yeah, and since this is Docker, I can mount a path from the host NAS as storage for all my project code outside of the disposable container:</p>
<p><img src="./vscode-file-station.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I know there can be some problems with this, I think largely around file watchers and suchlike. But, I&#39;ll burn those bridges when I get to them. For now, this seems like a fun new toy to play with and it&#39;s off-loaded a few more little jobs from my junker PC. </p>
<p>Maybe next I can reformat the hobby server and try some more advanced things like <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a> and friends, so it&#39;ll be like a big sibling to the little Synology.</p>
