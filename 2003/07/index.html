        <a href="/blog.lmorchard.com/2003/07/30/video-on-tape/">Videos on tape (Travan, not VHS)</a>
      </h2>
    
    <p class="summary">
      Oh and while I'm writing about watching video files on my TV, I've
been thinking of getting myself a tape drive.  Sure, I'll use it to
actually, finally, back up all the important things I have littered
around my handful of machines.  Having established a backup routine
at work, I've gotten to thinking.
How bad an idea would it be to use a tape drive to store TV shows?
I've been capturing them with the VCD format, which gives me around
600MB per hour of show.  This fills up my drive pretty quickly,
obviously.  I know I really should take sometime to revisit things and
try another video codec, since originally I used VCD because I burned
everything to CD for my DVD player, but now I'm streaming files to my
Powerbook over the network which gives me a lot more flexibility in
recording options.
However, not burning to CD leaves me with a hard drive full of video
that I'm hesitant to delete yet have no good reason to need laying around on a
high speed hard drive.  But, burning all that to a spindle-worth
of blank CDs without a Lego Mindstorms based CD-changer robot leaves
me shuddering.  I recall reading about a DJ-bot
that did this for playing music, and I notice via Slashdot that someone with a
decent woodshop has provided plans
for such a beast for a CD writer.  But I can't afford the Legos at
the present moment, and I'll only end up hurting myself working with
power tools.
Then, I remember that high capacity tapes make backing up lots of data
easy at work.  I know that the tape trade off is capacity and price
for speed of access.  But, if all I need to do is skip from one file
to the next and only need relatively low bandwidth to stream the file
from the tape, this sounds like a great way to archive video.
Depending on the video compression, maybe I could fit a whole season
or two of a show onto a single tape.
Seems like a good idea, though pricey.  But maybe the price and cost
of media would offset the pain in the ass of any other method.  I probably
should look more into the price and pain of a DVD burner, but the idea
of more disc-like things laying around worries me.
What do you think?

      </h2>
    
    <p class="summary">
      I don't gush about it very often, but I love my 12" Powerbook.  Since
I got it this past March, it has been my primary machine for both work
and home.  And other than wishing that there was a 1GB memory module
out for it and grumbling that I've lost one of the rubber footies on
the bottom, I've been extremely happy with it.
And just last night, I was reminded of yet another feature that's made me
glad I got it: the included
Composite/SVHS video adapter.
I'd had the AV cable
for my iBook before it, but the use of the adapter on the Powerbook
has a very important difference: dual display mode.
See, when I connected my iBook up to my home entertainment complex,
I got reduced resolution back on the LCD, and anything I did that went
full screen (ie. playing a DVD or a movie file) took over the machine.
But with the Powerbook, its connection to my television is just a second
desktop, not much different than the second monitor I use at work.
So, while I'm at home on the futon with my girlfriend, I often stream
videos off a PC in the next room that's been recording TV shows for
me, and present them on this second desktop.  Most apps I use to view
movies, such as Quicktime Pro
and VideoLAN,
allow me to pick a monitor for fullscreen mode. Meanwhile, the LCD on the
Powerbook is still available for other work while we watch.
It's just a little thing, but it's a thing that lets me get much of the
benefit of a dedicated
Home Theater PC without
having to buy or build a box that looks nice alongside all our
video game consoles.
While I'd still like to take on the project someday, my Powerbook does
just fine for the display and audio end of things, while an aging Windows PC
in the next room snags a few TV shows
for me.
Of course, if all you want is an HTPC, the Powerbook is expensive
overkill.  But, if you're shopping for a laptop and want some fringe
benefits, I think this is definitely one that doesn't get much attention.

      Macromedia Central provides a safe environment for developers to deploy occasionally-connected applications. Using Macromedia Central, developers can create an application and give it away for free. Or they can sell it to end users using the Try/Buy framework that is part of Central.                                            

Source: Macromedia - DevNet : Macromedia Central: How it Works



I’ve had a bit of enthusiasm for Flash lately.  So, this Macromedia Central thing that’s been on its way for a little while now looks very interesting.

<p>But&#8230;  What differentiates it from every other &#8220;widgets on your desktop&#8221; or &#8220;widgets in a little box&#8221; technology that&#8217;s come before?  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=dodots">Remember</a> <a href="http://disobey.com/ghostsites/show_exhibit/dodots">DoDots</a> ?  <span class="caps">CNN</span> called them <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/04/07/dodots.idg/">the web without a browser</a> and there was general gushing here and there about it.  At one point, I was close to being drafted to write a few promotional games using their <span class="caps">SDK</span>, and it seemed nifty enough.  No clients bit, though.  And all that remains of the company on the web are ghost pages and ex-employee photo albums and reunions.  Oh, and I still have a mousepad and a clipboard from the dev kit.</p>

<p>And then there&#8217;s <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">Java Web Start</a> and <a href="http://www.konfabulator.com/">Konfabulator</a> .  Have any of these sorts of things really taken off?  I mean, they all have their share of nifty things, but has this idea of a centrallized corral of mini-apps ever paid off?  Flash is yet another cool technology with which to develop these things, but will Central take off?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not trying to whiz on anyone&#8217;s Cheerios, since I honestly think these things are nifty, but then again I like widgets with fun buttons to push.</p>

Update: Hmm...  Mike Chambers is inviting questions about Central.  Maybe I should wander over there and ask.

      </h2>
    
    <p class="summary">
      Well, I forgot to mention it, but I emailed Google awhile back about their
rejecting my site for
Google ?AdSense.  They got back to me and let me in the club, which is
demonstrated by the skyscraper ad to the right.  So far, I seem to be on the
road to earning free hosting for the month, if my clickthroughs keep up,
which is more than I'd hoped for.  I only hope that if everyone's seeing this
kind of performance, that Google makes some money at it and doesn't have to
cancel the program.
My only complain now is this:  Can I get some ad rotation?  I'm not sure what
you're seeing, but I've been looking at the same 4 ads for backup solutions
since I first plopped the code in.  At first I thought it was neat, since
I'd been talking about backups at the time and the ads seemed an intelligent
complement.  But that story's long since scrolled off the page, and nothing
else interesing has come up since.  Maybe this is by design, but I expect
my clickthroughs to stop pretty soon.
Now, I have no ambitions to get rich quick via Google.  If they happen to
pay out enough to cover my hosting costs, I'm abso-frickin-loutely
ecstatic.  So, I won't be spending
much time obsessing over search terms and "borrowing" public domain works to
boosting my ?AdSense revenue,
but it seems like the service could use a little freshening.
Am I missing something?
Update: Heh, funny thing.  No sooner do I post this and visit the site to
check out how things look, the Google ad appears to have rotated.
Is someone watching?  Heh, heh.

      What I've discovered, though, is that my desktop PC, for standard development tasks, is astoundingly faster than my work laptop for just about everything.

Source: rc3.org | Developing on my game box



Personally, though I really do want a new PowerMac G5 I can’t see myself investing much in desk-anchored computing anymore.  Not since I got my first laptop, and later my first wireless ethernet card.  What I can see myself doing, though, is maybe investing a little bit into a new PC for games, and maybe for a box with lots of storage and CPU power to stick in a closet somewhere and use via network.

<p>Sure, a dirt cheap box tied to the spot via a dozen cables should be able to smoke my lightweight personal computing device&#8230;  but what if I use that stationary box <strong>from remote</strong> with that lightweight device?  It&#8217;s client/server all over again, but this time I own both the server and the client.</p>

<p>See&#8230; that&#8217;s where I <strong>really</strong> think it&#8217;s at. :)</p>

      Amazon.com Syndicated Content is delivered in RSS format. RSS is a standard format (in  XML) for delivering  content that changes on a regular basis. Content is delivered in small chunks, generally a synopsis, preview, or headline. Selected categories, subcategories and  search results in Amazon.com stores now have RSS feeds associated with them, delivering a headline-view of the top 10 bestsellers in that category or set of  search results.

This is very cool, though the feeds a little hard to find at first.  Don’t look for the orange XML or RSS buttons – use RSS autodiscovery to find the feed associated with a search.  (In other words, the URL will be in a link tag in the header of a search results page.)

<p>And though I don&#8217;t really want to stir up trouble, I find it strange that Amazon uses <span class="caps">RSS</span> v0.91, and that they link to <i>Netscape</i> (an all but defunct entity) and not a spec hosted by UserLand or <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/today/article348552.html">Harvard</a>.</p>

Ask a stupid question , get a smart answer .

<p>Last year, I thought it was a good idea to <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooahe.html">abuse referers</a> in order to leave footprints behind when I consume <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds.  Then, this past January, the abuse in the practice was revealed and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooodoe.html">using the User-Agent header</a> was recommended for this.</p>

<p>So, just for the hell of it, I <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/21/atom_aggregator_behavior_http_level.html#c003136">asked about the User-Agent header</a> for use in the context over at <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org">Mark&#8217;s place</a> to see what responses I&#8217;d get.  The one that seemed most informative was from <a href="http://IAwiki.net/EricScheid">Eric Scheid</a> as quoted above, referring me to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.22">the <span class="caps">HTTP</span>/1.1 spec, section 14.22</a></p>

<p>As per Eric&#8217;s comment and the spec, the value of a &#8220;From&#8221; header <span class="caps">SHOULD</span> be an email address, but I would think that using a <span class="caps">URL</span> wouldn&#8217;t be <strong>too</strong> much an abuse of this header.  Seems like a good idea to stick either the <span class="caps">URL</span> to a blog here, or even better, stick the <span class="caps">URL</span> to your <span class="caps">FOAF</span> file here.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d really like to see this get built into aggregators as an option, though not turned on by defauilt for privacy&#8217;s sake.  I like the idea of leaving my name or a trail back to me at the doorstep of people whose feeds I&#8217;m reading, and I like the idea of standardizing the practice as cleanly as possible.  Using the &#8220;From&#8221; header seems to be the best option so far, versus header abuse and User-Agent overloading.</p>

<p>Man.  One of these days, I really have to get around to studying those specs in full, rather than just sporadically referencing them.  Thank goodness for smart guys like <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org">Mark</a> and <a href="http://IAwiki.net/EricScheid">Eric</a> (among others) who actually take the time to read these things and try to communicate the gist to the rest of us busy developers!</p>

      For a change, I feel awake today.
It's ironic that much of my writing in journals and much of my thought goes toward the topic of consciousness and thought itself.  I've been studying and contemplating issues of cognition, awareness, and self for as long as I can remember.  I've wolfed down self-help books and pop-psych in high school, went on to get a minor degree in psychology proper in college.  
I don't use drugs to tinker with my consciousness (other than caffeine, that is), but I've tried various more controlled forms of meditation, visualization, and introspection.  I flirted with Dianetics & Scientology (but ran far, far away), employed psycho-cybernetics, got motivated by Anthony Robbins, twisted my inner eye around to see itself with the help of Douglas R. Hofstadter, studied concept-formation and knowledge ala Ayn Rand, considered the multiplicity of self with Marvin Minsky, and explored dreams and archetypes with C. G. Jung.  With the help of each influence, I've been stitching together a rough manual to my mind.  Just like I've hacked around with computing devices, I've worked to understand and tweak my own mentality.  
Oh, but I probably need to explain the irony: For the past few months-- likely the past few years-- I've been suffering from sleep apnea.  LIke my father, and his father before him, I've developed a horrible snore and have started fighting a losing struggle with sleepiness.  My dad is known for falling asleep constantly: in the midst of conversation, while eating, while getting his haircut, while using a computer.  And lately, those have all been things that I've begun to "enjoy".  Especially bad has been my tendency to fall asleep at work, and especially dangerous has been me falling asleep whenever I have to drive for more than 10 minutes.
This condition seems to have come upon me so gradually that it's only been recently, with the scare of losing my new job, and missadroit's persistent persuasion, that I finally ackowledged the problem and sought treatment.  So, I managed to get an appointment at the University of Michigan Sleep Disorders Clinic, where one evening at the beginning of the month I was covered with wires and sent to bed.  About a week later, they called me back to inform me that I had very severe sleep apnea, and was barely getting any sleep at all in a night with about 2-3 breathless episodes per hour.
Within a few days of that news-- yesterday, in fact-- I was given a new toy: The REMstar Pro CPAP System.  After one night with the thing, my snoring is gone except for the occasional snort as I become accustomed to a breathing mask, and I feel quite a bit more rested than I have in recent memory.  I still feel a bit tired, but that's to be expected: I've got many nights to catch up for.
I'd gone from being able to track "seven, plus or minus two" things at once down to barely one thing at a time, and that was if I didn't doze off in the middle of the task and have to rebuild the thought process when I snapped back awake.  The irony of it all is similar to something I was reminded of last week: As it turns out, software needs hardware to run.  So, for all my introspective experimentation on myself, and all my attention to consciousness, I've been feeling it slipping away from me lately.  As a "software" guy, I can't do much with my "hardware".  
So, I'm very happy that I finally-- after much denial and procrastination by me, and after much encouragement and tolerance by missadroit-- called and started the process that ended up with me sleeping through the night again.
And now maybe I can close my eyes and meditate without losing consciousness again.
Now maybe I can be myself again.
(P.S.:  Thank you, missadroit.  I love you and don't know what I'd do without you.)

      </h2>
    
    <p class="summary">
      "feed" is not a very unique name, and if another format were to come
along with the same top level element we would not be able to write a
format driver for it. Our architecture keys off the top-level
element. I suggest changing the top-level element to indicate the
format, and also add a version number so that aggregators can have an
idea of what spec the content provider is using. I imagine Radio is
not the only aggregator that would like to key off the name of the
top-level element.



Source:Radio UserLand: Radio gets some kind of Echo support







Nope, "feed" seems like a pretty poor choice as a name if the goal was
uniqueness in the tag name itself.  But, since we have XML namespaces
to ensure uniqueness between vocabularies, we can instead focus on a
clear and simple name that only needs to be unique within the
vocabulary.  And as for versioning, why not consider different
versions of a namespace to be entirely different vocabularies,
each with different namespaces?
I did some quick Googling and found the following:

... documents, containing multiple markup vocabularies, pose problems
of recognition and collision.  Software modules need to be able to
recognize the tags and attributes which they are designed to process,
even in the face of "collisions" occurring when markup intended for
some other software package uses the same element type or attribute
name.
These considerations require that document constructs should have
universal names, whose scope extends beyond their containing document.
This specification describes a mechanism, XML namespaces, which
accomplishes this.



Source:Namespaces in XML








One of the core features of XML is its ability to deal with changes in
the rules for data (hence the extensible in its name -- Extensible
Markup Language).  As changes are made to XML vocabularies, the
creation of multiple versions is inevitable.  This makes it necessary
to mark the versions clearly, for human and machine information.  The
clear marking of versions can be used for driving validation, or for
branch processing according to the requirements of each version.



You can mark the version of an XML vocabulary in many ways.  This
discussion focuses on the use of XML namespaces for marking versions.



Source:Tip: Namespaces and versioning







I haven't looked into RadioUserLand feed handling architecture,
but how difficult would it be to use the namespace and tag together
as key, rather than the tag alone?

      </h2>
    
    <p class="summary">
      Okay, so at my new job I'm the Guy if it has a transistor in it.  I'm
developer, sysadmin, and hardware jockey all in one.  This is fun
to a certain extent, since it tests pretty much everything I know from
A through Z.  And so far, I'm doing okay.  Every now and then, though,
I get a bit stumped.
My most recent adventure involves developing a backup routine for the
office.  I just got tape backup working on a Linux box for a big
Samba-shared directory that we all work out of.  I'm currently winging
it with star and cpio in =CRON=-scheduled scripts that manage a
6-tape rotation for me.
Full backups on alternating tapes on Fridays,
with incrementals inbetween on tapes labeled by the day.  I even have
the server eject the tape and IM me a few times until I go change to
the day's tape.  Tested recovery, and though it could be smoother, it
is at least possible at the moment.  I figure this is pretty good
for my first personal encounter with managing serious backup.  I plan
to keep researching and to upgrade software at some point soon.
So, now my boss asks me:  "Hey, can you backup this other folder for me?
I don't want to share it, though, and I don't want you to be able to
read the files."  This folder contains some important yet sensitive
things like salary information and other things to which I have no
business having access.
My stumper then, is this: How do I grab (or cause to be uploaded) a
folder of files for backup, say as large as 2GB, from a WinXP machine,
without having any access myself to read the file contents.  I'll be
able to install whatever I need on the WinXP machine, but the idea is
that, when the bits leave that machine for the Linux backup server,
there should be no way for me to read their contents.  But, I must be
able to usefully backup and, in conjunction with the owner of the
files, restore in case of disaster.
Oh yeah, and I have no budget for software.  So, I'm trying to work
this out using only free tools.
So, my first though is some sort of encryption on the WinXP machine.
Encrypt with GPG or something, leaving my boss with the secret key
on a floppy and the passphrase in his head.  Upload these files
to a special folder on our shared drive, and it all gets backed up
like everything else.
Or, since I don't even really want to know the names or number of
files in this sensitive folder, can I somehow ZIP up the whole
shebang and encrypt that before uploading?
Under Linux, none of this would be much of a problem to me.  But,
under WinXP, my knowledge of available tools and means of automation
fail me.
Any hints from out there?

      Tools will start to support necho as well as RSS. The formats will
coexist, just as RSS 0.91 and RDF and RSS 2.0 coexist
today. Furthermore, this coexistence will be transparent, just like
today. Over time, necho will, hopefully, become the standard. In the
meantime, there will not be a major catastrophe of incompatibility...
Eventually, some of the other formats might become less used, and will
be phased out (this is something that is already happening, for
example, with the transition from RSS 0.91 to RSS 2.0). And because,
currently, RSS is being almost exclusively used for updates and
regenerated constantly at each endpoint, there will be little if any
switchover cost, again, as an example of this I put forward the
transition from RSS 0.91 to RSS 2.0 that happened last year.



Obviously, it's on us, the developer community, to add necho support
without disruption, and it's not a problem. After all, we are already
doing it today, and moving most (hopefully all) tools into necho will
eventually reduce work for developers in the future, allowing us to,
finally, concentrate on improving the tools rather than on how to let
them connect to each other.

in the face of a later endorsement of the
project?)  The reason I was wondering is because nothing broke
on my desktop.  Every RSS feed to which I subscribed was still feeding
me RSS, and my home-brew aggregator continued crunching and delivering
my fix.
In fact, my aggregator's RSS consumption is based on
Mark Pilgrim's Ultra-liberal RSS parser.
And, it looks like Mark's been one
of the developers involved in the (not)Echo project.  Mark didn't
break anything for me, and couldn't if he wanted to.  On the contrary,
he continues to offer his code, and even updated it not more than a
month ago to address link-vs-guid concerns in a useful way.  Hell, even
though Mark demonstrated his break with RSS tinkering rather concretely
by implementing a very literal interpretation of the spec, I can still
download
his working RSS parser code.
I'm a user and a developer all at once: I produce RSS, I consume RSS,
I develop with RSS, and yet I'm watching (not)Echo with great interest
and welcome it when it's ready.  I fully expect that, in my tinkering,
it'll take me less than a lazy evening's work to put together a
template to publish a (not)Echo feed from my blog, and to add
(not)Echo support to my aggregator.  Hell, I might even get another
parser from Mr. Pilgrim to drop into my project.  But, as long as
others are still producing and expecting RSS, I'll still accept and
offer RSS.  No breakage here.  In fact, if I get off my lazy butt,
I'll unfunkify
my own feed and upgrade it to RSS 2.0 while I'm at it.
This isn't really heavyweight stuff here.
Then, I read things like
Jon Udell's Conversation with Mr. Safe
and other worries that the whole technology of web content syndication
and management will be avoided by big money, or even more horribly,
co-opted by big money in the confusion.  Has the BBC or the New York Times
expressed any change of heart with their decision to offer their content
in a syndication format?  Has the basic tech stopped working?  There are no
pieces of sky on my balcony, though I fully admit that I might be too
naive to see them.
See, to me, RSS ain't the thing.  Content syndication and aggregation
are the thing, and that's going strong.  Are the people with big money
interested in this geeky thing called RSS, or are they interested in
syndication and aggregation?  You know, getting their content out
there and read?  Do they know that this (not)Echo effort hasn't
actually made RSS-supporting software stop working, nor will it ever?
Just because a bunch of bloggers and tinkerers got together and decided
to start making an alternate format and API doesn't mean that the
existing, mature technology suddenly goes sproing.
In fact, unless or until this upstart (not)Echo project builds
something amazing in terms of in-spec capabilities and vendor support,
the currently working RSS-based tech is a safe bet.  And, in fact, I'd
be willing to bet that RSS will still be a force to consider in years
to come, even if (not)Echo introduces some irresistable pull.
Companies like Blogger and ?SixApart would reveal themselves to be run
by morons if they screwed users by dumping RSS overnight.  (And that's
ignoring the fact that someone would come along and whip something
up to fix their idiocy somehow.)
And, I'm sure Microsoft or some well-heeled vendor could try stepping
in with a format of their own and try to steamroll it through with
their own blogging tools and aggregation services, but you know,
they're not omnipotent.  The Internet didn't go away when MSN was
introduced, and the web full of RSS feeds won't go away even if they
introduce MSNBlogs or some such.  It'd take a gigantic fight, lots of
very shiny bits, or many bribes.
I mean, that's what it takes to get my cats to do anything.

      Mr Safe: Tim Bray said you're all washed up, kind of like Charles Goldfarb.



Source:backend.userland.com: Checking in with Mr Safe





Dave Winer has done a tremendous amount of work on RSS and invented
important parts of it and deserves a huge amount of credit for getting
us as far as we have. However, just looking around, I observe that
there are many people and organizations who seem unable to maintain a
good working relationship with Dave.



I regularly get pissed-off at Dave but I really truly do think he's
trying to Do The Right Thing; but there are many people out there who
can't get past being pissed off. This is what life is like.
There's an uncannny echo here, for me.  The thing that came before XML
was called SGML. SGML was largely invented, and its landscape
dominated, by a burly, bearded, brilliant New Yorker, Charles
Goldfarb, who is currently making a well-deserved killing bringing out
the Definitive XML Series of books for Prentice-Hall.  Charles is
loquacious, persistent, smart, loud-voiced, and nearly always gets his
way.
There were a lot of people out there (still are, I guess) whom Charles
drives completely nuts and just won't work with him. Which is one of
the reasons that, when we invented XML, we felt the need to give it a
new name and a new acronym and so on. Mind you, Charles, who as I said
is no dummy, climbed on board the XML bandwagon about fifteen seconds
after it got rolling and was a major help in getting the thing
finished and delivered.

I'm very confused about this.  Dave (or rather, Mr Safe) says that Tim Bray
said something nasty about him here.  In fact, Dave says that Tim said
he's all washed up, like Charles Goldfarb.
But as I read it, I'd love to be washed up like Charles Goldfarb,
seeing as he's "currently making a well-deserved killing bringing out
... books for Prentice-Hall", having "climbed on board the XML bandwagon
about fifteen seconds after it got rolling and was a major help
in getting the thing finished and delivered".  Sounds like Mr. Goldfarb
is still very active in his community, still considered an authority,
and is being rewarded for it.  I hope I'm that kind of washed up someday.
In fact, it'd be pretty keen if that's what people meant if someday
they said, "Les is Dead", though I can't find where Tim said that.
So, where's the nastiness?  It's not like Tim took notes from
Mark's spanish lessons
and told Dave to go "chinga tu madre" or "come verga".  That's nasty.
Far as I can tell, Tim compared Dave to a guy in another community
who has his own contingent of haters yet is still undeniably a brilliant
guy just trying to Do The Right Thing as he sees it.
Was the nastiness in saying that some people can't "maintain a good
working relationship with Dave"?  Or that Tim gets "regularly ...
pissed-off at Dave"?  I mean, they're both obviously true.  It would
have been nasty and untrue had Tim said that no one can maintain a
good relationship with Dave, because there are also obviously a lot of
people who do.  But, Tim didn't say that.
So, as far as I see, I'd personally be happy to have Tim Bray write
about me like this in public.

Not only that, but you added a scroller to my news aggregator page, too!  :)  Gah.
While not as dramatic as
Platypus Day, it does
have me adding an item to my TODO list to
more safely consume RSS in my aggregator.  I feel like I'm tooling around the blogosphere
with my pants off.
And, it makes me want to get back to working on AgentFrank, so I can insert some
filters to block JavaScript code that hijacks my status bar.  Bah.  No offense,
since the message itself is worth attention, but scrollers are so...  1998.
Update: And, John Robb 
has removed 
the scroller.  Thanks!  I still need to look into securing my aggregator
though.  Whether I like status bar scroller or not, my news aggregator
should keep them out anyway.

      ... there's excellent knowledge in blogs if only we had the tools to extract it. 



What sort of tools?  Relevance and reputation based feeds and
aggregators for one.  The problem of quickly finding what's good from
among the great muck of the blogosphere is, if you ask me, a far more
urgent problem than seeing the correct authorship or harmonizing
dc:date and pubDate before I even read the thing.
... facilitate P2P trading of RSS from desktop to desktop as well as
server to desktop -- you subscribe to 1000 feeds, aggregate them, rate
them (explicitly or by statistical filtering based on past use
patterns) and then rebroadcast your new rated feed.  Aggregators could
then /use/ redundant items from feedback loops because each RSS source
has a reputation rating that weights the contained individual item
ranking; repeated items add their rankings.

Yes.  This is it.  This is what I want to see come next from aggregators
and blogs and syndication and all this mess.  It's what I've been tinkering
with in small steps for most of a year.  It's what I intend BookmarkBlogger
to facilitate, as well as AmphetaOutlines and the homebrew aggregator I'm
hacking around with right now.
At first thought, I'm not sure whether or not building and
republishing RSS (or Echo) feeds is where it's at.  But, the more I think
about it, the more it seems perfectly elegant to me.  All the elements are
there, except for an extension to capture ratings.  Extend aggregators to
consume these rating-enriched feeds, and instead of just spooling the items
up into your view, extract and assimilate the ratings into a growing
matrix of rater versus rated.  Apply all the various algorithms to
correlate your rating history with that of others to whose ratings you
subscribe.  Mix in a little Bayes along with other machine learning.
As for the interface... well, that's a toughie.  At present, I think I could
sneak ratings into my daily routine by monitoring my BookmarkBlogger use and
watching the disclosure triangle clicks and link visits in my AmphetaOutlines
based news aggregator.  I could easily see adding an iTunes-like 5-star
rating interface, but unless I get some pretty significant payoff from
painstakingly rating things, I'll never use it.  At least in iTunes, I get
to have playlists of my faves automatically jumbled together, if I remember
to use the ratings in the moment. 
The cool thing will be when sites like
Technorati and Feedster start
using these ratings, but the even cooler thing is when all that's on
my desktop.  This could be easy, though, couldn't it?  What do we call
it, Syndicated Whuffie?
(Which reminds me:  Eventually, we really gotta get back to the subscription
problem.  All these agents polling files everywhere will get to be nasty.
Obviously.  This has been talked about already, but little has happened.
We need some ?PubSub, maybe some caches and concentrators.  All stuff that's
been mentioned in passing before, and left by the wayside as unsexy.)
