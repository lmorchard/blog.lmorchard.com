RSS is a standard format (in  XML) for delivering  content that changes on a regular basis. Content is delivered in small chunks, generally a synopsis, preview, or headline.

Don&#8217;t look for the orange <span class="caps">XML</span> or <span class="caps">RSS</span> buttons &#8211; use <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery.html"><span class="caps">RSS</span> autodiscovery</a> to find the feed associated with a search.  (In other words, the <span class="caps">URL</span> will be in a link tag in the header of a search results page.)</p>

	<p>And though I don&#8217;t really want to stir up trouble, I find it strange that Amazon uses <span class="caps">RSS</span> v0.91, and that they link to <i>Netscape</i> (an all but defunct entity) and not a spec hosted by UserLand or <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/today/article348552.html">Harvard</a>.</p>

	<p>Anyway, at least they&#8216;re providing feeds in <strong>some</strong> format!</p>
