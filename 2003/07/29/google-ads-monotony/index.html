I&amp;apos;m not sure what you&amp;apos;re seeing, but I&amp;apos;ve been looking at the same 4 ads for backup solutions since I first plopped the code in.

Now, I have no ambitions to get rich quick via Google.  If they happen to pay out enough to cover my hosting costs, I&amp;apos;m abso-frickin-loutely ecstatic.

<div class="content">I think it&#39;s funny how on DDRFreak.com they get lots of ads for things like DWI defense lawyers and such.  (DWI is also the name of one of the DDR clones.)
I think they need to work on their targeting metrics a bit more. :D</div>

<div class="content">The ads I&#39;m seeing on your page are all for uk computer hardware suppliers. So unless they are all on a big export drive at the moment I image that different people are getting different ads.</div>
