Lately, it’s been a 15” PowerBook that’s been having random crashes and happily corrupting its hard drive.  Being a software guy, I run every program I can think of:  Disk First Aid, DiskWarrior, fsck.  Reinstalled Photoshop.  Then, tried wiping the machine and installing OS X, which was fine until the installer itself crashed. Kernel panic after kernel panic.  At one point, I considered consulting Eliza. 

&lt;p&gt;Turns out it was the memory.  We found this out by finally running the one bit of software that, as a software focused guy, I hadn&amp;#8217;t even conceived of: The Hardware Diagnostics CD.&lt;/p&gt;" />
