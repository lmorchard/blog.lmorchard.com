I know I really should take sometime to revisit things and\ntry another video codec, since originally I used VCD because I burned\neverything to CD for my DVD player, but now I&#39;m streaming files to my\nPowerbook over the network which gives me a lot more flexibility in\nrecording options.\n<br /><br />\nHowever, not burning to CD leaves me with a hard drive full of video\nthat I&#39;m hesitant to delete yet have no good reason to need laying around on a\nhigh speed hard drive.

A used DLT drive (even an autoloader) doesn't run for too much on Ebay, but the tapes are pricey, ~$30 even for refurbs and you'll be lucky to get 50GB's out of them with compression turned on even using DLT-IV (since this is mpeg1/vcd expect to be closer to the 40GB limit though).\nMeanwhile, even a non-techno savvy coworker was impressed that 120GB 7200rpm hdd's were about $80 a pop now.  Very very tempting.  Look around and you might find even better bang-per-buck\nAnother interesting development, that seems a lot more tempting than Firewire and USB enclosures is eSATA (external Serial ATA).  Such as can be found at http://highpoint-tech.com/\nIt's potentially a lot faster than USB & Firewire (SATA is currently 133MB's threshold, which is basically the max of a standard 32bit 33Mhz PCI bus anyway - disks do not write anywhere near that quickly mind you), and potentially a bit cheaper too.  I haven't done the digging there, so SATA prices, a controller & enclosures might actually rule that out, but it is worth looking into.  Regardless, of nitpicking prices though it will definitely be cheaper & faster than used DLT crapola, plus in all likelihood you might need to buy a USB2 or firewire controller anyway, so getting a SATA controller instead isn't like to be much extra work, though it might be less standard (maybe buy a combo firewire & USB2 enclosure in case you need to bring it to a friend as well).\nAs an aside, you might want to contemplate using something like MPEG4 or DivX instead of mpeg1/vcd - you get much higher quality than VCD's with about the same density of data.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085099\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cb0bd3971c5ee6e566588273eb89cdc1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">nicole</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085099\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-03-29T15:30:24\">2004-03-29T15:30:24</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">so yeah i sorta was doing a search on how to record stuff from my tv to my apple powerbook. i have a dvd burner in it and stuff i just wanna know if its possible. i know what cord to get to hook up my powerbook so i can watch dvds on my tv. is that the same cord that i would use to record tv onto my powerbook? what kind of software do i need... so yeah, can this actually be done? whether i burn it on a dvd or just a cd... help! please!!</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

    "summary": "<p>Oh and while I&apos;m writing about watching video files on my TV, I&apos;ve\nbeen thinking of getting myself a tape drive.  Sure, I&apos;ll use it to\nactually, finally, back up all the important things I have littered\naround my handful of machines.  Having established a backup routine\nat work, I&apos;ve gotten to thinking.\n<br><br>\nHow bad an idea would it be to use a tape drive to store TV shows?\nI&apos;ve been capturing them with the VCD format, which gives me around\n600MB per hour of show.  This fills up my drive pretty quickly,\nobviously.  I know I really should take sometime to revisit things and\ntry another video codec, since originally I used VCD because I burned\neverything to CD for my DVD player, but now I&apos;m streaming files to my\nPowerbook over the network which gives me a lot more flexibility in\nrecording options.\n<br><br>\nHowever, not burning to CD leaves me with a hard drive full of video\nthat I&apos;m hesitant to delete yet have no good reason to need laying around on a\nhigh speed hard drive.  But, burning all that to a spindle-worth\nof blank CDs without a Lego Mindstorms based CD-changer robot leaves\nme shuddering.  I recall reading about <a href=\"http://www.djzone.net/pg/0101/tf01001.shtml\" target=\"_top\">a DJ-bot</a>\nthat did this for playing music, and I notice <a href=\"http://ask.slashdot.org/articles/03/07/22/122253.shtml?tid=137&amp;tid=198\" target=\"_top\">via Slashdot</a> that someone with a\ndecent woodshop <a href=\"http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/tech/changer.html\" target=\"_top\">has provided plans</a>\nfor such a beast for a CD writer.  But I can&apos;t afford the Legos at\nthe present moment, and I&apos;ll only end up hurting myself working with\npower tools.\n<br><br>\nThen, I remember that high capacity tapes make backing up lots of data\neasy at work.  I know that the tape trade off is capacity and price\nfor speed of access.  But, if all I need to do is skip from one file\nto the next and only need relatively low bandwidth to stream the file\nfrom the tape, this sounds like a great way to archive video.\nDepending on the video compression, maybe I could fit a whole season\nor two of a show onto a single tape.\n<br><br>\nSeems like a good idea, though pricey.  But maybe the price and cost\nof media would offset the pain in the ass of any other method.  I probably\nshould look more into the price and pain of a DVD burner, but the idea\nof more disc-like things laying around worries me.\n<br><br>\nWhat do you think?</p>\n"

I think the major (or minor, depending on how you look at it) will be leveraging the multitudes of Flash programmers that already exist. All those other options had their own specific API/code to learn. Also a timing with the Intel Centrino marketing and occasionally-connected computing talk, and joint efforts with Intel would certainly boost credibility.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086859\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e623db38f132a64df8213b2715042258&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">mike chambers</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086859\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-30T13:49:11\">2003-07-30T13:49:11</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I think there are a couple of things that set Central apart.\n1. integrated try / buy support. It will be very simple for developers to sell their apps (or allow users to try them for a set amount of time). This takes away a ton of the hassle for developers trying to make money from their work.\n2. Support of Macromedia / Marketing. Macromedia makes money when developers do, and thus you can be assured that we are going to do everything possible to 1) make sure that Central is successful, 2) make sure that developers sell a lot of apps.\n3. Ubiquity : Since Central is based on the Flash player, we will be able to quickly port it to new operating systems. We plan to release with versions for Windows and OSX, and will follow shortly there after with a Pocket PC version. The Flash player is available on tons of other platforms (linux, solaris, etc...), so there are tons of opportunities. \nJust some quick thoughts, hope that helps...\nmike chambers\nmesh@macromedia.com</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

I think the major (or minor, depending on how you look at it) will be leveraging the multitudes of Flash programmers that already exist. All those other options had their own specific API/code to learn. Also a timing with the Intel Centrino marketing and occasionally-connected computing talk, and joint efforts with Intel would certainly boost credibility.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086859\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e623db38f132a64df8213b2715042258&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">mike chambers</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086859\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-30T13:49:11\">2003-07-30T13:49:11</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I think there are a couple of things that set Central apart.\r\n\r\n1. integrated try / buy support. It will be very simple for developers to sell their apps (or allow users to try them for a set amount of time). This takes away a ton of the hassle for developers trying to make money from their work.\r\n\r\n2. Support of Macromedia / Marketing. Macromedia makes money when developers do, and thus you can be assured that we are going to do everything possible to 1) make sure that Central is successful, 2) make sure that developers sell a lot of apps.\r\n\r\n3. Ubiquity : Since Central is based on the Flash player, we will be able to quickly port it to new operating systems. We plan to release with versions for Windows and OSX, and will follow shortly there after with a Pocket PC version. The Flash player is available on tons of other platforms (linux, solaris, etc...), so there are tons of opportunities. \r\n\r\nJust some quick thoughts, hope that helps...\r\n\r\nmike chambers\r\n\r\nmesh@macromedia.com</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

At one point, I was close to being drafted to write a few promotional games using their &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt;, and it seemed nifty enough.  No clients bit, though.  And all that remains of the company on the web are ghost pages and ex-employee photo albums and reunions.  Oh, and I still have a mousepad and a clipboard from the dev kit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/&quot;&gt;Java Web Start&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.konfabulator.com/&quot;&gt;Konfabulator&lt;/a&gt; .  Have any of these sorts of things really taken off?  I mean, they all have their share of nifty things, but has this idea of a centrallized corral of mini-apps ever paid off?  Flash is yet another cool technology with which to develop these things, but will Central take off?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not trying to whiz on anyone&amp;#8217;s Cheerios, since I honestly think these things are nifty, but then again I like widgets with fun buttons to push.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<p><b>Update:</b> Hmm...

I&apos;m not sure what\nyou&apos;re seeing, but I&apos;ve been looking at the same 4 ads for backup solutions\nsince I first plopped the code in.  At first I thought it was neat, since\nI&apos;d been talking about backups at the time and the ads seemed an intelligent\ncomplement.

Maxing out laptop RAM, helps a bit too.  With mobile Athlon64's on the horizon, affordable portable 64bit computing isn't far away either.  Apple will probably have a G5 (ppc970) iteration next year along similar lines.  Meanwhile tadpole finally has a sparc(64)book that starts at $3k which is really something given their history.  Too bad not many people care about Sun hardware with AMD and IBM really pushing things in performance and price fields of late.\nLaptops seriously need something to replace cardbus, as gigabit ethernet et al need much more bandwidth.  That is why Powerbooks w/ gigE actually have the gigE controller placed in a rather nonstandard implementation manner.  Newcard is probably still two years away though.  Then again, the average desktop still only has standard 32bit 33Mhz PCI slots - so peripherals that demand extra speed haven't quite hit the mainstream yet I guess.  PCI-X and PCI Express aren't really in demand outside of server applications these days - maybe they'll continue to be of the same class of performance that ECC & SCSI have become - necessary for servers, but not really important in the commodity PC world.  Looking at the google approach, it may just be that the cheaper but OK approach is still a win over the more expensive, but better approach.\nJust like wired vs wireless; desktops will always have some advantages over laptops - particularly with regards to speed & expansion.  But the situation continues to improve for laptops too, usually - a generation's pace behind.  I don't think we're that far away from the point where people start to care more about the convenience of something rather than the reliability.  Then again, that's kind of how the mass of consumers has always been, and so we get VCR's and TV's that are cheaper to replace than to repair.\nOn the one hand I think that's great - because technology shouldn't be so expensive.  On the other hand I feel pretty adamantly that it's a myopic view of technology that leads to excess and waste.  It's great that people view computers increasingly as just another tool; but just like the world of tools - the cheap ones will rust and break quickly; adding to landfills - and a good one can last forever.  Maybe only the craftsmen care - but if they are passionate about their profession, then I think it is something that they should care about.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086017\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e24c81efad4c66a32b3146800f7963c0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">grey</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086017\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-28T20:10:45\">2003-07-28T20:10:45</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Sorry, I'm a bit hardware obessive and thought of a couple of other things that are of interest in the laptop & desktop musings.\nOne thing I've noticed increasingly in the workplace is the popularity of the PDA, I actually find it quite intriguing to see a computer (be it a laptop or desktop) set up, and right next to it - as though a pygmy imitation is some PDA in a cradle.  All the synchronization software leaves me thoroughly dissatisfied, and tends to cause many headaches (whether due to speed over a serial UART, or synchronization being all stupid and giving preference to the wrong thing at the wrong time - average users change their mind of whether the desktop or PDA is up to date, and they only configure such preferences once).  Anyway - enough of that - what seems really appealing, and not that far away is the notion of a PDAcore, that you plug into a desktop/laptop form factor.  Things like oqo.com and http://www.antelopetech.com/ are friggin brilliant in this regard - too bad that since the year+ that they've been announced, I still see none for sale.\nThat and the fact that while they're a very beefy PDA, they're an extremely poor desktop/laptop.  Ideally the docking host system would let you address faster hdd's, more RAM, possibly even a faster CPU - while putting all of the core's hardware to sleep, only relying on the hdd as a base.\nAnyway, my iteration is a pipe dream, but I think even their direction is intriguing.  Makes the client/server thing a little bit less necessary, and the PDA + Desktop thing downright foolish.\nI feel like a lot of these technologies are getting closer to where they need to be, but are still a long ways off.  Another example I've seen recently is with cell phone & PDA combos.  Quite intriguing, but they all suck.  Some PDA's seem to be good PDA's and OK cell phones - but can't send email.  Some can send email, but are crappy PDA's and mediocre cell phones.\nI could rant on and one about failed attempts at convergence (another good one to look at right now is PVR's, DVD burners and digital [satellite or cable] tuners - something that should all be rolled into one package, but even the attempts that go for two of the three tend to fail at one or both).\nMaybe it's the growing pains of nascent technology.  Maybe it's held back by corporate interests (e.g. the PVR+burner).    I tend to get the feeling that more often it's technology trying to solve problems that people have, but turning in the assignment 75% finished.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

PCI-X and PCI Express aren't really in demand outside of server applications these days - maybe they'll continue to be of the same class of performance that ECC & SCSI have become - necessary for servers, but not really important in the commodity PC world.  Looking at the google approach, it may just be that the cheaper but OK approach is still a win over the more expensive, but better approach.\r\n\r\nJust like wired vs wireless; desktops will always have some advantages over laptops - particularly with regards to speed & expansion.  But the situation continues to improve for laptops too, usually - a generation's pace behind.  I don't think we're that far away from the point where people start to care more about the convenience of something rather than the reliability.  Then again, that's kind of how the mass of consumers has always been, and so we get VCR's and TV's that are cheaper to replace than to repair.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand I think that's great - because technology shouldn't be so expensive.  On the other hand I feel pretty adamantly that it's a myopic view of technology that leads to excess and waste.  It's great that people view computers increasingly as just another tool; but just like the world of tools - the cheap ones will rust and break quickly; adding to landfills - and a good one can last forever.  Maybe only the craftsmen care - but if they are passionate about their profession, then I think it is something that they should care about.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086017\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e24c81efad4c66a32b3146800f7963c0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">grey</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086017\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-28T20:10:45\">2003-07-28T20:10:45</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Sorry, I'm a bit hardware obessive and thought of a couple of other things that are of interest in the laptop & desktop musings.\r\n\r\nOne thing I've noticed increasingly in the workplace is the popularity of the PDA, I actually find it quite intriguing to see a computer (be it a laptop or desktop) set up, and right next to it - as though a pygmy imitation is some PDA in a cradle.  All the synchronization software leaves me thoroughly dissatisfied, and tends to cause many headaches (whether due to speed over a serial UART, or synchronization being all stupid and giving preference to the wrong thing at the wrong time - average users change their mind of whether the desktop or PDA is up to date, and they only configure such preferences once).  Anyway - enough of that - what seems really appealing, and not that far away is the notion of a PDAcore, that you plug into a desktop/laptop form factor.  Things like oqo.com and http://www.antelopetech.com/ are friggin brilliant in this regard - too bad that since the year+ that they've been announced, I still see none for sale.\r\n\r\nThat and the fact that while they're a very beefy PDA, they're an extremely poor desktop/laptop.  Ideally the docking host system would let you address faster hdd's, more RAM, possibly even a faster CPU - while putting all of the core's hardware to sleep, only relying on the hdd as a base.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my iteration is a pipe dream, but I think even their direction is intriguing.  Makes the client/server thing a little bit less necessary, and the PDA + Desktop thing downright foolish.\r\n\r\nI feel like a lot of these technologies are getting closer to where they need to be, but are still a long ways off.  Another example I've seen recently is with cell phone & PDA combos.  Quite intriguing, but they all suck.  Some PDA's seem to be good PDA's and OK cell phones - but can't send email.  Some can send email, but are crappy PDA's and mediocre cell phones.\r\n\r\nI could rant on and one about failed attempts at convergence (another good one to look at right now is PVR's, DVD burners and digital [satellite or cable] tuners - something that should all be rolled into one package, but even the attempts that go for two of the three tend to fail at one or both).\r\n\r\nMaybe it's the growing pains of nascent technology.  Maybe it's held back by corporate interests (e.g. the PVR+burner).    I tend to get the feeling that more often it's technology trying to solve problems that people have, but turning in the assignment 75% finished.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

Then, this past January, the abuse in the practice was revealed and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooodoe.html&quot;&gt;using the User-Agent header&lt;/a&gt; was recommended for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, just for the hell of it, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/21/atom_aggregator_behavior_http_level.html#c003136&quot;&gt;asked about the User-Agent header&lt;/a&gt; for use in the context over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diveintomark.org&quot;&gt;Mark&amp;#8217;s place&lt;/a&gt; to see what responses I&amp;#8217;d get.  The one that seemed most informative was from &lt;a href=&quot;http://IAwiki.net/EricScheid&quot;&gt;Eric Scheid&lt;/a&gt; as quoted above, referring me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.22&quot;&gt;the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;/1.1 spec, section 14.22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As per Eric&amp;#8217;s comment and the spec, the value of a &amp;#8220;From&amp;#8221; header &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/span&gt; be an email address, but I would think that using a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; wouldn&amp;#8217;t be &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; much an abuse of this header.  Seems like a good idea to stick either the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to a blog here, or even better, stick the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to your &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FOAF&lt;/span&gt; file here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d really like to see this get built into aggregators as an option, though not turned on by defauilt for privacy&amp;#8217;s sake.  I like the idea of leaving my name or a trail back to me at the doorstep of people whose feeds I&amp;#8217;m reading, and I like the idea of standardizing the practice as cleanly as possible.  Using the &amp;#8220;From&amp;#8221; header seems to be the best option so far, versus header abuse and User-Agent overloading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Man.  One of these days, I really have to get around to studying those specs in full, rather than just sporadically referencing them.  Thank goodness for smart guys like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diveintomark.org&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://IAwiki.net/EricScheid&quot;&gt;Eric&lt;/a&gt; (among others) who actually take the time to read these things and try to communicate the gist to the rest of us busy developers!&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=from_foaf_rss</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086743\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.braino.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1958f40a3ea1b8af56f7453922769c9a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.braino.org\">Daniel Von Fange</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086743\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-23T17:47:41\">2003-07-23T17:47:41</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Oh yeah.

Then, this past January, the abuse in the practice was revealed and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooodoe.html\">using the User-Agent header</a> was recommended for this.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>So, just for the hell of it, I <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/21/atom_aggregator_behavior_http_level.html#c003136\">asked about the User-Agent header</a> for use in the context over at <a href=\"http://www.diveintomark.org\">Mark&#8217;s place</a> to see what responses I&#8217;d get.  The one that seemed most informative was from <a href=\"http://IAwiki.net/EricScheid\">Eric Scheid</a> as quoted above, referring me to <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.22\">the <span class=\"caps\">HTTP</span>/1.1 spec, section 14.22</a></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>As per Eric&#8217;s comment and the spec, the value of a &#8220;From&#8221; header <span class=\"caps\">SHOULD</span> be an email address, but I would think that using a <span class=\"caps\">URL</span> wouldn&#8217;t be <strong>too</strong> much an abuse of this header.  Seems like a good idea to stick either the <span class=\"caps\">URL</span> to a blog here, or even better, stick the <span class=\"caps\">URL</span> to your <span class=\"caps\">FOAF</span> file here.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I&#8217;d really like to see this get built into aggregators as an option, though not turned on by defauilt for privacy&#8217;s sake.  I like the idea of leaving my name or a trail back to me at the doorstep of people whose feeds I&#8217;m reading, and I like the idea of standardizing the practice as cleanly as possible.  Using the &#8220;From&#8221; header seems to be the best option so far, versus header abuse and User-Agent overloading.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Man.  One of these days, I really have to get around to studying those specs in full, rather than just sporadically referencing them.

The one that seemed most informative was from &lt;a href=&quot;http://IAwiki.net/EricScheid&quot;&gt;Eric Scheid&lt;/a&gt; as quoted above, referring me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.22&quot;&gt;the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;/1.1 spec, section 14.22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As per Eric&amp;#8217;s comment and the spec, the value of a &amp;#8220;From&amp;#8221; header &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/span&gt; be an email address, but I would think that using a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; wouldn&amp;#8217;t be &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; much an abuse of this header.  Seems like a good idea to stick either the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to a blog here, or even better, stick the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to your &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FOAF&lt;/span&gt; file here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d really like to see this get built into aggregators as an option, though not turned on by defauilt for privacy&amp;#8217;s sake.  I like the idea of leaving my name or a trail back to me at the doorstep of people whose feeds I&amp;#8217;m reading, and I like the idea of standardizing the practice as cleanly as possible.  Using the &amp;#8220;From&amp;#8221; header seems to be the best option so far, versus header abuse and User-Agent overloading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Man.  One of these days, I really have to get around to studying those specs in full, rather than just sporadically referencing them.  Thank goodness for smart guys like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diveintomark.org&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://IAwiki.net/EricScheid&quot;&gt;Eric&lt;/a&gt; (among others) who actually take the time to read these things and try to communicate the gist to the rest of us busy developers!&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n"

I knew I slept very restlessly, and my last female partner had told me I snore.\nYou don't really know yourself that you snore, because your asleep, and when you wake up you're not snoring.\nWell, they found I wake up, many times very subtley, more than I even knew, and that I was rarely going into REM sleep. So they prescribed a CPAP.\nWOW, what a difference it made, I immediately started sleeping better. The sleep lab told me it would take sometime of proper sleep to repair my subtle sleep deprivation.\nOne side benefit, the air filters allow me to breathe much cleaner air for 6 - 10 hour a night, and do I ever see the soot they filter out of the NYC air I breathe !!  Also, the white noise effect helps drown out NYC street noise a wee bit, earplugs do a better job.\nIt is Very Strange sleeping with a facemask covering your nose, and headgear to keep it in place, but it is worth the strange way you look. Besides, no one except someone who likes, or loves you, gets to see you in that thing. It is a bit of a shock to a partner when you first go to use this thing. But, it could make for a unique Halloween outfit.\nThe facemasks come in standard thin rubber face piece and Deluxe thick rubber gel-like face pieces. The gel-like ones are much more comfortable, and come in clear pale gold, or clear pale blue.\nI even take it with me traveling. Now if they could develop a portable battery operated lightweight for when I go camping.\nCurtis</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084029\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=53617e52a0ccf29f19c750e312df0f31&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">steve</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084029\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-02-17T02:12:14\">2004-02-17T02:12:14</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">hi.  i've gone through the process and ended up with the same machine.\nit gathers data with and without the smart card.\nanyone know how to pull the data out of the machine?</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

I knew I slept very restlessly, and my last female partner had told me I snore.\r\n\r\nYou don't really know yourself that you snore, because your asleep, and when you wake up you're not snoring.\r\n\r\nWell, they found I wake up, many times very subtley, more than I even knew, and that I was rarely going into REM sleep. So they prescribed a CPAP.\r\n\r\nWOW, what a difference it made, I immediately started sleeping better. The sleep lab told me it would take sometime of proper sleep to repair my subtle sleep deprivation.\r\n\r\nOne side benefit, the air filters allow me to breathe much cleaner air for 6 - 10 hour a night, and do I ever see the soot they filter out of the NYC air I breathe !!  Also, the white noise effect helps drown out NYC street noise a wee bit, earplugs do a better job.\r\n\r\nIt is Very Strange sleeping with a facemask covering your nose, and headgear to keep it in place, but it is worth the strange way you look. Besides, no one except someone who likes, or loves you, gets to see you in that thing. It is a bit of a shock to a partner when you first go to use this thing. But, it could make for a unique Halloween outfit.\r\n\r\nThe facemasks come in standard thin rubber face piece and Deluxe thick rubber gel-like face pieces. The gel-like ones are much more comfortable, and come in clear pale gold, or clear pale blue.\r\n\r\nI even take it with me traveling. Now if they could develop a portable battery operated lightweight for when I go camping.\r\nCurtis</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084029\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=53617e52a0ccf29f19c750e312df0f31&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">steve</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084029\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-02-17T02:12:14\">2004-02-17T02:12:14</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">hi.  i've gone through the process and ended up with the same machine.\r\n\r\nit gathers data with and without the smart card.\r\n\r\nanyone know how to pull the data out of the machine?</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

    "summary": "<p>For a change, I feel awake today.<br><br>It&apos;s ironic that much of my writing in journals and much of my thought goes toward the topic of consciousness and thought itself.  I&apos;ve been studying and contemplating issues of cognition, awareness, and self for as long as I can remember.  I&apos;ve wolfed down self-help books and pop-psych in high school, went on to get a minor degree in psychology proper in college.  <br><br>I don&apos;t use drugs to tinker with my consciousness (other than caffeine, that is), but I&apos;ve tried various more controlled forms of meditation, visualization, and introspection.  I flirted with Dianetics &amp; Scientology (but ran far, far away), employed <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671700758/0xdecafbad-20\">psycho-cybernetics</a>, got motivated by <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671791540/0xdecafbad-20\">Anthony Robbins</a>, twisted my inner eye around to see itself with the help of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465026567/0xdecafbad-20\">Douglas R. Hofstadter</a>, studied concept-formation and knowledge ala <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452010306/0xdecafbad-20\">Ayn Rand</a>, considered the multiplicity of self with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671657135/0xdecafbad-20\">Marvin Minsky</a>, and explored dreams and archetypes with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0440351839/0xdecafbad-20\">C. G. Jung</a>.  With the help of each influence, I&apos;ve been stitching together a rough manual to my mind.  Just like I&apos;ve hacked around with computing devices, I&apos;ve worked to understand and tweak my own mentality.  <br><br>Oh, but I probably need to explain the irony: For the past few months-- likely the past few years-- I&apos;ve been suffering from <a href=\"http://www.sleepapnea.org/geninfo.html#defined\">sleep apnea</a>.  LIke my father, and his father before him, I&apos;ve developed a horrible snore and have started fighting a losing struggle with sleepiness.  My dad is known for falling asleep constantly: in the midst of conversation, while eating, while getting his haircut, while using a computer.  And lately, those have all been things that I&apos;ve begun to &quot;enjoy&quot;.  Especially bad has been my tendency to fall asleep at work, and especially dangerous has been me falling asleep whenever I have to drive for more than 10 minutes.<br><br>This condition seems to have come upon me so gradually that it&apos;s only been recently, with the scare of losing my <i>new</i> job, and <span class=\"ljuser\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=missadroit\"><img src=\"http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif\" alt=\"userinfo\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom;border:0;\"></a><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/missadroit/\"><b>missadroit</b></a></span>&apos;s persistent persuasion, that I finally ackowledged the problem and sought treatment.  So, I managed to get an appointment at the <a href=\"http://www.med.umich.edu/neuro/sleep.htm\">University of Michigan Sleep Disorders Clinic</a>, where one evening at the beginning of the month I was covered with wires and sent to bed.  About a week later, they called me back to inform me that I had very severe sleep apnea, and was barely getting any sleep at all in a night with about 2-3 breathless episodes per hour.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/features_pro.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/images/exploded_humid.gif\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a>Within a few days of <i>that</i> news-- yesterday, in fact-- I was given a new toy: The <a href=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/features_pro.htm\">REMstar Pro CPAP System</a>.  After one night with the thing, my snoring is gone except for the occasional snort as I become accustomed to a breathing mask, and I feel quite a bit more rested than I have in recent memory.  I still feel a bit tired, but that&apos;s to be expected: I&apos;ve got many nights to catch up for.<br><br>I&apos;d gone from being able to track <a href=\"http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html\">&quot;seven, plus or minus two&quot;</a> things at once down to barely one thing at a time, and that was if I didn&apos;t doze off in the middle of the task and have to rebuild the thought process when I snapped back awake.  The irony of it all is similar to something I was reminded of last week: <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/1058457401.html\">As it turns out, software needs hardware to run.</a>  So, for all my introspective experimentation on myself, and all my attention to consciousness, I&apos;ve been feeling it slipping away from me lately.  As a &quot;software&quot; guy, I can&apos;t do much with my &quot;hardware&quot;.  <br><br>So, I&apos;m very happy that I finally-- after much denial and procrastination by me, and after much encouragement and tolerance by <span class=\"ljuser\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=missadroit\"><img src=\"http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif\" alt=\"userinfo\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom;border:0;\"></a><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/missadroit/\"><b>missadroit</b></a></span>-- called and started the process that ended up with me sleeping through the night again.<br><br>And now maybe I can close my eyes and meditate without losing consciousness again.<br><br>Now maybe I can be myself again.<br><br>(P.S.:  Thank you, <span class=\"ljuser\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=missadroit\"><img src=\"http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif\" alt=\"userinfo\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom;border:0;\"></a><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/missadroit/\"><b>missadroit</b></a></span>.

    "html": "<p>Okay, so at my new job I&#39;m the Guy if it has a transistor in it.  I&#39;m\ndeveloper, sysadmin, and hardware jockey all in one.  This is fun\nto a certain extent, since it tests pretty much everything I know from\nA through Z.  And so far, I&#39;m doing okay.  Every now and then, though,\nI get a bit stumped.\n<br /><br />\nMy most recent adventure involves developing a backup routine for the\noffice.  I just got tape backup working on a Linux box for a big\nSamba-shared directory that we all work out of.  I&#39;m currently winging\nit with <code>star</code> and <code>cpio</code> in =CRON=-scheduled scripts that manage a\n6-tape rotation for me.\n<br /><br />\nFull backups on alternating tapes on Fridays,\nwith incrementals inbetween on tapes labeled by the day.  I even have\nthe server eject the tape and IM me a few times until I go change to\nthe day&#39;s tape.  Tested recovery, and though it could be smoother, it\nis at least possible at the moment.  I figure this is pretty good\nfor my first personal encounter with managing serious backup.  I plan\nto keep researching and to upgrade software at some point soon.\n<br /><br />\nSo, now my boss asks me:  &quot;Hey, can you backup this other folder for me?\nI don&#39;t want to share it, though, and I don&#39;t want you to be able to\nread the files.&quot;  This folder contains some important yet sensitive\nthings like salary information and other things to which I have no\nbusiness having access.\n<br /><br />\nMy stumper then, is this: How do I grab (or cause to be uploaded) a\nfolder of files for backup, say as large as 2GB, from a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> machine,\nwithout having any access myself to read the file contents.  I&#39;ll be\nable to install whatever I need on the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> machine, but the idea is\nthat, when the bits leave that machine for the Linux backup server,\nthere should be no way for me to read their contents.  But, I must be\nable to usefully backup and, in conjunction with the owner of the\nfiles, restore in case of disaster.\n<br /><br />\nOh yeah, and I have no budget for software.  So, I&#39;m trying to work\nthis out using only free tools.\n<br /><br />\nSo, my first though is some sort of encryption on the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> machine.\nEncrypt with GPG or something, leaving my boss with the secret key\non a floppy and the passphrase in his head.  Upload these files\nto a special folder on our shared drive, and it all gets backed up\nlike everything else.\n<br /><br />\nOr, since I don&#39;t even really want to know the names or number of\nfiles in this sensitive folder, can I somehow ZIP up the whole\nshebang and encrypt that before uploading?\n<br /><br />\nUnder Linux, none of this would be much of a problem to me.  But,\nunder <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a>, my knowledge of available tools and means of automation\nfail me.\n<br /><br />\nAny hints from out there?</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=backup_question</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089289\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=468c6b5110ed4bea9c148cf736744c43&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jim</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089289\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T14:53:01\">2003-07-07T14:53:01</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I believe the latest versions of winzip and pkzip actually have decent encryption (none of this trivially breakable stuff.\nHowever, I was under the impression GPG worked on Windows, and you can install cygwin to get all the other things like tar.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089292\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8bcf295bb2e23d6ee0d80710023f2b66&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Anonymous</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089292\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T15:16:44\">2003-07-07T15:16:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Install cygwin on the XP box, then something like:\ntar cf - secretdir | gpg -c > destdir/mysecretfiles.tar.gpg</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089293\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://24.102.209.201/weblogs/ben/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=588bdfdda82be46c638d6956c55ebc38&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://24.102.209.201/weblogs/ben/\">Gnomon</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089293\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T15:19:03\">2003-07-07T15:19:03</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">My Win32 survival kit necessarily contains UnxUtils (a large cross-section of the GNU fileutils ported to run natively, available at http://unxutils.sf.net) which means that you need only bother installing those tools which you'll actually use.\nIn this case, I'd recommend tar and bzip2, and perhaps GPG on top. Sure, it might not be as pretty as Winzip, but it's a heck of a lot more scriptable and there won't be any nasty encryption incompatabilities (see http://slashdot.org/articles/03/06/10/1542216.shtml?tid=185 for some background about this).

Since the files are top secret, why not put the onus on your boss?  XP has a couple of built-in tools that will make the job easy.\nFirst, provided NTFS is utilized, he can take advantage of XP's Encrypting File System.  This will allow him to encrypt and compress his \"important data\".\nNext, assuming he has access to a dir on the \"back-up\" server, he can use XP's Backup, to schedule the backup to run once, Weekly, monthly, at system start-up or logon.\nAgain, this puts him in-control of his own data, and should eliminate the need of \"touching\" his important files. Here are a couple of links for additional information.\nEncrypting Sile System\nXP's Backup\nI hope this helps.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089306\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7a3895376100fa2a20cabab927bf35b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">David</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089306\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-08T08:54:42\">2003-07-08T08:54:42</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">He should just give you access to the contents: if you can't trust your sysadmin, you can't trust anyone.

The idea being with use of domain certificates it's possible to backup that which you cannot normally access.\nThe other quick and dirty solution is to just zip the files into a password protected archive.

    "body": "Okay, so at my new job I'm the Guy if it has a transistor in it.  I'm\r\ndeveloper, sysadmin, and hardware jockey all in one.  This is fun\r\nto a certain extent, since it tests pretty much everything I know from\r\nA through Z.  And so far, I'm doing okay.  Every now and then, though,\r\nI get a bit stumped.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMy most recent adventure involves developing a backup routine for the\r\noffice.  I just got tape backup working on a Linux box for a big\r\nSamba-shared directory that we all work out of.  I'm currently winging\r\nit with <code>star</code> and <code>cpio</code> in =CRON=-scheduled scripts that manage a\r\n6-tape rotation for me.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nFull backups on alternating tapes on Fridays,\r\nwith incrementals inbetween on tapes labeled by the day.  I even have\r\nthe server eject the tape and IM me a few times until I go change to\r\nthe day's tape.  Tested recovery, and though it could be smoother, it\r\nis at least possible at the moment.  I figure this is pretty good\r\nfor my first personal encounter with managing serious backup.  I plan\r\nto keep researching and to upgrade software at some point soon.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo, now my boss asks me:  \"Hey, can you backup this other folder for me?\r\nI don't want to share it, though, and I don't want you to be able to\r\nread the files.\"  This folder contains some important yet sensitive\r\nthings like salary information and other things to which I have no\r\nbusiness having access.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMy stumper then, is this: How do I grab (or cause to be uploaded) a\r\nfolder of files for backup, say as large as 2GB, from a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> machine,\r\nwithout having any access myself to read the file contents.  I'll be\r\nable to install whatever I need on the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> machine, but the idea is\r\nthat, when the bits leave that machine for the Linux backup server,\r\nthere should be no way for me to read their contents.  But, I must be\r\nable to usefully backup and, in conjunction with the owner of the\r\nfiles, restore in case of disaster.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOh yeah, and I have no budget for software.  So, I'm trying to work\r\nthis out using only free tools.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo, my first though is some sort of encryption on the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> machine.\r\nEncrypt with GPG or something, leaving my boss with the secret key\r\non a floppy and the passphrase in his head.  Upload these files\r\nto a special folder on our shared drive, and it all gets backed up\r\nlike everything else.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOr, since I don't even really want to know the names or number of\r\nfiles in this sensitive folder, can I somehow ZIP up the whole\r\nshebang and encrypt that before uploading?\r\n<br /><br />\r\nUnder Linux, none of this would be much of a problem to me.  But,\r\nunder <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a>, my knowledge of available tools and means of automation\r\nfail me.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAny hints from out there?\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=backup_question\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089289\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=468c6b5110ed4bea9c148cf736744c43&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Jim</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089289\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T14:53:01\">2003-07-07T14:53:01</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I believe the latest versions of winzip and pkzip actually have decent encryption (none of this trivially breakable stuff.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was under the impression GPG worked on Windows, and you can install cygwin to get all the other things like tar.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089292\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8bcf295bb2e23d6ee0d80710023f2b66&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Anonymous</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089292\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T15:16:44\">2003-07-07T15:16:44</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Install cygwin on the XP box, then something like:\r\ntar cf - secretdir | gpg -c > destdir/mysecretfiles.tar.gpg</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089293\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://24.102.209.201/weblogs/ben/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=588bdfdda82be46c638d6956c55ebc38&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://24.102.209.201/weblogs/ben/\">Gnomon</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089293\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T15:19:03\">2003-07-07T15:19:03</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">My Win32 survival kit necessarily contains UnxUtils (a large cross-section of the GNU fileutils ported to run natively, available at http://unxutils.sf.net) which means that you need only bother installing those tools which you'll actually use.\r\n\r\nIn this case, I'd recommend tar and bzip2, and perhaps GPG on top.

Since the files are top secret, why not put the onus on your boss?  XP has a couple of built-in tools that will make the job easy.\r\nFirst, provided NTFS is utilized, he can take advantage of XP's Encrypting File System.  This will allow him to encrypt and compress his \"important data\".\r\n\r\nNext, assuming he has access to a dir on the \"back-up\" server, he can use XP's Backup, to schedule the backup to run once, Weekly, monthly, at system start-up or logon.\r\n\r\nAgain, this puts him in-control of his own data, and should eliminate the need of \"touching\" his important files.

    "summary": "<p>Okay, so at my new job I&apos;m the Guy if it has a transistor in it.  I&apos;m\ndeveloper, sysadmin, and hardware jockey all in one.  This is fun\nto a certain extent, since it tests pretty much everything I know from\nA through Z.  And so far, I&apos;m doing okay.  Every now and then, though,\nI get a bit stumped.\n<br><br>\nMy most recent adventure involves developing a backup routine for the\noffice.  I just got tape backup working on a Linux box for a big\nSamba-shared directory that we all work out of.  I&apos;m currently winging\nit with <code>star</code> and <code>cpio</code> in =CRON=-scheduled scripts that manage a\n6-tape rotation for me.\n<br><br>\nFull backups on alternating tapes on Fridays,\nwith incrementals inbetween on tapes labeled by the day.  I even have\nthe server eject the tape and IM me a few times until I go change to\nthe day&apos;s tape.  Tested recovery, and though it could be smoother, it\nis at least possible at the moment.  I figure this is pretty good\nfor my first personal encounter with managing serious backup.  I plan\nto keep researching and to upgrade software at some point soon.\n<br><br>\nSo, now my boss asks me:  &quot;Hey, can you backup this other folder for me?\nI don&apos;t want to share it, though, and I don&apos;t want you to be able to\nread the files.&quot;  This folder contains some important yet sensitive\nthings like salary information and other things to which I have no\nbusiness having access.\n<br><br>\nMy stumper then, is this: How do I grab (or cause to be uploaded) a\nfolder of files for backup, say as large as 2GB, from a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> machine,\nwithout having any access myself to read the file contents.  I&apos;ll be\nable to install whatever I need on the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> machine, but the idea is\nthat, when the bits leave that machine for the Linux backup server,\nthere should be no way for me to read their contents.  But, I must be\nable to usefully backup and, in conjunction with the owner of the\nfiles, restore in case of disaster.\n<br><br>\nOh yeah, and I have no budget for software.  So, I&apos;m trying to work\nthis out using only free tools.\n<br><br>\nSo, my first though is some sort of encryption on the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> machine.\nEncrypt with GPG or something, leaving my boss with the secret key\non a floppy and the passphrase in his head.  Upload these files\nto a special folder on our shared drive, and it all gets backed up\nlike everything else.\n<br><br>\nOr, since I don&apos;t even really want to know the names or number of\nfiles in this sensitive folder, can I somehow ZIP up the whole\nshebang and encrypt that before uploading?\n<br><br>\nUnder Linux, none of this would be much of a problem to me.  But,\nunder <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a>, my knowledge of available tools and means of automation\nfail me.\n<br><br>\nAny hints from out there?</p>\n"

The reason I was wondering is because nothing broke\non <strong>my</strong> desktop.  Every <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed to which I subscribed was still feeding\nme <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, and my home-brew aggregator continued crunching and delivering\nmy fix.\n<br /><br />\nIn fact, my aggregator's <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> consumption is based on\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/13/ultraliberal_rss_parser.html\" target=\"_top\">Mark Pilgrim's Ultra-liberal <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> parser</a>.\nAnd, it looks like Mark's been one\nof the developers involved in the (not)Echo project.  Mark didn't\nbreak anything for me, and couldn't if he wanted to.  On the contrary,\nhe continues to offer his code, and even updated it not more than a\nmonth ago to address link-vs-guid concerns in a useful way.  Hell, even\nthough Mark <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/01/leave_rss_alone.html\" target=\"_top\">demonstrated his break with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> tinkering</a> rather concretely\nby implementing a very literal interpretation of the spec, I can still\ndownload\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/projects/misc/rssparser.py.txt\" target=\"_top\">his working <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> parser code</a>.\n<br /><br />\nI'm a user and a developer all at once: I produce <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, I consume <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>,\nI develop with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, and yet I'm watching (not)Echo with great interest\nand welcome it when it's ready.  I fully expect that, in my tinkering,\nit'll take me less than a lazy evening's work to put together a\ntemplate to publish a (not)Echo feed from my blog, and to add\n(not)Echo support to my aggregator.  Hell, I might even get another\nparser from Mr. Pilgrim to drop into my project.  But, as long as\nothers are still producing and expecting <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, I'll still accept and\noffer <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>.  No breakage here.  In fact, if I get off my lazy butt,\nI'll <a href=\"http://backend.userland.com/davesRss2PoliticalFaq#questionWhatDoesFunkyMeanInTheContextOfRss20\" target=\"_top\">unfunkify</a>\nmy own feed and upgrade it to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 while I'm at it.\nThis isn't really heavyweight stuff here.\n<br /><br />\nThen, I read things like\n<a href=\"http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/06/27.html\" target=\"_top\">Jon Udell's Conversation with Mr. Safe</a>\nand other worries that the whole technology of web content syndication\nand management will be avoided by big money, or even more horribly,\nco-opted by big money in the confusion.  Has the BBC or the New York Times\nexpressed any change of heart with their decision to offer their content\nin a syndication format?  Has the basic tech stopped working?  There are no\npieces of sky on my balcony, though I fully admit that I might be too\nnaive to see them.\n<br /><br />\nSee, to me, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> ain't the thing.  Content syndication and aggregation\nare the thing, and that's going strong.  Are the people with big money\ninterested in this geeky thing called <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, or are they interested in\nsyndication and aggregation?  You know, getting their content out\nthere and read?  Do they know that this (not)Echo effort hasn't\nactually made <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>-supporting software stop working, nor will it ever?\nJust because a bunch of bloggers and tinkerers got together and decided\nto start making an alternate format and API doesn't mean that the\nexisting, mature technology suddenly goes sproing.\n<br /><br />\nIn fact, unless or until this upstart (not)Echo project builds\nsomething amazing in terms of in-spec capabilities and vendor support,\nthe currently working <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>-based tech is a safe bet.  And, in fact, I'd\nbe willing to bet that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> will still be a force to consider in years\nto come, even if (not)Echo introduces some irresistable pull.\nCompanies like Blogger and <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/SixApart?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">SixApart</font></span> would reveal themselves to be run\nby morons if they screwed users by dumping <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> overnight.  (And that's\nignoring the fact that <strong>someone</strong> would come along and whip something\nup to fix their idiocy somehow.)\n<br /><br />\nAnd, I'm sure Microsoft or some well-heeled vendor could try stepping\nin with a format of their own and try to steamroll it through with\ntheir own blogging tools and aggregation services, but you know,\nthey're not omnipotent.  The Internet didn't go away when MSN was\nintroduced, and the web full of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds won't go away even if they\nintroduce MSNBlogs or some such.  It'd take a gigantic fight, lots of\nvery shiny bits, or many bribes.\n<br /><br />\nI mean, that's what it takes to get my cats to do anything.\n<!--more-->\nshortname=syndications_formats\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088195\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.voidstar.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4ca7f18e6a976271f93b665a6a84cec4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.voidstar.com\">Julian Bond</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088195\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T14:54:28\">2003-07-07T14:54:28</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">The only thing that wound me up about Mark P's little jest of removing link, and the only thing that winds me up about Dave W's problems with explaining what he thinks link should be used for, is that they're both messing with the old lizardbrain core in one way or another.

Furthermore, this coexistence will be transparent, just like\ntoday. Over time, necho will, hopefully, become the standard. In the\nmeantime, there will not be a major catastrophe of incompatibility...\nEventually, some of the other formats might become less used, and will\nbe phased out (this is something that is already happening, for\nexample, with the transition from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 0.91 to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0). And because,\ncurrently, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> is being almost exclusively used for updates and\nregenerated constantly at each endpoint, there will be little if any\nswitchover cost, again, as an example of this I put forward the\ntransition from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 0.91 to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 that happened last year.\n<br><br>\nObviously, it&apos;s on us, the developer community, to add necho support\nwithout disruption, and it&apos;s not a problem. After all, we are already\ndoing it today, and moving most (hopefully all) tools into necho will\neventually reduce work for developers in the future, allowing us to,\nfinally, concentrate on improving the tools rather than on how to let\nthem connect to each other.\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/002156.html\">d2r: why (not)echo is important -- part 2</a></cite></small></div>\n<br><br>\nWhen I read\n<a href=\"http://www.jarretthousenorth.com/2003/06/26.html#a2338\" target=\"_top\">Dave&apos;s post</a>\nthat developers were trying to &quot;rip up the pavement, break\neverything and start over&quot;, I wondered what he was talking about.\n(Strangely, I can&apos;t find the original posting on Dave&apos;s blog.

However, just looking around, I observe that\nthere are many people and organizations who seem unable to maintain a\ngood working relationship with Dave.\n<br /><br />\nI regularly get pissed-off at Dave but I really truly do think he's\ntrying to Do The Right Thing; but there are many people out there who\ncan't get past being pissed off. This is what life is like.\n<br /><br />\nThere's an uncannny echo here, for me.  The thing that came before XML\nwas called SGML. SGML was largely invented, and its landscape\ndominated, by a burly, bearded, brilliant New Yorker, Charles\nGoldfarb, who is currently making a well-deserved killing bringing out\nthe Definitive XML Series of books for Prentice-Hall.  Charles is\nloquacious, persistent, smart, loud-voiced, and nearly always gets his\nway.\n<br /><br />\nThere were a lot of people out there (still are, I guess) whom Charles\ndrives completely nuts and just won't work with him. Which is one of\nthe reasons that, when we invented XML, we felt the need to give it a\nnew name and a new acronym and so on. Mind you, Charles, who as I said\nis no dummy, climbed on board the XML bandwagon about fifteen seconds\nafter it got rolling and was a major help in getting the thing\nfinished and delivered.\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/23/SamsPie#davewiner\">ongoing: I Like Pie</a></cite></small></div>\n<br /><br />\nI'm very confused about this.  Dave (or rather, Mr Safe) says that Tim Bray\nsaid something nasty about him here.  In fact, Dave says that Tim said\nhe's all washed up, like Charles Goldfarb.\n<br /><br />\nBut as I read it, I'd love to be washed up like Charles Goldfarb,\nseeing as he's \"currently making a well-deserved killing bringing out\n... books for Prentice-Hall\", having \"climbed on board the XML bandwagon\nabout fifteen seconds after it got rolling and was a major help\nin getting the thing finished and delivered\".  Sounds like Mr. Goldfarb\nis still very active in his community, still considered an authority,\nand is being rewarded for it.  I hope I'm that kind of washed up someday.\n<br /><br />\nIn fact, it'd be pretty keen if that's what people meant if someday\nthey said, \"Les is Dead\", though I can't find where Tim said that.\n<br /><br />\nSo, where's the nastiness?

Dave (or rather, Mr Safe) says that Tim Bray\r\nsaid something nasty about him here.  In fact, Dave says that Tim said\r\nhe's all washed up, like Charles Goldfarb.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBut as I read it, I'd love to be washed up like Charles Goldfarb,\r\nseeing as he's \"currently making a well-deserved killing bringing out\r\n... books for Prentice-Hall\", having \"climbed on board the XML bandwagon\r\nabout fifteen seconds after it got rolling and was a major help\r\nin getting the thing finished and delivered\".  Sounds like Mr. Goldfarb\r\nis still very active in his community, still considered an authority,\r\nand is being rewarded for it.  I hope I'm that kind of washed up someday.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn fact, it'd be pretty keen if that's what people meant if someday\r\nthey said, \"Les is Dead\", though I can't find where Tim said that.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo, where's the nastiness?

In fact, Dave says that Tim said\nhe&apos;s all washed up, like Charles Goldfarb.\n<br><br>\nBut as I read it, I&apos;d love to be washed up like Charles Goldfarb,\nseeing as he&apos;s &quot;currently making a well-deserved killing bringing out\n... books for Prentice-Hall&quot;, having &quot;climbed on board the XML bandwagon\nabout fifteen seconds after it got rolling and was a major help\nin getting the thing finished and delivered&quot;.  Sounds like Mr. Goldfarb\nis still very active in his community, still considered an authority,\nand is being rewarded for it.  I hope I&apos;m that kind of washed up someday.\n<br><br>\nIn fact, it&apos;d be pretty keen if that&apos;s what people meant if someday\nthey said, &quot;Les is Dead&quot;, though I can&apos;t find where Tim said that.\n<br><br>\nSo, where&apos;s the nastiness?  It&apos;s not like Tim took notes from\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/19/teach_me_spanish_curse_words.html\" target=\"_top\">Mark&apos;s spanish lessons</a>\nand told Dave to go &quot;chinga tu madre&quot; or &quot;come verga&quot;.  That&apos;s nasty.\nFar as I can tell, Tim compared Dave to a guy in another community\nwho has his own contingent of haters yet is still undeniably a brilliant\nguy just trying to Do The Right Thing as he sees it.\n<br><br>\nWas the nastiness in saying that some people can&apos;t &quot;maintain a good\nworking relationship with Dave&quot;?  Or that Tim gets &quot;regularly ...\npissed-off at Dave&quot;?  I mean, they&apos;re both obviously true.  It would\nhave been nasty and untrue had Tim said that <strong>no one</strong> can maintain a\ngood relationship with Dave, because there are also obviously a lot of\npeople who do.  But, Tim didn&apos;t say that.\n<br><br>\nSo, as far as I see, I&apos;d personally be happy to have Tim Bray write\nabout me like this in public.\n"

This is it.  This is what I want to see come next from aggregators\nand blogs and syndication and all this mess.  It's what I've been tinkering\nwith in small steps for most of a year.  It's what I intend <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger\">BookmarkBlogger</a>\nto facilitate, as well as <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> and the homebrew aggregator I'm\nhacking around with right now.\n<br /><br />\nAt first thought, I'm not sure whether or not building and\nrepublishing <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> (or Echo) feeds is where it's at.  But, the more I think\nabout it, the more it seems perfectly elegant to me.  All the elements are\nthere, except for an extension to capture ratings.  Extend aggregators to\nconsume these rating-enriched feeds, and instead of just spooling the items\nup into your view, extract and assimilate the ratings into a growing\nmatrix of rater versus rated.  Apply all the various algorithms to\ncorrelate your rating history with that of others to whose ratings you\nsubscribe.  Mix in a little Bayes along with other machine learning.\n<br /><br />\nAs for the interface... well, that's a toughie.  At present, I think I could\nsneak ratings into my daily routine by monitoring my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger\">BookmarkBlogger</a> use and\nwatching the disclosure triangle clicks and link visits in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a>\nbased news aggregator.  I could easily see adding an iTunes-like 5-star\nrating interface, but unless I get some pretty significant payoff from\npainstakingly rating things, I'll never use it.  At least in iTunes, I get\nto have playlists of my faves automatically jumbled together, if I remember\nto use the ratings in the moment. \n<br /><br />\nThe cool thing will be when sites like\n<a href=\"http://www.technorati.com\" target=\"_top\">Technorati</a> and <a href=\"http://www.feedster.com\" target=\"_top\">Feedster</a> start\nusing these ratings, but the even cooler thing is when all that's on\nmy desktop.  This could be easy, though, couldn't it?  What do we call\nit, Syndicated Whuffie?\n<br /><br />\n(Which reminds me:  Eventually, we really gotta get back to the subscription\nproblem.  All these agents polling files everywhere will get to be nasty.\nObviously.  This has been talked about already, but little has happened.\nWe need some <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/PubSub?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">PubSub</font></span>, maybe some caches and concentrators.

This is it.  This is what I want to see come next from aggregators\r\nand blogs and syndication and all this mess.  It's what I've been tinkering\r\nwith in small steps for most of a year.  It's what I intend <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger\">BookmarkBlogger</a>\r\nto facilitate, as well as <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> and the homebrew aggregator I'm\r\nhacking around with right now.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAt first thought, I'm not sure whether or not building and\r\nrepublishing <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> (or Echo) feeds is where it's at.  But, the more I think\r\nabout it, the more it seems perfectly elegant to me.  All the elements are\r\nthere, except for an extension to capture ratings.  Extend aggregators to\r\nconsume these rating-enriched feeds, and instead of just spooling the items\r\nup into your view, extract and assimilate the ratings into a growing\r\nmatrix of rater versus rated.  Apply all the various algorithms to\r\ncorrelate your rating history with that of others to whose ratings you\r\nsubscribe.  Mix in a little Bayes along with other machine learning.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAs for the interface... well, that's a toughie.  At present, I think I could\r\nsneak ratings into my daily routine by monitoring my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger\">BookmarkBlogger</a> use and\r\nwatching the disclosure triangle clicks and link visits in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a>\r\nbased news aggregator.  I could easily see adding an iTunes-like 5-star\r\nrating interface, but unless I get some pretty significant payoff from\r\npainstakingly rating things, I'll never use it.  At least in iTunes, I get\r\nto have playlists of my faves automatically jumbled together, if I remember\r\nto use the ratings in the moment. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe cool thing will be when sites like\r\n<a href=\"http://www.technorati.com\" target=\"_top\">Technorati</a> and <a href=\"http://www.feedster.com\" target=\"_top\">Feedster</a> start\r\nusing these ratings, but the even cooler thing is when all that's on\r\nmy desktop.  This could be easy, though, couldn't it?  What do we call\r\nit, Syndicated Whuffie?\r\n<br /><br />\r\n(Which reminds me:  Eventually, we really gotta get back to the subscription\r\nproblem.  All these agents polling files everywhere will get to be nasty.\r\nObviously.

side effect of \"normal\" behaviour. Maybe you should just give a +1 to any item and/or feed that you click through in the aggregator to view in the parent website. this is much more likely to generate meaningful metadata than relying on human  rating. \r\n\r\nRe. Republishing feeds, I already republish RSS for the composite topics on Ecademy. eg \r\nWiFi weblogs = \r\nhttp://wifi.ecademy.com/module.php?mod=import&op=rssbundle&id=14\r\n\r\nInterestingly, I read the feed into a database cleaning it up in the process. The re-published feed is read out of the database so the items are not necessarily what went in.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086975\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5a70d939a73fa73603f2a9255ab81d21&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">BillSeitz</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086975\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-03T11:34:30\">2003-07-03T11:34:30</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I'm with Julian.

It&apos;s what I intend <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger\">BookmarkBlogger</a>\nto facilitate, as well as <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> and the homebrew aggregator I&apos;m\nhacking around with right now.\n<br><br>\nAt first thought, I&apos;m not sure whether or not building and\nrepublishing <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> (or Echo) feeds is where it&apos;s at.  But, the more I think\nabout it, the more it seems perfectly elegant to me.  All the elements are\nthere, except for an extension to capture ratings.  Extend aggregators to\nconsume these rating-enriched feeds, and instead of just spooling the items\nup into your view, extract and assimilate the ratings into a growing\nmatrix of rater versus rated.  Apply all the various algorithms to\ncorrelate your rating history with that of others to whose ratings you\nsubscribe.  Mix in a little Bayes along with other machine learning.\n<br><br>\nAs for the interface... well, that&apos;s a toughie.  At present, I think I could\nsneak ratings into my daily routine by monitoring my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger\">BookmarkBlogger</a> use and\nwatching the disclosure triangle clicks and link visits in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a>\nbased news aggregator.  I could easily see adding an iTunes-like 5-star\nrating interface, but unless I get some pretty significant payoff from\npainstakingly rating things, I&apos;ll never use it.  At least in iTunes, I get\nto have playlists of my faves automatically jumbled together, if I remember\nto use the ratings in the moment. \n<br><br>\nThe cool thing will be when sites like\n<a href=\"http://www.technorati.com\" target=\"_top\">Technorati</a> and <a href=\"http://www.feedster.com\" target=\"_top\">Feedster</a> start\nusing these ratings, but the even cooler thing is when all that&apos;s on\nmy desktop.  This could be easy, though, couldn&apos;t it?  What do we call\nit, Syndicated Whuffie?\n<br><br>\n(Which reminds me:  Eventually, we really gotta get back to the subscription\nproblem.  All these agents polling files everywhere will get to be nasty.\nObviously.  This has been talked about already, but little has happened.\nWe need some <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/PubSub?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">PubSub</font></span>, maybe some caches and concentrators.  All stuff that&apos;s\nbeen mentioned in passing before, and left by the wayside as unsexy.)\n"
