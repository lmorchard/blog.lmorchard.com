    "summary": "<p>Oh and while I'm writing about watching video files on my TV, I've\nbeen thinking of getting myself a tape drive.  Sure, I'll use it to\nactually, finally, back up all the important things I have littered\naround my handful of machines.  Having established a backup routine\nat work, I've gotten to thinking.\n<br><br>\nHow bad an idea would it be to use a tape drive to store TV shows?\nI've been capturing them with the VCD format, which gives me around\n600MB per hour of show.  This fills up my drive pretty quickly,\nobviously.  I know I really should take sometime to revisit things and\ntry another video codec, since originally I used VCD because I burned\neverything to CD for my DVD player, but now I'm streaming files to my\nPowerbook over the network which gives me a lot more flexibility in\nrecording options.\n<br><br>\nHowever, not burning to CD leaves me with a hard drive full of video\nthat I'm hesitant to delete yet have no good reason to need laying around on a\nhigh speed hard drive.  But, burning all that to a spindle-worth\nof blank CDs without a Lego Mindstorms based CD-changer robot leaves\nme shuddering.  I recall reading about <a href=\"http://www.djzone.net/pg/0101/tf01001.shtml\" target=\"_top\">a DJ-bot</a>\nthat did this for playing music, and I notice <a href=\"http://ask.slashdot.org/articles/03/07/22/122253.shtml?tid=137&amp;tid=198\" target=\"_top\">via Slashdot</a> that someone with a\ndecent woodshop <a href=\"http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/tech/changer.html\" target=\"_top\">has provided plans</a>\nfor such a beast for a CD writer.  But I can't afford the Legos at\nthe present moment, and I'll only end up hurting myself working with\npower tools.\n<br><br>\nThen, I remember that high capacity tapes make backing up lots of data\neasy at work.  I know that the tape trade off is capacity and price\nfor speed of access.  But, if all I need to do is skip from one file\nto the next and only need relatively low bandwidth to stream the file\nfrom the tape, this sounds like a great way to archive video.\nDepending on the video compression, maybe I could fit a whole season\nor two of a show onto a single tape.\n<br><br>\nSeems like a good idea, though pricey.  But maybe the price and cost\nof media would offset the pain in the ass of any other method.  I probably\nshould look more into the price and pain of a DVD burner, but the idea\nof more disc-like things laying around worries me.\n<br><br>\nWhat do you think?</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>I don't gush about it very often, but I love my 12\" Powerbook.  Since\nI got it this past March, it has been my primary machine for both work\nand home.  And other than wishing that there was a 1GB memory module\nout for it and grumbling that I've lost one of the rubber footies on\nthe bottom, I've been extremely happy with it.\n<br><br>\nAnd just last night, I was reminded of yet another feature that's made me\nglad I got it: the included\n<a href=\"http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/71505/wo/uo52A1Y3Ktac2nzhqf9RjQrQd5i/1.3.0.5.8.3.29.13.0\" target=\"_top\">Composite/SVHS video adapter</a>.\nI'd had the <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/71505/wo/uo52A1Y3Ktac2nzhqf9RjQrQd5i/1.3.0.5.8.3.22.13.0\" target=\"_top\">AV cable</a>\nfor my iBook before it, but the use of the adapter on the Powerbook\nhas a very important difference: <i>dual display mode</i>.\n<br><br>\nSee, when I connected my iBook up to my home entertainment complex,\nI got reduced resolution back on the LCD, and anything I did that went\nfull screen (ie. playing a DVD or a movie file) took over the machine.\nBut with the Powerbook, its connection to my television is just a second\ndesktop, not much different than the second monitor I use at work.\n<br><br>\nSo, while I'm at home on the futon with my girlfriend, I often stream\nvideos off a PC in the next room that's been recording TV shows for\nme, and present them on this second desktop.  Most apps I use to view\nmovies, such as <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/quicktime/upgrade/\" target=\"_top\">Quicktime Pro</a>\nand <a href=\"http://www.videolan.org/\" target=\"_top\">VideoLAN</a>,\nallow me to pick a monitor for fullscreen mode. Meanwhile, the LCD on the\nPowerbook is still available for other work while we watch.\n<br><br>\nIt's just a little thing, but it's a thing that lets me get much of the\nbenefit of a dedicated\n<a href=\"http://www.digitalconnection.com/FAQ/HTPC.htm\" target=\"_top\">Home Theater PC</a> without\nhaving to buy or build a box that looks nice alongside all our\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/games_stuff.html\" target=\"_top\">video game consoles</a>.\nWhile I'd still like to take on the project someday, my Powerbook does\njust fine for the display and audio end of things, while an aging Windows PC\nin the next room <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooach.html\" target=\"_top\">snags a few TV shows</a>\nfor me.\n<br><br>\nOf course, if all you want is an HTPC, the Powerbook is expensive\noverkill.  But, if you're shopping for a laptop and want some fringe\nbenefits, I think this is definitely one that doesn't get much attention.</p>\n",

Then, this past January, the abuse in the practice was revealed and &lt;a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooodoe.html\"&gt;using the User-Agent header&lt;/a&gt; was recommended for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, just for the hell of it, I &lt;a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/21/atom_aggregator_behavior_http_level.html#c003136\"&gt;asked about the User-Agent header&lt;/a&gt; for use in the context over at &lt;a href=\"http://www.diveintomark.org\"&gt;Mark&amp;#8217;s place&lt;/a&gt; to see what responses I&amp;#8217;d get.  The one that seemed most informative was from &lt;a href=\"http://IAwiki.net/EricScheid\"&gt;Eric Scheid&lt;/a&gt; as quoted above, referring me to &lt;a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.22\"&gt;the &lt;span class=\"caps\"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;/1.1 spec, section 14.22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As per Eric&amp;#8217;s comment and the spec, the value of a &amp;#8220;From&amp;#8221; header &lt;span class=\"caps\"&gt;SHOULD&lt;/span&gt; be an email address, but I would think that using a &lt;span class=\"caps\"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; wouldn&amp;#8217;t be &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; much an abuse of this header.  Seems like a good idea to stick either the &lt;span class=\"caps\"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to a blog here, or even better, stick the &lt;span class=\"caps\"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to your &lt;span class=\"caps\"&gt;FOAF&lt;/span&gt; file here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d really like to see this get built into aggregators as an option, though not turned on by defauilt for privacy&amp;#8217;s sake.  I like the idea of leaving my name or a trail back to me at the doorstep of people whose feeds I&amp;#8217;m reading, and I like the idea of standardizing the practice as cleanly as possible.  Using the &amp;#8220;From&amp;#8221; header seems to be the best option so far, versus header abuse and User-Agent overloading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Man.  One of these days, I really have to get around to studying those specs in full, rather than just sporadically referencing them.  Thank goodness for smart guys like &lt;a href=\"http://www.diveintomark.org\"&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://IAwiki.net/EricScheid\"&gt;Eric&lt;/a&gt; (among others) who actually take the time to read these things and try to communicate the gist to the rest of us busy developers!&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n",

    "summary": "<p>For a change, I feel awake today.<br><br>It's ironic that much of my writing in journals and much of my thought goes toward the topic of consciousness and thought itself.  I've been studying and contemplating issues of cognition, awareness, and self for as long as I can remember.  I've wolfed down self-help books and pop-psych in high school, went on to get a minor degree in psychology proper in college.  <br><br>I don't use drugs to tinker with my consciousness (other than caffeine, that is), but I've tried various more controlled forms of meditation, visualization, and introspection.  I flirted with Dianetics &amp; Scientology (but ran far, far away), employed <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671700758/0xdecafbad-20\">psycho-cybernetics</a>, got motivated by <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671791540/0xdecafbad-20\">Anthony Robbins</a>, twisted my inner eye around to see itself with the help of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465026567/0xdecafbad-20\">Douglas R. Hofstadter</a>, studied concept-formation and knowledge ala <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452010306/0xdecafbad-20\">Ayn Rand</a>, considered the multiplicity of self with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671657135/0xdecafbad-20\">Marvin Minsky</a>, and explored dreams and archetypes with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0440351839/0xdecafbad-20\">C. G. Jung</a>.  With the help of each influence, I've been stitching together a rough manual to my mind.  Just like I've hacked around with computing devices, I've worked to understand and tweak my own mentality.  <br><br>Oh, but I probably need to explain the irony: For the past few months-- likely the past few years-- I've been suffering from <a href=\"http://www.sleepapnea.org/geninfo.html#defined\">sleep apnea</a>.  LIke my father, and his father before him, I've developed a horrible snore and have started fighting a losing struggle with sleepiness.  My dad is known for falling asleep constantly: in the midst of conversation, while eating, while getting his haircut, while using a computer.  And lately, those have all been things that I've begun to \"enjoy\".  Especially bad has been my tendency to fall asleep at work, and especially dangerous has been me falling asleep whenever I have to drive for more than 10 minutes.<br><br>This condition seems to have come upon me so gradually that it's only been recently, with the scare of losing my <i>new</i> job, and <span class=\"ljuser\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=missadroit\"><img src=\"http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif\" alt=\"userinfo\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom;border:0;\"></a><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/missadroit/\"><b>missadroit</b></a></span>'s persistent persuasion, that I finally ackowledged the problem and sought treatment.  So, I managed to get an appointment at the <a href=\"http://www.med.umich.edu/neuro/sleep.htm\">University of Michigan Sleep Disorders Clinic</a>, where one evening at the beginning of the month I was covered with wires and sent to bed.  About a week later, they called me back to inform me that I had very severe sleep apnea, and was barely getting any sleep at all in a night with about 2-3 breathless episodes per hour.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/features_pro.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/images/exploded_humid.gif\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a>Within a few days of <i>that</i> news-- yesterday, in fact-- I was given a new toy: The <a href=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/features_pro.htm\">REMstar Pro CPAP System</a>.  After one night with the thing, my snoring is gone except for the occasional snort as I become accustomed to a breathing mask, and I feel quite a bit more rested than I have in recent memory.  I still feel a bit tired, but that's to be expected: I've got many nights to catch up for.<br><br>I'd gone from being able to track <a href=\"http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html\">\"seven, plus or minus two\"</a> things at once down to barely one thing at a time, and that was if I didn't doze off in the middle of the task and have to rebuild the thought process when I snapped back awake.  The irony of it all is similar to something I was reminded of last week: <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/1058457401.html\">As it turns out, software needs hardware to run.</a>  So, for all my introspective experimentation on myself, and all my attention to consciousness, I've been feeling it slipping away from me lately.  As a \"software\" guy, I can't do much with my \"hardware\".  <br><br>So, I'm very happy that I finally-- after much denial and procrastination by me, and after much encouragement and tolerance by <span class=\"ljuser\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=missadroit\"><img src=\"http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif\" alt=\"userinfo\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom;border:0;\"></a><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/missadroit/\"><b>missadroit</b></a></span>-- called and started the process that ended up with me sleeping through the night again.<br><br>And now maybe I can close my eyes and meditate without losing consciousness again.<br><br>Now maybe I can be myself again.<br><br>(P.S.:  Thank you, <span class=\"ljuser\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=missadroit\"><img src=\"http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif\" alt=\"userinfo\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom;border:0;\"></a><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/missadroit/\"><b>missadroit</b></a></span>.

    "summary": "<p>Okay, so at my new job I'm the Guy if it has a transistor in it.  I'm\ndeveloper, sysadmin, and hardware jockey all in one.  This is fun\nto a certain extent, since it tests pretty much everything I know from\nA through Z.  And so far, I'm doing okay.  Every now and then, though,\nI get a bit stumped.\n<br><br>\nMy most recent adventure involves developing a backup routine for the\noffice.  I just got tape backup working on a Linux box for a big\nSamba-shared directory that we all work out of.  I'm currently winging\nit with <code>star</code> and <code>cpio</code> in =CRON=-scheduled scripts that manage a\n6-tape rotation for me.\n<br><br>\nFull backups on alternating tapes on Fridays,\nwith incrementals inbetween on tapes labeled by the day.  I even have\nthe server eject the tape and IM me a few times until I go change to\nthe day's tape.  Tested recovery, and though it could be smoother, it\nis at least possible at the moment.  I figure this is pretty good\nfor my first personal encounter with managing serious backup.  I plan\nto keep researching and to upgrade software at some point soon.\n<br><br>\nSo, now my boss asks me:  \"Hey, can you backup this other folder for me?\nI don't want to share it, though, and I don't want you to be able to\nread the files.\"  This folder contains some important yet sensitive\nthings like salary information and other things to which I have no\nbusiness having access.\n<br><br>\nMy stumper then, is this: How do I grab (or cause to be uploaded) a\nfolder of files for backup, say as large as 2GB, from a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> machine,\nwithout having any access myself to read the file contents.  I'll be\nable to install whatever I need on the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> machine, but the idea is\nthat, when the bits leave that machine for the Linux backup server,\nthere should be no way for me to read their contents.  But, I must be\nable to usefully backup and, in conjunction with the owner of the\nfiles, restore in case of disaster.\n<br><br>\nOh yeah, and I have no budget for software.  So, I'm trying to work\nthis out using only free tools.\n<br><br>\nSo, my first though is some sort of encryption on the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> machine.\nEncrypt with GPG or something, leaving my boss with the secret key\non a floppy and the passphrase in his head.  Upload these files\nto a special folder on our shared drive, and it all gets backed up\nlike everything else.\n<br><br>\nOr, since I don't even really want to know the names or number of\nfiles in this sensitive folder, can I somehow ZIP up the whole\nshebang and encrypt that before uploading?\n<br><br>\nUnder Linux, none of this would be much of a problem to me.  But,\nunder <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a>, my knowledge of available tools and means of automation\nfail me.\n<br><br>\nAny hints from out there?</p>\n",

Furthermore, this coexistence will be transparent, just like\ntoday. Over time, necho will, hopefully, become the standard. In the\nmeantime, there will not be a major catastrophe of incompatibility...\nEventually, some of the other formats might become less used, and will\nbe phased out (this is something that is already happening, for\nexample, with the transition from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 0.91 to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0).

After all, we are already\ndoing it today, and moving most (hopefully all) tools into necho will\neventually reduce work for developers in the future, allowing us to,\nfinally, concentrate on improving the tools rather than on how to let\nthem connect to each other.\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/002156.html\">d2r: why (not)echo is important -- part 2</a></cite></small></div>\n<br><br>\nWhen I read\n<a href=\"http://www.jarretthousenorth.com/2003/06/26.html#a2338\" target=\"_top\">Dave's post</a>\nthat developers were trying to \"rip up the pavement, break\neverything and start over\", I wondered what he was talking about.\n(Strangely, I can't find the original posting on Dave's blog.  Maybe\n<a href=\"http://www.jarretthousenorth.com/2003/06/26.html#a2342\" target=\"_top\">the statement was revised</a>\nin the face of a later endorsement of the\nproject?)  The reason I was wondering is because nothing broke\non <strong>my</strong> desktop.  Every <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed to which I subscribed was still feeding\nme <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, and my home-brew aggregator continued crunching and delivering\nmy fix.\n<br><br>\nIn fact, my aggregator's <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> consumption is based on\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/13/ultraliberal_rss_parser.html\" target=\"_top\">Mark Pilgrim's Ultra-liberal </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> parser.\nAnd, it looks like Mark's been one\nof the developers involved in the (not)Echo project.  Mark didn't\nbreak anything for me, and couldn't if he wanted to.  On the contrary,\nhe continues to offer his code, and even updated it not more than a\nmonth ago to address link-vs-guid concerns in a useful way.  Hell, even\nthough Mark <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/01/leave_rss_alone.html\" target=\"_top\">demonstrated his break with </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> tinkering rather concretely\nby implementing a very literal interpretation of the spec, I can still\ndownload\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/projects/misc/rssparser.py.txt\" target=\"_top\">his working </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> parser code.\n<br><br>\nI'm a user and a developer all at once: I produce <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, I consume <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>,\nI develop with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, and yet I'm watching (not)Echo with great interest\nand welcome it when it's ready.  I fully expect that, in my tinkering,\nit'll take me less than a lazy evening's work to put together a\ntemplate to publish a (not)Echo feed from my blog, and to add\n(not)Echo support to my aggregator.  Hell, I might even get another\nparser from Mr. Pilgrim to drop into my project.  But, as long as\nothers are still producing and expecting <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, I'll still accept and\noffer <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>.  No breakage here.  In fact, if I get off my lazy butt,\nI'll <a href=\"http://backend.userland.com/davesRss2PoliticalFaq#questionWhatDoesFunkyMeanInTheContextOfRss20\" target=\"_top\">unfunkify</a>\nmy own feed and upgrade it to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 while I'm at it.\nThis isn't really heavyweight stuff here.\n<br><br>\nThen, I read things like\n<a href=\"http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/06/27.html\" target=\"_top\">Jon Udell's Conversation with Mr. Safe</a>\nand other worries that the whole technology of web content syndication\nand management will be avoided by big money, or even more horribly,\nco-opted by big money in the confusion.  Has the BBC or the New York Times\nexpressed any change of heart with their decision to offer their content\nin a syndication format?  Has the basic tech stopped working?  There are no\npieces of sky on my balcony, though I fully admit that I might be too\nnaive to see them.\n<br><br>\nSee, to me, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> ain't the thing.  Content syndication and aggregation\nare the thing, and that's going strong.  Are the people with big money\ninterested in this geeky thing called <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, or are they interested in\nsyndication and aggregation?  You know, getting their content out\nthere and read?  Do they know that this (not)Echo effort hasn't\nactually made <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>-supporting software stop working, nor will it ever?\nJust because a bunch of bloggers and tinkerers got together and decided\nto start making an alternate format and API doesn't mean that the\nexisting, mature technology suddenly goes sproing.\n<br><br>\nIn fact, unless or until this upstart (not)Echo project builds\nsomething amazing in terms of in-spec capabilities and vendor support,\nthe currently working <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>-based tech is a safe bet.  And, in fact, I'd\nbe willing to bet that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> will still be a force to consider in years\nto come, even if (not)Echo introduces some irresistable pull.\nCompanies like Blogger and <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/SixApart?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">SixApart</font></span> would reveal themselves to be run\nby morons if they screwed users by dumping <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> overnight.  (And that's\nignoring the fact that <strong>someone</strong> would come along and whip something\nup to fix their idiocy somehow.)\n<br><br>\nAnd, I'm sure Microsoft or some well-heeled vendor could try stepping\nin with a format of their own and try to steamroll it through with\ntheir own blogging tools and aggregation services, but you know,\nthey're not omnipotent.  The Internet didn't go away when MSN was\nintroduced, and the web full of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds won't go away even if they\nintroduce MSNBlogs or some such.  It'd take a gigantic fight, lots of\nvery shiny bits, or many bribes.\n<br><br>\nI mean, that's what it takes to get my cats to do anything.\n",

This is what life is like.\n<br><br>\nThere's an uncannny echo here, for me.  The thing that came before XML\nwas called SGML. SGML was largely invented, and its landscape\ndominated, by a burly, bearded, brilliant New Yorker, Charles\nGoldfarb, who is currently making a well-deserved killing bringing out\nthe Definitive XML Series of books for Prentice-Hall.  Charles is\nloquacious, persistent, smart, loud-voiced, and nearly always gets his\nway.\n<br><br>\nThere were a lot of people out there (still are, I guess) whom Charles\ndrives completely nuts and just won't work with him. Which is one of\nthe reasons that, when we invented XML, we felt the need to give it a\nnew name and a new acronym and so on. Mind you, Charles, who as I said\nis no dummy, climbed on board the XML bandwagon about fifteen seconds\nafter it got rolling and was a major help in getting the thing\nfinished and delivered.\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/23/SamsPie#davewiner\">ongoing: I Like Pie</a></cite></small></div>\n<br><br>\nI'm very confused about this.  Dave (or rather, Mr Safe) says that Tim Bray\nsaid something nasty about him here.  In fact, Dave says that Tim said\nhe's all washed up, like Charles Goldfarb.\n<br><br>\nBut as I read it, I'd love to be washed up like Charles Goldfarb,\nseeing as he's \"currently making a well-deserved killing bringing out\n... books for Prentice-Hall\", having \"climbed on board the XML bandwagon\nabout fifteen seconds after it got rolling and was a major help\nin getting the thing finished and delivered\".  Sounds like Mr. Goldfarb\nis still very active in his community, still considered an authority,\nand is being rewarded for it.  I hope I'm that kind of washed up someday.\n<br><br>\nIn fact, it'd be pretty keen if that's what people meant if someday\nthey said, \"Les is Dead\", though I can't find where Tim said that.\n<br><br>\nSo, where's the nastiness?  It's not like Tim took notes from\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/19/teach_me_spanish_curse_words.html\" target=\"_top\">Mark's spanish lessons</a>\nand told Dave to go \"chinga tu madre\" or \"come verga\".  That's nasty.\nFar as I can tell, Tim compared Dave to a guy in another community\nwho has his own contingent of haters yet is still undeniably a brilliant\nguy just trying to Do The Right Thing as he sees it.\n<br><br>\nWas the nastiness in saying that some people can't \"maintain a good\nworking relationship with Dave\"?  Or that Tim gets \"regularly ...\npissed-off at Dave\"?  I mean, they're both obviously true.  It would\nhave been nasty and untrue had Tim said that <strong>no one</strong> can maintain a\ngood relationship with Dave, because there are also obviously a lot of\npeople who do.  But, Tim didn't say that.\n<br><br>\nSo, as far as I see, I'd personally be happy to have Tim Bray write\nabout me like this in public.\n",

But, the more I think\nabout it, the more it seems perfectly elegant to me.  All the elements are\nthere, except for an extension to capture ratings.  Extend aggregators to\nconsume these rating-enriched feeds, and instead of just spooling the items\nup into your view, extract and assimilate the ratings into a growing\nmatrix of rater versus rated.  Apply all the various algorithms to\ncorrelate your rating history with that of others to whose ratings you\nsubscribe.  Mix in a little Bayes along with other machine learning.\n<br><br>\nAs for the interface... well, that's a toughie.  At present, I think I could\nsneak ratings into my daily routine by monitoring my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger\">BookmarkBlogger</a> use and\nwatching the disclosure triangle clicks and link visits in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a>\nbased news aggregator.  I could easily see adding an iTunes-like 5-star\nrating interface, but unless I get some pretty significant payoff from\npainstakingly rating things, I'll never use it.  At least in iTunes, I get\nto have playlists of my faves automatically jumbled together, if I remember\nto use the ratings in the moment. \n<br><br>\nThe cool thing will be when sites like\n<a href=\"http://www.technorati.com\" target=\"_top\">Technorati</a> and <a href=\"http://www.feedster.com\" target=\"_top\">Feedster</a> start\nusing these ratings, but the even cooler thing is when all that's on\nmy desktop.  This could be easy, though, couldn't it?  What do we call\nit, Syndicated Whuffie?\n<br><br>\n(Which reminds me:  Eventually, we really gotta get back to the subscription\nproblem.  All these agents polling files everywhere will get to be nasty.\nObviously.
