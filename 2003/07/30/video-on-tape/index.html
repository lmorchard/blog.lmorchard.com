        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Oh and while I&amp;apos;m writing about watching video files on my TV, I&amp;apos;ve
been thinking of getting myself a tape drive.  Sure, I&amp;apos;ll use it to
actually, finally, back up all the important things I have littered
around my handful of machines.  Having established a backup routine
at work, I&amp;apos;ve gotten to thinking.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
How bad an idea would it be to use a tape drive to store TV shows?
I&amp;apos;ve been capturing them with the VCD format, which gives me around
600MB per hour of show.  This fills up my drive pretty quickly,
obviously.  I know I really should take sometime to revisit things and
try another video codec, since originally I used VCD because I burned
everything to CD for my DVD player, but now I&amp;apos;m streaming files to my
Powerbook over the network which gives me a lot more flexibility in
recording options.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
However, not burning to CD leaves me with a hard drive full of video
that I&amp;apos;m hesitant to delete yet have no good reason to need laying around on a
high speed hard drive.  But, burning all that to a spindle-worth
of blank CDs without a Lego Mindstorms based CD-changer robot leaves
me shuddering.  I recall reading about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.djzone.net/pg/0101/tf01001.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;a DJ-bot&lt;/a&gt;
that did this for playing music, and I notice &lt;a href=&quot;http://ask.slashdot.org/articles/03/07/22/122253.shtml?tid=137&amp;amp;tid=198&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;via Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; that someone with a
decent woodshop &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/tech/changer.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;has provided plans&lt;/a&gt;
for such a beast for a CD writer.  But I can&amp;apos;t afford the Legos at
the present moment, and I&amp;apos;ll only end up hurting myself working with
power tools.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then, I remember that high capacity tapes make backing up lots of data
easy at work.  I know that the tape trade off is capacity and price
for speed of access.  But, if all I need to do is skip from one file
to the next and only need relatively low bandwidth to stream the file
from the tape, this sounds like a great way to archive video.
Depending on the video compression, maybe I could fit a whole season
or two of a show onto a single tape.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Seems like a good idea, though pricey.  But maybe the price and cost
of media would offset the pain in the ass of any other method.  I probably
should look more into the price and pain of a DVD burner, but the idea
of more disc-like things laying around worries me.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

<div class="content">I would like to see how this works out for you. I have several big hard drives full of vide. When I reach 99% I then burn to VCD or DVD. I have to have a whole self just for storage, and the drives re-fill. I'm a digital pack rat. I've been looking on ebay at tape drives in the 20/40 gig range. I think it is cheaper.</div>

<div class="content">I have concidered this many times.
The problem is simple: tapes are expensive, even when we forget the price of the tape drive for a moment.
The best value tape I could find in a large webshop was FUJIFILM Super DLTx1-160 GB at 163$.
The cheapest harddrive was Samsung 160GB SpinPoint V80, concidentally also at 163$.
So in my opinion you might as well buy harddrives.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with mesh - tape drives are simply too slow, finicky and prone to break down. I use a pair of external Firewire hard drives for my backups. Read this interesting interview of database pioneer Jim Gray:

<div class="content">For the tape question... hdd's are cheaper and faster - long term they're not exactly known to be reliable yet, but people haven't really done long term tests on them that I can see.  A used DLT drive (even an autoloader) doesn't run for too much on Ebay, but the tapes are pricey, ~$30 even for refurbs and you'll be lucky to get 50GB's out of them with compression turned on even using DLT-IV (since this is mpeg1/vcd expect to be closer to the 40GB limit though).
Meanwhile, even a non-techno savvy coworker was impressed that 120GB 7200rpm hdd's were about $80 a pop now.  Very very tempting.  Look around and you might find even better bang-per-buck
Another interesting development, that seems a lot more tempting than Firewire and USB enclosures is eSATA (external Serial ATA).  Such as can be found at http://highpoint-tech.com/
It's potentially a lot faster than USB & Firewire (SATA is currently 133MB's threshold, which is basically the max of a standard 32bit 33Mhz PCI bus anyway - disks do not write anywhere near that quickly mind you), and potentially a bit cheaper too.  I haven't done the digging there, so SATA prices, a controller & enclosures might actually rule that out, but it is worth looking into.  Regardless, of nitpicking prices though it will definitely be cheaper & faster than used DLT crapola, plus in all likelihood you might need to buy a USB2 or firewire controller anyway, so getting a SATA controller instead isn't like to be much extra work, though it might be less standard (maybe buy a combo firewire & USB2 enclosure in case you need to bring it to a friend as well).
As an aside, you might want to contemplate using something like MPEG4 or DivX instead of mpeg1/vcd - you get much higher quality than VCD's with about the same density of data.</div>
