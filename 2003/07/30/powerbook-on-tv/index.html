        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;apos;t gush about it very often, but I love my 12&amp;quot; Powerbook.  Since
I got it this past March, it has been my primary machine for both work
and home.  And other than wishing that there was a 1GB memory module
out for it and grumbling that I&amp;apos;ve lost one of the rubber footies on
the bottom, I&amp;apos;ve been extremely happy with it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And just last night, I was reminded of yet another feature that&amp;apos;s made me
glad I got it: the included
&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/71505/wo/uo52A1Y3Ktac2nzhqf9RjQrQd5i/1.3.0.5.8.3.29.13.0&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Composite/SVHS video adapter&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;apos;d had the &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/71505/wo/uo52A1Y3Ktac2nzhqf9RjQrQd5i/1.3.0.5.8.3.22.13.0&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;AV cable&lt;/a&gt;
for my iBook before it, but the use of the adapter on the Powerbook
has a very important difference: &lt;i&gt;dual display mode&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
See, when I connected my iBook up to my home entertainment complex,
I got reduced resolution back on the LCD, and anything I did that went
full screen (ie. playing a DVD or a movie file) took over the machine.
But with the Powerbook, its connection to my television is just a second
desktop, not much different than the second monitor I use at work.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, while I&amp;apos;m at home on the futon with my girlfriend, I often stream
videos off a PC in the next room that&amp;apos;s been recording TV shows for
me, and present them on this second desktop.  Most apps I use to view
movies, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/quicktime/upgrade/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Quicktime Pro&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.videolan.org/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;VideoLAN&lt;/a&gt;,
allow me to pick a monitor for fullscreen mode. Meanwhile, the LCD on the
Powerbook is still available for other work while we watch.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;apos;s just a little thing, but it&amp;apos;s a thing that lets me get much of the
benefit of a dedicated
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalconnection.com/FAQ/HTPC.htm&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Home Theater PC&lt;/a&gt; without
having to buy or build a box that looks nice alongside all our
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/games_stuff.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;video game consoles&lt;/a&gt;.
While I&amp;apos;d still like to take on the project someday, my Powerbook does
just fine for the display and audio end of things, while an aging Windows PC
in the next room &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooach.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;snags a few TV shows&lt;/a&gt;
for me.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Of course, if all you want is an HTPC, the Powerbook is expensive
overkill.  But, if you&amp;apos;re shopping for a laptop and want some fringe
benefits, I think this is definitely one that doesn&amp;apos;t get much attention.&lt;/p&gt;

<div class="content">have you had any issues whatsoever with the closing of your powerbook? after a week mine refused to latch shut, it no longer seemed magnetic. when i sent it back to apple they returned it in the same shape and said "push harder." i've talked to one other person with this problem, and i just wondered if it was widespread. other than that i'm having a ball authoring DVDs, and it's going to be great keeping my lap nice and warm during the cold michigan winters.</div>
