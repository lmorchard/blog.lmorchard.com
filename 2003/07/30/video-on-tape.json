A used DLT drive (even an autoloader) doesn&#39;t run for too much on Ebay, but the tapes are pricey, ~$30 even for refurbs and you&#39;ll be lucky to get 50GB&#39;s out of them with compression turned on even using DLT-IV (since this is mpeg1/vcd expect to be closer to the 40GB limit though).\n</code></pre><p>Meanwhile, even a non-techno savvy coworker was impressed that 120GB 7200rpm hdd&#39;s were about $80 a pop now.  Very very tempting.  Look around and you might find even better bang-per-buck</p>\n<p>Another interesting development, that seems a lot more tempting than Firewire and USB enclosures is eSATA (external Serial ATA).  Such as can be found at <a href=\"http://highpoint-tech.com/\">http://highpoint-tech.com/</a></p>\n<p>It&#39;s potentially a lot faster than USB &amp; Firewire (SATA is currently 133MB&#39;s threshold, which is basically the max of a standard 32bit 33Mhz PCI bus anyway - disks do not write anywhere near that quickly mind you), and potentially a bit cheaper too.  I haven&#39;t done the digging there, so SATA prices, a controller &amp; enclosures might actually rule that out, but it is worth looking into.  Regardless, of nitpicking prices though it will definitely be cheaper &amp; faster than used DLT crapola, plus in all likelihood you might need to buy a USB2 or firewire controller anyway, so getting a SATA controller instead isn&#39;t like to be much extra work, though it might be less standard (maybe buy a combo firewire &amp; USB2 enclosure in case you need to bring it to a friend as well).</p>\n<p>As an aside, you might want to contemplate using something like MPEG4 or DivX instead of mpeg1/vcd - you get much higher quality than VCD&#39;s with about the same density of data.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085099&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cb0bd3971c5ee6e566588273eb89cdc1&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;nicole&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085099&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-03-29T15:30:24&quot;&gt;2004-03-29T15:30:24&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;so yeah i sorta was doing a search on how to record stuff from my tv to my apple powerbook. i have a dvd burner in it and stuff i just wanna know if its possible. i know what cord to get to hook up my powerbook so i can watch dvds on my tv. is that the same cord that i would use to record tv onto my powerbook? what kind of software do i need... so yeah, can this actually be done? whether i burn it on a dvd or just a cd... help! please!!&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
