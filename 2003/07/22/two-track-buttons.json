My touchpad (on a PC) has a tap-and-drag feature but I&#39;m pretty hit-and-miss on successfully performing the maneuver and have it disabled because I&#39;m always accidentally triggering it. Do Macs do tap-and-drag too?\n\nI guess Macs don&#39;t have a &quot;right-click drag&quot; maneuver as Windows does, so the tap could be the right button, but that would just freak me out.\n\nMy touchpad driver has a feature where it picks up a finger moving up and down the right edge and scrolls in response, which I think is much nicer than using a scrollwheel on a mouse. I keep doing it on my friend&#39;s iBook and wondering why it isn&#39;t working :)</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
