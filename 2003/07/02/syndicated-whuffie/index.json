Maybe you should just give a +1 to any item and/or feed that you click through in the aggregator to view in the parent website. this is much more likely to generate meaningful metadata than relying on human  rating. \nRe. Republishing feeds, I already republish RSS for the composite topics on Ecademy. eg \nWiFi weblogs = \nhttp://wifi.ecademy.com/module.php?mod=import&amp;op=rssbundle&amp;id=14\nInterestingly, I read the feed into a database cleaning it up in the process. The re-published feed is read out of the database so the items are not necessarily what went in.</div>\n\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086975\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5a70d939a73fa73603f2a9255ab81d21&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\"></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">BillSeitz</a>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#comment-221086975\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-03T11:34:30\">2003-07-03T11:34:30</time></a></p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"content\">I'm with Julian.

There are also a lot of possibilities for personal knowledge bases, which could also help in the filtering processes.\nre. republishing - yep, there's a lot more we can do here : read feed, *process*, republish\nre. P2P - I don't think there's even a mark on the surface yet...\n(of course I'm playing with all of these in IdeaGraph ;-)</div>\n\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086979\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.srijith.net/trinetre\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=71daea6c5696489ec1f7dd8efa55e2f2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\"></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.srijith.net/trinetre\">Srijith</a>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#comment-221086979\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-04T05:15:28\">2003-07-04T05:15:28</time></a></p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"content\">I too have been working on something similar. I call it Intelli-Aggie (name subject to change!). It is what I would call a \"content sensitive\" RSS aggregator. Instead of learning from your friends's recommendations etc, the system tries to learn from your reading habits, your preferences and interests etc.\nJust before I came across this entry, I had justed posted an example of the generated news pages. If you are interested, do take a look at \nhttp://www.srijith.net/trinetre/archives/2003/07/04/index.shtml#000290\nThe initial thoughts are scribbled at \nhttp://www.srijith.net/trinetre/archives/2003/05/12/index.shtml#000230</div>\n\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086981\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.newsmonster.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=10606a6d767b499af483bbaa390d7771&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\"></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.newsmonster.org\">Kevin Burton</a>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#comment-221086981\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-05T04:27:05\">2003-07-05T04:27:05</time></a></p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"content\">This is the primary goal of the NewsMonster project actually.  \nThe biggest problem right now is getting past Metcalfe's law.  All the code is done including the trust metric and the implicit/explicit certification data (ratings) but we don't have enough active users.\nWe are working on leveraging the full trust network via a more expansive transitive trust algoritm but it will be a week or so before I can get that code in and I want to ship 1.0 by monday.\nThe biggest problem right now is that the project has very lofty goals.  Most of our users are worried about more daily issue where I want to focus on the reputation components. \nIt is all good though.  It will happen soon enough.</div>\n\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n",

side effect of \"normal\" behaviour. Maybe you should just give a +1 to any item and/or feed that you click through in the aggregator to view in the parent website. this is much more likely to generate meaningful metadata than relying on human  rating. \r\n\r\nRe. Republishing feeds, I already republish RSS for the composite topics on Ecademy. eg \r\nWiFi weblogs = \r\nhttp://wifi.ecademy.com/module.php?mod=import&op=rssbundle&id=14\r\n\r\nInterestingly, I read the feed into a database cleaning it up in the process. The re-published feed is read out of the database so the items are not necessarily what went in.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086975\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5a70d939a73fa73603f2a9255ab81d21&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">BillSeitz</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086975\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-03T11:34:30\">2003-07-03T11:34:30</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I'm with Julian.

  "summary": "... there's excellent knowledge in blogs if only we had the tools to extract it. \n\n\n\nWhat sort of tools?  Relevance and reputation based feeds and\naggregators for one.  The problem of quickly finding what's good from\namong the great muck of the blogosphere is, if you ask me, a far more\nurgent problem than seeing the correct authorship or harmonizing\ndc:date and pubDate before I even read the thing.\n... facilitate P2P trading of RSS from desktop to desktop as well as\nserver to desktop -- you subscribe to 1000 feeds, aggregate them, rate\nthem (explicitly or by statistical filtering based on past use\npatterns) and then rebroadcast your new rated feed.  Aggregators could\nthen /use/ redundant items from feedback loops because each RSS source\nhas a reputation rating that weights the contained individual item\nranking; repeated items add their rankings.\n\n\n\nSource:TeledyN: Echos of RSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes.  This is it.  This is what I want to see come next from aggregators\nand blogs and syndication and all this mess.  It's what I've been tinkering\nwith in small steps for most of a year.  It's what I intend BookmarkBlogger\nto facilitate, as well as AmphetaOutlines and the homebrew aggregator I'm\nhacking around with right now.\nAt first thought, I'm not sure whether or not building and\nrepublishing RSS (or Echo) feeds is where it's at.  But, the more I think\nabout it, the more it seems perfectly elegant to me.  All the elements are\nthere, except for an extension to capture ratings.  Extend aggregators to\nconsume these rating-enriched feeds, and instead of just spooling the items\nup into your view, extract and assimilate the ratings into a growing\nmatrix of rater versus rated.  Apply all the various algorithms to\ncorrelate your rating history with that of others to whose ratings you\nsubscribe.  Mix in a little Bayes along with other machine learning.\nAs for the interface... well, that's a toughie.  At present, I think I could\nsneak ratings into my daily routine by monitoring my BookmarkBlogger use and\nwatching the disclosure triangle clicks and link visits in my AmphetaOutlines\nbased news aggregator.  I could easily see adding an iTunes-like 5-star\nrating interface, but unless I get some pretty significant payoff from\npainstakingly rating things, I'll never use it.  At least in iTunes, I get\nto have playlists of my faves automatically jumbled together, if I remember\nto use the ratings in the moment. \nThe cool thing will be when sites like\nTechnorati and Feedster start\nusing these ratings, but the even cooler thing is when all that's on\nmy desktop.  This could be easy, though, couldn't it?  What do we call\nit, Syndicated Whuffie?\n(Which reminds me:  Eventually, we really gotta get back to the subscription\nproblem.  All these agents polling files everywhere will get to be nasty.\nObviously.  This has been talked about already, but little has happened.\nWe need some ?PubSub, maybe some caches and concentrators.  All stuff that's\nbeen mentioned in passing before, and left by the wayside as unsexy.)",
