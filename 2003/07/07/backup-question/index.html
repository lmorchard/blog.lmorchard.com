<div class="content">My Win32 survival kit necessarily contains UnxUtils (a large cross-section of the GNU fileutils ported to run natively, available at <a href="http://unxutils.sf.net">http://unxutils.sf.net</a>) which means that you need only bother installing those tools which you&#39;ll actually use.
In this case, I&#39;d recommend tar and bzip2, and perhaps GPG on top. Sure, it might not be as pretty as Winzip, but it&#39;s a heck of a lot more scriptable and there won&#39;t be any nasty encryption incompatabilities (see <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/06/10/1542216.shtml?tid=185">http://slashdot.org/articles/03/06/10/1542216.shtml?tid=185</a> for some background about this). Don&#39;t forget that the command-line FTP client in Win32 is scriptable and that there are dozens of Windows cron implementations.

First of all, for Linux backups, let me Highly recommend Amanda for Linux backups. Scaling other technologies gets too difficult, but we have a several hundred server network that Amanda tackles without problem. In addition, Amanda software is now being ported to win32, giving you a way to backup directly to tape (or rather to a Amanda spool). Here is One Such Effort. I had a project a few years back moving encrypted bank transactions across a network. Here is how I implemented it: Two folders are needed: 
The Unencrypted directory that has all of the important stuff. (A) 
A encrypted directory that is automatically written to. (B) Only B should be shared, and no unencrypted data should be present. There is a slight mathematical risk to zipping and then encrypting files (since the header of the ZIP is a well known structure), but the purpose of this excercise is to keep noisy employees away, not be 100% mathematically secure. Your proccess then works as follows: 
Have your boss schedule a script that takes every file in A is zipped into a single file. (Winzip) 
Have your boss schedule a script that encrypts that zip. (Use GPGP, but remind your boss that he must keep the key secure. 
Have your boss schedule a script that moves only the encrypted file to B. 
Use NCFTP or SAMBA to automatically transfer B over to a backup server. (Use SMBFS or smclient if using samba). If he does not want to share it, transfer it using NCFTP. WinZip works great for automatically compressing things. I would not use it&#39;s encryption or password features tho. Use GPGP with a secure key to encrypt, or roll your own using .NET&#39;s awesome encryption support. (I recommend staying with GPGP).</div>

<div class="content">Curious?  Since the files are top secret, why not put the onus on your boss?  XP has a couple of built-in tools that will make the job easy.
First, provided NTFS is utilized, he can take advantage of XP&#39;s Encrypting File System.  This will allow him to encrypt and compress his &quot;important data&quot;.
Next, assuming he has access to a dir on the &quot;back-up&quot; server, he can use XP&#39;s Backup, to schedule the backup to run once, Weekly, monthly, at system start-up or logon.
Again, this puts him in-control of his own data, and should eliminate the need of &quot;touching&quot; his important files. Here are a couple of links for additional information.

<div class="content">If it&#39;s on an Active Directory enabled network the backup tools should be able to handle it.  The idea being with use of domain certificates it&#39;s possible to backup that which you cannot normally access.
The other quick and dirty solution is to just zip the files into a password protected archive.  Then put that archive on a folder that gets backed up.  Winzip&#39;s command-line features should make this trivial.  My XP box is out for service so I can&#39;t check and see what the XP native zip functions would offer here.  But zipped archives are probably the simplest way to approach this.  Write a vbscript, set it up as a scheduled job and let it do the grunt work of creating the archive, adding the files and then copying it to the approapriate backup location.</div>
