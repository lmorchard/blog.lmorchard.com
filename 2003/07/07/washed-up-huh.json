I have met Charles Goldfarb and found him to be a likeable and respectable old fart just as I think of Churchill as a great admirable old fart (I have fits whenever I imagine him as a young buck :-).  At 41, I have fears of being washed up, but I know that if I do, it will be me who decides when I am washed up.  Speaking of washed up, can we please wash this ugly episode out of our mind now?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
