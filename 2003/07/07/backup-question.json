Don&#39;t forget that the command-line FTP client in Win32 is scriptable and that there are dozens of Windows cron implementations.</p>\n<p>[trackback: <a href=\"http://24.102.209.201/weblogs/ben/internet/www/weblogs/posts/posted-elsewhere/DECAFBAD/WinXP-hidden-backup-solution.writeback]\">http://24.102.209.201/weblogs/ben/internet/www/weblogs/posts/posted-elsewhere/DECAFBAD/WinXP-hidden-backup-solution.writeback]</a></div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221089297&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://weblogs.asp.net/jprismon/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cdb8499967998aa056bc65bf1b415608&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://weblogs.asp.net/jprismon/&quot;&gt;Joshua Prismon&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221089297&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-07-07T16:22:28&quot;&gt;2003-07-07T16:22:28&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;(See URL for well formed post)\n</code></pre><p>First of all, for Linux backups, let me Highly recommend Amanda for Linux backups. Scaling other technologies gets too difficult, but we have a several hundred server network that Amanda tackles without problem. In addition, Amanda software is now being ported to win32, giving you a way to backup directly to tape (or rather to a Amanda spool). Here is One Such Effort. I had a project a few years back moving encrypted bank transactions across a network. Here is how I implemented it: Two folders are needed: \nThe Unencrypted directory that has all of the important stuff. (A) \nA encrypted directory that is automatically written to. (B) Only B should be shared, and no unencrypted data should be present. There is a slight mathematical risk to zipping and then encrypting files (since the header of the ZIP is a well known structure), but the purpose of this excercise is to keep noisy employees away, not be 100% mathematically secure. Your proccess then works as follows: \nHave your boss schedule a script that takes every file in A is zipped into a single file. (Winzip) \nHave your boss schedule a script that encrypts that zip. (Use GPGP, but remind your boss that he must keep the key secure. \nHave your boss schedule a script that moves only the encrypted file to B. \nUse NCFTP or SAMBA to automatically transfer B over to a backup server. (Use SMBFS or smclient if using samba). If he does not want to share it, transfer it using NCFTP. WinZip works great for automatically compressing things. I would not use it&#39;s encryption or password features tho. Use GPGP with a secure key to encrypt, or roll your own using .NET&#39;s awesome encryption support. (I recommend staying with GPGP).</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221089301&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://weblogs.asp.net/jprismon/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cdb8499967998aa056bc65bf1b415608&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://weblogs.asp.net/jprismon/&quot;&gt;Joshua Prismon&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221089301&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-07-07T16:22:43&quot;&gt;2003-07-07T16:22:43&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;(See URL for well formed post)\n</code></pre><p>First of all, for Linux backups, let me Highly recommend Amanda for Linux backups.

Since the files are top secret, why not put the onus on your boss?  XP has a couple of built-in tools that will make the job easy.\n</code></pre><p>First, provided NTFS is utilized, he can take advantage of XP&#39;s Encrypting File System.  This will allow him to encrypt and compress his &quot;important data&quot;.</p>\n<p>Next, assuming he has access to a dir on the &quot;back-up&quot; server, he can use XP&#39;s Backup, to schedule the backup to run once, Weekly, monthly, at system start-up or logon.</p>\n<p>Again, this puts him in-control of his own data, and should eliminate the need of &quot;touching&quot; his important files. Here are a couple of links for additional information.</p>\n<p>Encrypting Sile System\nXP&#39;s Backup</p>\n<p>I hope this helps.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221089306&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7a3895376100fa2a20cabab927bf35b&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221089306&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-07-08T08:54:42&quot;&gt;2003-07-08T08:54:42&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;He should just give you access to the contents: if you can&#39;t trust your sysadmin, you can&#39;t trust anyone.

The idea being with use of domain certificates it&#39;s possible to backup that which you cannot normally access.\n</code></pre><p>The other quick and dirty solution is to just zip the files into a password protected archive.  Then put that archive on a folder that gets backed up.  Winzip&#39;s command-line features should make this trivial.  My XP box is out for service so I can&#39;t check and see what the XP native zip functions would offer here.  But zipped archives are probably the simplest way to approach this.  Write a vbscript, set it up as a scheduled job and let it do the grunt work of creating the archive, adding the files and then copying it to the approapriate backup location.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221089311&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://fiftyfly.mine.nu&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=43f54f4e781c8374414d45c287474cac&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://fiftyfly.mine.nu&quot;&gt;mike&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221089311&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-07-08T14:54:26&quot;&gt;2003-07-08T14:54:26&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;I would highly sugest not relying on ntfs&#39; encryption : http://www.annoyances.org/exec/forum/winxp/t1037834762 .
