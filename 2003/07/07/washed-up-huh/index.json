Dave (or rather, Mr Safe) says that Tim Bray\nsaid something nasty about him here.  In fact, Dave says that Tim said\nhe's all washed up, like Charles Goldfarb.\n<br /><br />\nBut as I read it, I'd love to be washed up like Charles Goldfarb,\nseeing as he's \"currently making a well-deserved killing bringing out\n... books for Prentice-Hall\", having \"climbed on board the XML bandwagon\nabout fifteen seconds after it got rolling and was a major help\nin getting the thing finished and delivered\".  Sounds like Mr. Goldfarb\nis still very active in his community, still considered an authority,\nand is being rewarded for it.  I hope I'm that kind of washed up someday.\n<br /><br />\nIn fact, it'd be pretty keen if that's what people meant if someday\nthey said, \"Les is Dead\", though I can't find where Tim said that.\n<br /><br />\nSo, where's the nastiness?  It's not like Tim took notes from\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/19/teach_me_spanish_curse_words.html\" target=\"_top\">Mark's spanish lessons</a>\nand told Dave to go \"chinga tu madre\" or \"come verga\".  That's nasty.\nFar as I can tell, Tim compared Dave to a guy in another community\nwho has his own contingent of haters yet is still undeniably a brilliant\nguy just trying to Do The Right Thing as he sees it.\n<br /><br />\nWas the nastiness in saying that some people can't \"maintain a good\nworking relationship with Dave\"?  Or that Tim gets \"regularly ...\npissed-off at Dave\"?  I mean, they're both obviously true.  It would\nhave been nasty and untrue had Tim said that <strong>no one</strong> can maintain a\ngood relationship with Dave, because there are also obviously a lot of\npeople who do.  But, Tim didn't say that.\n<br /><br />\nSo, as far as I see, I'd personally be happy to have Tim Bray write\nabout me like this in public.\n<!--more-->\nshortname=washed_up_huh\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085556\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=dc59c5ba9a8aa0a6225d9959eea3b7f3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Dave Winer</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085556\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T12:23:31\">2003-07-07T12:23:31</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Les, here's the clue: I'm not you.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085557\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=468c6b5110ed4bea9c148cf736744c43&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jim</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085557\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T14:50:09\">2003-07-07T14:50:09</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Give up on trying to find reason in Dave's little outbursts.

At 41, I have fears of being washed up, but I know that if I do, it will be me who decides when I am washed up.

I have met Charles Goldfarb and found him to be a likeable and respectable old fart just as I think of Churchill as a great admirable old fart (I have fits whenever I imagine him as a young buck :-).  At 41, I have fears of being washed up, but I know that if I do, it will be me who decides when I am washed up.  Speaking of washed up, can we please wash this ugly episode out of our mind now?</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

However, just looking around, I observe that\nthere are many people and organizations who seem unable to maintain a\ngood working relationship with Dave.\n<br><br>\nI regularly get pissed-off at Dave but I really truly do think he&apos;s\ntrying to Do The Right Thing; but there are many people out there who\ncan&apos;t get past being pissed off. This is what life is like.\n<br><br>\nThere&apos;s an uncannny echo here, for me.  The thing that came before XML\nwas called SGML. SGML was largely invented, and its landscape\ndominated, by a burly, bearded, brilliant New Yorker, Charles\nGoldfarb, who is currently making a well-deserved killing bringing out\nthe Definitive XML Series of books for Prentice-Hall.  Charles is\nloquacious, persistent, smart, loud-voiced, and nearly always gets his\nway.\n<br><br>\nThere were a lot of people out there (still are, I guess) whom Charles\ndrives completely nuts and just won&apos;t work with him. Which is one of\nthe reasons that, when we invented XML, we felt the need to give it a\nnew name and a new acronym and so on. Mind you, Charles, who as I said\nis no dummy, climbed on board the XML bandwagon about fifteen seconds\nafter it got rolling and was a major help in getting the thing\nfinished and delivered.\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/23/SamsPie#davewiner\">ongoing: I Like Pie</a></cite></small></div>\n<br><br>\nI&apos;m very confused about this.  Dave (or rather, Mr Safe) says that Tim Bray\nsaid something nasty about him here.  In fact, Dave says that Tim said\nhe&apos;s all washed up, like Charles Goldfarb.\n<br><br>\nBut as I read it, I&apos;d love to be washed up like Charles Goldfarb,\nseeing as he&apos;s &quot;currently making a well-deserved killing bringing out\n... books for Prentice-Hall&quot;, having &quot;climbed on board the XML bandwagon\nabout fifteen seconds after it got rolling and was a major help\nin getting the thing finished and delivered&quot;.  Sounds like Mr. Goldfarb\nis still very active in his community, still considered an authority,\nand is being rewarded for it.  I hope I&apos;m that kind of washed up someday.\n<br><br>\nIn fact, it&apos;d be pretty keen if that&apos;s what people meant if someday\nthey said, &quot;Les is Dead&quot;, though I can&apos;t find where Tim said that.\n<br><br>\nSo, where&apos;s the nastiness?  It&apos;s not like Tim took notes from\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/19/teach_me_spanish_curse_words.html\" target=\"_top\">Mark&apos;s spanish lessons</a>\nand told Dave to go &quot;chinga tu madre&quot; or &quot;come verga&quot;.  That&apos;s nasty.\nFar as I can tell, Tim compared Dave to a guy in another community\nwho has his own contingent of haters yet is still undeniably a brilliant\nguy just trying to Do The Right Thing as he sees it.\n<br><br>\nWas the nastiness in saying that some people can&apos;t &quot;maintain a good\nworking relationship with Dave&quot;?  Or that Tim gets &quot;regularly ...\npissed-off at Dave&quot;?  I mean, they&apos;re both obviously true.  It would\nhave been nasty and untrue had Tim said that <strong>no one</strong> can maintain a\ngood relationship with Dave, because there are also obviously a lot of\npeople who do.  But, Tim didn&apos;t say that.\n<br><br>\nSo, as far as I see, I&apos;d personally be happy to have Tim Bray write\nabout me like this in public.\n"
