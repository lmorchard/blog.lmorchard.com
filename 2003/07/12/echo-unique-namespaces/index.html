<div class="content">I added namespace support to Emacs&#39; xml.el recently.  It wasn&#39;t difficult at all.  Instead of parsing [feed xmlns:e=&quot;uri&quot;]...[/feed], into &#39;(feed ...), I parsed it into &#39;({uri}feed ...).  Namespace processing doesn&#39;t happen without a switch set to enable it, so it is completely backwards compatible.
So, while I haven&#39;t looked at how Radio parses stuff either, I think it wouldn&#39;t be that hard to add.  And it doesn&#39;t have to be ugly, either.</div>
