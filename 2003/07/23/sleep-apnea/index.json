My dad is known for falling asleep constantly: in the midst of conversation, while eating, while getting his haircut, while using a computer.  And lately, those have all been things that I&#39;ve begun to &quot;enjoy&quot;.  Especially bad has been my tendency to fall asleep at work, and especially dangerous has been me falling asleep whenever I have to drive for more than 10 minutes.<br /><br />This condition seems to have come upon me so gradually that it&#39;s only been recently, with the scare of losing my <i>new</i> job, and <span class='ljuser' style='white-space:nowrap;'><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=missadroit'><img src='http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif' alt='userinfo' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align:bottom;border:0;' /></a><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/users/missadroit/'><b>missadroit</b></a></span>&#39;s persistent persuasion, that I finally ackowledged the problem and sought treatment.

But, it could make for a unique Halloween outfit.\r\n\r\nThe facemasks come in standard thin rubber face piece and Deluxe thick rubber gel-like face pieces. The gel-like ones are much more comfortable, and come in clear pale gold, or clear pale blue.\r\n\r\nI even take it with me traveling. Now if they could develop a portable battery operated lightweight for when I go camping.\r\nCurtis</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084029\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=53617e52a0ccf29f19c750e312df0f31&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">steve</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084029\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-02-17T02:12:14\">2004-02-17T02:12:14</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">hi.  i've gone through the process and ended up with the same machine.\r\n\r\nit gathers data with and without the smart card.\r\n\r\nanyone know how to pull the data out of the machine?</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

  "summary": "<p>For a change, I feel awake today.<br><br>It&apos;s ironic that much of my writing in journals and much of my thought goes toward the topic of consciousness and thought itself.  I&apos;ve been studying and contemplating issues of cognition, awareness, and self for as long as I can remember.  I&apos;ve wolfed down self-help books and pop-psych in high school, went on to get a minor degree in psychology proper in college.  <br><br>I don&apos;t use drugs to tinker with my consciousness (other than caffeine, that is), but I&apos;ve tried various more controlled forms of meditation, visualization, and introspection.  I flirted with Dianetics &amp; Scientology (but ran far, far away), employed <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671700758/0xdecafbad-20\">psycho-cybernetics</a>, got motivated by <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671791540/0xdecafbad-20\">Anthony Robbins</a>, twisted my inner eye around to see itself with the help of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465026567/0xdecafbad-20\">Douglas R. Hofstadter</a>, studied concept-formation and knowledge ala <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452010306/0xdecafbad-20\">Ayn Rand</a>, considered the multiplicity of self with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671657135/0xdecafbad-20\">Marvin Minsky</a>, and explored dreams and archetypes with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0440351839/0xdecafbad-20\">C. G. Jung</a>.  With the help of each influence, I&apos;ve been stitching together a rough manual to my mind.  Just like I&apos;ve hacked around with computing devices, I&apos;ve worked to understand and tweak my own mentality.  <br><br>Oh, but I probably need to explain the irony: For the past few months-- likely the past few years-- I&apos;ve been suffering from <a href=\"http://www.sleepapnea.org/geninfo.html#defined\">sleep apnea</a>.  LIke my father, and his father before him, I&apos;ve developed a horrible snore and have started fighting a losing struggle with sleepiness.  My dad is known for falling asleep constantly: in the midst of conversation, while eating, while getting his haircut, while using a computer.  And lately, those have all been things that I&apos;ve begun to &quot;enjoy&quot;.  Especially bad has been my tendency to fall asleep at work, and especially dangerous has been me falling asleep whenever I have to drive for more than 10 minutes.<br><br>This condition seems to have come upon me so gradually that it&apos;s only been recently, with the scare of losing my <i>new</i> job, and <span class=\"ljuser\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=missadroit\"><img src=\"http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif\" alt=\"userinfo\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom;border:0;\"></a><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/missadroit/\"><b>missadroit</b></a></span>&apos;s persistent persuasion, that I finally ackowledged the problem and sought treatment.  So, I managed to get an appointment at the <a href=\"http://www.med.umich.edu/neuro/sleep.htm\">University of Michigan Sleep Disorders Clinic</a>, where one evening at the beginning of the month I was covered with wires and sent to bed.  About a week later, they called me back to inform me that I had very severe sleep apnea, and was barely getting any sleep at all in a night with about 2-3 breathless episodes per hour.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/features_pro.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/images/exploded_humid.gif\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a>Within a few days of <i>that</i> news-- yesterday, in fact-- I was given a new toy: The <a href=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/features_pro.htm\">REMstar Pro CPAP System</a>.  After one night with the thing, my snoring is gone except for the occasional snort as I become accustomed to a breathing mask, and I feel quite a bit more rested than I have in recent memory.  I still feel a bit tired, but that&apos;s to be expected: I&apos;ve got many nights to catch up for.<br><br>I&apos;d gone from being able to track <a href=\"http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html\">&quot;seven, plus or minus two&quot;</a> things at once down to barely one thing at a time, and that was if I didn&apos;t doze off in the middle of the task and have to rebuild the thought process when I snapped back awake.  The irony of it all is similar to something I was reminded of last week: <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/1058457401.html\">As it turns out, software needs hardware to run.</a>  So, for all my introspective experimentation on myself, and all my attention to consciousness, I&apos;ve been feeling it slipping away from me lately.  As a &quot;software&quot; guy, I can&apos;t do much with my &quot;hardware&quot;.  <br><br>So, I&apos;m very happy that I finally-- after much denial and procrastination by me, and after much encouragement and tolerance by <span class=\"ljuser\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=missadroit\"><img src=\"http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif\" alt=\"userinfo\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom;border:0;\"></a><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/missadroit/\"><b>missadroit</b></a></span>-- called and started the process that ended up with me sleeping through the night again.<br><br>And now maybe I can close my eyes and meditate without losing consciousness again.<br><br>Now maybe I can be myself again.<br><br>(P.S.:  Thank you, <span class=\"ljuser\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=missadroit\"><img src=\"http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif\" alt=\"userinfo\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom;border:0;\"></a><a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/missadroit/\"><b>missadroit</b></a></span>.  I love you and don&apos;t know what I&apos;d do without you.)</p>\n"
