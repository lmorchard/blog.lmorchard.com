I wish I would&#39;ve checked your GeoURL metadata earlier. We could&#39;ve gotten together while I was there.

I knew I slept very restlessly, and my last female partner had told me I snore.</p>\n<p>You don&#39;t really know yourself that you snore, because your asleep, and when you wake up you&#39;re not snoring.</p>\n<p>Well, they found I wake up, many times very subtley, more than I even knew, and that I was rarely going into REM sleep. So they prescribed a CPAP.</p>\n<p>WOW, what a difference it made, I immediately started sleeping better. The sleep lab told me it would take sometime of proper sleep to repair my subtle sleep deprivation.</p>\n<p>One side benefit, the air filters allow me to breathe much cleaner air for 6 - 10 hour a night, and do I ever see the soot they filter out of the NYC air I breathe !!  Also, the white noise effect helps drown out NYC street noise a wee bit, earplugs do a better job.</p>\n<p>It is Very Strange sleeping with a facemask covering your nose, and headgear to keep it in place, but it is worth the strange way you look. Besides, no one except someone who likes, or loves you, gets to see you in that thing. It is a bit of a shock to a partner when you first go to use this thing. But, it could make for a unique Halloween outfit.</p>\n<p>The facemasks come in standard thin rubber face piece and Deluxe thick rubber gel-like face pieces. The gel-like ones are much more comfortable, and come in clear pale gold, or clear pale blue.</p>\n<p>I even take it with me traveling. Now if they could develop a portable battery operated lightweight for when I go camping.\nCurtis</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221084029&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=53617e52a0ccf29f19c750e312df0f31&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;steve&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221084029&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-02-17T02:12:14&quot;&gt;2004-02-17T02:12:14&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;hi.  i&#39;ve gone through the process and ended up with the same machine.\n</code></pre><p>it gathers data with and without the smart card.</p>\n<p>anyone know how to pull the data out of the machine?</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
