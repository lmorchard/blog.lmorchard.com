I sat down in front of the computer, and sure enough, it didn&#39;t connect to the internet (or whatever).\n&quot;It just started doing that...&quot; he said.\n&quot;What did you change?&quot; was my first question.\n&quot;Nothing.&quot;\n&quot;What did you change?&quot;\n&quot;Nothing.&quot;\n&quot;What did you change?&quot;\n&quot;Nothing.&quot;\n&quot;What did you change?&quot;\n&quot;Well, I might have changed something, but it shouldn&#39;t make any difference.&quot;\n&quot;What did you change?&quot;\n&quot;It was a network setting, but I changed it right back.&quot;\n(I open up the network settings.)\n&quot;Which one did you change?&quot;\n&quot;That one.&quot;\n&quot;What did it used to be set to?&quot;\n&quot;This.&quot;\n(I change it back to what it used to be, and try the test again.  It all works just fine.)\n&quot;Wow!  How did you do that?&quot;, he asks excitedly.\nMy deadpan reply: &quot;I&#39;m psychic.&quot;</p>\n<p>What amuses me the most about this story is that when I tell it to people the universal reaction is &quot;You mean I can just keep asking, and eventually they&#39;ll tell me what they did?!?&quot;</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221084323&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.media-portal.com/muraii&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a6ea4923cd8d4c049a63ac982a2701a2&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.media-portal.com/muraii&quot;&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221084323&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-07-18T16:57:33&quot;&gt;2003-07-18T16:57:33&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Nothing is so adorable as when your four-year-old daughter comes, ever so slowly, demurely, down the stairs to tell you that, &quot;It isn&#39;t working.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221084324&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://eo.dyndns.info/mt-meblog/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bb4029863e0ba8911ec718d8d6a3b705&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://eo.dyndns.info/mt-meblog/&quot;&gt;MichaelE&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221084324&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-07-19T20:48:37&quot;&gt;2003-07-19T20:48:37&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Hmmm... &#39;cluebat&#39; where do I get one?
