<div class="content">this occurs to me on an almost daily basis.  then again i pick up tech support calls between admining stuff for a smallish indie isp so one would expect it to happen.  most times &quot;it doesn&#39;t work&quot; is the only explanation i can work out of someone in a half hour call.  <em>shrug</em> comes with the territory.</div>

<div class="content">This reminds me of a story I like to tell...
I was visiting my father a while ago, and sometime during the conversation, he mentioned that something broke on his computer, and could I take a look at it.  I sat down in front of the computer, and sure enough, it didn&#39;t connect to the internet (or whatever).
&quot;It just started doing that...&quot; he said.
&quot;What did you change?&quot; was my first question.
&quot;Nothing.&quot;
&quot;What did you change?&quot;
&quot;Nothing.&quot;
&quot;What did you change?&quot;
&quot;Nothing.&quot;
&quot;What did you change?&quot;
&quot;Well, I might have changed something, but it shouldn&#39;t make any difference.&quot;
&quot;What did you change?&quot;
&quot;It was a network setting, but I changed it right back.&quot;
(I open up the network settings.)
&quot;Which one did you change?&quot;
&quot;That one.&quot;
&quot;What did it used to be set to?&quot;
&quot;This.&quot;
(I change it back to what it used to be, and try the test again.  It all works just fine.)
&quot;Wow!  How did you do that?&quot;, he asks excitedly.
My deadpan reply: &quot;I&#39;m psychic.&quot;
What amuses me the most about this story is that when I tell it to people the universal reaction is &quot;You mean I can just keep asking, and eventually they&#39;ll tell me what they did?!?&quot;</div>
