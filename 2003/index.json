    "html": "<p>\nI've just read Mark Pilgrim's post, \"<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/12/04/infinite-hotel\">The infinite hotel</a>\", which I'm sure I'll need to re-read a few times and chase down references to read.  Also I'm reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465026567/qid=1070644457/0xdecafbad-20\">G&#246;del, Escher, Bach</a> again for the third time, since I first read it in high school and needed corks in my ears to prevent brain slurry from spilling out.  I really need to read more of this sort of thing, refresh myself on all the math I took in college, and explore some of this really abstract stuff.\n</p>\n<p>\nSomething I've been musing about lately, without any real novel ideas or insights, is about the history of computation and these thinking machines.  Not history in terms of events and when, but in terms of the concepts and discoveries leading up to keyboards, screens, and code today.  Thinking about things like recursion, and sets, and logic, and all the patterns and revolutions in thought that are the basis for everyday business and life today.\n</p>\n<p>\nI've been trying to imagine the world in each moment where each of these things were new, when these things were worked out in minds and on paper.  When there were no computational engines available to carry out calculations or work out conclusions to logical constructions.  \nToday, these discoveries are crystallized in computing architectures, and so geeks hack and play and learn by example.  The construction of the CPU is objective fact, independent of subjective thought or understanding, and the behavior of code demonstrates the laws and rules.  Before, the rules were carefully reasoned out and intuited from observations on the objective universe, but now they're assimilated by example from mechanically working artifacts.\n</p>\n<p>\nI'm not sure I'm expressing this very well, or if my thoughts are very well formed altogether, but I'm trying to imagine mental life without readily available, objectively existing computational artifacts with which we can play, without prohibitive investments of effort or time.  No scripting languages with which to just try out logical constructions.  No calculators with which to solve formulae.  All manual, all by hand, all worked out by careful thought and precision.  I'm trying to imagine what geeks like me, as I am today, would be like at a time when everyone dealing in these things was an abstraction astronaut, and there was not really a such thing as that-which-just-works or worse-is-better.  Does this make any sense?\n</p>\n<p>\nAgain, this is not really an expression of anything coherent or novel.  This is mostly me just in awe of how we got here, and trying to get myself above the mode of being just a hacker chasing down the phylogeny of all that's come before, and into some meta-mode of understanding of the things behind what makes these thinking machines and the thinking itself work.  Maybe after a few more decades of this I'll have some thoughts worth sharing synthesized from all that I've learned.\n</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=hacking_infinite_and_cognition\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082777\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.dme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ba95ba57f948f9de1d4a101bb84cca3a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.dme.org\">David Edmondson</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082777\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-12-05T12:51:36\">2003-12-05T12:51:36</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Is this really just a trailer for Neal Stephenson books?  :-)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082779\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082779\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-12-05T13:15:13\">2003-12-05T13:15:13</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Heh, no, but it occurred to me shortly after writing this that I really need to get Quicksilver :)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082780\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/missadroit\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3bdecc906ce5c5e8d2865e022bcd8e5e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/missadroit\">Miss A</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082780\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-12-05T14:17:54\">2003-12-05T14:17:54</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Found this today: Cogprints.

    "summary": "<p>\nI&apos;ve just read Mark Pilgrim&apos;s post, &quot;<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/12/04/infinite-hotel\">The infinite hotel</a>&quot;, which I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll need to re-read a few times and chase down references to read.  Also I&apos;m reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465026567/qid=1070644457/0xdecafbad-20\">G&#xF6;del, Escher, Bach</a> again for the third time, since I first read it in high school and needed corks in my ears to prevent brain slurry from spilling out.  I really need to read more of this sort of thing, refresh myself on all the math I took in college, and explore some of this really abstract stuff.\n</p>\n<p>\nSomething I&apos;ve been musing about lately, without any real novel ideas or insights, is about the history of computation and these thinking machines.  Not history in terms of events and when, but in terms of the concepts and discoveries leading up to keyboards, screens, and code today.  Thinking about things like recursion, and sets, and logic, and all the patterns and revolutions in thought that are the basis for everyday business and life today.\n</p>\n<p>\nI&apos;ve been trying to imagine the world in each moment where each of these things were new, when these things were worked out in minds and on paper.  When there were no computational engines available to carry out calculations or work out conclusions to logical constructions.  \nToday, these discoveries are crystallized in computing architectures, and so geeks hack and play and learn by example.  The construction of the CPU is objective fact, independent of subjective thought or understanding, and the behavior of code demonstrates the laws and rules.  Before, the rules were carefully reasoned out and intuited from observations on the objective universe, but now they&apos;re assimilated by example from mechanically working artifacts.\n</p>\n<p>\nI&apos;m not sure I&apos;m expressing this very well, or if my thoughts are very well formed altogether, but I&apos;m trying to imagine mental life without readily available, objectively existing computational artifacts with which we can play, without prohibitive investments of effort or time.  No scripting languages with which to just try out logical constructions.  No calculators with which to solve formulae.  All manual, all by hand, all worked out by careful thought and precision.  I&apos;m trying to imagine what geeks like me, as I am today, would be like at a time when everyone dealing in these things was an abstraction astronaut, and there was not really a such thing as that-which-just-works or worse-is-better.  Does this make any sense?\n</p>\n<p>\nAgain, this is not really an expression of anything coherent or novel.  This is mostly me just in awe of how we got here, and trying to get myself above the mode of being just a hacker chasing down the phylogeny of all that&apos;s come before, and into some meta-mode of understanding of the things behind what makes these thinking machines and the thinking itself work.  Maybe after a few more decades of this I&apos;ll have some thoughts worth sharing synthesized from all that I&apos;ve learned.\n</p>\n",

    "html": "<p>I haven&#8217;t had much time to tinker in the past week or two, but I have still been thinking about recipes and blogs.  I&#8217;ve also been trading emails with <a href=\"http://www.troyandgay.com/\">Troy Hakala</a>, who&#8217;s one of the food &#38; techie geeks responsible for <a href=\"http://www.recipezaar.com/about/people.zsp\">RecipeZaar</a> and who also has had a hand in the aforementioned <a href=\"http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml/\">RecipeML</a> spec -- clearly, this is someone who knows what&#8217;s what with recipes online.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recipezaar.com&quot;&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; site is very rich in functionality, allowing you to refine searches by various types of information in recipes such as ingredient, course, dietary needs, preparation, and occasion.  The recipes themselves are shown with calculated nutritional information, and discussion and ratings are offered as well.  But, what looks like one of the best features of the site is the recipe submission process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With all the various ways recipes are organized and indexed on this site, I would expect that entering a new recipe would demand some tedious form field entry to get the information into the database.  And, while there is a tiny bit of that toward the end, with regard to categorization and cooking time, the entry of ingredients and cooking steps is done by pasting them in whole into two text areas.  It seems similar to some job listing sites which manage to parse &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASCII&lt;/span&gt; dumps of applicants&amp;#8217; resumes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#8217;d guess, a parser -- which I&amp;#8217;ve been told has been in constant refinement since the site started -- churns through the text of the ingredient list and separates things into their parts.  And these parts include things like amounts and units, and ingredients which are themselves linked to nutritional and descriptive data.  It&amp;#8217;s all cross-referenced and classified in a way that makes the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt; fan in me cheer -- although this ain&amp;#8217;t &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt; or the Semantic Web.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what if it could be?  Or, at the least, what if recipes could join the list of content types available to be published by bloggers.  If not in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt;, then say maybe in some further developed form of RecipeML?  I see recipes in my aggregator from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.10500bc.org/archive/006335.php#006335&quot;&gt;a weblog like this&lt;/a&gt; and I wonder what things could be done with data like this if it were in some structured and machine-readable form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, for one thing, bloggers could ping &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recipezaar.com&quot;&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; when they post new recipes, and that site could become the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedster.com&quot;&gt;Feedster&lt;/a&gt; of recipes.  Bloggers could also provide &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; indexes of their recipe postings, possibly for use by future aggregators -- although, I think some major work needs to be done on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/dynamic_polling_freq_too.html&quot;&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/21/atom_aggregator_behavior_http_level&quot;&gt;aggregators&lt;/a&gt; before we go too far down that road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what would probably be a great start is to come up with some MovableType plugin which helps support recipe post authoring.  Ideally, this would produce both &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and RecipeML (or better) content, for both human and machine consumption.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But,  there&amp;#8217;s that filling-out-of-forms issue again.  I just read &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/11/18.html#a2022&quot;&gt;a post by Marc Canter&lt;/a&gt; talking about the growing formats for reviews, where he asks why there aren&amp;#8217;t more fields to fill out for a properly constructed post.  He acknowledges that end-users might not want to fill those out, but we need that data to be potentially available -- but my take on it is that end-users won&amp;#8217;t &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt; want to fill out any fields that they don&amp;#8217;t have to.  And, if there are too many fields that they &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; have to fill out, they&amp;#8217;ll never do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll never get people posting reviews or recipes or anything beyond blog entries without dead simple tools to do it.  Because, of course, your average person sharing recipes has absolutely zero interest in authoring &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt;.  It&amp;#8217;s the techies and machines that want to see things authored in these strange formats, so the motivation to see rich, structured data is on the wrong side of the fence to encourage its production.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recipezaar.com&quot;&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; uses a parser in its recipe submission forms to ease the process as much as possible.  And, it&amp;#8217;s been successful, since they can point to over 70,000 recipes submitted to their site by users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One solution for this, if the people behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recipezaar.com&quot;&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; like the idea, is to borrow their parser via web service for use in my hypothetical MovableType plugin.  This could also be used for any number of other blogging tools.  On the upside, we get the benefit of all the work done by Troy and company, and they get to pull in more recipes.  On the downside, we&amp;#8217;re dependant on a web service not under our control for the basic functionality of this plugin.  Maybe not such a bad option, practically speaking, since its a great site run by great people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, just sharing some thoughts here.  I&amp;#8217;m excited to see more varieties of micro-content shared between the people of the web, but the thing I see least talked about is how this stuff will be authored.  I read about data formats and all that, but in terms of user interface, we haven&amp;#8217;t progressed much past the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; textarea.  Also, I often see handwaving and assumptions that the content is really pretty simple -- but as Troy Hakala would tell you, not even something as &amp;#8220;simple&amp;#8221; as a recipe is a slam dunk in terms of digestion by a machine.  There needs to be some happy medium between a natural human expression of information, and the rigorous structuring required by a machine, mediated by good user interface.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=recipe_web_3</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090410\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=941b31363609ee1e6144ee4ef937a290&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">blaine</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090410\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-27T04:15:17\">2004-04-27T04:15:17</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">This makes sense; I've also been wanting to do something like this for some time, but alas, it's waaaaay down on my list of priorities.\nHowever, I think it would be best if RecipeZaar just opened up their parser; I really, really hate having to rely on web services for basic tasks.

    "summary": "<p>I haven&#x2019;t had much time to tinker in the past week or two, but I have still been thinking about recipes and blogs.  I&#x2019;ve also been trading emails with <a href=\"http://www.troyandgay.com/\">Troy Hakala</a>, who&#x2019;s one of the food &amp; techie geeks responsible for <a href=\"http://www.recipezaar.com/about/people.zsp\">RecipeZaar</a> and who also has had a hand in the aforementioned <a href=\"http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml/\">RecipeML</a> spec -- clearly, this is someone who knows what&#x2019;s what with recipes online.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recipezaar.com&quot;&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; site is very rich in functionality, allowing you to refine searches by various types of information in recipes such as ingredient, course, dietary needs, preparation, and occasion.  The recipes themselves are shown with calculated nutritional information, and discussion and ratings are offered as well.  But, what looks like one of the best features of the site is the recipe submission process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With all the various ways recipes are organized and indexed on this site, I would expect that entering a new recipe would demand some tedious form field entry to get the information into the database.  And, while there is a tiny bit of that toward the end, with regard to categorization and cooking time, the entry of ingredients and cooking steps is done by pasting them in whole into two text areas.  It seems similar to some job listing sites which manage to parse &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASCII&lt;/span&gt; dumps of applicants&amp;#8217; resumes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#8217;d guess, a parser -- which I&amp;#8217;ve been told has been in constant refinement since the site started -- churns through the text of the ingredient list and separates things into their parts.  And these parts include things like amounts and units, and ingredients which are themselves linked to nutritional and descriptive data.  It&amp;#8217;s all cross-referenced and classified in a way that makes the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt; fan in me cheer -- although this ain&amp;#8217;t &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt; or the Semantic Web.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what if it could be?  Or, at the least, what if recipes could join the list of content types available to be published by bloggers.  If not in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt;, then say maybe in some further developed form of RecipeML?  I see recipes in my aggregator from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.10500bc.org/archive/006335.php#006335&quot;&gt;a weblog like this&lt;/a&gt; and I wonder what things could be done with data like this if it were in some structured and machine-readable form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, for one thing, bloggers could ping &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recipezaar.com&quot;&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; when they post new recipes, and that site could become the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedster.com&quot;&gt;Feedster&lt;/a&gt; of recipes.  Bloggers could also provide &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; indexes of their recipe postings, possibly for use by future aggregators -- although, I think some major work needs to be done on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/dynamic_polling_freq_too.html&quot;&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/21/atom_aggregator_behavior_http_level&quot;&gt;aggregators&lt;/a&gt; before we go too far down that road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what would probably be a great start is to come up with some MovableType plugin which helps support recipe post authoring.  Ideally, this would produce both &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and RecipeML (or better) content, for both human and machine consumption.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But,  there&amp;#8217;s that filling-out-of-forms issue again.  I just read &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/11/18.html#a2022&quot;&gt;a post by Marc Canter&lt;/a&gt; talking about the growing formats for reviews, where he asks why there aren&amp;#8217;t more fields to fill out for a properly constructed post.  He acknowledges that end-users might not want to fill those out, but we need that data to be potentially available -- but my take on it is that end-users won&amp;#8217;t &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt; want to fill out any fields that they don&amp;#8217;t have to.  And, if there are too many fields that they &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; have to fill out, they&amp;#8217;ll never do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll never get people posting reviews or recipes or anything beyond blog entries without dead simple tools to do it.  Because, of course, your average person sharing recipes has absolutely zero interest in authoring &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt;.  It&amp;#8217;s the techies and machines that want to see things authored in these strange formats, so the motivation to see rich, structured data is on the wrong side of the fence to encourage its production.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recipezaar.com&quot;&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; uses a parser in its recipe submission forms to ease the process as much as possible.  And, it&amp;#8217;s been successful, since they can point to over 70,000 recipes submitted to their site by users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One solution for this, if the people behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recipezaar.com&quot;&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; like the idea, is to borrow their parser via web service for use in my hypothetical MovableType plugin.  This could also be used for any number of other blogging tools.  On the upside, we get the benefit of all the work done by Troy and company, and they get to pull in more recipes.  On the downside, we&amp;#8217;re dependant on a web service not under our control for the basic functionality of this plugin.  Maybe not such a bad option, practically speaking, since its a great site run by great people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, just sharing some thoughts here.  I&amp;#8217;m excited to see more varieties of micro-content shared between the people of the web, but the thing I see least talked about is how this stuff will be authored.  I read about data formats and all that, but in terms of user interface, we haven&amp;#8217;t progressed much past the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; textarea.  Also, I often see handwaving and assumptions that the content is really pretty simple -- but as Troy Hakala would tell you, not even something as &amp;#8220;simple&amp;#8221; as a recipe is a slam dunk in terms of digestion by a machine.  There needs to be some happy medium between a natural human expression of information, and the rigorous structuring required by a machine, mediated by good user interface.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n",

Actually, I've been thinking about them for a couple of years now, since I'd really like to start cooking some decent meals with the web's help.  Oh yeah, and I'm a geek, so tinkering with some data would be fun too.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne thing I rarely notice mentioned when ideas like this come up is pre-existing work.  Like <a href=\"http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml/index.html\">RecipeML</a> or even the non-XML MealMaster format.  Both of these have been around for quite a long time, especially so in the case of MealMaster.  In fact, if someone wanted to bootstrap a collection of recipes, you can find <a href=\"http://www.thehoseys.com/recipes.html\">a ton (150,000) of MealMaster recipes</a> as well as <a href=\"http://dsquirrel.tripod.com/recipeml/indexrecipes.html\">a smaller archive (10,000) of RecipeML files</a>.  Of course, I'm not sure about the copyright situation with any of these, but it's a start anyway.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut, the real strength in a recipe web would come from cooking bloggers.  Supply them with tools to generate RecipeML, post them on a blog server, and <a href=\"http://bitsko.slc.ut.us/blog/feed-data.html\">index them in an RSS feed</a>.  Then, geeks get to work building the recipe aggregators.  Hell, I'm thinking I might even give this a shot.  Since I'd really like to play with some RDF concepts, maybe I'll write some adaptors to munge RecipeML and MealMaster into <a href=\"http://donnafales.com/2002/07/28/recipe-schema#\">RDF recipe data</a>.  Cross that with FOAF and other RDF whackyness, and build an empire of recipe data.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe thing I wonder, though, is why hasn't anyone done this already?  And why hasn't anyone really mentioned much about what's out there already like RecipeML and MealMaster?  It seems like the perfect time to add this into the blogosphere.\n</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=the_recipe_web\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087742\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.braino.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1958f40a3ea1b8af56f7453922769c9a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.braino.org/\">Daniel Von Fange</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087742\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-11-14T22:22:29\">2003-11-14T22:22:29</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Though not \"open\", you do know of the epicurious recipe site, right?\nhttp://eat.epicurious.com/</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087744\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.poeticgeek.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3f559a187f3e64699a10e7704af90fe1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.poeticgeek.net\">gord</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087744\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-11-14T22:32:10\">2003-11-14T22:32:10</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I am a blogger that absolutely loves to cook (and throw dinner parties for that matter).

However, it isn't useful in practice. Imagine the same thing for auctions. There could be an XML format for auctions, everyone can post their items for sale on their weblog and auction aggregators would replace eBay. This would not be as good as eBay, obviously, as there is significant value to a centralized database of auctions. The same is true for recipes, in my opinion. \nAdditionally, creating RecipeML for recipes is a difficult task. Sure, it's fairly easy to write a few recipes in RecipeML if you're technically adept, but to do thousands becomes impossible and for the average recipe producer (grandmothers, chefs, etc) it just won't happen. And you really do need thousands to be a useful database (even your average cooking magazine publishes hundreds a month). \nWe (Recipezaar) wrote a natural language recipe parser to make this possible and it's a difficult job. It took us 3 years to write it!  Recipes are far more complicated than you might think, believe it or not. And a natural language recipe parser is not trivial software, which is why no other recipe web site has done this except for Recipezaar. We could release the software under the GPL so that everyone can start creating XML recipes. We've considered it and we've talked to people about doing it but after some thought, people do realize that it wouldn't be useful. Because, again, having recipes distributed across web sites is less powerful than a centralized repository of freely-available recipes. \nImagine a world of XML recipes distributed around the web on weblogs. An aggregator would need to aggregate millions of weblogs just to cull together a few hundred or thousand recipes. Now imagine millions of aggregator users doing this daily or hourly the way they do this today for weblogs. And if a weblogger had 1,000 recipes on their weblog archives, they wouldn't want millions of aggregators eating their bandwidth every day to maintain the database for each individual using an aggregator (webloggers today already complain about aggregators costing them too much money in bandwidth costs). Additionally, 99.999% of people who create recipes are unlikely to have a weblog to post their XML recipes so you'd lose the majority of the potential content. \nA centralized repository provides a place for regular users to post their recipes and get them seen by the most number of people. And a centralized repository provides an easy way to search for recipes, browse for recipes, review & rate recipes, discuss recipes, etc. And let's talk numbers.... today, Recipezaar has 73,000 recipes in the database and, while it's the largest database of recipes on the internet, people still can't find a particular recipe because there is an infinite number of possible recipes that can be created. Having a few hundred or a few thousand recipes is not a useful database to people. More is better.

However, it isn't useful in practice. Imagine the same thing for auctions. There could be an XML format for auctions, everyone can post their items for sale on their weblog and auction aggregators would replace eBay. This would not be as good as eBay, obviously, as there is significant value to a centralized database of auctions. The same is true for recipes, in my opinion. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, creating RecipeML for recipes is a difficult task. Sure, it's fairly easy to write a few recipes in RecipeML if you're technically adept, but to do thousands becomes impossible and for the average recipe producer (grandmothers, chefs, etc) it just won't happen. And you really do need thousands to be a useful database (even your average cooking magazine publishes hundreds a month). \r\n\r\nWe (Recipezaar) wrote a natural language recipe parser to make this possible and it's a difficult job. It took us 3 years to write it!  Recipes are far more complicated than you might think, believe it or not. And a natural language recipe parser is not trivial software, which is why no other recipe web site has done this except for Recipezaar. We could release the software under the GPL so that everyone can start creating XML recipes. We've considered it and we've talked to people about doing it but after some thought, people do realize that it wouldn't be useful. Because, again, having recipes distributed across web sites is less powerful than a centralized repository of freely-available recipes. \r\n\r\nImagine a world of XML recipes distributed around the web on weblogs. An aggregator would need to aggregate millions of weblogs just to cull together a few hundred or thousand recipes. Now imagine millions of aggregator users doing this daily or hourly the way they do this today for weblogs. And if a weblogger had 1,000 recipes on their weblog archives, they wouldn't want millions of aggregators eating their bandwidth every day to maintain the database for each individual using an aggregator (webloggers today already complain about aggregators costing them too much money in bandwidth costs). Additionally, 99.999% of people who create recipes are unlikely to have a weblog to post their XML recipes so you'd lose the majority of the potential content. \r\n\r\nA centralized repository provides a place for regular users to post their recipes and get them seen by the most number of people. And a centralized repository provides an easy way to search for recipes, browse for recipes, review & rate recipes, discuss recipes, etc. And let's talk numbers.... today, Recipezaar has 73,000 recipes in the database and, while it's the largest database of recipes on the internet, people still can't find a particular recipe because there is an infinite number of possible recipes that can be created. Having a few hundred or a few thousand recipes is not a useful database to people. More is better. And acquiring more via an aggregator is a big and expensive job.\r\n\r\nDistributed databases are useful in some contexts and centralized databases are useful in other contexts. Each has their own advantages and disadvantages, but like auctions, recipes are best stored centrally where everyone has access to them.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087754\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rjasmin.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9479c9c2b46970b26fe7642ddaf893a5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rjasmin.net\">rich</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087754\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-07-11T02:26:03\">2009-07-11T02:26:03</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with the central database theory.BUT, why limit to KRAFT or epicurious or the like.There are LOTS TONS even of unpublished or un-online recipies out there.My mother has several shoe boxes full and can't organize them yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know HOW to do it, but there is no stable MMF reader for OSX that fixes corrupted input yet.MacGourmet FAILS.

There's a matter of scale involved here, where the relative A's through Z's are completely different given your choice of grouping.  And, where choice of grouping is around topic area, the world's a bit of a smaller place and getting your questions answered is likely much easier.  Especially if you've built up some Whuffie in that domain area by generating some useful answers and knowledge yourself.  For newcomers to a domain of knowledge, who have lesser stockpiles of Whuffie, they'll hopefully be fortunate enough to find much of what they're looking for chronicled in the archives of blogs of those who've come before.  When they don't, though, it can still be a frustrating experience.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut, semantic web tech in and of itself doesn't solve the problem where data or knowledge is missing altogether.  How could it?  So, although I was a bit dismissive at first thought about <a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/scriptingArchive/2003/11/10#When:3:49:55PM\">what Dave Winer wrote</a>, he nonetheless has a good point.  Even if the semantic web were richly populated with data and running in full swing, it would still be missing large swaths of Things People Know.

It is sexy. They say it only works with Windows, but Doc thinks it probably works with Linux too. A couple of thousand really smart people will read this. I&apos;m sure one of them knows the answer. Probably more than one. There&apos;s the query. Human intelligence is so under-rated by computer researchers, but when we do our job well, that&apos;s what we facilitate. Human minds communicating with other human minds. What could be easier to understand?</i></blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://www.scripting.com/\">Scripting News</a></cite></small></div>\n\n<p>\nWell, I certainly wouldn&apos;t call this the Semantic Web-- more like the Whuffie Web.  See, if we were all A-List bloggers, with our own constellations of readers willing to pitch in to answer a question, we could all make queries like the above.  A-List bloggers have the big Whuffie.  Most everyone else has much less Whuffie, thus their query powers are much less.  I somehow doubt that the Whuffie Web, if it were to take off in a big way, would work to equal benefit for everyone.  A cousin, the Lazyweb, sometime serves its petitioners well, but it&apos;s a fickle and unpredictable thing indeed.  Sometimes you get magic, sometimes you get shrugs.  This also links into the Whuffie Web, in that Lazyweb contributors will be more likely to service a request if it comes from a Big Time Blogger.  It&apos;s all about the Whuffie exchange.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn the other hand, if this Semantic Web thing were to take off, it&apos;d benefit anyone who could lay hands on the connectivity to acquire the data, and the CPU power to churn through it.  The data itself could come from anyone with the connectivity to provide the data, and the brain power to create and assemble it from information and knowledge.  No underestimation of human intelligence here.  If anything, it&apos;s an attempt to better respect the exercise human intelligence, to conserve it, and make it more available.  Were the Semantic Web to take off in a big and easy to use way, people could spend more time creating answers and less time answering questions, since the machines do the job of fielding the questions themselves.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course... without the Whuffie, where&apos;s the motivation to provide the data?\n</p>\n",

I intend to eventually wipe this PowerBook completely and install fresh, but I couldn&apos;t wait.  :)\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/10/24/panther\">Mark Pilgrim</a> published the most definitive coverage of the beastie I&apos;ve seen yet, with help of the denizens of <a href=\"http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel\">#joiito</a> to manage the onslaught of readers.  So, I won&apos;t make any attempt to catalog the new things.\n</p>\n<p>\nA few impressions though:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Everything</b> feels faster.  Windows slide around and resize like they&apos;ve been waxed underneath.  Things seem to launch faster.</li>\n<li>A few small things have improved, like System Preferences quitting when I close the window, rather than hanging around waiting for me to open the window again or quit.</li>\n<li>Some third-party extension I had installed threw Finder into a launch-and-crash loop for awhile.  So, if you&apos;ve yet to install, try to purge your system of extensions first.  This should be obvious, but is sometimes a surprise when it&apos;s actually a problem.</li>\n<li>Expose looked like a neat feature when I first heard of it.  I fully expected it to be slow, stuttery, and &apos;cute&apos; when I finally played with it.  Now, having used it and slowly incorporating it into my usage habits, it&apos;s amazing.  Smooth and not stuttery at all, it looks like a computer interface feature from the movies.</li>\n<li>Fast user switching, where desktops rotate in and out of view, also looks like you wish it would, and seems like it&apos;s from the movies.</li>\n<li>I <b>hate</b> metal.</li>\n<li>I hate <i>metal</i>.</li>\n<li><u>I hate metal.</u></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThat is all.  For now.  Maybe.\n</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>\nFor the past year or two, I&apos;ve been trying an experiment in my\npersonal research and learning.  I&apos;ve been seeking out tools and\ntechnologies which are as different as possible from those with which\nI already have experience.  I want to break up some prejudices and\nhabits I have, and expose myself to more ways of looking at things.\nNow that I write this, it sounds like a great approach to life in\ngeneral, but for now I&apos;m focusing on computer science.  :)\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy success \nwith this has been entirely dependant on free time and brain cycles,\nof which I&apos;ve had precious little.  But, I have managed to wean myself\naway from Perl to learning Python, developing a few apps with it and\nincorporating it into my problem solving kit.  I&apos;ve also managed to\nget myself away from XEmacs for hours at a time in order to weave Vim\ninto my work-a-day life.  These two things haven&apos;t been easy for me,\nsince I&apos;ve been using both Perl and some variant of Emacs for almost\n12 years now, and I&apos;ve done my share of sneering at that which is not\nperl or emacs.  \n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd, although I&apos;ve yet to spring upon them, I&apos;ve also been making wary, \nnarrowing circles around Lisp, Smalltalk, Prolog, and .NET.  There\nbeen occasional forays into Java, as well as my daily attachment to\nFlash and Actionscript lately.  And then, there&apos;ve been my hefting and\nswinging of XSLT and XPath, as well as RDF, countered by a few feints\nwith plaintext shell tools and YAML.  There&apos;s been more, but most\ninvestigations have been too tentative to mention.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIf there&apos;s a &quot;holy war&quot; between two things, I want to explore them both.\nI tend to see two apparently intelligent parties in an extended debate\nover which of them has a hold on the One True Way.  In my\nexperience, though, there&apos;s a high likelyhood that such a phenomenon\npoints toward a real truth which lies somewhere inbetween.  (This, of\ncourse, ignoring such cases where one party is correct, and the other\nis WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!)  There tend to be very good reasons why smart\npeople on either side of a fence have taken up with what they have,\nand I want to know both sides thoroughly.  I know full well that both\nsides have at least some valid criticisms against the other, but I\nwant a synthesis of the two.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn this field of computer science, there\nare as many ways of working with the dreamstuff as there\nare ways of structuring thoughts.  And, rather than there ever being\nOne True Way to do things, there will always be another smart person\ndeveloping another powerfully expressive and insightful way of doing\nthings.  Someday, I&apos;d like to be one of those smart people, so I need\nto have a sense for that truth in the middle that other One True Ways \nbracket and zero in on.  And then, I want to know enough to jump out\nof the frame altogether, and in which ways I can invert and twist\nthings to encircle some new spark.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSomeday in the next few years, I&apos;d like to get back into school so I\ncan get to even higher levels of growing up to be a computer scientist.\nBut for now, it&apos;s back to work for me.  And, if you happen to think of\nany geeky holy wars, let me know.  I&apos;m collecting them for study.\n</p>\n",

Perhaps even with OPML.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1611.html#c1066129228\">A later comment on Sam Ruby: FDML</a></cite></small></div>\n\n<p>\nFor anyone who wonders why people talk about politics and animosity in\nthe tiny sphere of web syndication tech, here's a case in point.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYou see, there was a private event over the weekend, called Foo Camp.\nTo this, many smart people were invited, and many more weren't.\nGrousing about invitations, funding, and elitism aside, it sounded\nlike a great time and a cool change from your average conference.  I\nhope it turns into a regular event, and hope that someday I'm given\nthe opportunity to go to something like it.  I'm sure a lot of us\nout here would like to make it to something like that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut, for what it was, you can only gather so many people before it\nbecomes a circus (or a conference).  Charging a price serves as a\nlimiter, while making the event invitation-only works as well.  The\ndifference is whether you're bringing in people who can afford it\nversus people who are favored by the organizer.  Either way, someone's\ngoing to be pissed about not going.  The difference is whether you're\npissed off at the organizer's economics or the organizer's\npersonality.  Oh well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo anyway, around mid-September, Jeremy Zawodny had floated\n<a href=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000967.html\">an idea</a>\ninvolving publishing and discovery of lists of RSS feeds.\nHe was one of those invited to Foo Camp, and in one of their\nhuddles, he brought the idea up for a brainstorming session.\nFrom the sounds of it, they tossed around a few ideas, but\ndidn't really come up with much other than that it was an idea\nworth discussing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNo sooner than the camp breaks up, though, and the angry buzz\nhas already started.  How dare a bunch of geeks talk about\ntechnology they're interested in while at a private gathering?\nHow dare they not invite all of us?  Conspiracy!  Elitism!\nThey didn't pick me for their kickball team!  By the way,\nthis isn't an attempt to put words in mouths.  This is my\noff-the-cuff impression of what I read yesterday.  It all\nseems repeatedly and unnecessarily childish to me, and it's\ncertainly not limited to one person.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo, by today, there's already\n<a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/fdml/FrontPage\">a wiki</a>\ndevoted to exploring this idea, along with a scattering of blog\nposts. This seems pretty speedy to me,\nconsidering campers returning to the work-a-day world after\na geek retreat.  This doesn't seem at all the work of a sinister\ncabal bent on wresting control and domination over a technology,\nas what I saw implied in the first comment I quoted above.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDave Winer's already posted a\n<a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/myPublicFeedsOpml\">first proposal</a>\ntoward implementing the idea.  And, believe it or not, as Sam comments\non above, this approach has not been ruled out.  In fact,\nJeremy had suggested using OPML in his original posting of the idea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhy couldn't we just have seen the collaboration without the\nantagonism, in at least this case?  Yeah, there was a small, private\ngathering at which discussions were had.  Sounds like what happens at\nwork, or with friends, or in classes.  Granted, I suppose an argument\ncould be made concerning the relative openness of these gatherings as\ncompared to Foo Camp.  But, this is mooted by the fact that the\npeople involved were already moving toward sharing the discussion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor all the grousing about flame wars and personality clashes on\nmailing lists and working groups, sometimes it's nice to work on an\nidea in a smaller group with a good dynamic.  It helps to get\nsomething together before throwing the doors open to have the thing\nbuffeted by opinions and criticism from all sides.  It's one way to\navoid <a href=\"http://www.userland.com/whatIsStopEnergy\">\"stop\nenergy\"</a> while trying to build some momentum.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs Dave himself wrote, \"I heard at a working group meeting that things\nlike SOAP can only happen when no one is paying attention.\"  So, it\nsounds like a bunch of geeks tried to get something rolling before the\nattentional heat lamps turned on it.  Had they wanted to be a sinister\ncabal, we certainly wouldn't have heard about any of this until long,\nlong after the event.  It would have been kept behind closed corporate\ndoors until the day of embrace-and-extend.  Then, profit!  As it is, I\nthink they erred on the side of throwing open the discussion\n<i>too</i> early.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo anyway, the reason I write at such length about this is that I\ndon't think that this should be let to pass without comment or\nconsideration.  This kind of thing is what's wrong.  We need to take\nat <i>least</i> three deep breaths before reacting like this, whether\nor not we've taken 900 beep breaths in the past already.

The\r\ndifference is whether you're bringing in people who can afford it\r\nversus people who are favored by the organizer.  Either way, someone's\r\ngoing to be pissed about not going.

This seems pretty speedy to me,\r\nconsidering campers returning to the work-a-day world after\r\na geek retreat.  This doesn't seem at all the work of a sinister\r\ncabal bent on wresting control and domination over a technology,\r\nas what I saw implied in the first comment I quoted above.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDave Winer's already posted a\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/myPublicFeedsOpml\">first proposal</a>\r\ntoward implementing the idea.

In fact,\r\nJeremy had suggested using OPML in his original posting of the idea.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhy couldn't we just have seen the collaboration without the\r\nantagonism, in at least this case?  Yeah, there was a small, private\r\ngathering at which discussions were had.  Sounds like what happens at\r\nwork, or with friends, or in classes.

It helps to get\r\nsomething together before throwing the doors open to have the thing\r\nbuffeted by opinions and criticism from all sides.

Kuchling\n<a href=\"http://www.amk.ca/xml/reviews.html\">has provided</a> an\n<a href=\"http://amk.ca/xml/review/1.0\">RDF namespace</a>\nfor embedding book review metadata within XHTML documents.\n</li>\n<li>\nFor resumes,\nUldis Bojars\n<a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2002Jun/0077.html\">has been working</a> on an\n<a href=\"http://nightman.lv/~captsolo/cv.rdfs\">RDF schema for resumes and CV</a>.\n</li>\n<li>\nTo offer up recipes, I found\n<a href=\"http://donnafales.com/2002/07/28/recipe-schema\">this RDF schema</a>\nfor <a href=\"http://donnafales.com/2003/recipes\">recipes</a> hosted on\n<a href=\"http://donnafales.com\">donnafales.com</a>.\n</li>\n<li>\nAs for topics, well, there's already a straight RSS 2.0 namespace\nextension called <a href=\"http://matt.blogs.it/specs/ENT/1.0/\">Easy News Topics</a>.\n</li>\n<li>\nAnd, finally, for events there is\n<a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\">mod_event</a>,\nand RSS 1.0 module used for presenting calendar event information.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nYes, with the exception of ENT, these are RDF schema or namespaces.\nBut, any one of them could likely be adapted to straight XML and used as an RSS 2.0\nnamespace, thereby leveraging the work these people have already done\nin modeling these kinds of content, as well as potentially providing\nan easy transformation path to RDF for those who care.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat does RSS-Data provide out of the box which makes any of the\nabove obsolete?  There's no magic here, other than translating between\nraw data sctructures.  You'll still need to do the same sort of\nmodeling and structure work that the authors of all the above have\ndone.  It's always nicer to have someone else do homework for you.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo, if all this new microcontent is so hot, why hasn't anything like\nthe above been put into use?

I have my misgivings about it, which mostly center around the issue of schema.\n<br /><br />\nSee, the goal of RSS-Data, as I understand it, is to bridge raw data from one programming environment to another, and package it up to be syndicated within RSS feeds for which an existing infrastructure already exists.  So, it's \"easy\".  Just throw your data structures at a library, which serializes them into some magic XML.  At the receiving end, another library, written possibly in a different language altogether, transliterates the magic XML into local idiomatic data structures.  You never think much about XML, nor does the consumer of your data.\n<br /><br />\nBut...  we're still talking about <i>structures</i> here.  Whether they're represented by XML tags, RDF triples, RDF/XML serialization, or hashtables and arrays-- there's still a structure involved.  From whence did it come?\n<br /><br />\nAbout RSS-Data, Roger Benningfield writes, \"...I don't need to work up a schema...\", which is literally true.  He goes on to write, \"I take an existing data structure, and plug it into a syndication feed. That's it.\"\n<br /><br />\nFrom where did this \"existing data structure\" originate?  For <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/rss_data_versus_namespace.html\">my examples</a>, I used an existing schema from the Amazon web services.  Where'd you get yours?\n<br /><br />\nI'd guess that you got it from somewhere in the bowels of your scripts, a hash or rough structure once limited to intra- or inter- module data exchange, but now pressed into service as a unit of interoperation.  I wouldn't expect that you'd put much specific effort toward making this data structure particularly concise or friendly for interoperation.  This might not be a big deal for now.  And anyway, why bother with it?  That's not the philosophy with this tech, as far as I understand it.  The idea, is that hopefully this data structure is already <i>good enough</i> for sharing.  And, luckily enough, this is sometimes the case.\n<br /><br />\nOn the other hand, maybe you're sitting down to come up with a new data structure for sharing, from scratch.  During this activity, I imagine that you'll be mulling over what goes where, what's contained by what, what this hash or dictionary key means versus that one.  You'll likely be deciding whether to use a string here, or a date time here, and you'll likely have some idea about ranges of values for various things.  This is a bit more abstract an activity than you may have gone through, were you simply creating an internal data structure for your app.  In this case, you'd likely be thinking more about the data in and of itself, rather than the specific needs of your app and its API. In my opinion, this is a <i>bit better</i> for sharing.\n<br /><br />\nBut, how's your documentation?  Will I be able to reliably accept data from your application by just looking at a write-up or a rough spec?  Will I have to walk through your source code to reverse engineer general usage?  Will I have to examine RSS-Data dumps to come up with a rough approximation of what to expect from your data structure?  If this is a data structure plucked from the depths of your script, who knows?  If this structure was designed specifically for sharing, I hope that you've documented as you go along.\n<br /><br />\nWhat RSS-Data makes me worry about is an abundance of fuzzy, adhoc structures for interchange that no one ever quite documents well enough because they're too busy hacking along and pushing things out the door.  Maybe they'll be good enough, given discipline and thoughtfulness, but then maybe they'll end up in a mess.  But, just like many scripting languages, there are no facilities in RSS-Data currently to either require or even merely encourage clean and documented interchange structures.\n<br /><br />\nThis is a <b>code-first-schema-later</b> approach:  The schema stems, eventually, from general usage and tradition, and if we're lucky, from documentation.  If the people hacking on the project have discipline and are thoughtful, this documentation will be well maintained, and changes well communicated.  It can be a train-wreck, but it doesn't have to be.\n<br /><br />\nOn the other hand, we can circle back to that <a href=\"http://xml.amazon.com/schemas3/dev-lite.xsd\">Amazon Web Services schema</a> I used in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/rss_data_versus_namespace.html\">previous examples</a>.  This technology, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/\">XML Schema</a>, represents the opposite approach: <b>schema-first-code-later</b>.  In coming up with such a schema, I think still think about information and data structures just as I would while hacking on a script and thinking about a native data structure for sharing.  It's just that, with this approach, I'm doing things in a different order and front-loading the thinking. \n<br /><br />\nBut, there's more: if I build something like an XML Schema, I'm creating something which is both documentation <i>and</i> a machine readable resource.  I'm sure someone out there is working on or has released tools or stylesheets to convert XML Schema into HTML or RTF or something human readable.  Hell, you could even <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/01/15/transforming-schemas.html\">apply some transformation to the schema to generate code or data entry forms</a>.\n<br /><br />\nOnce I have a schema, implementing code to produce and handle XML data conforming to it isn't really all that much harder than using straight RSS-Data.  This is an item for much dispute, but my gut and limited experience tells me that the difference in complexity will usually be more like a dozen lines of code or less in a decent environment rather than, say, an order of magnitude.  I think we'll find that things will tend to be consistent with <a href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/2003/10/3/#200310033\">Phillip Pearson's example implementations</a> of an RSS namespace extension versus an RSS-Data example.\n<br /><br />\nWhat we get for the added complexity, though, is certainty.  I can say, \"Here.  This is a URL to the schema for the XML data my application produces.\"  If I've lived up to my end \nof the bargain, you won't even need to see my application's code or documentation.  You can implement with the schema, and our apps will interoperate.  We can treat the data formats <i>as separate entities from applications</i>.  In other words, we can treat interchange <i>as neutral ground</i>.\n<br /><br />\nThe problem, of course, is that this business with schema carries with it a bit of overhead, as well as a demand that you do some homework.  You'll need to know more than your immediate programming environment.  You'll need to think about XML and XML schemas, and you can't just stay in your comfortable favorite environment of programing language idiom.  This is off-putting to some, to say the least.\n<br /><br />\nSo...  how about Marc's question?  \"Can't we all live together?? Can't we put our heads together and come up with solutions that BRIDGE between these two standards - which just happen to have almost the same dam name?\"  On the one side, I see hackers who want to get down and code, and who consider themselves and each other thoughtful and disciplined enough to do the right thing and prevent trainwrecks.  On the other side, I see hackers who want to put discipline and thoughtfulness upfront and <i>in writing (or typing?)</i> before they code, because they don't really trust themselves or others to keep from wrecking the trains all the time.\n<br /><br />\nPersonally, I want to live somewhere in the middle.  Just enough distrust of myself and others to discourage sloppy problems, but not too much so that I have to trudge through careful molasses to get anywhere.\n<br /><br />\nI don't think I'm thrilled with RSS-Data.  But if you're going to use RSS-Data anyway, but here's one thought out of all this:  Is there some way we could come up with an RSS-Data-analogue for schema?  Forget about XML schema and standards groups and the like.  Think about some semi-universal way of translating meta-data-structures composed within one's favorite scripting language which forms documentation and a promise about what to expect over the wire?  If done right, maybe we could even generate an XML schema with this, and that could be a bridge between the two approaches.  On the surface, it sounds like a wonky idea to me, but hey...\n<br /><br />\nThanks for bearing with me through this much-longer-than-usual post.  :)\n<!--more-->\nshortname=rss_data_and_schema\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086629\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://therealadam.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b205857010d759de7e2c8cb592b01dd5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://therealadam.com\">Adam Keys</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086629\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-10-06T23:03:14\">2003-10-06T23:03:14</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">This is absolutely brilliant.

You&apos;ll likely be deciding whether to use a string here, or a date time here, and you&apos;ll likely have some idea about ranges of values for various things.  This is a bit more abstract an activity than you may have gone through, were you simply creating an internal data structure for your app.  In this case, you&apos;d likely be thinking more about the data in and of itself, rather than the specific needs of your app and its API. In my opinion, this is a <i>bit better</i> for sharing.\n<br><br>\nBut, how&apos;s your documentation?  Will I be able to reliably accept data from your application by just looking at a write-up or a rough spec?  Will I have to walk through your source code to reverse engineer general usage?  Will I have to examine RSS-Data dumps to come up with a rough approximation of what to expect from your data structure?  If this is a data structure plucked from the depths of your script, who knows?  If this structure was designed specifically for sharing, I hope that you&apos;ve documented as you go along.\n<br><br>\nWhat RSS-Data makes me worry about is an abundance of fuzzy, adhoc structures for interchange that no one ever quite documents well enough because they&apos;re too busy hacking along and pushing things out the door.  Maybe they&apos;ll be good enough, given discipline and thoughtfulness, but then maybe they&apos;ll end up in a mess.  But, just like many scripting languages, there are no facilities in RSS-Data currently to either require or even merely encourage clean and documented interchange structures.\n<br><br>\nThis is a <b>code-first-schema-later</b> approach:  The schema stems, eventually, from general usage and tradition, and if we&apos;re lucky, from documentation.  If the people hacking on the project have discipline and are thoughtful, this documentation will be well maintained, and changes well communicated.  It can be a train-wreck, but it doesn&apos;t have to be.\n<br><br>\nOn the other hand, we can circle back to that <a href=\"http://xml.amazon.com/schemas3/dev-lite.xsd\">Amazon Web Services schema</a> I used in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/rss_data_versus_namespace.html\">previous examples</a>.  This technology, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/\">XML Schema</a>, represents the opposite approach: <b>schema-first-code-later</b>.  In coming up with such a schema, I think still think about information and data structures just as I would while hacking on a script and thinking about a native data structure for sharing.  It&apos;s just that, with this approach, I&apos;m doing things in a different order and front-loading the thinking. \n<br><br>\nBut, there&apos;s more: if I build something like an XML Schema, I&apos;m creating something which is both documentation <i>and</i> a machine readable resource.  I&apos;m sure someone out there is working on or has released tools or stylesheets to convert XML Schema into HTML or RTF or something human readable.  Hell, you could even <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/01/15/transforming-schemas.html\">apply some transformation to the schema to generate code or data entry forms</a>.\n<br><br>\nOnce I have a schema, implementing code to produce and handle XML data conforming to it isn&apos;t really all that much harder than using straight RSS-Data.  This is an item for much dispute, but my gut and limited experience tells me that the difference in complexity will usually be more like a dozen lines of code or less in a decent environment rather than, say, an order of magnitude.  I think we&apos;ll find that things will tend to be consistent with <a href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/2003/10/3/#200310033\">Phillip Pearson&apos;s example implementations</a> of an RSS namespace extension versus an RSS-Data example.\n<br><br>\nWhat we get for the added complexity, though, is certainty.  I can say, &quot;Here.  This is a URL to the schema for the XML data my application produces.&quot;  If I&apos;ve lived up to my end \nof the bargain, you won&apos;t even need to see my application&apos;s code or documentation.  You can implement with the schema, and our apps will interoperate.  We can treat the data formats <i>as separate entities from applications</i>.  In other words, we can treat interchange <i>as neutral ground</i>.\n<br><br>\nThe problem, of course, is that this business with schema carries with it a bit of overhead, as well as a demand that you do some homework.  You&apos;ll need to know more than your immediate programming environment.  You&apos;ll need to think about XML and XML schemas, and you can&apos;t just stay in your comfortable favorite environment of programing language idiom.  This is off-putting to some, to say the least.\n<br><br>\nSo...  how about Marc&apos;s question?  &quot;Can&apos;t we all live together?? Can&apos;t we put our heads together and come up with solutions that BRIDGE between these two standards - which just happen to have almost the same dam name?&quot;  On the one side, I see hackers who want to get down and code, and who consider themselves and each other thoughtful and disciplined enough to do the right thing and prevent trainwrecks.  On the other side, I see hackers who want to put discipline and thoughtfulness upfront and <i>in writing (or typing?)</i> before they code, because they don&apos;t really trust themselves or others to keep from wrecking the trains all the time.\n<br><br>\nPersonally, I want to live somewhere in the middle.  Just enough distrust of myself and others to discourage sloppy problems, but not too much so that I have to trudge through careful molasses to get anywhere.\n<br><br>\nI don&apos;t think I&apos;m thrilled with RSS-Data.  But if you&apos;re going to use RSS-Data anyway, but here&apos;s one thought out of all this:  Is there some way we could come up with an RSS-Data-analogue for schema?  Forget about XML schema and standards groups and the like.  Think about some semi-universal way of translating meta-data-structures composed within one&apos;s favorite scripting language which forms documentation and a promise about what to expect over the wire?  If done right, maybe we could even generate an XML schema with this, and that could be a bridge between the two approaches.  On the surface, it sounds like a wonky idea to me, but hey...\n<br><br>\nThanks for bearing with me through this much-longer-than-usual post.  :)\n",

    "summary": "<p>\nSo, for the same of argument, yesterday I threw together\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/rss_data_versus_namespace.html\">examples</a>\nof what a use of RSS-Data might look like alongside what\nthe same data in an RSS namespace extension might look like.\nI promised code, but never got a chance to circle back around.\nFortunately, <a href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/\">Phillip Pearson</a>\nconnected the rest of the dots for me with two examples:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/2003/10/3/#200310031\">Parsing RSS-Data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/2003/10/3/#200310032\">Parsing an RSS namespace extension</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nI was just a <i>little</i> surprised by his results, since I expected\nthe code to handle an RSS namespace to be at least a bit more complex\nthan the RSS-Data example.  But,\n<a href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/2003/10/3/#200310033\">as Phillip observed later</a>,\nthe scripts were pretty much equivalent in length, complexity, and\nease of construction.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen, this morning, I saw that Danny Ayers had posted an\n<a href=\"http://dannyayers.com/archives/001908.html\">example in RDF</a>\nof this same data.  It doesn&apos;t differ very much from my namespace\nextension example, except that the few differences there are enables\nhis example to flow through RDF tools (as well as, usually, XML tools like\nXPath and XSLT).\n</p>\n<p>\nIn <a href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/phil/pss/comments.php?u=2&amp;p=200310033&amp;link=http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/2003/10/3/#200310033\">a comment</a>\non one of Phillip&apos;s posts, though, Roger Benningfield makes\nthe point that this example is a bit biased:\n</p>\n<blockquote><i>\nI agree that there won&apos;t be a ton of difference between a struct full\nof strings and plain ol&apos; XML. But that&apos;s kind of a stacked example,\nsince SDL would allow a lot more than that... arrays, integers, and\narrays of integers inside structs.\n</i></blockquote>\n<p>\nWhat I did could be obscuring some work.  I just took an existing\nschema from Amazon, which gave me some initial work already for free.\n(Though, there&apos;s something to be said for <i>that</i> in and of itself.)\nThe structures were already established, and the schema was created\nwith XML representation already in mind.  This could have placed\nRSS-Data at an example.  While I really don&apos;t think\nthat XML-RPC serialization offers more flexibility in expression than\nXML itself, I could be wrong and I don&apos;t want to be tilting\nat <a href=\"http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/straw-man.html\">straw men</a>.  \n</p>\n<p>\nSo, while I doubt that I&apos;ll have a whole lot of time today, I think\nfor the same of completeness, someone should go through the parallel\nprocesses of going from problem statement up through data modeling and\non to production and consumption of RSS-Data and an RSS namespace\nextension.  While doing this, capture the work involved in both.\n</p>\n<p>\nI could see shortcuts taken on the RSS-Data side, since you don&apos;t have\nto be concerened with various bits of XML tech like DTDs or schema\nor whatnot.  You can jump right into coding up an example usage and\ncome up with your data model on the fly.  Whether this is a good thing\nor not, I&apos;m sure many will disagree.  Also, I&apos;m sure others would\ngo through this differently than I would.  Again, your mojo may\nexceed mine.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt this point, I can see the benefits of RSS-Data in rapidly cobbling\ntogether scripts, but I lean toward having a decently defined data\nmodel first.  You can do this in your scripts, but using the existing\nXML tech forces you through some specific processes.  On the other\nhand, I can see where some busy developers don&apos;t have time or spare\nbrain cycles to absorb all the XML tech.  It could be made easier\nat that end of things, which is where I&apos;d rather spend my effort.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnyway, I&apos;m really interested in seeing where this goes, because\nthis comparison of RSS-Data, RSS namespace extensions, and even\nRDF seems like another very concrete, non-theoretical way to demonstrate\nthe benefits and drawbacks of these ways of thinking about data\nand interoperability.\n</p>\n",

On one hand, I just shoehorned the Amazon\nXML schema into an RSS 2.0 namespace, and on the other, I tried\ntransliterating the Amazon XML data into\n<a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0113297/2003/10/01.html#a237\">RSS-Data</a> /\n<a href=\"http://www.xml-rpc.com/spec\">XML-RPC</a> serialized data\nstructures.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo resolve my own love/hate of this RSS-Data idea,\nI'm planning to keep going from here and work up some simple Python\nscripts to produce and consume data along the lines of both examples,\nthen to comment on the experience.  (This is assuming I don't run out\nof round tuits.)  Some things to note:\n<ul>\n\n<li>Your XML mojo is probably stronger than mine,\nso please feel free to correct me.</li>\n\n<li>Although I created the RSS-Data example by hand, it would\notherwise be completely produced and consumed by machine.</li>\n\n<li>Since it's at the root of a few things I'm thinking,\nit's worth restating:  RSS-Data is intended to be produced and\nconsumed by machine, not by humans.  This means that the XML\ndata needs not look pretty or elegant to you, but to your machine.</li>\n\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo, on with the XML.

On one hand, I just shoehorned the Amazon\r\nXML schema into an RSS 2.0 namespace, and on the other, I tried\r\ntransliterating the Amazon XML data into\r\n<a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0113297/2003/10/01.html#a237\">RSS-Data</a> /\r\n<a href=\"http://www.xml-rpc.com/spec\">XML-RPC</a> serialized data\r\nstructures.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo resolve my own love/hate of this RSS-Data idea,\r\nI'm planning to keep going from here and work up some simple Python\r\nscripts to produce and consume data along the lines of both examples,\r\nthen to comment on the experience.

This means that the XML\r\ndata needs not look pretty or elegant to you, but to your machine.</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo, on with the XML.

How important is quickly catching mid-day updates?\nI think looking at averages throws things off, considering how \"clumpy\" I'd guess most update frequencies are. Some thoughts:\n* probably makes sense to check each feed at least once per day\n* for each feed, look at the average time-of-day of its first-post-of-the-day. Actually, look at a distribution curve, and pick the time at which there's an 80% chance that the first post will have been made (if it's going to be made at all).\n* check at that time; if no posting then check 12 hours later?\n* if found posting at first check of day, then start that additive/multiplicative process\n* regardless of the state of that latter calculation, check the next morning at that time-of-first-post prediction\nParallel idea:\n* calc average time between posts like you're doing, but just over the window each day when posts are being made (e.g. 8am-11pm = 15 hrs, not 24 hrs).</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083784\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083784\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-09-29T10:39:45\">2003-09-29T10:39:45</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Ooh, good ideas!

When I suggested AIMD, I meant that the time between polls should be subject to this scheduling system - that is, the poll interval should increase additively but decrease multiplicatively.\nThis is not as polite as your interpretation, which definitely backs off very quickly. My reasoning went like this: weblog posts tend to clump, so the best indicator of an upcoming post is a new post...:\n- If there aren't any new posts, lengthen the check interval by a little bit and check again later; keep lengthening the check interval up to a certain limit.\n- If there is a new post, then it's likely that another new post will follow soon, so substantially decrease the poll time (down to a certain limit) and check again soon.\nThis approach is less biased towards decreasing server load and more biased towards detecting quick clumps of updates, which seem to be the norm. I don't know any human webloggers who have such a predictable posting pattern that they are subject to statistical analysis  ;)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083787\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083787\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-09-29T11:53:46\">2003-09-29T11:53:46</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Oh, duh.

Then, you could collapse the series of hours where nothing was posted into a big block, and split any hours where something was posted into two sections, to average out the number of posts per hour.  Then, if my theory is correct, you can poll once per block of time, and would have a reasonable chance of getting a new post.\nSome notable flaws with the algorithm:\n1. It fails to account for whole days where there's nothing posted.  This might be overcome by having your initial blocks of time be the days of the week.\n2. It fails to account for the relationship (or the average time) between posts.  So if someone posts a lot at 9:00 or 10:00, but never both at 9:00 and 10:00, my theory will still check the 10:00 time even if something was found at 9:00.  I can't think of a way to get around this, off the top of my head.\nAnother way of thinking of this idea is pre-calculating a guess at the fall-off, based on previous posts.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

How important is quickly catching mid-day updates?\r\n\r\nI think looking at averages throws things off, considering how \"clumpy\" I'd guess most update frequencies are. Some thoughts:\r\n\r\n* probably makes sense to check each feed at least once per day\r\n\r\n* for each feed, look at the average time-of-day of its first-post-of-the-day. Actually, look at a distribution curve, and pick the time at which there's an 80% chance that the first post will have been made (if it's going to be made at all).\r\n\r\n* check at that time; if no posting then check 12 hours later?\r\n\r\n* if found posting at first check of day, then start that additive/multiplicative process\r\n\r\n* regardless of the state of that latter calculation, check the next morning at that time-of-first-post prediction\r\n\r\nParallel idea:\r\n\r\n* calc average time between posts like you're doing, but just over the window each day when posts are being made (e.g. 8am-11pm = 15 hrs, not 24 hrs).</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083784\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083784\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-09-29T10:39:45\">2003-09-29T10:39:45</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Ooh, good ideas!

When I suggested AIMD, I meant that the time between polls should be subject to this scheduling system - that is, the poll interval should increase additively but decrease multiplicatively.\r\n\r\nThis is not as polite as your interpretation, which definitely backs off very quickly. My reasoning went like this: weblog posts tend to clump, so the best indicator of an upcoming post is a new post...:\r\n\r\n - If there aren't any new posts, lengthen the check interval by a little bit and check again later; keep lengthening the check interval up to a certain limit.\r\n - If there is a new post, then it's likely that another new post will follow soon, so substantially decrease the poll time (down to a certain limit) and check again soon.\r\n\r\nThis approach is less biased towards decreasing server load and more biased towards detecting quick clumps of updates, which seem to be the norm. I don't know any human webloggers who have such a predictable posting pattern that they are subject to statistical analysis  ;)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083787\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083787\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-09-29T11:53:46\">2003-09-29T11:53:46</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Oh, duh.

Then, you could collapse the series of hours where nothing was posted into a big block, and split any hours where something was posted into two sections, to average out the number of posts per hour.  Then, if my theory is correct, you can poll once per block of time, and would have a reasonable chance of getting a new post.\r\n\r\nSome notable flaws with the algorithm:\r\n1. It fails to account for whole days where there's nothing posted.  This might be overcome by having your initial blocks of time be the days of the week.\r\n2. It fails to account for the relationship (or the average time) between posts.  So if someone posts a lot at 9:00 or 10:00, but never both at 9:00 and 10:00, my theory will still check the 10:00 time even if something was found at 9:00.  I can't think of a way to get around this, off the top of my head.\r\n\r\nAnother way of thinking of this idea is pre-calculating a guess at the fall-off, based on previous posts.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

I was doing something\nthat seems really odd now, trying to collect counts of new items together\nby hour, then averaging those hourly counts across a week.  Instead, I&apos;m\ntrying this now:\n</p>\n\n<pre>SELECT\n  source,\n  &apos;update_period&apos; AS name,\n  round(min(24,max(1,(max(1,(iso8601_to_epoch(max(created)) -\n    max(now() - (7*24*60*60), iso8601_to_epoch(min(created)))) /\n   (60*60))) / count(id))),2) AS value\nFROM\n  items\nWHERE\n  created &gt;= epoch_to_iso8601(now() - (7*24*60*60)) \nGROUP BY\n  source</pre>\n\n<p>\nThis bit of SQL, though still ugly, is much simpler.  This leaves out\nthe subselect, which I think I might have been playing with in order\nto build a little graph display of new items over time by source.

This\nseems to be working much better.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAn alternate algorithm I&apos;ve been playing with was suggested in\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/comments/tech/dynamic_feed_scan_times/#comment-aofdehdefioofcb\">a comment</a>\nby <a href=\"http://24.102.209.201/weblogs/ben/\">Gnomon</a>,\ninspired by TCP/IP&apos;s Additive Increase / Multiplicative Decrease.\nWith this, I subtract an hour from the time between polls when a\npoll finds new items, and then multiply by 2 every time a poll\ncomes up with nothing new.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nUsing the average of new items over time lessens my pummeling\nof servers per hour, but the second approach is even lighter\non polling since it&apos;s biased toward large leaps backing off\nfrom polling when new items are not found.

Also, a few of the date functions are\nspecific to how I've <a href=\"http://pysqlite.sourceforge.net/documentation/pysqlite/node10.html#SECTION004231000000000000000\">extended sqlite in Python</a>.  It works though, and\nwhat it does is this:\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor each feed to which I'm subscribed, work out\nan average time between updates for the past week, with a maximum\nperiod of 24 hours and a minimum of 1 hour.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy aggregator does this daily, and uses the results to determine how\nfrequently to schedule scans.  In this way, it automatically backs off\non checking feeds which update infrequently, and ramps up its polling\nof more active feeds.  This shortens my feed downloading and scanning\ntime, and is kinder in general to everyone on my subscription list.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext, among other things, I have to look into making sure that the\nHTTP client parts of this beast pass all the\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/tests/client/http/\">aggregator client\nHTTP tests</a> that <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/\">Mark\nPilgrim</a> put together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>Update</b>: Well, it seemed like a good idea, anyway.  But, on\nfurther examination, it has flaws.  The most notable is that it\nassumes a polling frequency of once per hour.  This works right up\nuntil I start changing the polling frequency with the results of the\ncalculation.  I haven't poked at it yet, but maybe if I take this\ninto account, it'll be more accurate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn the other hand, I've also been thinking about a much simpler\napproach to ramping polling frequency up and down:  Start out at\na poll every hour.  If, after a poll, no new items are found,\ndouble the time until the next poll.  If new items were found,\nhalve the time until the next poll.</p>\n\n<p>\nProvide lower and upper limits to this, say between 1 hour and 1\nweek.  Also, consider the ramp up and ramp down factor as a variable\nsetting too.  Instead of a factor of 2, maybe try 1.5 or even 1.25 for\na more gradual change.  To go even further, I wonder if it would be\nvaluable to dynamically alter this factor itself, to try to get the\npolling time zeroed in on a realistic polling time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOkay.  There the simpler approach leaves simplicity.  I'm sure there's\nsome decently elegant math that could be pulled in here.  :)\n</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=dynamic_feed_scan_times\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087768\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://24.102.209.201/weblogs/ben/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=588bdfdda82be46c638d6956c55ebc38&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://24.102.209.201/weblogs/ben/\">Gnomon</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087768\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-09-26T09:56:09\">2003-09-26T09:56:09</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Why not just go the TCP/IP route - Additive Increase / Multiplicative Decrease?

It works though, and\r\nwhat it does is this:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor each feed to which I'm subscribed, work out\r\nan average time between updates for the past week, with a maximum\r\nperiod of 24 hours and a minimum of 1 hour.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy aggregator does this daily, and uses the results to determine how\r\nfrequently to schedule scans.  In this way, it automatically backs off\r\non checking feeds which update infrequently, and ramps up its polling\r\nof more active feeds.  This shortens my feed downloading and scanning\r\ntime, and is kinder in general to everyone on my subscription list.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNext, among other things, I have to look into making sure that the\r\nHTTP client parts of this beast pass all the\r\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/tests/client/http/\">aggregator client\r\nHTTP tests</a> that <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/\">Mark\r\nPilgrim</a> put together.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Update</b>: Well, it seemed like a good idea, anyway.  But, on\r\nfurther examination, it has flaws.  The most notable is that it\r\nassumes a polling frequency of once per hour.  This works right up\r\nuntil I start changing the polling frequency with the results of the\r\ncalculation.  I haven't poked at it yet, but maybe if I take this\r\ninto account, it'll be more accurate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOn the other hand, I've also been thinking about a much simpler\r\napproach to ramping polling frequency up and down:  Start out at\r\na poll every hour.  If, after a poll, no new items are found,\r\ndouble the time until the next poll.  If new items were found,\r\nhalve the time until the next poll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nProvide lower and upper limits to this, say between 1 hour and 1\r\nweek.  Also, consider the ramp up and ramp down factor as a variable\r\nsetting too.  Instead of a factor of 2, maybe try 1.5 or even 1.25 for\r\na more gradual change.  To go even further, I wonder if it would be\r\nvaluable to dynamically alter this factor itself, to try to get the\r\npolling time zeroed in on a realistic polling time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOkay.  There the simpler approach leaves simplicity.  I'm sure there's\r\nsome decently elegant math that could be pulled in here.  :)\r\n</p>\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=dynamic_feed_scan_times\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087768\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://24.102.209.201/weblogs/ben/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=588bdfdda82be46c638d6956c55ebc38&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://24.102.209.201/weblogs/ben/\">Gnomon</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087768\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-09-26T09:56:09\">2003-09-26T09:56:09</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Why not just go the TCP/IP route - Additive Increase / Multiplicative Decrease?

    "summary": "<p>\nOkay, I may be the last person fiddling with Flash to\ndiscover this, but here&apos;s what I&apos;ve learned today:\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/support/flash/ts/documents/cant_load_jpg.htm\"><b>Flash MX hates progressive JPEGs.</b></a>\n</p>\n<p>\nFrom the above: &quot;<i>The Macromedia Flash Player does not have a\ndecompressor for progressive JPEG images, therefore files of this type\ncannot be loaded dynamically and will not display when using the\nloadMovie action.</i>&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\nThis would have been nice to know, hours ago.  Or maybe fixed in\nthe past year or so since the above linked tech note.  See, although\nI&apos;m a Jack of a lot of Trades, I don&apos;t really pay attention much\nto things like JPEGs and their progressive natures.  It wasn&apos;t\nuntil I finally started randomly clicking buttons on and off in\nMacromedia Fireworks while exporting a test JPEG that I finally\nnarrowed down the problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis was after a day worth of examining ActionScript, XML data,\nHTTP headers, and a mess of other random dead ends.  And a lot of\nlast-ditch random and exhaustive twiddling of checkboxes and\noptions.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Then</b>, once I had the words I\nwouldn&apos;t have had unless I already knew what my problem was, a Google search for\n&quot;<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=flash+progressive+jpeg&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">flash progressive jpeg</a>&quot;\ngot me all kinds of info.\n</p>\n<p>\nProblem is, the JPEGs supplied to the particular Flash app on which\nI&apos;m hacking come from a random assortment of people working through\na content management system on the backend.  They upload them\nwith a form in their browser, and this Flash app gets a URL to the\nimage via an XML doc it loads.  Me, I&apos;m probably in bed when this\nhappens.  I&apos;d love to have tested every one... er, rather, no I\nwouldn&apos;t.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo... Now I just have to figure out how to get all these people\nto start making sure that their JPEGs aren&apos;t progressive.

I&#8217;m sure that there aren&#8217;t many who wouldn&#8217;t feel the same way.  But, although a lot of us try to keep up on patches and maintain decent security, there&#8217;s the &#8220;great unwashed masses&#8221; who just want to &#8220;do email&#8220;.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;On one hand, it&amp;#8217;s easy to say, &amp;#8220;Tough.  Learn the care &amp;#38; feeding of your equipment.&amp;#8221;  Yeah, as if that will help or get any response from all the people who&amp;#8217;ve bought into &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AOL&lt;/span&gt; and have been reassured for years that computers are friendly and easy beasts (despite their intuitions to the contrary).  Hell, I&amp;#8217;d bet that, more often than not, the same person who gets regular oil changes and tune-ups for the car has no idea how to do the equivalent for a computer (or that it even needs it).  Cars have been positioned differently than computers.  No one expects a Spanish Inquisition when they live in a virtual preschool of a user interface with large and colorful buttons and happy smiling faces.  They know there&amp;#8217;s some voodoo going on underneath, but the UI tells them that it&amp;#8217;s nothing to worry about (until &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/not_working.html&quot;&gt;it isn&amp;#8217;t working&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if the problem was just that stupid users ended up with broken computers, there&amp;#8217;d be no problem.  But, like cars with problems waiting to happen (like worn down tires), their users become a hazard to others.  Unlike cars, however, the problems of stupid users&amp;#8217; computers are contagious and self-replicating: every tire blowout becomes a 1000 car pileup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like everyone sits on their recliners watching TV in their houses; not even realizing that there are doors to lock; not even hearing the intruders rummaging through the fridge in the kitchen; and certainly not knowing that there&amp;#8217;s a guy sleeping on the sofa at night working by day to let his army of clones into the neighbor&amp;#8217;s houses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, about what about vigilante &amp;#8220;white hat&amp;#8221; worms?  Wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be nice if there was a guy wandering the neighborhood locking door for the ignorant?  Wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be nice if there was a truck driver on the road that forced cars with bald tires off to the side for free tire replacement?  Okay, maybe that&amp;#8217;s a bit whacky, but then again, people with bald tires aren&amp;#8217;t causing 1000 car pileups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m thinking that &amp;#8220;white hat&amp;#8221; virii and worms are one of the only things that will work, since I&amp;#8217;m very pessimistic about the user culture changing to be more responsible.  Though, what about a compromise?  Install a service or some indicator on every network-connected machine, somewhat like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html&quot;&gt;robots.txt&lt;/a&gt; , which tells friendly robots where they&amp;#8216;re welcome and where they&amp;#8216;re not.  Set this to maximum permissiveness for white hat worms as a default.  The good guys infect, fix, and self-destruct unless this indicator tells them to stay out.  Then, all of us who want to take maintenance into our own hands can turn away the friendly assistance of white hat worms.  It&amp;#8217;s an honor system, but the white hats should be the honorable ones anyway.  The ones which ignore the no-worms-allowed indicator are hostile by definition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, then, the internet develops an immune system.  Anyone can release a white hat worm as soon as they find an exploit to be nullified, and I&amp;#8217;m sure there are lots of geeks out there who&amp;#8217;d jump at the chance to play with worms and virii in a constructive way.  And if you want to opt-out of the system, go for it.  Hell&amp;#8230;  think of this on a smaller scale as a next-gen anti-virus software.  Instead of internet-wide, just support &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;P2P&lt;/span&gt; networks between installations of your anti-virus product.  When it&amp;#8217;s time to close a hole, infect your network with a vaccinating update.

I&#8217;m sure that there aren&#8217;t many who wouldn&#8217;t feel the same way.  But, although a lot of us try to keep up on patches and maintain decent security, there&#8217;s the &#8220;great unwashed masses&#8221; who just want to &#8220;do email&#8220;.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>On one hand, it&#8217;s easy to say, &#8220;Tough.  Learn the care &#38; feeding of your equipment.&#8221;  Yeah, as if that will help or get any response from all the people who&#8217;ve bought into <span class=\"caps\">AOL</span> and have been reassured for years that computers are friendly and easy beasts (despite their intuitions to the contrary).  Hell, I&#8217;d bet that, more often than not, the same person who gets regular oil changes and tune-ups for the car has no idea how to do the equivalent for a computer (or that it even needs it).  Cars have been positioned differently than computers.  No one expects a Spanish Inquisition when they live in a virtual preschool of a user interface with large and colorful buttons and happy smiling faces.  They know there&#8217;s some voodoo going on underneath, but the UI tells them that it&#8217;s nothing to worry about (until <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/not_working.html\">it isn&#8217;t working</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Now if the problem was just that stupid users ended up with broken computers, there&#8217;d be no problem.  But, like cars with problems waiting to happen (like worn down tires), their users become a hazard to others.  Unlike cars, however, the problems of stupid users&#8217; computers are contagious and self-replicating: every tire blowout becomes a 1000 car pileup.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>It&#8217;s like everyone sits on their recliners watching TV in their houses; not even realizing that there are doors to lock; not even hearing the intruders rummaging through the fridge in the kitchen; and certainly not knowing that there&#8217;s a guy sleeping on the sofa at night working by day to let his army of clones into the neighbor&#8217;s houses.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>So, about what about vigilante &#8220;white hat&#8221; worms?  Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if there was a guy wandering the neighborhood locking door for the ignorant?  Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if there was a truck driver on the road that forced cars with bald tires off to the side for free tire replacement?  Okay, maybe that&#8217;s a bit whacky, but then again, people with bald tires aren&#8217;t causing 1000 car pileups.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I&#8217;m thinking that &#8220;white hat&#8221; virii and worms are one of the only things that will work, since I&#8217;m very pessimistic about the user culture changing to be more responsible.  Though, what about a compromise?  Install a service or some indicator on every network-connected machine, somewhat like <a href=\"http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html\">robots.txt</a> , which tells friendly robots where they&#8216;re welcome and where they&#8216;re not.  Set this to maximum permissiveness for white hat worms as a default.  The good guys infect, fix, and self-destruct unless this indicator tells them to stay out.  Then, all of us who want to take maintenance into our own hands can turn away the friendly assistance of white hat worms.  It&#8217;s an honor system, but the white hats should be the honorable ones anyway.  The ones which ignore the no-worms-allowed indicator are hostile by definition.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>So, then, the internet develops an immune system.  Anyone can release a white hat worm as soon as they find an exploit to be nullified, and I&#8217;m sure there are lots of geeks out there who&#8217;d jump at the chance to play with worms and virii in a constructive way.  And if you want to opt-out of the system, go for it.  Hell&#8230;  think of this on a smaller scale as a next-gen anti-virus software.  Instead of internet-wide, just support <span class=\"caps\">P2P</span> networks between installations of your anti-virus product.  When it&#8217;s time to close a hole, infect your network with a vaccinating update.  I doubt this would work as well as a fully open system, but might have less controversy.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s a whacky idea to a whacky problem that just might work.</p>\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=superworm\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086264\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.dme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ba95ba57f948f9de1d4a101bb84cca3a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.dme.org\">David Edmondson</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086264\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-09-05T11:23:25\">2003-09-05T11:23:25</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">How would a system tell the difference between white hat and black hat\r\nworms or virii when they arrive?

I&#x2019;m sure that there aren&#x2019;t many who wouldn&#x2019;t feel the same way.  But, although a lot of us try to keep up on patches and maintain decent security, there&#x2019;s the &#x201C;great unwashed masses&#x201D; who just want to &#x201C;do email&#x201C;.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;On one hand, it&amp;#8217;s easy to say, &amp;#8220;Tough.  Learn the care &amp;#38; feeding of your equipment.&amp;#8221;  Yeah, as if that will help or get any response from all the people who&amp;#8217;ve bought into &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AOL&lt;/span&gt; and have been reassured for years that computers are friendly and easy beasts (despite their intuitions to the contrary).  Hell, I&amp;#8217;d bet that, more often than not, the same person who gets regular oil changes and tune-ups for the car has no idea how to do the equivalent for a computer (or that it even needs it).  Cars have been positioned differently than computers.  No one expects a Spanish Inquisition when they live in a virtual preschool of a user interface with large and colorful buttons and happy smiling faces.  They know there&amp;#8217;s some voodoo going on underneath, but the UI tells them that it&amp;#8217;s nothing to worry about (until &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/not_working.html&quot;&gt;it isn&amp;#8217;t working&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if the problem was just that stupid users ended up with broken computers, there&amp;#8217;d be no problem.  But, like cars with problems waiting to happen (like worn down tires), their users become a hazard to others.  Unlike cars, however, the problems of stupid users&amp;#8217; computers are contagious and self-replicating: every tire blowout becomes a 1000 car pileup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like everyone sits on their recliners watching TV in their houses; not even realizing that there are doors to lock; not even hearing the intruders rummaging through the fridge in the kitchen; and certainly not knowing that there&amp;#8217;s a guy sleeping on the sofa at night working by day to let his army of clones into the neighbor&amp;#8217;s houses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, about what about vigilante &amp;#8220;white hat&amp;#8221; worms?  Wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be nice if there was a guy wandering the neighborhood locking door for the ignorant?  Wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be nice if there was a truck driver on the road that forced cars with bald tires off to the side for free tire replacement?  Okay, maybe that&amp;#8217;s a bit whacky, but then again, people with bald tires aren&amp;#8217;t causing 1000 car pileups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m thinking that &amp;#8220;white hat&amp;#8221; virii and worms are one of the only things that will work, since I&amp;#8217;m very pessimistic about the user culture changing to be more responsible.  Though, what about a compromise?  Install a service or some indicator on every network-connected machine, somewhat like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html&quot;&gt;robots.txt&lt;/a&gt; , which tells friendly robots where they&amp;#8216;re welcome and where they&amp;#8216;re not.  Set this to maximum permissiveness for white hat worms as a default.  The good guys infect, fix, and self-destruct unless this indicator tells them to stay out.  Then, all of us who want to take maintenance into our own hands can turn away the friendly assistance of white hat worms.  It&amp;#8217;s an honor system, but the white hats should be the honorable ones anyway.  The ones which ignore the no-worms-allowed indicator are hostile by definition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, then, the internet develops an immune system.  Anyone can release a white hat worm as soon as they find an exploit to be nullified, and I&amp;#8217;m sure there are lots of geeks out there who&amp;#8217;d jump at the chance to play with worms and virii in a constructive way.  And if you want to opt-out of the system, go for it.  Hell&amp;#8230;  think of this on a smaller scale as a next-gen anti-virus software.  Instead of internet-wide, just support &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;P2P&lt;/span&gt; networks between installations of your anti-virus product.  When it&amp;#8217;s time to close a hole, infect your network with a vaccinating update.  I doubt this would work as well as a fully open system, but might have less controversy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;#8217;s a whacky idea to a whacky problem that just might work.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n",

Because it&#39;s cheaper, and I have less disposable income these\ndays.  And, well, it seemed like fun to try another virtual server\ncompany, since I&#39;ve been looking into it so much lately.  The new\nserver has less capacity than the one I&#39;ve had at <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies\">JohnCompanies</a>, but I\nreally don&#39;t need all that much -- just a roof over my files and a\nroot password.  Well, I don&#39;t really need a root password, but it&#39;s\nnice to have so that I can tinker around with more things with fewer\nquestions asked of the management.  (For what it&#39;s worth, we&#39;re still\nusing <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies\">JohnCompanies</a> servers for hosting at my work.)\n<br /><br />\nI&#39;ve almost got this server migration thing down to a science, though,\nsince I had everything over and up in a few hours.  And that was going\nfrom a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FreeBSD\">FreeBSD</a> system to Debian Linux.  Personally, though I fully\nrespect <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FreeBSD\">FreeBSD</a> and the ports collection, I like Debian and apt-get\nso much better.  But who knows, maybe in another year, I&#39;ll be moving\nagain for the hell of it.\n<br /><br />\nI don&#39;t have much in the way of reputation for JVDS, but the management\nhas been very responsive to requests so far.  In fact, they&#39;re using\n<a href=\"http://www.bestpractical.com/rt//\" target=\"_top\">RT</a> for their support ticket\nmanagement.  Responsiveness has been one of the most impressive aspects\nof <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies\">JohnCompanies</a>, since between my personal server and the servers\nI use at work, it tends to take less than an hour to get resolution\non any problems I&#39;ve had.

Here are the steps in how I composed the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenation.com&quot;&gt;http://www.thenation.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>\n<li><a href=\"http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/tidy?docAddr=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenation.com\">http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/tidy?docAddr=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenation.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/06/webdata/xslt?xslfile=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whump.com%2Fdropbox%2Fnationrss%2Fnation.xsl&amp;xmlfile=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.w3.org%2Fcgi-bin%2Ftidy%3FdocAddr%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.thenation.com&amp;transform=Submit\">http://www.w3.org/2000/06/webdata/xslt?<br>xslfile=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whump.com%2Fdropbox%2Fnationrss%2Fnation.xsl&amp;<br>xmlfile=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.w3.org%2Fcgi-bin%2Ftidy%3F<br>docAddr%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.thenation.com&amp;transform=Submit</a></li>\n\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this doesn&amp;#8217;t work.

I imagine, had that worked, the whole process at step #3 would be producing &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;.  On my command line, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML &lt;/span&gt;Tidy works fine, so I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking of throwing together my own web interface to that program and seeing if that works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it works, this with the addition of a cache at each stage could allow for what I think is a pretty nifty, all web-based means of scraping news items from web sites.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;p&gt;What would really be nice for apps like this is a better way to express the URLs-within-URLs without escaping and escaping and escaping and...  Thinking some very lightweight scripting here, or some LISP-ish expressions would help.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n",

The time for creating Internet standards passed a decade ago. ISPs currently support email as it is today only because it was around when they started to exist. The same applies to USENET. Getting them to provide a new alternative email service to their customers is as unlikely as all ISPs running a Jabber server with accounts for each customer, or providing an Atom syndication proxy which sucks down Atom feeds and re-syndicates them to customers.\nGeeks can, of course, run their own Internet Mail 2000 servers and services, but today's average Internet user will not do this and will go on using the service provided by their ISP or free mail service of choice.\nIt's a shame, but that's how it is.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090669\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ac977ef3ec28ccaca80e5cbf6db0b1b7&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Curtis Seyfried</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090669\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-08-22T17:40:20\">2003-08-22T17:40:20</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">On first reading this concept is definetly interesting. But, a flaw becomes evident. The notification that userX wants to send an e-mail to userZ, is the same as sending e-mail. If a spammer sends me 2,000 notifications, they just as well should have sent me the e-mails.\nMostly what needs to be done is that everyone needs to have anti-virus software that updates itself everytime you logon. Invisible, built into the O/S.\nThen there should be a firewall built into every O/S.\nI have Symantec Norton anti-virus 2003 with live update. Everytime Norton upgrades its software I unfortunetly have to also, but it auotmatically updates virus lists.\nI receieved 200 SoBig e-mails with the virus attached. Not a single one got onto my PC.\nThen I run 2 opensource firewalls, along with Snort intrusion detection. The firewalls are Outpost and Sygate personal. I hardblocked entry to anything on the ports used by MSBlaster after I found out what they were in a few articles. BUT, even before I did that everytime MSBlaster would try to assault my PC both firewalls would alert me and I would set up a permenant rule denying access. This stopped it quickly.\nAdditionally, people need to kppe their O/S updated with all sp's, critical and security patches. I have Win2K pro fully updated.\nWELL, that is a lot of WORK and $$$$'s, but this is what needs to be done 1st in thisucky real world.\nTHEN, Every MS licencee, because we do not even OWN the software, well licensors are still liable for their products, no matter what the 400 page in 8pt type licence agreement says. We ALL need to demand that MS fix their shit, and ALLL sue as a class action to get the BILLIONS in CASH $$$$'s they've got in the bank. Strip Bill Gates to his underwear, then tar and feather him and run him out of town on a rail \"Only Philosophiclly of course\".\nJust like American politics, if you don't hold them accountable they'll screw you every way you let them.\nJust think if every Corporate IT and personal MS user got together and sued for damamges, even the judges hate MS.\nI run PopFile as a Spam blocker and it works Great, after a 3 month training period it's provides a consistent 94% accuracy rate. I marks my e-mail by catagory before it passes it to Eudora, then I quickly filter my inbox to matching catagory folders. Then I scan the spam titles to catch any mistakes, which I'll stop doing soon. I delete the spam and read my e-mail. I get over 200 e-mails a day, many for informational research purposes, this woks pretty well.\nCS</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090671\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=09c273bf21e69f92aa048905f94a4f21&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Martin Atkins</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090671\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-08-22T19:40:28\">2003-08-22T19:40:28</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Curtis,\nWhile spammers could still bother you with notifications, the burden is on them to serve the message to everyone who they send the notification to, or else the notification is useless.\nAt the moment Spam is essentially free to the sender, which is why it is so common.

The time for creating Internet standards passed a decade ago. ISPs currently support email as it is today only because it was around when they started to exist. The same applies to USENET. Getting them to provide a new alternative email service to their customers is as unlikely as all ISPs running a Jabber server with accounts for each customer, or providing an Atom syndication proxy which sucks down Atom feeds and re-syndicates them to customers.\r\n\r\nGeeks can, of course, run their own Internet Mail 2000 servers and services, but today's average Internet user will not do this and will go on using the service provided by their ISP or free mail service of choice.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame, but that's how it is.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090669\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ac977ef3ec28ccaca80e5cbf6db0b1b7&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Curtis Seyfried</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090669\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-08-22T17:40:20\">2003-08-22T17:40:20</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">On first reading this concept is definetly interesting. But, a flaw becomes evident. The notification that userX wants to send an e-mail to userZ, is the same as sending e-mail. If a spammer sends me 2,000 notifications, they just as well should have sent me the e-mails.\r\n\r\nMostly what needs to be done is that everyone needs to have anti-virus software that updates itself everytime you logon. Invisible, built into the O/S.\r\n\r\nThen there should be a firewall built into every O/S.\r\nI have Symantec Norton anti-virus 2003 with live update. Everytime Norton upgrades its software I unfortunetly have to also, but it auotmatically updates virus lists.\r\nI receieved 200 SoBig e-mails with the virus attached. Not a single one got onto my PC.\r\n\r\nThen I run 2 opensource firewalls, along with Snort intrusion detection. The firewalls are Outpost and Sygate personal. I hardblocked entry to anything on the ports used by MSBlaster after I found out what they were in a few articles. BUT, even before I did that everytime MSBlaster would try to assault my PC both firewalls would alert me and I would set up a permenant rule denying access. This stopped it quickly.\r\nAdditionally, people need to kppe their O/S updated with all sp's, critical and security patches. I have Win2K pro fully updated.\r\n\r\nWELL, that is a lot of WORK and $$$$'s, but this is what needs to be done 1st in thisucky real world.\r\n\r\nTHEN, Every MS licencee, because we do not even OWN the software, well licensors are still liable for their products, no matter what the 400 page in 8pt type licence agreement says. We ALL need to demand that MS fix their shit, and ALLL sue as a class action to get the BILLIONS in CASH $$$$'s they've got in the bank. Strip Bill Gates to his underwear, then tar and feather him and run him out of town on a rail \"Only Philosophiclly of course\".\r\nJust like American politics, if you don't hold them accountable they'll screw you every way you let them.\r\n\r\nJust think if every Corporate IT and personal MS user got together and sued for damamges, even the judges hate MS.\r\n\r\nI run PopFile as a Spam blocker and it works Great, after a 3 month training period it's provides a consistent 94% accuracy rate. I marks my e-mail by catagory before it passes it to Eudora, then I quickly filter my inbox to matching catagory folders. Then I scan the spam titles to catch any mistakes, which I'll stop doing soon. I delete the spam and read my e-mail. I get over 200 e-mails a day, many for informational research purposes, this woks pretty well.\r\n\r\nCS</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090671\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=09c273bf21e69f92aa048905f94a4f21&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Martin Atkins</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090671\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-08-22T19:40:28\">2003-08-22T19:40:28</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Curtis,\r\nWhile spammers could still bother you with notifications, the burden is on them to serve the message to everyone who they send the notification to, or else the notification is useless.\r\n\r\nAt the moment Spam is essentially free to the sender, which is why it is so common.

I know I&#x2019;ve been <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/syndicated_whuffie.phtml\">talking about it</a>\nfor awhile, but procrastination and being busy all round kept me from getting\nto it.  Funny thing is, when I finally got a chance to really check things out,\nthe integration was a snap.  I&#x2019;d anticipated a bit of work, but was pleasantly\nsurprised.  I doubt that any other aggregator written in\nPython would have a hard time with it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;If, that is, anyone else wants to do it.  I already knew it wasn&amp;#8217;t</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/07/linkdumps_are_like_sex\">magic pixy dust</a>\nbut I figured it might be worth a try.  I will be eating my dogfood\nfor awhile with this, but I&#x2019;m thinking already that what&#x2019;s good for spam\nmight not be so good for news aggregators.</p><p></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Srijith&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.srijith.net/trinetre/archives/2003/08/11/index.shtml#000373&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>mentions some snags in ignoring some of the semantics of a news item,\nsuch as whether a word appears in the item&#x2019;s title or information about\nthe item&#x2019;s source.  I don&#x2019;t think that this completely\napplies to how I&#x2019;m doing classification, since SpamBayes appears to\ndifferentiate between words found in email headers and the body itself.\nWhen I feed an item to SpamBayes for training and scoring, I represent\nit as something like an email message, with headers like date, subject,\nfrom, and an &#x201C;X-Link&#x201D; header for the link.  However, even with this,\nI think Srijith&#x2019;s got a point when he writes that this method will miss\na lot of available clues for classification.</p><p></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Unlike Srijith&amp;#8217;s examples, though, I&amp;#8217;m not trying to train my</code></pre>\n<p>aggregator to sift entries into any specific categories.  So far, I&#x2019;ve\nbeen trying to get it to discriminate between what I really want to\nread, and what I&#x2019;m not so interested in.  So, I figured that something\nwhich can learn the difference between spam and normal email could help.\nBut, although it&#x2019;s early, I&#x2019;m noticing a few things about the results and\nI&#x2019;ve had a few things occur to me.</p><p></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;See, in the case of ham vs spam, I really want all the ham and none of</code></pre>\n<p>the spam.  A method to differentiate between these two should be\noptimized toward one answer or the other.  SpamBayes offers &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t\nknow&#x201D; as a third answer, but it&#x2019;s not geared toward anything else\nin-between.  However, in measuring something like &#x201C;interest&#x201C;,\ninbetween answers are useful.  I want all of the interesting stuff,\nsome of the sort-of interesting stuff, and a little of the rest.</p><p></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This is also a problem for me in deciding to what I</code></pre>\n<p>should give a thumbs up and what gets the thumbs down.  Even though\nI&#x2019;ve subscribed to a little over 300 feeds, every item from each of\nthem is somewhat interesting to me.  I wouldn&#x2019;t have subscribed to the\nfeed if there wasn&#x2019;t anything of interest there, so I&#x2019;ve already\nbiased the content of what I receive.  Some items are more interesting\nthan others, but the difference between them is nowhere near the\ndifference of wanted ham vs unsolicited spam.

And, when companies I worked for paid for travel as freely as for paper clips, I made rounds at a few conferences.  I was lucky enough to meet a few other #perl regulars.  I doubt most of them remember me since they&#8216;re a fairly close-nit group, and I&#8217;d only made the one appearance, despite constantly swearing I&#8217;d make it to a <a href=\"http://www.yapc.org/America/\"><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span></a> at some point.  But I always thought it was cool as hell to actually have had a beer at the same table in Boston with authors of some of my favorite O&#8216;Reilly perl books.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;But, I got busy, stopped hanging out in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; so much, and also decided that I needed to expand my horizons and stop being so narrowly focused on one language.  I got into Java, Python, shell scripting, and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;.  I started this weblog, and I tried to purposefully keep away from Perl.  Of course, I can&amp;#8217;t stay away, because Perl code comes out of my fingertips as naturally as breathing when a problem presents itself for solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#8217;s community.  I&amp;#8217;ve yet to find a Java community as quirky and entertaining as that surrounding Perl.  Thus, Java bores me.  I use it, but it&amp;#8217;s strictly business, mostly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When what you&amp;#8216;re doing &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; strictly business, I guess that&amp;#8217;s desirable.  But when you eat, sleep, and breathe this stuff, having a group of people constantly doing clever things and being odd certainly makes it more rewarding.  It&amp;#8217;s predictability versus creativity.  To get the job done, you want solid and dependable tools.  To have fun, you want some challenge and unexpected results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, Perl and its community offers both.  I think Python might, also, but I&amp;#8217;m not as familiar there.  Java and other technologies are mostly business.  Maybe this also crosses over into the difference between IT people and CS people, and whether you&amp;#8216;re here to work or here to play and get paid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=software_and_community</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082749\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.thok.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8668a7917f70b35cb2b99bf101316468&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.thok.org\">Mark Eichin</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082749\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-08-02T16:57:52\">2003-08-02T16:57:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I found EuroPython a great way to hook into the python community, since so many of the notables (and not-so-notables) were there.

A used DLT drive (even an autoloader) doesn't run for too much on Ebay, but the tapes are pricey, ~$30 even for refurbs and you'll be lucky to get 50GB's out of them with compression turned on even using DLT-IV (since this is mpeg1/vcd expect to be closer to the 40GB limit though).\nMeanwhile, even a non-techno savvy coworker was impressed that 120GB 7200rpm hdd's were about $80 a pop now.  Very very tempting.  Look around and you might find even better bang-per-buck\nAnother interesting development, that seems a lot more tempting than Firewire and USB enclosures is eSATA (external Serial ATA).  Such as can be found at http://highpoint-tech.com/\nIt's potentially a lot faster than USB & Firewire (SATA is currently 133MB's threshold, which is basically the max of a standard 32bit 33Mhz PCI bus anyway - disks do not write anywhere near that quickly mind you), and potentially a bit cheaper too.  I haven't done the digging there, so SATA prices, a controller & enclosures might actually rule that out, but it is worth looking into.  Regardless, of nitpicking prices though it will definitely be cheaper & faster than used DLT crapola, plus in all likelihood you might need to buy a USB2 or firewire controller anyway, so getting a SATA controller instead isn't like to be much extra work, though it might be less standard (maybe buy a combo firewire & USB2 enclosure in case you need to bring it to a friend as well).\nAs an aside, you might want to contemplate using something like MPEG4 or DivX instead of mpeg1/vcd - you get much higher quality than VCD's with about the same density of data.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085099\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cb0bd3971c5ee6e566588273eb89cdc1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">nicole</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085099\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-03-29T15:30:24\">2004-03-29T15:30:24</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">so yeah i sorta was doing a search on how to record stuff from my tv to my apple powerbook. i have a dvd burner in it and stuff i just wanna know if its possible. i know what cord to get to hook up my powerbook so i can watch dvds on my tv. is that the same cord that i would use to record tv onto my powerbook? what kind of software do i need... so yeah, can this actually be done? whether i burn it on a dvd or just a cd... help! please!!</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

A used DLT drive (even an autoloader) doesn't run for too much on Ebay, but the tapes are pricey, ~$30 even for refurbs and you'll be lucky to get 50GB's out of them with compression turned on even using DLT-IV (since this is mpeg1/vcd expect to be closer to the 40GB limit though).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, even a non-techno savvy coworker was impressed that 120GB 7200rpm hdd's were about $80 a pop now.  Very very tempting.  Look around and you might find even better bang-per-buck\r\n\r\nAnother interesting development, that seems a lot more tempting than Firewire and USB enclosures is eSATA (external Serial ATA).  Such as can be found at http://highpoint-tech.com/\r\n\r\nIt's potentially a lot faster than USB & Firewire (SATA is currently 133MB's threshold, which is basically the max of a standard 32bit 33Mhz PCI bus anyway - disks do not write anywhere near that quickly mind you), and potentially a bit cheaper too.  I haven't done the digging there, so SATA prices, a controller & enclosures might actually rule that out, but it is worth looking into.  Regardless, of nitpicking prices though it will definitely be cheaper & faster than used DLT crapola, plus in all likelihood you might need to buy a USB2 or firewire controller anyway, so getting a SATA controller instead isn't like to be much extra work, though it might be less standard (maybe buy a combo firewire & USB2 enclosure in case you need to bring it to a friend as well).\r\n\r\nAs an aside, you might want to contemplate using something like MPEG4 or DivX instead of mpeg1/vcd - you get much higher quality than VCD's with about the same density of data.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085099\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cb0bd3971c5ee6e566588273eb89cdc1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">nicole</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085099\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-03-29T15:30:24\">2004-03-29T15:30:24</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">so yeah i sorta was doing a search on how to record stuff from my tv to my apple powerbook. i have a dvd burner in it and stuff i just wanna know if its possible. i know what cord to get to hook up my powerbook so i can watch dvds on my tv. is that the same cord that i would use to record tv onto my powerbook? what kind of software do i need... so yeah, can this actually be done? whether i burn it on a dvd or just a cd... help! please!!</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

    "summary": "<p>Oh and while I&apos;m writing about watching video files on my TV, I&apos;ve\nbeen thinking of getting myself a tape drive.  Sure, I&apos;ll use it to\nactually, finally, back up all the important things I have littered\naround my handful of machines.  Having established a backup routine\nat work, I&apos;ve gotten to thinking.\n<br><br>\nHow bad an idea would it be to use a tape drive to store TV shows?\nI&apos;ve been capturing them with the VCD format, which gives me around\n600MB per hour of show.  This fills up my drive pretty quickly,\nobviously.  I know I really should take sometime to revisit things and\ntry another video codec, since originally I used VCD because I burned\neverything to CD for my DVD player, but now I&apos;m streaming files to my\nPowerbook over the network which gives me a lot more flexibility in\nrecording options.\n<br><br>\nHowever, not burning to CD leaves me with a hard drive full of video\nthat I&apos;m hesitant to delete yet have no good reason to need laying around on a\nhigh speed hard drive.  But, burning all that to a spindle-worth\nof blank CDs without a Lego Mindstorms based CD-changer robot leaves\nme shuddering.  I recall reading about <a href=\"http://www.djzone.net/pg/0101/tf01001.shtml\" target=\"_top\">a DJ-bot</a>\nthat did this for playing music, and I notice <a href=\"http://ask.slashdot.org/articles/03/07/22/122253.shtml?tid=137&amp;tid=198\" target=\"_top\">via Slashdot</a> that someone with a\ndecent woodshop <a href=\"http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/tech/changer.html\" target=\"_top\">has provided plans</a>\nfor such a beast for a CD writer.  But I can&apos;t afford the Legos at\nthe present moment, and I&apos;ll only end up hurting myself working with\npower tools.\n<br><br>\nThen, I remember that high capacity tapes make backing up lots of data\neasy at work.  I know that the tape trade off is capacity and price\nfor speed of access.  But, if all I need to do is skip from one file\nto the next and only need relatively low bandwidth to stream the file\nfrom the tape, this sounds like a great way to archive video.\nDepending on the video compression, maybe I could fit a whole season\nor two of a show onto a single tape.\n<br><br>\nSeems like a good idea, though pricey.

And other than wishing that there was a 1GB memory module\nout for it and grumbling that I&apos;ve lost one of the rubber footies on\nthe bottom, I&apos;ve been extremely happy with it.\n<br><br>\nAnd just last night, I was reminded of yet another feature that&apos;s made me\nglad I got it: the included\n<a href=\"http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/71505/wo/uo52A1Y3Ktac2nzhqf9RjQrQd5i/1.3.0.5.8.3.29.13.0\" target=\"_top\">Composite/SVHS video adapter</a>.\nI&apos;d had the <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/71505/wo/uo52A1Y3Ktac2nzhqf9RjQrQd5i/1.3.0.5.8.3.22.13.0\" target=\"_top\">AV cable</a>\nfor my iBook before it, but the use of the adapter on the Powerbook\nhas a very important difference: <i>dual display mode</i>.\n<br><br>\nSee, when I connected my iBook up to my home entertainment complex,\nI got reduced resolution back on the LCD, and anything I did that went\nfull screen (ie. playing a DVD or a movie file) took over the machine.\nBut with the Powerbook, its connection to my television is just a second\ndesktop, not much different than the second monitor I use at work.\n<br><br>\nSo, while I&apos;m at home on the futon with my girlfriend, I often stream\nvideos off a PC in the next room that&apos;s been recording TV shows for\nme, and present them on this second desktop.  Most apps I use to view\nmovies, such as <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/quicktime/upgrade/\" target=\"_top\">Quicktime Pro</a>\nand <a href=\"http://www.videolan.org/\" target=\"_top\">VideoLAN</a>,\nallow me to pick a monitor for fullscreen mode. Meanwhile, the LCD on the\nPowerbook is still available for other work while we watch.\n<br><br>\nIt&apos;s just a little thing, but it&apos;s a thing that lets me get much of the\nbenefit of a dedicated\n<a href=\"http://www.digitalconnection.com/FAQ/HTPC.htm\" target=\"_top\">Home Theater PC</a> without\nhaving to buy or build a box that looks nice alongside all our\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/games_stuff.html\" target=\"_top\">video game consoles</a>.\nWhile I&apos;d still like to take on the project someday, my Powerbook does\njust fine for the display and audio end of things, while an aging Windows PC\nin the next room <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooach.html\" target=\"_top\">snags a few TV shows</a>\nfor me.\n<br><br>\nOf course, if all you want is an HTPC, the Powerbook is expensive\noverkill.  But, if you&apos;re shopping for a laptop and want some fringe\nbenefits, I think this is definitely one that doesn&apos;t get much attention.</p>\n",

They got back to me and let me in the club, which is\ndemonstrated by the skyscraper ad to the right.  So far, I seem to be on the\nroad to earning free hosting for the month, if my clickthroughs keep up,\nwhich is more than I&#39;d hoped for.  I only hope that if everyone&#39;s seeing this\nkind of performance, that Google makes some money at it and doesn&#39;t have to\ncancel the program.\n<br /><br />\nMy only complain now is this:  Can I get some ad rotation?  I&#39;m not sure what\nyou&#39;re seeing, but I&#39;ve been looking at the same 4 ads for backup solutions\nsince I first plopped the code in.  At first I thought it was neat, since\nI&#39;d been talking about backups at the time and the ads seemed an intelligent\ncomplement.  But that story&#39;s long since scrolled off the page, and nothing\nelse interesing has come up since.  Maybe this is by design, but I expect\nmy clickthroughs to stop pretty soon.\n<br /><br />\nNow, I have no ambitions to get rich quick via Google.

Maxing out laptop RAM, helps a bit too.  With mobile Athlon64's on the horizon, affordable portable 64bit computing isn't far away either.  Apple will probably have a G5 (ppc970) iteration next year along similar lines.  Meanwhile tadpole finally has a sparc(64)book that starts at $3k which is really something given their history.  Too bad not many people care about Sun hardware with AMD and IBM really pushing things in performance and price fields of late.\nLaptops seriously need something to replace cardbus, as gigabit ethernet et al need much more bandwidth.  That is why Powerbooks w/ gigE actually have the gigE controller placed in a rather nonstandard implementation manner.  Newcard is probably still two years away though.  Then again, the average desktop still only has standard 32bit 33Mhz PCI slots - so peripherals that demand extra speed haven't quite hit the mainstream yet I guess.  PCI-X and PCI Express aren't really in demand outside of server applications these days - maybe they'll continue to be of the same class of performance that ECC & SCSI have become - necessary for servers, but not really important in the commodity PC world.  Looking at the google approach, it may just be that the cheaper but OK approach is still a win over the more expensive, but better approach.\nJust like wired vs wireless; desktops will always have some advantages over laptops - particularly with regards to speed & expansion.  But the situation continues to improve for laptops too, usually - a generation's pace behind.  I don't think we're that far away from the point where people start to care more about the convenience of something rather than the reliability.  Then again, that's kind of how the mass of consumers has always been, and so we get VCR's and TV's that are cheaper to replace than to repair.\nOn the one hand I think that's great - because technology shouldn't be so expensive.  On the other hand I feel pretty adamantly that it's a myopic view of technology that leads to excess and waste.  It's great that people view computers increasingly as just another tool; but just like the world of tools - the cheap ones will rust and break quickly; adding to landfills - and a good one can last forever.  Maybe only the craftsmen care - but if they are passionate about their profession, then I think it is something that they should care about.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086017\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e24c81efad4c66a32b3146800f7963c0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">grey</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086017\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-28T20:10:45\">2003-07-28T20:10:45</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Sorry, I'm a bit hardware obessive and thought of a couple of other things that are of interest in the laptop & desktop musings.\nOne thing I've noticed increasingly in the workplace is the popularity of the PDA, I actually find it quite intriguing to see a computer (be it a laptop or desktop) set up, and right next to it - as though a pygmy imitation is some PDA in a cradle.  All the synchronization software leaves me thoroughly dissatisfied, and tends to cause many headaches (whether due to speed over a serial UART, or synchronization being all stupid and giving preference to the wrong thing at the wrong time - average users change their mind of whether the desktop or PDA is up to date, and they only configure such preferences once).  Anyway - enough of that - what seems really appealing, and not that far away is the notion of a PDAcore, that you plug into a desktop/laptop form factor.  Things like oqo.com and http://www.antelopetech.com/ are friggin brilliant in this regard - too bad that since the year+ that they've been announced, I still see none for sale.\nThat and the fact that while they're a very beefy PDA, they're an extremely poor desktop/laptop.  Ideally the docking host system would let you address faster hdd's, more RAM, possibly even a faster CPU - while putting all of the core's hardware to sleep, only relying on the hdd as a base.\nAnyway, my iteration is a pipe dream, but I think even their direction is intriguing.  Makes the client/server thing a little bit less necessary, and the PDA + Desktop thing downright foolish.\nI feel like a lot of these technologies are getting closer to where they need to be, but are still a long ways off.  Another example I've seen recently is with cell phone & PDA combos.  Quite intriguing, but they all suck.  Some PDA's seem to be good PDA's and OK cell phones - but can't send email.  Some can send email, but are crappy PDA's and mediocre cell phones.\nI could rant on and one about failed attempts at convergence (another good one to look at right now is PVR's, DVD burners and digital [satellite or cable] tuners - something that should all be rolled into one package, but even the attempts that go for two of the three tend to fail at one or both).\nMaybe it's the growing pains of nascent technology.  Maybe it's held back by corporate interests (e.g. the PVR+burner).    I tend to get the feeling that more often it's technology trying to solve problems that people have, but turning in the assignment 75% finished.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

Maxing out laptop RAM, helps a bit too.  With mobile Athlon64's on the horizon, affordable portable 64bit computing isn't far away either.  Apple will probably have a G5 (ppc970) iteration next year along similar lines.  Meanwhile tadpole finally has a sparc(64)book that starts at $3k which is really something given their history.  Too bad not many people care about Sun hardware with AMD and IBM really pushing things in performance and price fields of late.\r\n\r\nLaptops seriously need something to replace cardbus, as gigabit ethernet et al need much more bandwidth.  That is why Powerbooks w/ gigE actually have the gigE controller placed in a rather nonstandard implementation manner.  Newcard is probably still two years away though.  Then again, the average desktop still only has standard 32bit 33Mhz PCI slots - so peripherals that demand extra speed haven't quite hit the mainstream yet I guess.  PCI-X and PCI Express aren't really in demand outside of server applications these days - maybe they'll continue to be of the same class of performance that ECC & SCSI have become - necessary for servers, but not really important in the commodity PC world.  Looking at the google approach, it may just be that the cheaper but OK approach is still a win over the more expensive, but better approach.\r\n\r\nJust like wired vs wireless; desktops will always have some advantages over laptops - particularly with regards to speed & expansion.

I don't think we're that far away from the point where people start to care more about the convenience of something rather than the reliability.  Then again, that's kind of how the mass of consumers has always been, and so we get VCR's and TV's that are cheaper to replace than to repair.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand I think that's great - because technology shouldn't be so expensive.

Then, this past January, the abuse in the practice was revealed and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooodoe.html&quot;&gt;using the User-Agent header&lt;/a&gt; was recommended for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, just for the hell of it, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/21/atom_aggregator_behavior_http_level.html#c003136&quot;&gt;asked about the User-Agent header&lt;/a&gt; for use in the context over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diveintomark.org&quot;&gt;Mark&amp;#8217;s place&lt;/a&gt; to see what responses I&amp;#8217;d get.  The one that seemed most informative was from &lt;a href=&quot;http://IAwiki.net/EricScheid&quot;&gt;Eric Scheid&lt;/a&gt; as quoted above, referring me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.22&quot;&gt;the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;/1.1 spec, section 14.22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As per Eric&amp;#8217;s comment and the spec, the value of a &amp;#8220;From&amp;#8221; header &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/span&gt; be an email address, but I would think that using a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; wouldn&amp;#8217;t be &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; much an abuse of this header.  Seems like a good idea to stick either the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to a blog here, or even better, stick the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to your &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FOAF&lt;/span&gt; file here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d really like to see this get built into aggregators as an option, though not turned on by defauilt for privacy&amp;#8217;s sake.  I like the idea of leaving my name or a trail back to me at the doorstep of people whose feeds I&amp;#8217;m reading, and I like the idea of standardizing the practice as cleanly as possible.  Using the &amp;#8220;From&amp;#8221; header seems to be the best option so far, versus header abuse and User-Agent overloading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Man.  One of these days, I really have to get around to studying those specs in full, rather than just sporadically referencing them.

Then, this past January, the abuse in the practice was revealed and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooodoe.html&quot;&gt;using the User-Agent header&lt;/a&gt; was recommended for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, just for the hell of it, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/21/atom_aggregator_behavior_http_level.html#c003136&quot;&gt;asked about the User-Agent header&lt;/a&gt; for use in the context over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diveintomark.org&quot;&gt;Mark&amp;#8217;s place&lt;/a&gt; to see what responses I&amp;#8217;d get.  The one that seemed most informative was from &lt;a href=&quot;http://IAwiki.net/EricScheid&quot;&gt;Eric Scheid&lt;/a&gt; as quoted above, referring me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.22&quot;&gt;the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;/1.1 spec, section 14.22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As per Eric&amp;#8217;s comment and the spec, the value of a &amp;#8220;From&amp;#8221; header &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/span&gt; be an email address, but I would think that using a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; wouldn&amp;#8217;t be &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; much an abuse of this header.  Seems like a good idea to stick either the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to a blog here, or even better, stick the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to your &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FOAF&lt;/span&gt; file here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d really like to see this get built into aggregators as an option, though not turned on by defauilt for privacy&amp;#8217;s sake.  I like the idea of leaving my name or a trail back to me at the doorstep of people whose feeds I&amp;#8217;m reading, and I like the idea of standardizing the practice as cleanly as possible.  Using the &amp;#8220;From&amp;#8221; header seems to be the best option so far, versus header abuse and User-Agent overloading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Man.  One of these days, I really have to get around to studying those specs in full, rather than just sporadically referencing them.  Thank goodness for smart guys like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diveintomark.org&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://IAwiki.net/EricScheid&quot;&gt;Eric&lt;/a&gt; (among others) who actually take the time to read these things and try to communicate the gist to the rest of us busy developers!&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n",

    "html": "<p>For a change, I feel awake today.<br /><br />It&#39;s ironic that much of my writing in journals and much of my thought goes toward the topic of consciousness and thought itself.  I&#39;ve been studying and contemplating issues of cognition, awareness, and self for as long as I can remember.  I&#39;ve wolfed down self-help books and pop-psych in high school, went on to get a minor degree in psychology proper in college.  <br /><br />I don&#39;t use drugs to tinker with my consciousness (other than caffeine, that is), but I&#39;ve tried various more controlled forms of meditation, visualization, and introspection.  I flirted with Dianetics &amp; Scientology (but ran far, far away), employed <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671700758/0xdecafbad-20\">psycho-cybernetics</a>, got motivated by <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671791540/0xdecafbad-20\">Anthony Robbins</a>, twisted my inner eye around to see itself with the help of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465026567/0xdecafbad-20\">Douglas R. Hofstadter</a>, studied concept-formation and knowledge ala <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452010306/0xdecafbad-20\">Ayn Rand</a>, considered the multiplicity of self with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671657135/0xdecafbad-20\">Marvin Minsky</a>, and explored dreams and archetypes with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0440351839/0xdecafbad-20\">C. G. Jung</a>.  With the help of each influence, I&#39;ve been stitching together a rough manual to my mind.  Just like I&#39;ve hacked around with computing devices, I&#39;ve worked to understand and tweak my own mentality.  <br /><br />Oh, but I probably need to explain the irony: For the past few months-- likely the past few years-- I&#39;ve been suffering from <a href=\"http://www.sleepapnea.org/geninfo.html#defined\">sleep apnea</a>.  LIke my father, and his father before him, I&#39;ve developed a horrible snore and have started fighting a losing struggle with sleepiness.  My dad is known for falling asleep constantly: in the midst of conversation, while eating, while getting his haircut, while using a computer.  And lately, those have all been things that I&#39;ve begun to &quot;enjoy&quot;.  Especially bad has been my tendency to fall asleep at work, and especially dangerous has been me falling asleep whenever I have to drive for more than 10 minutes.<br /><br />This condition seems to have come upon me so gradually that it&#39;s only been recently, with the scare of losing my <i>new</i> job, and <span class='ljuser' style='white-space:nowrap;'><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=missadroit'><img src='http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif' alt='userinfo' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align:bottom;border:0;' /></a><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/users/missadroit/'><b>missadroit</b></a></span>&#39;s persistent persuasion, that I finally ackowledged the problem and sought treatment.  So, I managed to get an appointment at the <a href=\"http://www.med.umich.edu/neuro/sleep.htm\">University of Michigan Sleep Disorders Clinic</a>, where one evening at the beginning of the month I was covered with wires and sent to bed.  About a week later, they called me back to inform me that I had very severe sleep apnea, and was barely getting any sleep at all in a night with about 2-3 breathless episodes per hour.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/features_pro.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/images/exploded_humid.gif\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a>Within a few days of <i>that</i> news-- yesterday, in fact-- I was given a new toy: The <a href=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/features_pro.htm\">REMstar Pro CPAP System</a>.  After one night with the thing, my snoring is gone except for the occasional snort as I become accustomed to a breathing mask, and I feel quite a bit more rested than I have in recent memory.  I still feel a bit tired, but that&#39;s to be expected: I&#39;ve got many nights to catch up for.<br /><br />I&#39;d gone from being able to track <a href=\"http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html\">&quot;seven, plus or minus two&quot;</a> things at once down to barely one thing at a time, and that was if I didn&#39;t doze off in the middle of the task and have to rebuild the thought process when I snapped back awake.  The irony of it all is similar to something I was reminded of last week: <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/1058457401.html\">As it turns out, software needs hardware to run.</a>  So, for all my introspective experimentation on myself, and all my attention to consciousness, I&#39;ve been feeling it slipping away from me lately.  As a &quot;software&quot; guy, I can&#39;t do much with my &quot;hardware&quot;.  <br /><br />So, I&#39;m very happy that I finally-- after much denial and procrastination by me, and after much encouragement and tolerance by <span class='ljuser' style='white-space:nowrap;'><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=missadroit'><img src='http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif' alt='userinfo' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align:bottom;border:0;' /></a><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/users/missadroit/'><b>missadroit</b></a></span>-- called and started the process that ended up with me sleeping through the night again.<br /><br />And now maybe I can close my eyes and meditate without losing consciousness again.<br /><br />Now maybe I can be myself again.<br /><br />(P.S.:  Thank you, <span class='ljuser' style='white-space:nowrap;'><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=missadroit'><img src='http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif' alt='userinfo' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align:bottom;border:0;' /></a><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/users/missadroit/'><b>missadroit</b></a></span>.

But, since we have XML namespaces\nto ensure uniqueness between vocabularies, we can instead focus on a\nclear and simple name that only needs to be unique <strong>within</strong> the\nvocabulary.

Software modules need to be able to\nrecognize the tags and attributes which they are designed to process,\neven in the face of \"collisions\" occurring when markup intended for\nsome other software package uses the same element type or attribute\nname.\nThese considerations require that document constructs should have\nuniversal names, whose scope extends beyond their containing document.\nThis specification describes a mechanism, XML namespaces, which\naccomplishes this.\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xml-names-19990114/Overview.html\">Namespaces in XML</a></cite></small></div>\n<br /><br />\n<blockquote cite=\"http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-tipnamsp.html\">\nOne of the core features of XML is its ability to deal with changes in\nthe rules for data (hence the extensible in its name -- Extensible\nMarkup Language).

Sure, it might not be as pretty as Winzip, but it's a heck of a lot more scriptable and there won't be any nasty encryption incompatabilities (see http://slashdot.org/articles/03/06/10/1542216.shtml?tid=185 for some background about this).

Since the files are top secret, why not put the onus on your boss?  XP has a couple of built-in tools that will make the job easy.\nFirst, provided NTFS is utilized, he can take advantage of XP's Encrypting File System.  This will allow him to encrypt and compress his \"important data\".\nNext, assuming he has access to a dir on the \"back-up\" server, he can use XP's Backup, to schedule the backup to run once, Weekly, monthly, at system start-up or logon.\nAgain, this puts him in-control of his own data, and should eliminate the need of \"touching\" his important files. Here are a couple of links for additional information.\nEncrypting Sile System\nXP's Backup\nI hope this helps.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089306\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7a3895376100fa2a20cabab927bf35b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">David</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089306\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-08T08:54:42\">2003-07-08T08:54:42</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">He should just give you access to the contents: if you can't trust your sysadmin, you can't trust anyone.

The idea being with use of domain certificates it's possible to backup that which you cannot normally access.\nThe other quick and dirty solution is to just zip the files into a password protected archive.  Then put that archive on a folder that gets backed up.  Winzip's command-line features should make this trivial.  My XP box is out for service so I can't check and see what the XP native zip functions would offer here.  But zipped archives are probably the simplest way to approach this.  Write a vbscript, set it up as a scheduled job and let it do the grunt work of creating the archive, adding the files and then copying it to the approapriate backup location.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089311\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://fiftyfly.mine.nu\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=43f54f4e781c8374414d45c287474cac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://fiftyfly.mine.nu\">mike</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089311\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-08T14:54:26\">2003-07-08T14:54:26</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I would highly sugest not relying on ntfs' encryption : http://www.annoyances.org/exec/forum/winxp/t1037834762 .

But,\r\nunder <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a>, my knowledge of available tools and means of automation\r\nfail me.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAny hints from out there?\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=backup_question\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089289\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=468c6b5110ed4bea9c148cf736744c43&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Jim</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089289\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T14:53:01\">2003-07-07T14:53:01</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I believe the latest versions of winzip and pkzip actually have decent encryption (none of this trivially breakable stuff.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was under the impression GPG worked on Windows, and you can install cygwin to get all the other things like tar.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089292\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8bcf295bb2e23d6ee0d80710023f2b66&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Anonymous</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089292\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T15:16:44\">2003-07-07T15:16:44</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Install cygwin on the XP box, then something like:\r\ntar cf - secretdir | gpg -c > destdir/mysecretfiles.tar.gpg</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089293\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://24.102.209.201/weblogs/ben/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=588bdfdda82be46c638d6956c55ebc38&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://24.102.209.201/weblogs/ben/\">Gnomon</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089293\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T15:19:03\">2003-07-07T15:19:03</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">My Win32 survival kit necessarily contains UnxUtils (a large cross-section of the GNU fileutils ported to run natively, available at http://unxutils.sf.net) which means that you need only bother installing those tools which you'll actually use.\r\n\r\nIn this case, I'd recommend tar and bzip2, and perhaps GPG on top.

Since the files are top secret, why not put the onus on your boss?  XP has a couple of built-in tools that will make the job easy.\r\nFirst, provided NTFS is utilized, he can take advantage of XP's Encrypting File System.  This will allow him to encrypt and compress his \"important data\".\r\n\r\nNext, assuming he has access to a dir on the \"back-up\" server, he can use XP's Backup, to schedule the backup to run once, Weekly, monthly, at system start-up or logon.\r\n\r\nAgain, this puts him in-control of his own data, and should eliminate the need of \"touching\" his important files.

The idea being with use of domain certificates it's possible to backup that which you cannot normally access.\r\n\r\nThe other quick and dirty solution is to just zip the files into a password protected archive.  Then put that archive on a folder that gets backed up.  Winzip's command-line features should make this trivial.  My XP box is out for service so I can't check and see what the XP native zip functions would offer here.  But zipped archives are probably the simplest way to approach this.  Write a vbscript, set it up as a scheduled job and let it do the grunt work of creating the archive, adding the files and then copying it to the approapriate backup location.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089311\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://fiftyfly.mine.nu\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=43f54f4e781c8374414d45c287474cac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://fiftyfly.mine.nu\">mike</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089311\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-08T14:54:26\">2003-07-08T14:54:26</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I would highly sugest not relying on ntfs' encryption : http://www.annoyances.org/exec/forum/winxp/t1037834762 .

    "summary": "<p>Okay, so at my new job I&apos;m the Guy if it has a transistor in it.  I&apos;m\ndeveloper, sysadmin, and hardware jockey all in one.  This is fun\nto a certain extent, since it tests pretty much everything I know from\nA through Z.  And so far, I&apos;m doing okay.  Every now and then, though,\nI get a bit stumped.\n<br><br>\nMy most recent adventure involves developing a backup routine for the\noffice.  I just got tape backup working on a Linux box for a big\nSamba-shared directory that we all work out of.  I&apos;m currently winging\nit with <code>star</code> and <code>cpio</code> in =CRON=-scheduled scripts that manage a\n6-tape rotation for me.\n<br><br>\nFull backups on alternating tapes on Fridays,\nwith incrementals inbetween on tapes labeled by the day.  I even have\nthe server eject the tape and IM me a few times until I go change to\nthe day&apos;s tape.  Tested recovery, and though it could be smoother, it\nis at least possible at the moment.  I figure this is pretty good\nfor my first personal encounter with managing serious backup.  I plan\nto keep researching and to upgrade software at some point soon.\n<br><br>\nSo, now my boss asks me:  &quot;Hey, can you backup this other folder for me?\nI don&apos;t want to share it, though, and I don&apos;t want you to be able to\nread the files.&quot;  This folder contains some important yet sensitive\nthings like salary information and other things to which I have no\nbusiness having access.\n<br><br>\nMy stumper then, is this: How do I grab (or cause to be uploaded) a\nfolder of files for backup, say as large as 2GB, from a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> machine,\nwithout having any access myself to read the file contents.  I&apos;ll be\nable to install whatever I need on the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> machine, but the idea is\nthat, when the bits leave that machine for the Linux backup server,\nthere should be no way for me to read their contents.  But, I must be\nable to usefully backup and, in conjunction with the owner of the\nfiles, restore in case of disaster.\n<br><br>\nOh yeah, and I have no budget for software.  So, I&apos;m trying to work\nthis out using only free tools.\n<br><br>\nSo, my first though is some sort of encryption on the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> machine.\nEncrypt with GPG or something, leaving my boss with the secret key\non a floppy and the passphrase in his head.  Upload these files\nto a special folder on our shared drive, and it all gets backed up\nlike everything else.\n<br><br>\nOr, since I don&apos;t even really want to know the names or number of\nfiles in this sensitive folder, can I somehow ZIP up the whole\nshebang and encrypt that before uploading?\n<br><br>\nUnder Linux, none of this would be much of a problem to me.  But,\nunder <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a>, my knowledge of available tools and means of automation\nfail me.\n<br><br>\nAny hints from out there?</p>\n",

The formats will\ncoexist, just as <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 0.91 and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 coexist\ntoday. Furthermore, this coexistence will be transparent, just like\ntoday. Over time, necho will, hopefully, become the standard. In the\nmeantime, there will not be a major catastrophe of incompatibility...\nEventually, some of the other formats might become less used, and will\nbe phased out (this is something that is already happening, for\nexample, with the transition from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 0.91 to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0). And because,\ncurrently, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> is being almost exclusively used for updates and\nregenerated constantly at each endpoint, there will be little if any\nswitchover cost, again, as an example of this I put forward the\ntransition from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 0.91 to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 that happened last year.\n<br><br>\nObviously, it&apos;s on us, the developer community, to add necho support\nwithout disruption, and it&apos;s not a problem. After all, we are already\ndoing it today, and moving most (hopefully all) tools into necho will\neventually reduce work for developers in the future, allowing us to,\nfinally, concentrate on improving the tools rather than on how to let\nthem connect to each other.\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/002156.html\">d2r: why (not)echo is important -- part 2</a></cite></small></div>\n<br><br>\nWhen I read\n<a href=\"http://www.jarretthousenorth.com/2003/06/26.html#a2338\" target=\"_top\">Dave&apos;s post</a>\nthat developers were trying to &quot;rip up the pavement, break\neverything and start over&quot;, I wondered what he was talking about.\n(Strangely, I can&apos;t find the original posting on Dave&apos;s blog.  Maybe\n<a href=\"http://www.jarretthousenorth.com/2003/06/26.html#a2342\" target=\"_top\">the statement was revised</a>\nin the face of a later endorsement of the\nproject?)  The reason I was wondering is because nothing broke\non <strong>my</strong> desktop.  Every <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed to which I subscribed was still feeding\nme <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, and my home-brew aggregator continued crunching and delivering\nmy fix.\n<br><br>\nIn fact, my aggregator&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> consumption is based on\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/13/ultraliberal_rss_parser.html\" target=\"_top\">Mark Pilgrim&apos;s Ultra-liberal </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> parser.\nAnd, it looks like Mark&apos;s been one\nof the developers involved in the (not)Echo project.  Mark didn&apos;t\nbreak anything for me, and couldn&apos;t if he wanted to.  On the contrary,\nhe continues to offer his code, and even updated it not more than a\nmonth ago to address link-vs-guid concerns in a useful way.  Hell, even\nthough Mark <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/01/leave_rss_alone.html\" target=\"_top\">demonstrated his break with </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> tinkering rather concretely\nby implementing a very literal interpretation of the spec, I can still\ndownload\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/projects/misc/rssparser.py.txt\" target=\"_top\">his working </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> parser code.\n<br><br>\nI&apos;m a user and a developer all at once: I produce <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, I consume <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>,\nI develop with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, and yet I&apos;m watching (not)Echo with great interest\nand welcome it when it&apos;s ready.  I fully expect that, in my tinkering,\nit&apos;ll take me less than a lazy evening&apos;s work to put together a\ntemplate to publish a (not)Echo feed from my blog, and to add\n(not)Echo support to my aggregator.  Hell, I might even get another\nparser from Mr. Pilgrim to drop into my project.  But, as long as\nothers are still producing and expecting <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, I&apos;ll still accept and\noffer <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>.  No breakage here.  In fact, if I get off my lazy butt,\nI&apos;ll <a href=\"http://backend.userland.com/davesRss2PoliticalFaq#questionWhatDoesFunkyMeanInTheContextOfRss20\" target=\"_top\">unfunkify</a>\nmy own feed and upgrade it to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> 2.0 while I&apos;m at it.\nThis isn&apos;t really heavyweight stuff here.\n<br><br>\nThen, I read things like\n<a href=\"http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/06/27.html\" target=\"_top\">Jon Udell&apos;s Conversation with Mr. Safe</a>\nand other worries that the whole technology of web content syndication\nand management will be avoided by big money, or even more horribly,\nco-opted by big money in the confusion.  Has the BBC or the New York Times\nexpressed any change of heart with their decision to offer their content\nin a syndication format?  Has the basic tech stopped working?  There are no\npieces of sky on my balcony, though I fully admit that I might be too\nnaive to see them.\n<br><br>\nSee, to me, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> ain&apos;t the thing.  Content syndication and aggregation\nare the thing, and that&apos;s going strong.  Are the people with big money\ninterested in this geeky thing called <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>, or are they interested in\nsyndication and aggregation?  You know, getting their content out\nthere and read?  Do they know that this (not)Echo effort hasn&apos;t\nactually made <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>-supporting software stop working, nor will it ever?\nJust because a bunch of bloggers and tinkerers got together and decided\nto start making an alternate format and API doesn&apos;t mean that the\nexisting, mature technology suddenly goes sproing.\n<br><br>\nIn fact, unless or until this upstart (not)Echo project builds\nsomething amazing in terms of in-spec capabilities and vendor support,\nthe currently working <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>-based tech is a safe bet.  And, in fact, I&apos;d\nbe willing to bet that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> will still be a force to consider in years\nto come, even if (not)Echo introduces some irresistable pull.\nCompanies like Blogger and <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/SixApart?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">SixApart</font></span> would reveal themselves to be run\nby morons if they screwed users by dumping <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> overnight.  (And that&apos;s\nignoring the fact that <strong>someone</strong> would come along and whip something\nup to fix their idiocy somehow.)\n<br><br>\nAnd, I&apos;m sure Microsoft or some well-heeled vendor could try stepping\nin with a format of their own and try to steamroll it through with\ntheir own blogging tools and aggregation services, but you know,\nthey&apos;re not omnipotent.  The Internet didn&apos;t go away when MSN was\nintroduced, and the web full of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds won&apos;t go away even if they\nintroduce MSNBlogs or some such.

However, just looking around, I observe that\nthere are many people and organizations who seem unable to maintain a\ngood working relationship with Dave.\n<br /><br />\nI regularly get pissed-off at Dave but I really truly do think he's\ntrying to Do The Right Thing; but there are many people out there who\ncan't get past being pissed off. This is what life is like.\n<br /><br />\nThere's an uncannny echo here, for me.  The thing that came before XML\nwas called SGML. SGML was largely invented, and its landscape\ndominated, by a burly, bearded, brilliant New Yorker, Charles\nGoldfarb, who is currently making a well-deserved killing bringing out\nthe Definitive XML Series of books for Prentice-Hall.  Charles is\nloquacious, persistent, smart, loud-voiced, and nearly always gets his\nway.\n<br /><br />\nThere were a lot of people out there (still are, I guess) whom Charles\ndrives completely nuts and just won't work with him. Which is one of\nthe reasons that, when we invented XML, we felt the need to give it a\nnew name and a new acronym and so on. Mind you, Charles, who as I said\nis no dummy, climbed on board the XML bandwagon about fifteen seconds\nafter it got rolling and was a major help in getting the thing\nfinished and delivered.\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/23/SamsPie#davewiner\">ongoing: I Like Pie</a></cite></small></div>\n<br /><br />\nI'm very confused about this.  Dave (or rather, Mr Safe) says that Tim Bray\nsaid something nasty about him here.  In fact, Dave says that Tim said\nhe's all washed up, like Charles Goldfarb.\n<br /><br />\nBut as I read it, I'd love to be washed up like Charles Goldfarb,\nseeing as he's \"currently making a well-deserved killing bringing out\n... books for Prentice-Hall\", having \"climbed on board the XML bandwagon\nabout fifteen seconds after it got rolling and was a major help\nin getting the thing finished and delivered\".  Sounds like Mr. Goldfarb\nis still very active in his community, still considered an authority,\nand is being rewarded for it.  I hope I'm that kind of washed up someday.\n<br /><br />\nIn fact, it'd be pretty keen if that's what people meant if someday\nthey said, \"Les is Dead\", though I can't find where Tim said that.\n<br /><br />\nSo, where's the nastiness?  It's not like Tim took notes from\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/19/teach_me_spanish_curse_words.html\" target=\"_top\">Mark's spanish lessons</a>\nand told Dave to go \"chinga tu madre\" or \"come verga\".  That's nasty.\nFar as I can tell, Tim compared Dave to a guy in another community\nwho has his own contingent of haters yet is still undeniably a brilliant\nguy just trying to Do The Right Thing as he sees it.\n<br /><br />\nWas the nastiness in saying that some people can't \"maintain a good\nworking relationship with Dave\"?  Or that Tim gets \"regularly ...\npissed-off at Dave\"?  I mean, they're both obviously true.  It would\nhave been nasty and untrue had Tim said that <strong>no one</strong> can maintain a\ngood relationship with Dave, because there are also obviously a lot of\npeople who do.  But, Tim didn't say that.\n<br /><br />\nSo, as far as I see, I'd personally be happy to have Tim Bray write\nabout me like this in public.\n<!--more-->\nshortname=washed_up_huh\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085556\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=dc59c5ba9a8aa0a6225d9959eea3b7f3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Dave Winer</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085556\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T12:23:31\">2003-07-07T12:23:31</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Les, here's the clue: I'm not you.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085557\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=468c6b5110ed4bea9c148cf736744c43&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jim</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085557\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T14:50:09\">2003-07-07T14:50:09</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Give up on trying to find reason in Dave's little outbursts.

Mind you, Charles, who as I said\r\nis no dummy, climbed on board the XML bandwagon about fifteen seconds\r\nafter it got rolling and was a major help in getting the thing\r\nfinished and delivered.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/23/SamsPie#davewiner\">ongoing: I Like Pie</a></cite></small></div>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nI'm very confused about this.  Dave (or rather, Mr Safe) says that Tim Bray\r\nsaid something nasty about him here.  In fact, Dave says that Tim said\r\nhe's all washed up, like Charles Goldfarb.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBut as I read it, I'd love to be washed up like Charles Goldfarb,\r\nseeing as he's \"currently making a well-deserved killing bringing out\r\n... books for Prentice-Hall\", having \"climbed on board the XML bandwagon\r\nabout fifteen seconds after it got rolling and was a major help\r\nin getting the thing finished and delivered\".  Sounds like Mr. Goldfarb\r\nis still very active in his community, still considered an authority,\r\nand is being rewarded for it.  I hope I'm that kind of washed up someday.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn fact, it'd be pretty keen if that's what people meant if someday\r\nthey said, \"Les is Dead\", though I can't find where Tim said that.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo, where's the nastiness?  It's not like Tim took notes from\r\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/19/teach_me_spanish_curse_words.html\" target=\"_top\">Mark's spanish lessons</a>\r\nand told Dave to go \"chinga tu madre\" or \"come verga\".  That's nasty.\r\nFar as I can tell, Tim compared Dave to a guy in another community\r\nwho has his own contingent of haters yet is still undeniably a brilliant\r\nguy just trying to Do The Right Thing as he sees it.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWas the nastiness in saying that some people can't \"maintain a good\r\nworking relationship with Dave\"?  Or that Tim gets \"regularly ...\r\npissed-off at Dave\"?  I mean, they're both obviously true.  It would\r\nhave been nasty and untrue had Tim said that <strong>no one</strong> can maintain a\r\ngood relationship with Dave, because there are also obviously a lot of\r\npeople who do.  But, Tim didn't say that.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo, as far as I see, I'd personally be happy to have Tim Bray write\r\nabout me like this in public.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=washed_up_huh\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085556\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=dc59c5ba9a8aa0a6225d9959eea3b7f3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Dave Winer</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085556\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T12:23:31\">2003-07-07T12:23:31</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Les, here's the clue: I'm not you.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085557\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=468c6b5110ed4bea9c148cf736744c43&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Jim</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085557\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-07T14:50:09\">2003-07-07T14:50:09</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Give up on trying to find reason in Dave's little outbursts.

This is it.  This is what I want to see come next from aggregators\nand blogs and syndication and all this mess.  It's what I've been tinkering\nwith in small steps for most of a year.  It's what I intend <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger\">BookmarkBlogger</a>\nto facilitate, as well as <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a> and the homebrew aggregator I'm\nhacking around with right now.\n<br /><br />\nAt first thought, I'm not sure whether or not building and\nrepublishing <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> (or Echo) feeds is where it's at.  But, the more I think\nabout it, the more it seems perfectly elegant to me.  All the elements are\nthere, except for an extension to capture ratings.  Extend aggregators to\nconsume these rating-enriched feeds, and instead of just spooling the items\nup into your view, extract and assimilate the ratings into a growing\nmatrix of rater versus rated.  Apply all the various algorithms to\ncorrelate your rating history with that of others to whose ratings you\nsubscribe.  Mix in a little Bayes along with other machine learning.\n<br /><br />\nAs for the interface... well, that's a toughie.  At present, I think I could\nsneak ratings into my daily routine by monitoring my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger\">BookmarkBlogger</a> use and\nwatching the disclosure triangle clicks and link visits in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines\">AmphetaOutlines</a>\nbased news aggregator.  I could easily see adding an iTunes-like 5-star\nrating interface, but unless I get some pretty significant payoff from\npainstakingly rating things, I'll never use it.  At least in iTunes, I get\nto have playlists of my faves automatically jumbled together, if I remember\nto use the ratings in the moment. \n<br /><br />\nThe cool thing will be when sites like\n<a href=\"http://www.technorati.com\" target=\"_top\">Technorati</a> and <a href=\"http://www.feedster.com\" target=\"_top\">Feedster</a> start\nusing these ratings, but the even cooler thing is when all that's on\nmy desktop.  This could be easy, though, couldn't it?  What do we call\nit, Syndicated Whuffie?\n<br /><br />\n(Which reminds me:  Eventually, we really gotta get back to the subscription\nproblem.  All these agents polling files everywhere will get to be nasty.\nObviously.

Maybe you should just give a +1 to any item and/or feed that you click through in the aggregator to view in the parent website. this is much more likely to generate meaningful metadata than relying on human  rating. \nRe. Republishing feeds, I already republish RSS for the composite topics on Ecademy. eg \nWiFi weblogs = \nhttp://wifi.ecademy.com/module.php?mod=import&op=rssbundle&id=14\nInterestingly, I read the feed into a database cleaning it up in the process.

side effect of \"normal\" behaviour. Maybe you should just give a +1 to any item and/or feed that you click through in the aggregator to view in the parent website. this is much more likely to generate meaningful metadata than relying on human  rating. \r\n\r\nRe. Republishing feeds, I already republish RSS for the composite topics on Ecademy. eg \r\nWiFi weblogs = \r\nhttp://wifi.ecademy.com/module.php?mod=import&op=rssbundle&id=14\r\n\r\nInterestingly, I read the feed into a database cleaning it up in the process. The re-published feed is read out of the database so the items are not necessarily what went in.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086975\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5a70d939a73fa73603f2a9255ab81d21&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">BillSeitz</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086975\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-03T11:34:30\">2003-07-03T11:34:30</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I'm with Julian.

Aggregators could\nthen /use/ redundant items from feedback loops because each <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> source\nhas a reputation rating that weights the contained individual item\nranking; repeated items add their rankings.\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://www.teledyn.com/mt/archives/001055.html\">TeledyN: Echos of </a><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a></cite></small></div>\n<br><br>\nYes.  This is it.  This is what I want to see come next from aggregators\nand blogs and syndication and all this mess.  It&apos;s what I&apos;ve been tinkering\nwith in small steps for most of a year.

But, the more I think\nabout it, the more it seems perfectly elegant to me.  All the elements are\nthere, except for an extension to capture ratings.  Extend aggregators to\nconsume these rating-enriched feeds, and instead of just spooling the items\nup into your view, extract and assimilate the ratings into a growing\nmatrix of rater versus rated.  Apply all the various algorithms to\ncorrelate your rating history with that of others to whose ratings you\nsubscribe.  Mix in a little Bayes along with other machine learning.\n<br><br>\nAs for the interface... well, that&apos;s a toughie.

I think it&#39;s the right tool for a broad\nrange of jobs.  But, after having studied the spec, and after having implemented it in a handful\nof languages for a handful of well-used apps, I think the spec needs just a bit of fixing.\n<br /><br />\nIn particular, the spec needs a tweak with regards to this &quot;ASCII limitation&quot;.  There is confusion\nabout this, period.  I&#39;ve had to hash this out with clients before, this \n<a href=\"http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=WikiRPCInterfaceUTF8VsBase64\" target=\"_top\">was an issue of note</a> while\nworking out an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\" target=\"_top\">XML-RPC based Wiki API</a>,\nand it&#39;s obviously an issue in many other projects.  This, of course, includes the current\n<a href=\"http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/06/why_we_need_ech.shtml\" target=\"_top\">hubbub surrounding weblog APIs and whatnot</a>.\n<br /><br />\nSo, please fix the spec.  It shouldn&#39;t take long to make this issue a non-issue by some simple\nclarification in the main <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> to which everyone refers.\n<br /><br />\nYes, I know there&#39;s a bit of clarification at the end of the spec, involving escaping (\n<a href=\"http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/28/Learning\" target=\"_top\">not encoding</a>) &lt; and &amp; along\nwith the statement that &quot;A string can be used to encode binary data.&quot;<br><br /><br />\nWell, yeah, I do that\nall the time with <a href=\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/base64/rfc1341.html\" target=\"_top\">Base64</a>.  And, since\nthe spec earlier had called for &quot;ASCII&quot;, I assume that&#39;s what <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=encoding\" target=\"_top\">encoding</a>\nbinary data means in the context of this spec.  To me, encoding implies a transformation \nfrom original form to some other form later requiring decoding.\n<br /><br />\nBut, apparently, my interpretation and \n<a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1498.html#c1056921193\" target=\"_top\">the interpretation of others</a>\nis wrong on that score.  But still, I&#39;ve been confused, and so have others.  Consider this a bug report.\n<br /><br />\nI&#39;ve been referred <a href=\"http://www.effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-ascii.htm\" target=\"_top\">by Fredrik Lundh</a> (<a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/06/29#When:6:21:27AM\" target=\"_top\">via Dave Winer</a>), \nto &quot;private conversations&quot;,\n&quot;various public fora&quot;, and &quot;early archives for the XML-RPC mailing list&quot;.  And, again by Fredrik Lundh,\n<a href=\"http://www.effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-ascii.htm\" target=\"_top\">I&#39;m told</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><i>But even if you don't know all this, it's not that hard to figure it out for\nyourself. Just make sure you read and digest the entire specification, apply some common sense\nto sort out the contradictions, and you'll find that it's pretty obvious that the intent is that\nyou can use any character allowed by XML.</i></blockquote>\n<br /><br />\nWell, let's see.  I read the whole spec, more than once, and what I figured out for myself with my \n\"common sense\" is what I wrote above.  I thought\nthe spec called for ASCII (as in: <a href=\"http://www.asciitable.com/\" target=\"_top\">ASCII</a>), and assumed that\nencoding binary data called for something like Base64.  Yes, I realize that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> is XML, but\nwhen a spec calls for ASCII as a particular part, I assume that there's a reason for it\nsince that's what the specification specified.  \n<br /><br />\nIn my experience, specifications are not about common sense, figuring it out, and\n<a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=connotation\" target=\"_top\">connotation</a>.  Specifications are\nabout declaration, clarity, and \n<a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=denotation\" target=\"_top\">denotation</a>.  \n<br /><br />\nYes, I understand that no\nspec is perfect, and that many are steaming piles meeting none of the criteria I just mentioned,\nbut that doesn't alter the goal.  A spec can always be made better by revising \nwith these things in mind, given the input of consumers of the spec.  This is what a process\nof communication is all about, and specifications are intended as a form of communication.\n<br /><br />\nSo, instead of talking about <i>intent</i> and things that have been talked about somewhere\nat some time, with the implication that I should just go off and search for these things, can \nwe just get a clarifying fix to the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> spec?  I don't want to send my clients off to \nmailing list and discussion archives, or present <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> with any corrections or caveats.  I\nwant to say, as I have been, \"Here, go to xmlrpc.com, read the spec, implement to the API\nI emailed you, and get back to me.\"  Only, it'd be nice if the first question is about my API, \nnot about character encoding.\n<br /><br />\nI've been confused, and so have others.  I consider myself a smart person, and I consider most\nof the others who have been confused as even smarter.  I apologize if my \"common sense\" is of a\ndifferent sort, but that's what you have to deal with in the world of people.  As young as I am,\neven I've discovered this already.\n<br /><br />\nSo, can we just get a clarifying revision of the spec?  And if not, why not?\n<br /><br />\n<b>Update:</b> Rock on.

    "summary": "<p>I&apos;ve written before that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooccb.html\" target=\"_top\">I love XML-RPC</a>, and\nthat it has served me well in the past couple of years.  I think it&apos;s the right tool for a broad\nrange of jobs.  But, after having studied the spec, and after having implemented it in a handful\nof languages for a handful of well-used apps, I think the spec needs just a bit of fixing.\n<br><br>\nIn particular, the spec needs a tweak with regards to this &quot;ASCII limitation&quot;.  There is confusion\nabout this, period.  I&apos;ve had to hash this out with clients before, this \n<a href=\"http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=WikiRPCInterfaceUTF8VsBase64\" target=\"_top\">was an issue of note</a> while\nworking out an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\" target=\"_top\">XML-RPC based Wiki API</a>,\nand it&apos;s obviously an issue in many other projects.  This, of course, includes the current\n<a href=\"http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/06/why_we_need_ech.shtml\" target=\"_top\">hubbub surrounding weblog APIs and whatnot</a>.\n<br><br>\nSo, please fix the spec.  It shouldn&apos;t take long to make this issue a non-issue by some simple\nclarification in the main <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> to which everyone refers.\n<br><br>\nYes, I know there&apos;s a bit of clarification at the end of the spec, involving escaping (\n<a href=\"http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/28/Learning\" target=\"_top\">not encoding</a>) &lt; and &amp; along\nwith the statement that &quot;A string can be used to encode binary data.&quot;<br><br><br>\nWell, yeah, I do that\nall the time with <a href=\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/base64/rfc1341.html\" target=\"_top\">Base64</a>.  And, since\nthe spec earlier had called for &quot;ASCII&quot;, I assume that&apos;s what <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=encoding\" target=\"_top\">encoding</a>\nbinary data means in the context of this spec.  To me, encoding implies a transformation \nfrom original form to some other form later requiring decoding.\n<br><br>\nBut, apparently, my interpretation and \n<a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1498.html#c1056921193\" target=\"_top\">the interpretation of others</a>\nis wrong on that score.  But still, I&apos;ve been confused, and so have others.  Consider this a bug report.\n<br><br>\nI&apos;ve been referred <a href=\"http://www.effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-ascii.htm\" target=\"_top\">by Fredrik Lundh</a> (<a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/06/29#When:6:21:27AM\" target=\"_top\">via Dave Winer</a>), \nto &quot;private conversations&quot;,\n&quot;various public fora&quot;, and &quot;early archives for the XML-RPC mailing list&quot;.  And, again by Fredrik Lundh,\n<a href=\"http://www.effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-ascii.htm\" target=\"_top\">I&apos;m told</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><i>But even if you don&apos;t know all this, it&apos;s not that hard to figure it out for\nyourself. Just make sure you read and digest the entire specification, apply some common sense\nto sort out the contradictions, and you&apos;ll find that it&apos;s pretty obvious that the intent is that\nyou can use any character allowed by XML.</i></blockquote>\n<br><br>\nWell, let&apos;s see.  I read the whole spec, more than once, and what I figured out for myself with my \n&quot;common sense&quot; is what I wrote above.  I thought\nthe spec called for ASCII (as in: <a href=\"http://www.asciitable.com/\" target=\"_top\">ASCII</a>), and assumed that\nencoding binary data called for something like Base64.  Yes, I realize that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> is XML, but\nwhen a spec calls for ASCII as a particular part, I assume that there&apos;s a reason for it\nsince that&apos;s what the specification specified.  \n<br><br>\nIn my experience, specifications are not about common sense, figuring it out, and\n<a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=connotation\" target=\"_top\">connotation</a>.  Specifications are\nabout declaration, clarity, and \n<a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=denotation\" target=\"_top\">denotation</a>.  \n<br><br>\nYes, I understand that no\nspec is perfect, and that many are steaming piles meeting none of the criteria I just mentioned,\nbut that doesn&apos;t alter the goal.  A spec can always be made better by revising \nwith these things in mind, given the input of consumers of the spec.  This is what a process\nof communication is all about, and specifications are intended as a form of communication.\n<br><br>\nSo, instead of talking about <i>intent</i> and things that have been talked about somewhere\nat some time, with the implication that I should just go off and search for these things, can \nwe just get a clarifying fix to the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> spec?  I don&apos;t want to send my clients off to \nmailing list and discussion archives, or present <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> with any corrections or caveats.  I\nwant to say, as I have been, &quot;Here, go to xmlrpc.com, read the spec, implement to the API\nI emailed you, and get back to me.&quot;  Only, it&apos;d be nice if the first question is about my API, \nnot about character encoding.\n<br><br>\nI&apos;ve been confused, and so have others.  I consider myself a smart person, and I consider most\nof the others who have been confused as even smarter.  I apologize if my &quot;common sense&quot; is of a\ndifferent sort, but that&apos;s what you have to deal with in the world of people.  As young as I am,\neven I&apos;ve discovered this already.\n<br><br>\nSo, can we just get a clarifying revision of the spec?  And if not, why not?\n<br><br>\n<b>Update:</b> Rock on.  After <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1498.html#c1056890028\" target=\"_top\">catching up</a> \non a bit of banter over at <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1498.htm\" target=\"_top\">Sam&apos;s place</a>, I see that\nthe same Fredrik Lundh I quoted before has already begun an\n<a href=\"http://effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-errata.htm\" target=\"_top\">XML-RPC errata</a> page with the goal of clarification.\n(I just missed it in my daily reading thus far.)  As \n<a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1498.html#c1056904400\" target=\"_top\">Mark comments</a>, I fear bumps in the\nroad as any confused implementors find things weren&apos;t what they thought, but I&apos;m happy to see\nthe clarification accepted.\n<br><br>\n<b>Update again:</b> If you&apos;ve stopped rocking, resume.  Dave Winer \n<a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/06/30#When:11:41:21AM\" target=\"_top\">updated the XML-RPC spec</a>.\nIt was a small change, could have been more, but had not been done at all until now.  I\ndoubt that my asking please really had much to do with it, but I couldn&apos;t guess that it \nhurt.  Thanks!\n",

A developer of an aggregator needs to know that if they see a guid and !(isPermalink=\"false\") then that's the permalink, and if the link !== the guid, then it's a separate outbound link. What a producer of a feed needs to know is that they have the option of using link to point to what they are talking about, not themselves, and if they also want to point to themselves they should use guid. But the talk about only using guid for permalink, and omitting link if you don't want to use it for an outside link, is just flat out crazy. If you don't want to do an outside link, then by using link for the permalink you have a feed that will work with every aggregator written since 0.90. If you use guid and omit link, you have a feed that will work with some but not all aggregators written or rewritten since last fall. That's not just crazy, it's completely the opposite approach to the \"backward compatibility no matter what the cost\" way that Dave has always done RSS development. I just flat out don't understand why he would say that link SHOULD NOT be used for a weblog permalink.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090510\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090510\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-06-27T08:15:24\">2003-06-27T08:15:24</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Phil:  Yikes, that's an amazingly good point.

A developer of an aggregator needs to know that if they see a guid and !(isPermalink=\"false\") then that's the permalink, and if the link !== the guid, then it's a separate outbound link. What a producer of a feed needs to know is that they have the option of using link to point to what they are talking about, not themselves, and if they also want to point to themselves they should use guid. But the talk about only using guid for permalink, and omitting link if you don't want to use it for an outside link, is just flat out crazy. If you don't want to do an outside link, then by using link for the permalink you have a feed that will work with every aggregator written since 0.90. If you use guid and omit link, you have a feed that will work with some but not all aggregators written or rewritten since last fall. That's not just crazy, it's completely the opposite approach to the \"backward compatibility no matter what the cost\" way that Dave has always done RSS development. I just flat out don't understand why he would say that link SHOULD NOT be used for a weblog permalink.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090510\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090510\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-06-27T08:15:24\">2003-06-27T08:15:24</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Phil:  Yikes, that's an amazingly good point.

Most of the major resistance to the Echo Project going on over at Sam's call on backward compatibility and \"tearing up the pavement\" on the existing installed base, but they're just suggesting a new common framework for people to take or leave.

This past post about GUIDs and\ntheir properties of rocking in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> hadn&apos;t had much thought behind it, other\nthan that the idea of having <strong>something</strong> well defined and uncontestably intended\nfor the use or uniquely identifying a weblog post seems like a good idea,\nespecially if it&apos;s a permalink.  Because, you know, permalinks seem great things\nto serve as both globally unique identifier and locator in one go.\n<br><br>\nI had a feeling that I was confused about the purpose of the link element in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>\n2.0, but having not really studied the spec, I just kept to maintaining a student\nmind and assumed that there were Things Not Yet Understood.

Cool\nby me, I assume that I am not yet well informed.  So, I read in the\nspec, where assumedly I&apos;ll be illuminated as to its designed purpose,\nthat link is &quot;The URL of the item&quot;.

I used to think that that was what the link of an RSS item should be, but then I never really maintained a weblog in the quote-link-comment style for long stretches.\" Are you sure you've got that the right way round? I also agree that the link should be the permalink is at all possible, and I prefer that to link being the URL of some external article mentioned in the text of description.

I say this because there exist weblog entries in this style, a point that Dave Winer has reiterated many times and that I just understood recently.\nSo, what I say is this:  Use the GUID to identify at your entry, in all cases, preferrably by permalink.  Only use the link tag if your entry happens to be mainly a comment on some other resource, and use the link tag to point at it.  \nI'd *actually* wished that things worked out such that link points to the entry, and links under discussion remain in the description or body of the entry.  But since there's a disagreement over it, I'd just as soon give up the link tag to link bloggers and assume the GUID tag for permalinks and have done with it.\nThis makes sense to me as a way to clear up the variations from blog to blog - right now, I'm never quite sure where I'll end up when I click on the link in my aggregator.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085019\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.seizethedave.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=82d457ebf5b4b9dc0a17c8cf4f32d92f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.seizethedave.com/\">seizethedave</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085019\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-01T15:01:14\">2003-07-01T15:01:14</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">So, it's just talking about a unique identifier such as the URL to the post, not the 32-bit {4A4DBF1F-81D8-4063-AE33-F6D1F942BB13} GUID MS cooked up?</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

I also agree that the link should be the permalink is at all possible, and I prefer that to link being the URL of some external article mentioned in the text of description.

I say this because there exist weblog entries in this style, a point that Dave Winer has reiterated many times and that I just understood recently.\r\n\r\nSo, what I say is this:  Use the GUID to identify at your entry, in all cases, preferrably by permalink.  Only use the link tag if your entry happens to be mainly a comment on some other resource, and use the link tag to point at it.  \r\n\r\nI'd *actually* wished that things worked out such that link points to the entry, and links under discussion remain in the description or body of the entry.  But since there's a disagreement over it, I'd just as soon give up the link tag to link bloggers and assume the GUID tag for permalinks and have done with it.\r\n\r\nThis makes sense to me as a way to clear up the variations from blog to blog - right now, I'm never quite sure where I'll end up when I click on the link in my aggregator.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085019\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.seizethedave.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=82d457ebf5b4b9dc0a17c8cf4f32d92f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.seizethedave.com/\">seizethedave</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085019\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-01T15:01:14\">2003-07-01T15:01:14</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">So, it's just talking about a unique identifier such as the URL to the post, not the 32-bit {4A4DBF1F-81D8-4063-AE33-F6D1F942BB13} GUID MS cooked up?</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

I&#39;ve been meaning\nto write something for <a href=\"http://www.kalsey.com/2003/05/newly_digital/\" target=\"_top\">Newly Digital</a>,\nso here goes:\n<br /><br />\nMy history with computers starts a few years earlier than 1983,\nthough.  I think it was during the first grade, when I was a hyper,\neasily bored kid.  I would get class work done quickly and early, yet\nforget to turn it in.  Then, I would disrupt class until I was somehow\ncalmed down or sent to the principal.  I seem to remember that, once,\nI was caught scaling a classroom wall via the curtains.  How far I\nmade if before being caught, I&#39;m not sure, but it seemed like miles\nto me at the time.  I remember being the only one happy about it.\n<br /><br />\nOne day though, the usual trip to the principal changed.  I remember\nhim as a tall, bald, and imposing man whose breath always smelled\nfunny.  (This was long, long before I knew about coffee and had become\nhopelessly addicted myself.)  The man scared me, since he was known\nhave spanked students in the old days, and though he wasn&#39;t allowed to\ndo that anymore he still had the power to call my Mom.  And I&#39;m pretty\nsure most everyone knows the little-kid terror of that.\n<br /><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=460\"><img src=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/atari_800.jpg\" width=\"175\" height=\"123\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"/></a>\nThis particular visit, though, he led me back into his office, and sat\nme down in front of an\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=460\" target=\"_top\">Atari 800</a>\nand a TV screen.  Though I had\nalready been introduced to video games via our Atari 2600 at home, I\nhad little idea what this thing was.\n<br /><br />\nHe showed me how to turn everything on, and introduced me to a stack\nof workbooks as tall as I was.  Each book was about 1/4&quot; thick and the\ncover colors were a rainbow of progressive difficulty.  He told me\nthat he was trying to decide whether or not to start teaching\ncomputers in the school, and that these books were what the company\nsent him for classes.  He wanted me to try them out for him and see\nwhat I could do with the computer before he bought more for the\nschool.\n<br /><br />\nFrom then on, when my class work was done, I had a pass to go to the\nprincipal&#39;s office and work through the books with the computer until\neither I ran out of books or the year ended.  I worked mostly on my\nown, with a heavy sense that it was something special I&#39;d been trusted\nwith.  As the principal went about his daily work, I was barely\nsupervised with this expensive machine, and I felt I needed to prove I\nwas worth it.\n<br /><br />\n<img src=\"http://www.futurecast.com/futurechronicles/images/y2k.gif\" width=\"79\" height=\"75\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\" />\nMy grades and my behavior improved as I tore through the workbooks in\nhis office.  There was so much to learn and play with.  I remember\nwith unusual clarity writing a program that asked me for my birthday\nand replied with my age in the year 2000.  It dazzled me that\nsomething I programmed into the computer could tell me about myself,\nall grown up, in the twenty-first century.  You know, the year when\nall science fiction stories came true!  But there I was, playing with\nthe stuff of sci-fi already.\n<br /><br />\nAnd the greatest thing, as the books began to ask more creativity and\noriginality from me in my assignments, I felt my mind stretch.  I&#39;d\nnever quite felt that before, and it was so amazing.  Part of it was,\nI&#39;m sure, just a property of the elasticity of the brain at that age,\nbut I&#39;m sure my time at the computer helped.  Every day, I remembered\nand could do more.  My thoughts were becoming more ordered and\norganized, as programming the computer required it.\n<br /><br />\nBut, after a few months, observing my obvious enthusiasm for the work,\nthe principal took me out of his experiment.  I was disappointed but\nhe told me that he&#39;d decided to build a computer lab and turn what I&#39;d\nbeen doing into a real class for everyone in the school.  I crossed my\nfingers: There were still plenty of books left to get through, and I\nwas just getting to the fun things like graphics and sound.\n<br /><br />\nWhen the school&#39;s little computer lab was finally opened, all the kids\ngot sorted into groups of five or so, and each rotated through a\nweekly schedule of hour-long visits.  When my group&#39;s turn came, I was\ncrushed: I found that there were no assignments, just Pac Man and\nMissile Command and a smattering of math and vocabulary games.  We\nwere handed joysticks and told not to touch anything else.\n<br /><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=76\"><img src=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/atari_400.jpg\" width=\"175\" height=\"138\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"/></a>\nThese machines were <a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=76\" target=\"_top\">Atari 400</a>&#39;s \nand looked so much less advanced than what I&#39;d been used to.  I\nremember there being an intense nervous aura radiating from the\nsupervising teacher on duty in the lab, just waiting for one of us to\ndestroy these things.  And, when I asked if I could have a BASIC\ncartridge to work on some of my programs, I told that if I didn&#39;t\nwant to participate in the computer activities I could just go back to\nclass.  As bitter as a first or second grader could be, I was.\n<br /><br />\nSee, I&#39;d gotten teased a bit for the special treatment in the\nbeginning, but I didn&#39;t mind.  And, now that everyone played with the\ncomputers, I got teased for not being so special anymore.  What I\ncouldn&#39;t get across to anyone, not even my teachers, was that they\nweren&#39;t getting what I had.  There was so much more they could have.\nWell, I&#39;m not sure my thoughts were so mature at the time, but I felt\nlike everyone, including me, had been cheated.\n<br /><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/\"><img src=\"http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/TN_basicgames.JPG\" width=\"97\" height=\"128\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"/></a>\nSo that ended my education in hands-on programming, temporarily.  I took to\nreading more computer books, often bought from the school book fair,\nlike David Ahl&#39;s\n<a href=\"http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/\" target=\"_top\">BASIC Computer Games</a>.\nLacking a computer of my own, I read and ran though the\nprograms in my head.\n<br /><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=18\"><img src=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/tandy_trs80-model3_1.jpg\" width=\"120\" height=\"105\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"/></a>\nFor the next year or so, I had sporadic access to computers.  My Uncle had a\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=18\" target=\"_top\">TRS 80 Model III</a>\nthat he let me use during visits.  That thing mostly\nconfused me though, as I was introduced for the first time to an\nalternate flavor of BASIC.  And still, there was the not-mine feeling\nand my Uncle&#39;s protectiveness of his expensive business machine.\nMy grandparents also had a\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=252\" target=\"_top\">VIC-20</a>,\nbut sans tape drive or hard drive, so every visit was starting over\nfrom scratch.  Nothing would substitute for what I&#39;d had: My own time\nwith the machine, doing things myself, building one thing atop another.\n<br /><br />\nThen, the\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=98\" target=\"_top\">Commodore 64</a>\narrived at the local K-Mart.  I was in love.  This was it for me, and\nI raved about it constantly.  I never quite expected to get one,\nthough, since the thing was expensive, especially for a kid my age.  And\nbesides, computers were always something that someone else had.  But I\nguess I must&#39;ve really gotten on Santa&#39;s good side, because I was met\nwith this surprise on Christmas morning that year:\n<br /><br /></p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog-images/first-c64.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog-images/first-c64-sm.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" /></a></div>\n<br /><br />\nThat first computer was really something.  It was mine, given to me by\nmy family as a whole.  No one protecting it from me, fearing I'd break\nit.\n<br /><br />\nSo I attacked it.  I learned everything about it, buried myself in\nbooks and magazines, figured out how every bit of it worked and could\nbe used.  More than once, I'd gone at it with a screwdriver to see\nwhat was inside.  Then I went at it with a soldering iron to add\nthings like a reset switch and RCA audio output.  I made friends with\npeople at a local computer store, and they let me be a guinea pig to\ntest new software and hardware for the thing.  At one point in fourth\ngrade, I learned 6502 assembly, printed out a disassembly of the\nmachine's kernel, and mapped out what everything did.  I still have\nthat print-out, bound with rubber cement, and full of my scrawlings.\n<br /><br />\nThat Commodore 64 would be my gateway to all sorts of further hackery\nand geekery, as well as a means of meeting more of my kind.  After\ngetting a modem, it became my entry point to local (and not-so-local)\nbulletin boards, and eventually my first tastes of the Internet.  I\nwas still using that Commodore 64 up until my last year of High\nSchool, coincidentally the year of the machine's last production\nrun.\n<br /><br />\nI've had other computers since that Commodore 64, but it was opening\nthat box on Christmas Morning that let me continue the process that my\nElementary School principal had started for me, and I haven't stopped\nsince.  I love to feel my mind stretch, and I love to take things\napart and see what's inside.\n<!--more-->\nshortname=newly_digital\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082790\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://stevenf.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ae2c0b2d1d3219cac5409a77a1c99fb2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://stevenf.com/\">stevenf</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082790\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-06-11T21:04:17\">2003-06-11T21:04:17</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">David Ahl's BASIC Computer Games!

As bitter as a first or second grader could be, I was.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSee, I'd gotten teased a bit for the special treatment in the\r\nbeginning, but I didn't mind.  And, now that everyone played with the\r\ncomputers, I got teased for not being so special anymore.  What I\r\ncouldn't get across to anyone, not even my teachers, was that they\r\nweren't getting what I had.  There was so much more they could have.\r\nWell, I'm not sure my thoughts were so mature at the time, but I felt\r\nlike everyone, including me, had been cheated.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/\"><img src=\"http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/TN_basicgames.JPG\" width=\"97\" height=\"128\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"/></a>\r\nSo that ended my education in hands-on programming, temporarily.  I took to\r\nreading more computer books, often bought from the school book fair,\r\nlike David Ahl's\r\n<a href=\"http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/\" target=\"_top\">BASIC Computer Games</a>.\r\nLacking a computer of my own, I read and ran though the\r\nprograms in my head.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=18\"><img src=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/tandy_trs80-model3_1.jpg\" width=\"120\" height=\"105\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"/></a>\r\nFor the next year or so, I had sporadic access to computers.  My Uncle had a\r\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=18\" target=\"_top\">TRS 80 Model III</a>\r\nthat he let me use during visits.  That thing mostly\r\nconfused me though, as I was introduced for the first time to an\r\nalternate flavor of BASIC.  And still, there was the not-mine feeling\r\nand my Uncle's protectiveness of his expensive business machine.\r\nMy grandparents also had a\r\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=252\" target=\"_top\">VIC-20</a>,\r\nbut sans tape drive or hard drive, so every visit was starting over\r\nfrom scratch.  Nothing would substitute for what I'd had: My own time\r\nwith the machine, doing things myself, building one thing atop another.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThen, the\r\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=98\" target=\"_top\">Commodore 64</a>\r\narrived at the local K-Mart.  I was in love.  This was it for me, and\r\nI raved about it constantly.  I never quite expected to get one,\r\nthough, since the thing was expensive, especially for a kid my age.  And\r\nbesides, computers were always something that someone else had.  But I\r\nguess I must've really gotten on Santa's good side, because I was met\r\nwith this surprise on Christmas morning that year:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog-images/first-c64.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog-images/first-c64-sm.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" /></a></div>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThat first computer was really something.  It was mine, given to me by\r\nmy family as a whole.  No one protecting it from me, fearing I'd break\r\nit.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo I attacked it.  I learned everything about it, buried myself in\r\nbooks and magazines, figured out how every bit of it worked and could\r\nbe used.  More than once, I'd gone at it with a screwdriver to see\r\nwhat was inside.  Then I went at it with a soldering iron to add\r\nthings like a reset switch and RCA audio output.  I made friends with\r\npeople at a local computer store, and they let me be a guinea pig to\r\ntest new software and hardware for the thing.  At one point in fourth\r\ngrade, I learned 6502 assembly, printed out a disassembly of the\r\nmachine's kernel, and mapped out what everything did.  I still have\r\nthat print-out, bound with rubber cement, and full of my scrawlings.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThat Commodore 64 would be my gateway to all sorts of further hackery\r\nand geekery, as well as a means of meeting more of my kind.  After\r\ngetting a modem, it became my entry point to local (and not-so-local)\r\nbulletin boards, and eventually my first tastes of the Internet.  I\r\nwas still using that Commodore 64 up until my last year of High\r\nSchool, coincidentally the year of the machine's last production\r\nrun.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nI've had other computers since that Commodore 64, but it was opening\r\nthat box on Christmas Morning that let me continue the process that my\r\nElementary School principal had started for me, and I haven't stopped\r\nsince.  I love to feel my mind stretch, and I love to take things\r\napart and see what's inside.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=newly_digital\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082790\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://stevenf.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ae2c0b2d1d3219cac5409a77a1c99fb2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://stevenf.com/\">stevenf</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082790\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-06-11T21:04:17\">2003-06-11T21:04:17</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">David Ahl's BASIC Computer Games!

    "summary": "<p>I caught <a href=\"http://gizmodo.net/archives/002242.php#002242\" target=\"_top\">Gizmodo 1983</a> this week,\nalong with <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/06/09/television.visitors.reut/index.html\" target=\"_top\">the news</a>\nthat NBC may be revisiting the old 1983 scifi series &quot;V&quot;, and I was reminded that that\nwas right around the time I got my first computer.  I&apos;ve been meaning\nto write something for <a href=\"http://www.kalsey.com/2003/05/newly_digital/\" target=\"_top\">Newly Digital</a>,\nso here goes:\n<br><br>\nMy history with computers starts a few years earlier than 1983,\nthough.  I think it was during the first grade, when I was a hyper,\neasily bored kid.  I would get class work done quickly and early, yet\nforget to turn it in.  Then, I would disrupt class until I was somehow\ncalmed down or sent to the principal.  I seem to remember that, once,\nI was caught scaling a classroom wall via the curtains.  How far I\nmade if before being caught, I&apos;m not sure, but it seemed like miles\nto me at the time.  I remember being the only one happy about it.\n<br><br>\nOne day though, the usual trip to the principal changed.  I remember\nhim as a tall, bald, and imposing man whose breath always smelled\nfunny.  (This was long, long before I knew about coffee and had become\nhopelessly addicted myself.)  The man scared me, since he was known\nhave spanked students in the old days, and though he wasn&apos;t allowed to\ndo that anymore he still had the power to call my Mom.  And I&apos;m pretty\nsure most everyone knows the little-kid terror of that.\n<br><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=460\"><img src=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/atari_800.jpg\" width=\"175\" height=\"123\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"></a>\nThis particular visit, though, he led me back into his office, and sat\nme down in front of an\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=460\" target=\"_top\">Atari 800</a>\nand a TV screen.  Though I had\nalready been introduced to video games via our Atari 2600 at home, I\nhad little idea what this thing was.\n<br><br>\nHe showed me how to turn everything on, and introduced me to a stack\nof workbooks as tall as I was.  Each book was about 1/4&quot; thick and the\ncover colors were a rainbow of progressive difficulty.  He told me\nthat he was trying to decide whether or not to start teaching\ncomputers in the school, and that these books were what the company\nsent him for classes.  He wanted me to try them out for him and see\nwhat I could do with the computer before he bought more for the\nschool.\n<br><br>\nFrom then on, when my class work was done, I had a pass to go to the\nprincipal&apos;s office and work through the books with the computer until\neither I ran out of books or the year ended.  I worked mostly on my\nown, with a heavy sense that it was something special I&apos;d been trusted\nwith.  As the principal went about his daily work, I was barely\nsupervised with this expensive machine, and I felt I needed to prove I\nwas worth it.\n<br><br>\n<img src=\"http://www.futurecast.com/futurechronicles/images/y2k.gif\" width=\"79\" height=\"75\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\">\nMy grades and my behavior improved as I tore through the workbooks in\nhis office.  There was so much to learn and play with.  I remember\nwith unusual clarity writing a program that asked me for my birthday\nand replied with my age in the year 2000.  It dazzled me that\nsomething I programmed into the computer could tell me about myself,\nall grown up, in the twenty-first century.  You know, the year when\nall science fiction stories came true!  But there I was, playing with\nthe stuff of sci-fi already.\n<br><br>\nAnd the greatest thing, as the books began to ask more creativity and\noriginality from me in my assignments, I felt my mind stretch.  I&apos;d\nnever quite felt that before, and it was so amazing.  Part of it was,\nI&apos;m sure, just a property of the elasticity of the brain at that age,\nbut I&apos;m sure my time at the computer helped.  Every day, I remembered\nand could do more.  My thoughts were becoming more ordered and\norganized, as programming the computer required it.\n<br><br>\nBut, after a few months, observing my obvious enthusiasm for the work,\nthe principal took me out of his experiment.  I was disappointed but\nhe told me that he&apos;d decided to build a computer lab and turn what I&apos;d\nbeen doing into a real class for everyone in the school.  I crossed my\nfingers: There were still plenty of books left to get through, and I\nwas just getting to the fun things like graphics and sound.\n<br><br>\nWhen the school&apos;s little computer lab was finally opened, all the kids\ngot sorted into groups of five or so, and each rotated through a\nweekly schedule of hour-long visits.  When my group&apos;s turn came, I was\ncrushed: I found that there were no assignments, just Pac Man and\nMissile Command and a smattering of math and vocabulary games.  We\nwere handed joysticks and told not to touch anything else.\n<br><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=76\"><img src=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/atari_400.jpg\" width=\"175\" height=\"138\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"></a>\nThese machines were <a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=76\" target=\"_top\">Atari 400</a>&apos;s \nand looked so much less advanced than what I&apos;d been used to.  I\nremember there being an intense nervous aura radiating from the\nsupervising teacher on duty in the lab, just waiting for one of us to\ndestroy these things.  And, when I asked if I could have a BASIC\ncartridge to work on some of my programs, I told that if I didn&apos;t\nwant to participate in the computer activities I could just go back to\nclass.

Finding the pattern is assumed to mean the ping was successful.\nA successful ping, then, causes the plugin to update the contents and timestamp\nof the status file with the response.\n<br /><br />\nThe status file is used by the plugin to determine whether or not a ping\nshould be sent.  This check is made everytime an item is viewed on my blog,\nand if the plugin sees a blog item whose timestamp is newer than that of\nthe status file, a ping is sent.\n<br /><br />\nSo!  Onto the punch-line: The appearance of the word &#39;congratulations&#39; and\nthe successful registration of a ping are not the same thing.  Apparently,\n<a href=\"http://www.blo.gs\" target=\"_top\">blo.gs</a> has been throwing up an error message in response to a ping, while\nstill registering a ping.  This error message does not contain the word\n&#39;congratulations&#39;, and so my plugin never updates the status file, and so\nit happily tries pinging <a href=\"http://www.blo.gs\" target=\"_top\">blo.gs</a> again with the next blog view.\n<br /><br />\nTwo lessons learned here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> When using a web service, whether a \"real\" service or a \"scraped\" service, be very sure to know and handle the difference between a valid response and an exception or error in the service itself.\n</li>\n<li> When using a web service, take care with your usage pattern.  That is, just how important is success?  Important enough to try again and again?  Or could you wait awhile, whether successful or not?  Or should you even try again?\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br /><br />\nMy plugin doesn't know the real meaning of the response to a ping.  And further,\nthe fact that it's designed to try, try again in the case of apparent failure\nis not the greatest choice for a usage pattern.\n<br /><br />\nSo... longwinded post, but I think the realizations are valuable.\n<!--more-->\nshortname=blo_gs_gone_wild\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083912\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://trikuare.cx/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0a5b2c20fe4587a2b0abc3738c953e53&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://trikuare.cx/\">magenta</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083912\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-06-05T00:29:21\">2003-06-05T00:29:21</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">What would be really nice is if the blo.gs response page made clever use of CSS like the W3C validator, by putting one (and, of course, only one) &lt;div id=\"result\" class=\"valid\"&gt; (or class=\"error\") in the response, with the actual error message inside.

I count myself as infinitely fortunate to have\nfound a girl who not only tolerates my video gaming ways, but insists that\nwe display the collection of consoles in the living room.\n<br><br>\nI have a photo of the entertainment rack around here somewhere, but it\nmay have been a casualty of the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/misc/thirsty_ibook.phtml\" target=\"_top\">thirsty iBook</a>\nincident.  (Still tinkering with getting a Linux box to mount the HFS+\npartition on the apparently undamaged hard drive.)  From where I&apos;m sitting,\nthough, I see the following systems either connected via switchbox to\nthe TV, or stowed away in a mesh drawer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Nintendo\n<ul>\n<li> NES (classic frontloader)\n</li>\n<li> SNES\n</li>\n<li> N64\n</li>\n<li> <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/GameCube?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">GameCube</font></span>\n</li>\n<li> <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/GameBoy?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">GameBoy</font></span>\n<ul>\n<li> Classic\n</li>\n<li> Pocket\n</li>\n<li> Color\n</li>\n<li> Advance \n<ul>\n<li> purple with TV connector mod\n</li>\n<li> pink \n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Advance SP (x 2 platinum)\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Sega\n<ul>\n<li> Genesis\n</li>\n<li> Dreamcast\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> XBox\n</li>\n<li> PS2\n</li>\n</ul>\nStowed away in closets and, possibly, at my Mom&apos;s house, I&apos;ve also\ngot an Atari and <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/ColecoVision?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">ColecoVision</font></span>.  Also, I have a small start on a\ncomputer collection as well, including a C64, Atari 800, Amiga 1200,\nand of course a smattering of random PCs.\n<br><br>\nEventually, I want a house, and a room in this house will be dedicated\nto the display and use of these machines.  Also, eventually, I want\nto work on a proper collection of these things and their games and\nsoftware.  (For instance, I&apos;m in desperate need of a second generation\ntop-loading NES.)\n<br><br>\nThe funny thing is that people still ask me occasionally if I really\nneed or use all this stuff.

It used to return a 405 Request Method not allowed or something like that. Well, thanks for the testing area. I'd given up on trying the script because I didn't have anything to ping.\nI think the blank trackback is from me clicking on the link that you put under the entry.

The first trackback is from me. Well, from my boyfriend's blog, anyway, which is still on Movable Type. I currently can't get the MT standalone trackback script to send pings for my Blosxom blog.\r\n\r\nScratch that, apparently the trackback script is working now! What the devil... It used to return a 405 Request Method not allowed or something like that. Well, thanks for the testing area. I'd given up on trying the script because I didn't have anything to ping.\r\n\r\nI think the blank trackback is from me clicking on the link that you put under the entry.

Do they actually use this thing in the movie?  I hope this isn&#39;t a sign for what the movie will be like -- clumsy, bulky, cartoonish and not at all subtle like the original.  See, the first movie had a phone.  I forget the model number, but I think it was a Nokia.  its sliding keypad cover was modified especially for the movie with a switchblade-springload action for extra cool factor.  And, unlike a lot of phones at the time, it was slick and sleek and tiny.\n<br /><br />\nSo what the hell is this thing?

It was a dual-band GSM phone so it never made it to the US. Right after the first movie, when I would travel to England half the brits I met with had one. It was discontinued because the springload action kept breaking and in some cases shot the cover clear across the room. \nInterestingly one owner told me that the phone was quite popular in a pub game where it was used to launch bottlecaps across the table into a make shift goal.\nYour're right this phone is a disappointment. I'm sure Samsung called the shots and for their promotional contribution, they had little room to say \"this is ugly.\" I'd still buy the 8110 with a few upgrade to it.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088245\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://algorhythm.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=546b2f1947278db93fa8f7c734876111&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://algorhythm.org\">Shawn</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088245\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-05-16T13:08:05\">2003-05-16T13:08:05</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Man, did that need to be said.

Do they actually use this thing in the movie?  I hope this isn't a sign for what the movie will be like -- clumsy, bulky, cartoonish and not at all subtle like the original.  See, the first movie had a phone.  I forget the model number, but I think it was a Nokia.  its sliding keypad cover was modified especially for the movie with a switchblade-springload action for extra cool factor.  And, unlike a lot of phones at the time, it was slick and sleek and tiny.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo what the hell is this thing?  It looks like a walkee-talkee for grade school kids, not the \"ultimate conversation piece\".\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=matrix_phone\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088240\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dev.lophty.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=75dbbf57a574d8445968c52823abc316&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dev.lophty.com\">Brian</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088240\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-05-16T10:24:45\">2003-05-16T10:24:45</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Agreed.

It was a dual-band GSM phone so it never made it to the US. Right after the first movie, when I would travel to England half the brits I met with had one. It was discontinued because the springload action kept breaking and in some cases shot the cover clear across the room. \r\n\r\nInterestingly one owner told me that the phone was quite popular in a pub game where it was used to launch bottlecaps across the table into a make shift goal.\r\n\r\nYour're right this phone is a disappointment. I'm sure Samsung called the shots and for their promotional contribution, they had little room to say \"this is ugly.\" I'd still buy the 8110 with a few upgrade to it.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088245\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://algorhythm.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=546b2f1947278db93fa8f7c734876111&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://algorhythm.org\">Shawn</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088245\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-05-16T13:08:05\">2003-05-16T13:08:05</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Man, did that need to be said.

I'll guess ill just keep them as collecters items.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088261\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f85a18b3ae50833f2bec6d7370bc7249&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">scradge</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088261\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-03-04T09:17:28\">2004-03-04T09:17:28</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">blitz is right the 7110 is a compleatly different phone which has a much larger screen than the 8110. the nokia 8110. is still available if you buy it on ebay.\r\nI have 3 myself and are currently modding mine to make the slide work!

Do they actually use this thing in the movie?  I hope this isn&apos;t a sign for what the movie will be like -- clumsy, bulky, cartoonish and not at all subtle like the original.  See, the first movie had a phone.  I forget the model number, but I think it was a Nokia.  its sliding keypad cover was modified especially for the movie with a switchblade-springload action for extra cool factor.  And, unlike a lot of phones at the time, it was slick and sleek and tiny.\n<br><br>\nSo what the hell is this thing?  It looks like a walkee-talkee for grade school kids, not the &quot;ultimate conversation piece&quot;.</p>\n",

However, the  &quot;fcid=145690&quot; parameter  is an unknown to me.  It seems to change, though I haven&apos;t yet investigated its derivation or how often it changes.  I was working on things yesterday, and the value was one thing, this morning it was another. If the number is not valid, unexpected results happen, sometimes resulting in HTML output describing an application exception.  So, until the fcid mystery is solved, I&apos;ve yet to automate this transformation. \n<br><br>\nAny ideas out there on the lazyweb?  Visit the wiki page (<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ItunesMusicStoreToRss\">ItunesMusicStoreToRss</a>) and feel free to poke fun at my XSL skills.</p>\n",

Instead, I&apos;ve had\na project hurled at me that combines Flash MX and XML, something I&apos;ve\njust barely touched before.\n<br><br>\nWow, is this stuff fun.  And I write that without a trace of sarcasm--\nthis app I&apos;ve inherited for maintenance and extension, though it&apos;s a\nbit grungy and shows some signs of late-night expediency, does some\nneat things with actions and buttons dynamically wired up in response\nto XML config files loaded via URL, which are in turn generated from a\ndatabase managed by a simple end-user admin interface.  Not sure how\nmuch more I should write about it, but I&apos;m dying to post a link.  Of\ncourse, this isn&apos;t revolutionary stuff in general.  It&apos;s just a revelation\nto me.\n<br><br>\nThe last time I had an opportunity to really, really dig around in\nFlash was just about when Flash 5 came out.  I was immersed daily in\nFlash in the years between the initial acquisition by Macromedia, up\nthrough version 4, and just started drifting away, sadly, when things\nstarted getting really interesting with v5.  That was when my daily\njob swung entirely into the backend, and client-side concerns were\nno longer my task.\n<br><br>\nBut now I&apos;m back in this old neighborhood, and I can see why some\npeople would love nothing better but to build entire websites in\nFlash.  Yeah, that&apos;s evil, but it&apos;s sexy.  Despite some clunkiness,\nthere are some very nice possibilities I see now.  I love Java, and\nloved cobbling together funky applets 5 years or so ago, but Flash\nmakes me want to toy with rich client-side apps again.\n<br><br>\nAnd then, there&apos;s this\n<a href=\"http://sonyelectronics.sonystyle.com/micros/clie/models/tg50.html\" target=\"_top\">Sony Clie PEG-TG50</a>\nhandheld I&apos;ve recently started pining for, and it appears to run a\nFlash 5 player.  It&apos;s probably underwhelming, but who knows?\n<br><br>\nAnyway, back to work, but just had to spill some enthusiasm for\nFlash.</p>\n",

Or, at least,\nI&#39;d love to see more stories from the same setting or playing with the\nsame themes of the Bitchun Society.  I have seen some of these things\nin stories before, though.  So, hey, I haven&#39;t posted anything here in\na few days - have some babble and book links (feel free to comment and\nleave some more links):\n<br /><br />\nOf course I love the notion of ubiquitous computing and personal\nHUD&#39;s.  I&#39;ve babbled about that at length for sure.  If you want more\nof that, go check out Vernor Vinge&#39;s\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312875843/0xdecafbad-20\" target=\"_top\">Fast Times at Fairmont High</a>.\nMediated reality with P2P computing woven into clothing and projected\nacross contact lens displays.  A little less obtrusive than\nseisure-inducing in-brain electronics, but just as post-human.\n<br /><br />\nAnd then there&#39;s backup-and-restore and the cure for death.  Although\nin David Brin&#39;s\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0765342618/0xdecafbad-20\" target=\"_top\">Kiln People</a>,\nthings start with disposable\ndoppelgangers, survival of personality after bodily death is promised\nin the ending.  What could change human nature more than transcending\nmortality?\n<br /><br />\nAs for deadheading, check out Vinge&#39;s\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671720988/0xdecafbad-20\" target=\"_top\">Across Realtime</a>\nseries.  In\nparticular, read up on bobbling in Marooned in Realtime.  There&#39;s also\nOrson Scott Card&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812533313/0xdecafbad-20\" target=\"_top\">The Worthing Saga</a>.\nA one-way trip into the far future\nthrough geological periods of time seems particularly external to\nknown human experience, especially when combined with immortality.\n<br /><br />\nOne thing I&#39;ve yet to see much in stories or speculations is how\nsociety could function in a post-mortality and post-scarcity\nconditions.  I&#39;ve never been satisfied with the way Star Trek dodges\nthe day-to-day realities of a post-capitalistic Federation of plenty.\nWalter Jon Williams&#39; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312851723/0xdecafbad-20\" target=\"_top\">Aristoi</a>\nexplores an interesting track with a\nmeritocratic society whose top members have godlike powers matched to\ngodlike creativity and self-possession (not to mention possession by\nmultiple selves).\n<br /><br />\nBut so far, Whuffie and its currency in reputation is the best game\nI&#39;ve seen yet.  Since, even if the problems of mortality and material\nscarcity are solved, human attention and cooperation will never be\ngratis.  So, how else do you herd the cats when you can neither\nthreaten nor reward them via any physical means?  Seems like the\nblogosphere, gift culture, and open source noosphere brought to\nreality.\n<br /><br />\nKinda makes me want to get back to fiction writing meself and finally\nget out the dozen or so stories I&#39;ve had bouncing around in my head\nthese past years.  Doesn&#39;t necessarily mean I&#39;d churn out anything\ngood, but who knows?  Maybe after some work and some stumbling I could\nproduce something passable.  All those creative writing classes in\ncollege and short stories in spiral-bound notebooks from high school\nhave to count for something.  I&#39;d even love to squat in the Bitchun\nSociety for a few stories, but that might be a bit presumptuous, even though\nMr. Doctorow himself <a href=\"http://www.craphound.com/down/archives/2003_01.php#000054\" target=\"_top\">has let on</a>\nthat he&#39;s not likely to write more\ntales from the same Bitchun universe.\nBetter to get some practice in before jamming in someone else&#39;s club.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=down_and_out</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088177\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=af9aaec8a780cf03de305603eae6e243&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Mart</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088177\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-04-21T16:48:09\">2003-04-21T16:48:09</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Sorry this is unrelated to what I'm responding to, but...\nI just noticed you've replaced your RSS file with an English message explaining that it has moved.

    "html": "<p>In my intermittent online presence, I&#39;ve been happily watching <a href=\"http://www.scripting.com\" target=\"_top\">Dave Winer</a>&#39;s\nramp-up with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a> toward OSCON with things like \n&quot;<a href=\"http://www.opml.org/howToImplementOpmlDirectoryBrowser\" target=\"_top\">How to implement an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a> directory browser</a>&quot;.\nI love outliners, and though it&#39;s been a little while since I played with Radio, I loved Instant Outlining\nand the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooocoe.html\" target=\"_top\">transclusion</a> of outside outlines into the\none at hand via URL.  And when Dave first introduced the idea of an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a>-based distributed web directory,\nI figured it was the start of another nifty twist in the web fabric.  (You know, the kind that makes wrinkles?\nThe kind of wrinkles that make brains smarter?)\n<br /><br />\nAnyway, even given all this, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a> has always bugged me, and I&#39;m not alone.  In fact, today I found a\nlink to <a href=\"http://oml.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_top\">OML</a>, the Outline Markup Language project on <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/SourceForge?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">SourceForge</font></span>,\nwhich seems to seek to address many of the same things that have bugged me.  That is, things like\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> application-specific tags, and extension via arbitrary attributes.  Though I&#39;m no master\nof deep XML magic, these things struck me as grungy.\n<br /><br />\nBut you know, we&#39;re <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooced.html\" target=\"_top\">designing for recombinant growth with the lazyweb</a> here\n(or at least, Dave Winer was and is), and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a> looks like one of those dirty things that got\nthrown together quickly in order to enable a laundry list of further projects.  It works, isn&#39;t\nall that hard to grasp, and has gotten adopted quickly.  There&#39;s momentum there.  As \n<a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/04/15#noWaitForTools\" target=\"_top\">Dave says</a>, there is no wait for\ntools.\n<br /><br />\nSo, now there&#39;s also <a href=\"http://oml.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_top\">OML</a> starting.  Hopefully this won&#39;t become another rehash of the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> fight.<br>Because, I sense many similar issues between the two.  Maybe it would have been better still if OML had been named something\ncompletely avoiding the letters O, P, M, or L.  I already see mailing list charters being called out in order to quiet unwanted\ndiscussion of fundamentals, but, hopefully we can avoid anyone claiming that they have the One True Format, all fighting for the\nsame name and slapping each other around with version numbers.  Gah.\n<br /><br />\nAnyway.  I like OML but see some grunge in it as well.  At the moment, I&#39;m using an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a>-supporting tool. I can&#39;t imagine that\nconversion would be more than an XSLT file away.  Well, maybe more than that.  Beyond that, let&#39;s agree to disagree and viva le\nfork.

    "body": "In my intermittent online presence, I've been happily watching <a href=\"http://www.scripting.com\" target=\"_top\">Dave Winer</a>'s\r\nramp-up with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a> toward OSCON with things like \r\n\"<a href=\"http://www.opml.org/howToImplementOpmlDirectoryBrowser\" target=\"_top\">How to implement an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a> directory browser</a>\".\r\nI love outliners, and though it's been a little while since I played with Radio, I loved Instant Outlining\r\nand the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooocoe.html\" target=\"_top\">transclusion</a> of outside outlines into the\r\none at hand via URL.  And when Dave first introduced the idea of an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a>-based distributed web directory,\r\nI figured it was the start of another nifty twist in the web fabric.  (You know, the kind that makes wrinkles?\r\nThe kind of wrinkles that make brains smarter?)\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAnyway, even given all this, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a> has always bugged me, and I'm not alone.  In fact, today I found a\r\nlink to <a href=\"http://oml.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_top\">OML</a>, the Outline Markup Language project on <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/SourceForge?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">SourceForge</font></span>,\r\nwhich seems to seek to address many of the same things that have bugged me.  That is, things like\r\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> application-specific tags, and extension via arbitrary attributes.  Though I'm no master\r\nof deep XML magic, these things struck me as grungy.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBut you know, we're <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooced.html\" target=\"_top\">designing for recombinant growth with the lazyweb</a> here\r\n(or at least, Dave Winer was and is), and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a> looks like one of those dirty things that got\r\nthrown together quickly in order to enable a laundry list of further projects.  It works, isn't\r\nall that hard to grasp, and has gotten adopted quickly.  There's momentum there.  As \r\n<a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/04/15#noWaitForTools\" target=\"_top\">Dave says</a>, there is no wait for\r\ntools.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo, now there's also <a href=\"http://oml.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_top\">OML</a> starting.  Hopefully this won't become another rehash of the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> fight.  \r\nBecause, I sense many similar issues between the two.  Maybe it would have been better still if OML had been named something\r\ncompletely avoiding the letters O, P, M, or L.  I already see mailing list charters being called out in order to quiet unwanted\r\ndiscussion of fundamentals, but, hopefully we can avoid anyone claiming that they have the One True Format, all fighting for the\r\nsame name and slapping each other around with version numbers.  Gah.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAnyway.  I like OML but see some grunge in it as well.  At the moment, I'm using an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a>-supporting tool. I can't imagine that\r\nconversion would be more than an XSLT file away.  Well, maybe more than that.  Beyond that, let's agree to disagree and viva le\r\nfork.  Let the best, most demonstratably capable format win.

(You know, the kind that makes wrinkles?\nThe kind of wrinkles that make brains smarter?)\n<br><br>\nAnyway, even given all this, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a> has always bugged me, and I&apos;m not alone.  In fact, today I found a\nlink to <a href=\"http://oml.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_top\">OML</a>, the Outline Markup Language project on <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/SourceForge?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">SourceForge</font></span>,\nwhich seems to seek to address many of the same things that have bugged me.  That is, things like\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand\">UserLand</a> application-specific tags, and extension via arbitrary attributes.  Though I&apos;m no master\nof deep XML magic, these things struck me as grungy.\n<br><br>\nBut you know, we&apos;re <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooced.html\" target=\"_top\">designing for recombinant growth with the lazyweb</a> here\n(or at least, Dave Winer was and is), and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a> looks like one of those dirty things that got\nthrown together quickly in order to enable a laundry list of further projects.  It works, isn&apos;t\nall that hard to grasp, and has gotten adopted quickly.  There&apos;s momentum there.  As \n<a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/04/15#noWaitForTools\" target=\"_top\">Dave says</a>, there is no wait for\ntools.\n<br><br>\nSo, now there&apos;s also <a href=\"http://oml.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_top\">OML</a> starting.  Hopefully this won&apos;t become another rehash of the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> fight.<br>Because, I sense many similar issues between the two.  Maybe it would have been better still if OML had been named something\ncompletely avoiding the letters O, P, M, or L.  I already see mailing list charters being called out in order to quiet unwanted\ndiscussion of fundamentals, but, hopefully we can avoid anyone claiming that they have the One True Format, all fighting for the\nsame name and slapping each other around with version numbers.  Gah.\n<br><br>\nAnyway.  I like OML but see some grunge in it as well.  At the moment, I&apos;m using an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a>-supporting tool. I can&apos;t imagine that\nconversion would be more than an XSLT file away.  Well, maybe more than that.  Beyond that, let&apos;s agree to disagree and viva le\nfork.  Let the best, most demonstratably capable format win.  Meanwhile, I&apos;m still considering that Tinderbox license to see if I\nmight like multi-dimensional outlining...</p>\n",

And what I read almost never\nfails to resonate with something I've been thinking or musing about,\nfrom my perspective as a geek wondering about life, the universe, and\neverything and as a fan of Kurzweil, Vinge, and all of post-humanity.\nBut my anticipation of the Singularity is constantly swayed by things\nsuch as the theses of the above quoted essays.\n<br /><br />\nSee, as an irredeemable believer in the ways of better living through\ntechnology, I look forward to our increasing ability to further\nself-improve and bootstrap to higher levels of living, longevity,\nability, understanding, and exploration.  But, there's a neopagan\nmystic and naturalist in me who keeps looking for the catch.  There\nmust be natural limits we don't yet understand.\n<br /><br />\nNo matter the precocious cleverness of our species, there's got to be\nplenty of good reasons it takes millions of years to achieve progress\nin forms and patterns of life.  There are lots of little subtle\ndetails to be easily missed.  We're smart, but not yet endowed with\nthe patience and wisdom that eternity grants.  I both breathlessly\nawait and fear the arrival of our ability to fundamentally change\nhuman nature directly through genetic manipulation and device\nimplantation.\n<br /><br />\nAs the first essay quoted above asserts, I believe the human species\nis unfinished.  But as with the second essay, I think we've outpaced\nevolution in terms of changing the conditions under which the process\nitself occurs.\n<br /><br />\nJust look around you.  You're likely indoors, in a building composed\nof simple straight lines which register easily on your visual pattern\nrecognizers, with corridors and doorways and rooms proportioned to\nyour bodily dimensions.  The air is conditioned to your respiratory\nand temperature tolerances.  Things are padded and accessible.  Food\nand drink are likely plentiful.  The only predators you're likely to\nmeet up with during your day are of your own species.  Nothing really\nchallenges your basic nature.\n<br /><br />\nYet, this is just what the universe has been doing to forms of life\nthroughout the history of evolution.  Only now, we've jumped the\ntracks, reversed the flow of control, and have reshaped our corner of\nthe universe to fit our status quo.  So, where does that leave the\nnatural process of evolution with regard to us?  Stopped or slowed to\na crawl, that's where.  Maybe falling backward, since we have\nprosthetics, glasses, and other forms of propping up imperfections\nthat would have otherwise been faced with disincentives by natural\nselection.\n<br /><br />\nSo, where are we without a natural evolution?  We're left as an\nunfinished species, with a peculiar mix of awesome abilities matched\nwith amazing disabilities.  Very clever people, but with a lot of\nblind spots.  There are certain ways in which it is very difficult and\nsometimes nearly impossible for us to think.  We have biases toward\ngrouping things by similarity, dividing them by difference - which\nallows for a very elegant economy of memory and thought, but allows\nfor peculiarly devastating things like racism and xenophobia.\nCritical thinking is counterintuitive, yet is one of our most powerful\ntools.\n<br /><br />\nAnd there are definite flaws in our perceptions of reality, as any\nbook of optical illusions will tell you.  One thing that struck me\nlike a thunderbolt came from a human biology class: Ever try following\na common housefly with your eyes?  Isn't it frustrating how it just\nseems to <strong>vanish</strong> from your sight?  I can't find a reference to back\nme up, so this is just from memory: I was taught that flies have\ndeveloped a particularly zig-zaggy and erratic flight pattern to evade\njust our kind of mammalian vision system.  But, studies of fly-eating\nfrogs have shown that their vision systems appear particularly tweaked\nto react to a fly's midair dance.  Imagine what else slips past us, or\ncomes to our attention garbled because our very apparatus contains\nbiases of which we're yet to even conceive?\n<br /><br />\nHere we are, then, flawed and incomplete yet with a growing ability to\nself-modify.  As an amateur computer scientist, I shudder a bit at any\ncode that's self-modifying.  It can be done, and it can be powerfully\nenabling, but it's just so damn easy to blow a foot off with the\ntechnique.  So too with ourselves, then.  There's a possiblity that we\ncan push ourselves into a richer level of thought and perception and\nability without destroying ourselves completely.  But, we're going to\nmiss things, important things.\n<br /><br />\nIf we're lucky, we'll roll with it and survive.  But, as the second\nDisenchanted essay explores, we'll most certainly render the species\nas we know it extinct, and push ourselves our of a natural niche and\ninto a wholly artificial niche in need of perpetual maintenance and\nrenewal.  Maybe this artifical niche will be easily sustained and\nportable enough to take with us if we want to leave the planet.  On\nthe other hand, maybe this artificial niche will prove our undoing as\nit outstrips our ability to keep it up.\n<br /><br />\nSo, given all this, I think the inevitable predicted verticality of\nthe Singularity's curve has an incredibly strong counter-force\nstemming from human nature itself.  What does this mean?  Not sure.\nWhat to do?  Not sure.  But it tells me that the Kurzweilan and\nVingian predictions of which I'm so fond face some severe reality\nchecks.\n<br /><br />\nMore thinking to do.  Thanks to Disenchanted for making me think this\nfar today.  :)\n<!--more-->\nshortname=singularity_vs_human_nature\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086808\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c462705b91eebbf6281cbe1dccab88e0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Lief Clennon</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086808\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-03-27T03:26:17\">2003-03-27T03:26:17</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">It occurs to me that creating a situation we're not entirely prepared to face would, in fact, be tantamount to forcing ourselves back into Darwinian evolution.

I shudder to think of the barrage of hate mail when someone seriously suggests that we eliminate the diabetics ... and yet I also shudder to think what we will do when the man on horseback rides into our theatre and shouts \"Darwin.\"</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

    "summary": "<p>Apologies in advance if this post-cum-essay runs a bit long...\n<br><br></p>\n<blockquote cite=\"http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/humanity/brainbuilder.html?id=8Mir9Pz5\">We could conclude that modern human intelligence is an unfinished product, and something that nature hasn&apos;t quite got around to polishing yet. The problem-solving intelligence part can be tuned and revved up to high levels, but it becomes unstable like early supersonic jet prototypes that shook themselves to pieces just after reaching the sound barrier. Nature has outstripped itself, producing a freak organism with a feature that&apos;s obscenely over-developed but under-refined. We&apos;ve seen examples of evolution getting ahead of itself before, like the rapid conversion to an erect, bipedal skeletal frame without properly modifying the spine to withstand the back-aching load of pregnancy. To get a better grip of human failings, and human stupidity, you have to realize that modern Homo sapiens sapiens just isn&apos;t done yet.</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/humanity/brainbuilder.html?id=8Mir9Pz5\">Disenchanted: * Early prototype, expect instability</a></cite></small></div>\n<blockquote cite=\"http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/technology/mediated.html?id=AtW2JdUp\">When our own instincts are inadequate, or become a hazard, and the surrogate activities to control them aren&apos;t sufficient anymore, then there certainly will be a push to change human nature to fit his new, self-crafted niche. And the answer to my original question?that man will invent something that knocks him out of his niche with fatal consequences?is yes. Homo sapien will die, and homo modified will inherit the earth.</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/technology/mediated.html?id=AtW2JdUp\">Disenchanted: Invent this and die</a></cite></small></div>\n<br><br>\nThere&apos;s only an essay or two per month published over at Disenchanted,\nbut they&apos;re gems, each and every one.  And what I read almost never\nfails to resonate with something I&apos;ve been thinking or musing about,\nfrom my perspective as a geek wondering about life, the universe, and\neverything and as a fan of Kurzweil, Vinge, and all of post-humanity.\nBut my anticipation of the Singularity is constantly swayed by things\nsuch as the theses of the above quoted essays.\n<br><br>\nSee, as an irredeemable believer in the ways of better living through\ntechnology, I look forward to our increasing ability to further\nself-improve and bootstrap to higher levels of living, longevity,\nability, understanding, and exploration.  But, there&apos;s a neopagan\nmystic and naturalist in me who keeps looking for the catch.  There\nmust be natural limits we don&apos;t yet understand.\n<br><br>\nNo matter the precocious cleverness of our species, there&apos;s got to be\nplenty of good reasons it takes millions of years to achieve progress\nin forms and patterns of life.  There are lots of little subtle\ndetails to be easily missed.  We&apos;re smart, but not yet endowed with\nthe patience and wisdom that eternity grants.  I both breathlessly\nawait and fear the arrival of our ability to fundamentally change\nhuman nature directly through genetic manipulation and device\nimplantation.\n<br><br>\nAs the first essay quoted above asserts, I believe the human species\nis unfinished.  But as with the second essay, I think we&apos;ve outpaced\nevolution in terms of changing the conditions under which the process\nitself occurs.\n<br><br>\nJust look around you.  You&apos;re likely indoors, in a building composed\nof simple straight lines which register easily on your visual pattern\nrecognizers, with corridors and doorways and rooms proportioned to\nyour bodily dimensions.  The air is conditioned to your respiratory\nand temperature tolerances.  Things are padded and accessible.  Food\nand drink are likely plentiful.  The only predators you&apos;re likely to\nmeet up with during your day are of your own species.  Nothing really\nchallenges your basic nature.\n<br><br>\nYet, this is just what the universe has been doing to forms of life\nthroughout the history of evolution.  Only now, we&apos;ve jumped the\ntracks, reversed the flow of control, and have reshaped our corner of\nthe universe to fit our status quo.  So, where does that leave the\nnatural process of evolution with regard to us?  Stopped or slowed to\na crawl, that&apos;s where.  Maybe falling backward, since we have\nprosthetics, glasses, and other forms of propping up imperfections\nthat would have otherwise been faced with disincentives by natural\nselection.\n<br><br>\nSo, where are we without a natural evolution?  We&apos;re left as an\nunfinished species, with a peculiar mix of awesome abilities matched\nwith amazing disabilities.  Very clever people, but with a lot of\nblind spots.  There are certain ways in which it is very difficult and\nsometimes nearly impossible for us to think.  We have biases toward\ngrouping things by similarity, dividing them by difference - which\nallows for a very elegant economy of memory and thought, but allows\nfor peculiarly devastating things like racism and xenophobia.\nCritical thinking is counterintuitive, yet is one of our most powerful\ntools.\n<br><br>\nAnd there are definite flaws in our perceptions of reality, as any\nbook of optical illusions will tell you.  One thing that struck me\nlike a thunderbolt came from a human biology class: Ever try following\na common housefly with your eyes?  Isn&apos;t it frustrating how it just\nseems to <strong>vanish</strong> from your sight?  I can&apos;t find a reference to back\nme up, so this is just from memory: I was taught that flies have\ndeveloped a particularly zig-zaggy and erratic flight pattern to evade\njust our kind of mammalian vision system.  But, studies of fly-eating\nfrogs have shown that their vision systems appear particularly tweaked\nto react to a fly&apos;s midair dance.  Imagine what else slips past us, or\ncomes to our attention garbled because our very apparatus contains\nbiases of which we&apos;re yet to even conceive?\n<br><br>\nHere we are, then, flawed and incomplete yet with a growing ability to\nself-modify.  As an amateur computer scientist, I shudder a bit at any\ncode that&apos;s self-modifying.  It can be done, and it can be powerfully\nenabling, but it&apos;s just so damn easy to blow a foot off with the\ntechnique.  So too with ourselves, then.  There&apos;s a possiblity that we\ncan push ourselves into a richer level of thought and perception and\nability without destroying ourselves completely.  But, we&apos;re going to\nmiss things, important things.\n<br><br>\nIf we&apos;re lucky, we&apos;ll roll with it and survive.  But, as the second\nDisenchanted essay explores, we&apos;ll most certainly render the species\nas we know it extinct, and push ourselves our of a natural niche and\ninto a wholly artificial niche in need of perpetual maintenance and\nrenewal.  Maybe this artifical niche will be easily sustained and\nportable enough to take with us if we want to leave the planet.  On\nthe other hand, maybe this artificial niche will prove our undoing as\nit outstrips our ability to keep it up.\n<br><br>\nSo, given all this, I think the inevitable predicted verticality of\nthe Singularity&apos;s curve has an incredibly strong counter-force\nstemming from human nature itself.  What does this mean?  Not sure.\nWhat to do?  Not sure.  But it tells me that the Kurzweilan and\nVingian predictions of which I&apos;m so fond face some severe reality\nchecks.\n<br><br>\nMore thinking to do.  Thanks to Disenchanted for making me think this\nfar today.  :)\n",

    "html": "<p>So, while my time is mine, I&#39;ve decided that I want to expand my\npractical horizons.  And, one of the first things I can think of is to\ngo lateral and approach something I&#39;ve looked upon with mild disdain:\nMicrosoft technologies.  In particular: .NET\n<br /><br />\nI already understand Unix well enough to do damn near anything -- this\nis not to say that there aren&#39;t still years worth of things left for\nme to learn in that sphere, but I&#39;m not nearly as adept with\nMicrosoft&#39;s offerings.  And, besides the practical concerns with being\nflexible enough to take on what work the world offers me, I also have\na hunch that this .NET thing will make me think as differently about\nMicrosoft as OS X made me change my mind about Apple.\n<br /><br />\nMaybe.  But it&#39;s still a good attitude with which a punk unixhead can\napproach the subject, I think.

Were this Java, I&#39;d pop open an emacs window and start\nplaying.  I&#39;d grab some free app servers and check some things out.\nBeing on a fixed budget, I don&#39;t think I can spring for any packages\nlike Visual Studio .NET.

I tell people it's \"java done right\"... C# is nice, too -- the other legacy langs in .net variants, I don't think are quite so nice.\nAnyhow, I have to write a small windows app/util now and then, and from now on I'm using C#. But for web stuff, which is my bread and butter, I just, frankly, don't trust microsoft enough to expend the time, energy, and effort to building things with asp.net or similar. I don't want to be locked to their platform. (And if you believe they're going to be happy if/when mono \"finishes\", and can run the same apps without compiling on linux, you're nuts--they'll subvert it like hell *when*appropriate*. Right now it's not appropriate to their business needs; in fact it's quite useful for them to seem to be supportive of it.)\nJust remember that microsoft is a business first and foremost, and wins by having people use their platforms. To me, the public wins by using a common platform, which for the kinds of things I build, they do--the web. The code I invest my time in, should run \"on the web\", and that implies to me hardware-agnostic, OS-agnostic. That puts the power back into my hands, allowing me to find the right hardware and OS for the particular systems' needs, not \"the only one I know how to program on\", such as .Net, or VB. [C# is open, and the language is great--but mostly who cares, without the libraries? And the libraries only run right now, 100%, and I'd argue, forever only >90%, on Microsoft OSes.]\nOK, that was rambling, sorry :-) I've thought about this a lot, and while I haven't the time or organizational skills at the moment to truly effectively convey my opinion, at least I feel a little better!</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084439\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://monkey.org/~jose/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d74863ca9c7785cd396379766095036c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://monkey.org/~jose/\">jose</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084439\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-03-20T10:58:58\">2003-03-20T10:58:58</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">hey les, long time no see. sorry to hear about your jobless sitch, but ... good to see you're using it for good. i'm also getting hooked on the .NET thing, i'm finally grokking the tech they're embracing. i think it's pretty cool, and can finally let me do some of the more interesting things i have wanted to do. i think the rotor source should install on os x, which would be a nicer, faster way to do it. i know mono works on linux-ppc, so the underlying processor support is there. \na few links:\nhttp://www.devhood.com/tutorials/tutorial_details.aspx?tutorial_id=579\nhttp://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1269\nanyhow, you can see where this is going: you should have support for .NET on os x. \nhappy hacking.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084440\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=206fbbec4cb9474d5a622b33a450319b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/blog/\">Bryce</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084440\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-03-20T18:14:50\">2003-03-20T18:14:50</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Eclipse has a C# plugin, if you can get Mono running you can completely avoid Virtual PC.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084443\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=55de90f5a0977fcf7b47ce4e6837f48d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\">Steve Makofsky</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084443\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-03-21T19:40:38\">2003-03-21T19:40:38</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Why dont you give the shared source cli a try (SSCLI or ROTOR)?

I tell people it's \"java done right\"... C# is nice, too -- the other legacy langs in .net variants, I don't think are quite so nice.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I have to write a small windows app/util now and then, and from now on I'm using C#. But for web stuff, which is my bread and butter, I just, frankly, don't trust microsoft enough to expend the time, energy, and effort to building things with asp.net or similar. I don't want to be locked to their platform. (And if you believe they're going to be happy if/when mono \"finishes\", and can run the same apps without compiling on linux, you're nuts--they'll subvert it like hell *when*appropriate*. Right now it's not appropriate to their business needs; in fact it's quite useful for them to seem to be supportive of it.)\r\nJust remember that microsoft is a business first and foremost, and wins by having people use their platforms. To me, the public wins by using a common platform, which for the kinds of things I build, they do--the web. The code I invest my time in, should run \"on the web\", and that implies to me hardware-agnostic, OS-agnostic. That puts the power back into my hands, allowing me to find the right hardware and OS for the particular systems' needs, not \"the only one I know how to program on\", such as .Net, or VB. [C# is open, and the language is great--but mostly who cares, without the libraries? And the libraries only run right now, 100%, and I'd argue, forever only >90%, on Microsoft OSes.]\r\n\r\nOK, that was rambling, sorry :-) I've thought about this a lot, and while I haven't the time or organizational skills at the moment to truly effectively convey my opinion, at least I feel a little better!</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084439\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://monkey.org/~jose/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d74863ca9c7785cd396379766095036c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://monkey.org/~jose/\">jose</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084439\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-03-20T10:58:58\">2003-03-20T10:58:58</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">hey les, long time no see. sorry to hear about your jobless sitch, but ... good to see you're using it for good. i'm also getting hooked on the .NET thing, i'm finally grokking the tech they're embracing. i think it's pretty cool, and can finally let me do some of the more interesting things i have wanted to do. i think the rotor source should install on os x, which would be a nicer, faster way to do it. i know mono works on linux-ppc, so the underlying processor support is there. \r\n\r\na few links:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.devhood.com/tutorials/tutorial_details.aspx?tutorial_id=579\r\n\r\nhttp://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1269\r\n\r\nanyhow, you can see where this is going: you should have support for .NET on os x. \r\n\r\nhappy hacking.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084440\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=206fbbec4cb9474d5a622b33a450319b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/blog/\">Bryce</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084440\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-03-20T18:14:50\">2003-03-20T18:14:50</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Eclipse has a C# plugin, if you can get Mono running you can completely avoid Virtual PC.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084443\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=55de90f5a0977fcf7b47ce4e6837f48d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\">Steve Makofsky</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084443\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-03-21T19:40:38\">2003-03-21T19:40:38</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Why dont you give the shared source cli a try (SSCLI or ROTOR)?

And, one of the first things I can think of is to\ngo lateral and approach something I&apos;ve looked upon with mild disdain:\nMicrosoft technologies.  In particular: .NET\n<br><br>\nI already understand Unix well enough to do damn near anything -- this\nis not to say that there aren&apos;t still years worth of things left for\nme to learn in that sphere, but I&apos;m not nearly as adept with\nMicrosoft&apos;s offerings.  And, besides the practical concerns with being\nflexible enough to take on what work the world offers me, I also have\na hunch that this .NET thing will make me think as differently about\nMicrosoft as OS X made me change my mind about Apple.\n<br><br>\nMaybe.  But it&apos;s still a good attitude with which a punk unixhead can\napproach the subject, I think.  I&apos;m going to assume that brighter\npeople than myself have applied themselves to the creation of .NET and\nprepare to be surprised.  This attitude has always served me well in\nthe past when trying something new.  (Take Python, for instance.)\n<br><br>\nOkay.  Got a good attitude.  Have installations of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP\">WinXP</a> and Win2003\npreview (which I&apos;m kinda, grudgingly digging so far) running in\nVirtual PC on my <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/PowerBook?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">PowerBook</font></span>.  Could even draft a PC at home into\nservice running an appropriate OS if need be.  Have downloaded the\n.NET Framework and installed it on XP and Win2k3.\n<br><br>\nNow what?  Were this Java, I&apos;d pop open an emacs window and start\nplaying.  I&apos;d grab some free app servers and check some things out.\nBeing on a fixed budget, I don&apos;t think I can spring for any packages\nlike Visual Studio .NET.  And being a unixhead, I&apos;m used to being able\nto find dev tools for free.\n<br><br>\nAnyway, this absolute newbie is continuing to poke around.</p>\n",

Having been let go on a Friday, I had a\nweekend to pretend things were all as usual.  But, when Monday hit,\nthings were different.  I still got up at the usual time, did the\nusual morning things, and got out of the apartment as if I were going\nto work.  But instead of heading for the highway, I headed for a\n<a href=\"http://www.espresso-royale.com/locations_detail.cfm?state=Michigan\" target=\"_top\">coffee shop</a>\nnear campus with wireless internet.  Trying to keep the old\npatterns as normal as possible, only now my job is finding a job and\ngetting myself in shape for what's out there.\n<br /><br />\nIt wouldn't be news to anyone to hear that the job market, at least\nwhat I've seen of it so far, is nothing like the verdant plains and\nvalleys of even 3 years ago - which is about the last time I took a\nserious look.  After a first survey of a few job boards online, I\nfired off a handful of resumes and apps, and took notes on what's\nbeing asked for so as to prepare some semblance of a learning plan\nwhile I'm off.\n<br /><br />\nSo by the end of last week, I'd accomplished these various and sundry\nthings:\n<ul>\n<li> 5 cups of coffee consumed per day\n</li>\n<li> 1 resume updated and revised\n</li>\n<li> 6 resumes emailed and 4 online applications filled\n</li>\n<li> 5 profiles completed at online recruiting sites\n</li>\n<li> 1 application for unemployment filed\n</li>\n<li> 1 12\" G4 <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/PowerBook?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">PowerBook</font></span> acquired and configured\n</li>\n<li> 3 Microsoft operating systems installed and configured under Virtual PC\n</li>\n<li> 1 .NET Framework installed and exploration begun\n</li>\n<li> 1 novel finished, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0872863328/103-7733542-0669406?vi=glance\" target=\"_top\">Close to the Machine</a> by Ellen Ullman\n</li>\n<li> 6 hours of Metroid Prime played\n</li>\n</ul>\nThere's been more, but it's the amount of Metroid Prime play I'm most\nproud of - had I not gotten out of the apartment in the morning, the\nhours invested in that would have been immensely greater.

    "summary": "<p>I hadn&apos;t written much last week, between the job search and getting\nmyself hooked up with a new laptop.  I&apos;d meant to revise my initial\npost announcing my being laid of - but instead, I simply lost it\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/misc/thirsty_ibook.html\" target=\"_top\">when the iBook got doused</a>.\n<br><br>\nSo, to those of you who haven&apos;t heard my news: I was laid off a little\nover a week and a weekend ago.  No hard feelings or fireworks, just\ntypical bad economy reasons.  Nevertheless, it took me by surprise.\nSo now I&apos;m shopping my resume around.\n<br><br>\nIf you&apos;re interested, my resume is available here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2003/03/l-m-orchard-resume.doc\" target=\"_top\">http://www.decafbad.com/2003/03/l-m-orchard-resume.doc</a>\n</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2003/03/l-m-orchard-resume.pdf\" target=\"_top\">http://www.decafbad.com/2003/03/l-m-orchard-resume.pdf</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br><br>\nLast week was strange.  Having been let go on a Friday, I had a\nweekend to pretend things were all as usual.  But, when Monday hit,\nthings were different.  I still got up at the usual time, did the\nusual morning things, and got out of the apartment as if I were going\nto work.  But instead of heading for the highway, I headed for a\n<a href=\"http://www.espresso-royale.com/locations_detail.cfm?state=Michigan\" target=\"_top\">coffee shop</a>\nnear campus with wireless internet.  Trying to keep the old\npatterns as normal as possible, only now my job is finding a job and\ngetting myself in shape for what&apos;s out there.\n<br><br>\nIt wouldn&apos;t be news to anyone to hear that the job market, at least\nwhat I&apos;ve seen of it so far, is nothing like the verdant plains and\nvalleys of even 3 years ago - which is about the last time I took a\nserious look.  After a first survey of a few job boards online, I\nfired off a handful of resumes and apps, and took notes on what&apos;s\nbeing asked for so as to prepare some semblance of a learning plan\nwhile I&apos;m off.\n<br><br>\nSo by the end of last week, I&apos;d accomplished these various and sundry\nthings:\n<ul>\n<li> 5 cups of coffee consumed per day\n</li>\n<li> 1 resume updated and revised\n</li>\n<li> 6 resumes emailed and 4 online applications filled\n</li>\n<li> 5 profiles completed at online recruiting sites\n</li>\n<li> 1 application for unemployment filed\n</li>\n<li> 1 12&quot; G4 <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/PowerBook?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">PowerBook</font></span> acquired and configured\n</li>\n<li> 3 Microsoft operating systems installed and configured under Virtual PC\n</li>\n<li> 1 .NET Framework installed and exploration begun\n</li>\n<li> 1 novel finished, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0872863328/103-7733542-0669406?vi=glance\" target=\"_top\">Close to the Machine</a> by Ellen Ullman\n</li>\n<li> 6 hours of Metroid Prime played\n</li>\n</ul>\nThere&apos;s been more, but it&apos;s the amount of Metroid Prime play I&apos;m most\nproud of - had I not gotten out of the apartment in the morning, the\nhours invested in that would have been immensely greater.  Maybe after\nI&apos;ve fired off a few more resumes, I&apos;ll feel better about actually\ntaking a rest since my brane&apos;s been going full speed for months now at\nwork.\n<br><br>\nThought a bit about striking out on my own with freelance work, but\nthe Ellen Ullman book has given me a bit of a strange mood.  She makes\nworking for oneself sound both promising and desolate at once - though\nthe promising bits would seem to be the things that disappeared with\nthe 90&apos;s.  So that leaves it sounding pretty unpalatable.  Who knows,\nthough - I always wanted to work from (but not at) a coffee shop.  \n<br><br>\nWell, back to searching and my first baby steps with .NET - wish me\nluck.  And if you happen to be in town, stop by and say haloo.\n",

    "html": "<p>So <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooodh.html\" target=\"_top\">on this day last year</a>,\nI was excitely thinking about pipelining webservices together like commands in a\nUNIX command line shell.  Lately, I&#39;ve been doing quite a bit of work at the\ncommand line level, more so than I ever have before.  And for all the clunkiness\nand inelegances to be found there, I think the zen has stuck me.\n<br /><br />\nSure, it&#39;s an ass-ugly string of characters that connects commands\nlike find, sort, awk, sed, grep, and ssh together.  But, in constructing such\nmonstrosities, I find myself generating new disposable tools at a rate\nof at least one every minute or so.  And, though a few have found themselves graduating\ninto fuller, cleaner, more general tools, I would have been stuck for\nhours were it not for a quick multi-file grep across a vast plain of comma-separated\nvalue files digested by a tag team of sed and awk.  Then, like magic, I toss in\nan incredibly slow yet, at the time, convenient call to mysql on another server\nbehind a firewall via ssh with a SQL call constructed from the regurgitations\nof said sed and awk brothers.\n<br /><br />\nSo, I&#39;m thinking again:  How hot would this be if it were web services replacing\neach of my commands?  How hot would it be if there was a STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR\nfor a whole class of web services?  Imagine an enhanced bash or zsh piping these\nbeasts together.  For awhile, I thought my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XmlRpcFilteringPipe</a> API was the way to\ngo, but lately I&#39;ve been thinking more in the direction of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>.  I have to admit\nthat the XML-RPC API is a bit clunky to use, and besides, no one&#39;s really paid\nit much notice besides using it in the peculiar fashion I do to make my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a>.\n<br /><br />\nHow about this for a simpler API:  Post data to a URL, receive data in response.\nThere&#39;s your STDIN and STDOUT.  What about STDERR?  Well, I suppose it&#39;s an\neither-or affair, but standard HTTP header error codes can fill in there.  What\nabout command line arguments?

Lately, I've been doing quite a bit of work at the\r\ncommand line level, more so than I ever have before.  And for all the clunkiness\r\nand inelegances to be found there, I think the zen has stuck me.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSure, it's an ass-ugly string of characters that connects commands\r\nlike find, sort, awk, sed, grep, and ssh together.  But, in constructing such\r\nmonstrosities, I find myself generating new disposable tools at a rate\r\nof at least one every minute or so.  And, though a few have found themselves graduating\r\ninto fuller, cleaner, more general tools, I would have been stuck for\r\nhours were it not for a quick multi-file grep across a vast plain of comma-separated\r\nvalue files digested by a tag team of sed and awk.  Then, like magic, I toss in\r\nan incredibly slow yet, at the time, convenient call to mysql on another server\r\nbehind a firewall via ssh with a SQL call constructed from the regurgitations\r\nof said sed and awk brothers.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo, I'm thinking again:  How hot would this be if it were web services replacing\r\neach of my commands?  How hot would it be if there was a STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR\r\nfor a whole class of web services?  Imagine an enhanced bash or zsh piping these\r\nbeasts together.  For awhile, I thought my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XmlRpcFilteringPipe</a> API was the way to\r\ngo, but lately I've been thinking more in the direction of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>.

He just set up an Agent Frank <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/WikiPage?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">WikiPage</font></span> with download and install instructions. \n<p>I'm downloading now (it's pretty huge - like 11 megs), but the Wiki page has lots of good info, including Les' new acronym, PIIC. ... Very cool. I'm going to start playing right now. <br />\n...<br />\nLater... Urgh! It's GPLed! Bleh! </blockquote><div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://beattie.info/notebook/20030215.html#131352\">The UPP Lives: OxDECAFBAD Launches Agent Frank </a></cite>.</small></div></p>\n<p>So Russell noticed my late night release of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AgentFrank\">AgentFrank</a>.  Cool!  Hope it actually works for him.</p>\n<p>Currently it's very big, because it's got everything in it, all the JARs and the kitchen sink from everything I thought I'd start using at some point.  My actual original code is likely less than 100k so far, if that.  Suggestions are <strong>more</strong> than welcome.  </p>\n<p>The same goes for the license - all I want out of this thing is to share it and get interested tinkerers tinkering.  It'd be nice if anyone who tinkers with it gets credit for said tinkering, but that's about all I care about.  Hell, if it gets incorporated into a commercial product, I'd like some credit, and some cash would be nice, but otherwise I'd just be flattered.  Is there a license to cover that?  Maybe I should research a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a> license.</p>\n<p>This first code dump is very much premature - I'm not even pretending that this deserves a version number.  It's more a conversation piece and an a tangible starting point to play with things I've been thinking.  It's 99% crap code that apparently works, at this point.  I fully expect it to get rewritten before it rates a version number.</p>\n<p>So... have at it.  Play with it, make fun of it, send me patches and abuse.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooodab\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084861\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://stevenf.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ae2c0b2d1d3219cac5409a77a1c99fb2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://stevenf.com/\">stevenf</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084861\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-02-16T02:12:36\">2003-02-16T02:12:36</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Cool!

I stay away from all GPLed code as a general rule. I like GPL, but I don't want to break any licenses.\nIMHO, the internet was built on BSD, not the GPL. BSD allows commercial use and many times that's what's needed to get to that next technical level.\nBut to each his own, if you go with GPL I totally support that decision. :-)\n-Russ</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084868\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=409d5681415763e28c25affcc3b611b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Tony</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084868\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-02-19T00:09:46\">2003-02-19T00:09:46</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I do not understand people like Russ that do not understand the GPL but attack it when they get the chance.

I've been attempting to dig into the code in little bits and spurts for the last week. I'm not quite sure that I've grokked it all -- I'll probably start trying to strip things out to see if I've got the basics down (already got a project set up in Eclipse for it), but that's still dependent on my work load (in other words, it'll happen in the fifteen minutes of spare time I have between eating my lunch and getting back to work).\nI've been thinking about building something of a similar nature for some time, but never had gotten around to actually doing it. I'm pretty impressed so far. One thing, though, that I might do differently (though you seem to be headed down the right track already) would be to strip the core down to the most minimal basics. In fact, I would even consider (I know this is stepping out a bit) making the proxy piece itself a plugin/module/whatever you want to call it. \nAlso, it would be nice (and I'm not sure this isn't already in there) if plugins could modify the settings of the rest of the system. One thing I would like to see is the ability to point the proxy at another proxy, but I'd like this to be configurable. At our office, they use the Microsoft ISA proxy server, but only have the NTLM based authentication enabled, so non-MS products can't get through it. However, I use a local app that acts as an HTTP proxy and rewrites everything for the ISA server. It works well, but it's a pain to keep all my apps setup for this since I work on a laptop and often switch networks. If I could write some java code to detect whether the outside network is reachable, I could tell the AgentFrank proxy whether to hit the HTTP-ISA proxy or not.\nJust my $0.02. Great start. I'll have to see what I can dig out of it.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084879\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webweavertech.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4759e194dd2189c027a29a2104451bb7&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webweavertech.com/\">Ovidiu Predescu</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084879\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-02-24T08:40:14\">2003-02-24T08:40:14</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">If you care about someone else's developments to your code to be freely available, LGPL is perhaps the best option.

Cool!  Hope it actually works for him.</p>\r\n<p>Currently it's very big, because it's got everything in it, all the JARs and the kitchen sink from everything I thought I'd start using at some point.  My actual original code is likely less than 100k so far, if that.  Suggestions are <strong>more</strong> than welcome.  </p>\r\n<p>The same goes for the license - all I want out of this thing is to share it and get interested tinkerers tinkering.  It'd be nice if anyone who tinkers with it gets credit for said tinkering, but that's about all I care about.  Hell, if it gets incorporated into a commercial product, I'd like some credit, and some cash would be nice, but otherwise I'd just be flattered.  Is there a license to cover that?  Maybe I should research a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a> license.</p>\r\n<p>This first code dump is very much premature - I'm not even pretending that this deserves a version number.  It's more a conversation piece and an a tangible starting point to play with things I've been thinking.  It's 99% crap code that apparently works, at this point.  I fully expect it to get rewritten before it rates a version number.</p>\r\n<p>So... have at it.  Play with it, make fun of it, send me patches and abuse.</p>\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=ooodab\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084861\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://stevenf.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ae2c0b2d1d3219cac5409a77a1c99fb2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://stevenf.com/\">stevenf</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084861\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-02-16T02:12:36\">2003-02-16T02:12:36</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Cool!

cause you so much strife. I wrongly assumed that you had chose GPL because of political reasons. Here's my post in January on GPL:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/20030102.html#095658\r\n\r\nBasically, I give my code away without strings, and I like the code I use to be the same, just in case there's a way some day for me to commercialize it. I stay away from all GPLed code as a general rule. I like GPL, but I don't want to break any licenses.\r\n\r\nIMHO, the internet was built on BSD, not the GPL. BSD allows commercial use and many times that's what's needed to get to that next technical level.\r\n\r\nBut to each his own, if you go with GPL I totally support that decision. :-)\r\n\r\n-Russ</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084868\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=409d5681415763e28c25affcc3b611b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Tony</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084868\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-02-19T00:09:46\">2003-02-19T00:09:46</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I do not understand people like Russ that do not understand the GPL but attack it when they get the chance.

I've been attempting to dig into the code in little bits and spurts for the last week. I'm not quite sure that I've grokked it all -- I'll probably start trying to strip things out to see if I've got the basics down (already got a project set up in Eclipse for it), but that's still dependent on my work load (in other words, it'll happen in the fifteen minutes of spare time I have between eating my lunch and getting back to work).\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about building something of a similar nature for some time, but never had gotten around to actually doing it. I'm pretty impressed so far. One thing, though, that I might do differently (though you seem to be headed down the right track already) would be to strip the core down to the most minimal basics. In fact, I would even consider (I know this is stepping out a bit) making the proxy piece itself a plugin/module/whatever you want to call it. \r\n\r\nAlso, it would be nice (and I'm not sure this isn't already in there) if plugins could modify the settings of the rest of the system. One thing I would like to see is the ability to point the proxy at another proxy, but I'd like this to be configurable. At our office, they use the Microsoft ISA proxy server, but only have the NTLM based authentication enabled, so non-MS products can't get through it. However, I use a local app that acts as an HTTP proxy and rewrites everything for the ISA server. It works well, but it's a pain to keep all my apps setup for this since I work on a laptop and often switch networks. If I could write some java code to detect whether the outside network is reachable, I could tell the AgentFrank proxy whether to hit the HTTP-ISA proxy or not.\r\n\r\nJust my $0.02. Great start. I'll have to see what I can dig out of it.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084879\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webweavertech.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4759e194dd2189c027a29a2104451bb7&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webweavertech.com/\">Ovidiu Predescu</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084879\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-02-24T08:40:14\">2003-02-24T08:40:14</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">If you care about someone else's developments to your code to be freely available, LGPL is perhaps the best option.

Cool!  Hope it actually works for him.</p>\n<p>Currently it&apos;s very big, because it&apos;s got everything in it, all the JARs and the kitchen sink from everything I thought I&apos;d start using at some point.  My actual original code is likely less than 100k so far, if that.  Suggestions are <strong>more</strong> than welcome.  </p>\n<p>The same goes for the license - all I want out of this thing is to share it and get interested tinkerers tinkering.  It&apos;d be nice if anyone who tinkers with it gets credit for said tinkering, but that&apos;s about all I care about.  Hell, if it gets incorporated into a commercial product, I&apos;d like some credit, and some cash would be nice, but otherwise I&apos;d just be flattered.  Is there a license to cover that?  Maybe I should research a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a> license.</p>\n<p>This first code dump is very much premature - I&apos;m not even pretending that this deserves a version number.  It&apos;s more a conversation piece and an a tangible starting point to play with things I&apos;ve been thinking.  It&apos;s 99% crap code that apparently works, at this point.  I fully expect it to get rewritten before it rates a version number.</p>\n<p>So... have at it.  Play with it, make fun of it, send me patches and abuse.</p>\n",

I&#8217;ve always found it irritating that news aggregators insert their URL into the referrer field. ... It would be nice if there was some sort of browser header the aggregator could send to identify itself instead of using the referrer field. Oh, that&#8217;s right, there is. It&#8217;s called User-Agent. \n<p>The user agent field is designed for browsers, robots, and other user agents to identify themselves to the Web server. You can even add additional information, like a contact URL or email address. I&#8217;d like to see aggregators start using it. <br />\n</blockquote><div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://kalsey.com/blog/2003/01/referral_abuse/index.html\">Kalsey Consulting Group: Referral Abuse</a></cite>.</small></div></p>\n<p>Hmm, being mostly a standards neophyte, I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000185.phtml#000185\" target=\"_top\">thought this was a great idea</a>, you know, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/NeatLikeDigitalWatches\">NeatLikeDigitalWatches</a>.  I thought this was more a semi-clever <strong>overloading</strong> of the referer, rather than outright abuse.  And this, I thought, was reasonably okay since there wasn't, I thought, anywhere else to stick a backlink to myself while consuming <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds.</p>\n<p>Well, yeah, now that I read some of the complaints against this use of referers, I agree.  And, yes, now that I read the fine RFC, I see that the User-Agent string is more appropriate for this purpose.</p>\n<p>So!  From now on, hits from my copy of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> will leave behind a User-Agent string similar to this:</p>\n<p><code>\"AmphetaDesk/0.93 (darwin; http: //www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/; http: //www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml)\"</code></p>\n<p>I tack my own personal thanks URL onto the end of the list within the parenthesis.  In addition, I no longer send a referrer string when I download <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds.  How did I do it?  Very simply.</p>\n<p>First, I modify my <code>AmphetaDesk/data/mySettings.xml</code> file by hand to supply a blank referer and a new user URL (having some angle-bracket problems, bear with me):<blockquote><code><br />\n[user]<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... <br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[http_referer][/http_referer]<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[user_url]http://www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml[/user_url]<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />\n[/user]<br />\n</verbatim><br />\n</code></blockquote>Second, I modified <code>AmphetaDesk/lib/AmphetaDesk/Settings.pm</code> to account for the new setting:<blockquote><code>...<br />\n   $SETTINGS{user_http_referer}               = \"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\";<br />\n   $SETTINGS{user_user_url}                   = \"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\";<br />\n   $SETTINGS{user_link_target}                = \"_blank\";<br />\n...</code></blockquote>Third, I modified the <code>create_ua()</code> subroutine in <code>AmphetaDesk/lib/AmphetaDesk/WWW.pm</code> to actually use the new setting:<blockquote><code><br />\nsub create_ua {<br />\n...<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my $ua = new LWP::UserAgent; $ua->env_proxy();<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ua->timeout(get_setting(\"user_request_timeout\"));<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my ($app_v, $app_u, $app_o, $user_u) = (get_setting(\"app_version\"),<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get_setting(\"app_url\"), get_setting(\"app_os\"), get_setting(\"user_user_url\"));<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ua->agent(\"AmphetaDesk/$app_v ($app_o; $app_u; $user_u)\");<br />\n...<br />\n}<br />\n</code></blockquote>And voila - no more referer abuse.  If you want to discover my thank-you message, examine the User-Agent string.  Seems like this would be a good idea for all news aggregators to pick up.  And if I get ambitious and have spare time today, I'll be sending off a patch to <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/about/morbus.shtml\" target=\"_top\">Morbus</a> &amp; friends later today.</p>\n<p><b>Update</b>: Gagh!

This would help feed producers who have access to Referer reports.\nI'm sure I'm missing something.

I&#8217;ve always found it irritating that news aggregators insert their URL into the referrer field. ... It would be nice if there was some sort of browser header the aggregator could send to identify itself instead of using the referrer field. Oh, that&#8217;s right, there is. It&#8217;s called User-Agent. \r\n<p>The user agent field is designed for browsers, robots, and other user agents to identify themselves to the Web server. You can even add additional information, like a contact URL or email address. I&#8217;d like to see aggregators start using it. <br />\r\n</blockquote><div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://kalsey.com/blog/2003/01/referral_abuse/index.html\">Kalsey Consulting Group: Referral Abuse</a></cite>.</small></div></p>\r\n<p>Hmm, being mostly a standards neophyte, I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000185.phtml#000185\" target=\"_top\">thought this was a great idea</a>, you know, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/NeatLikeDigitalWatches\">NeatLikeDigitalWatches</a>.  I thought this was more a semi-clever <strong>overloading</strong> of the referer, rather than outright abuse.  And this, I thought, was reasonably okay since there wasn't, I thought, anywhere else to stick a backlink to myself while consuming <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds.</p>\r\n<p>Well, yeah, now that I read some of the complaints against this use of referers, I agree.  And, yes, now that I read the fine RFC, I see that the User-Agent string is more appropriate for this purpose.</p>\r\n<p>So!  From now on, hits from my copy of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> will leave behind a User-Agent string similar to this:</p>\r\n<p><code>\"AmphetaDesk/0.93 (darwin; http: //www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/; http: //www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml)\"</code></p>\r\n<p>I tack my own personal thanks URL onto the end of the list within the parenthesis.  In addition, I no longer send a referrer string when I download <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds.  How did I do it?  Very simply.</p>\r\n<p>First, I modify my <code>AmphetaDesk/data/mySettings.xml</code> file by hand to supply a blank referer and a new user URL (having some angle-bracket problems, bear with me):<blockquote><code><br />\r\n[user]<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... <br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[http_referer][/http_referer]<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[user_url]http://www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml[/user_url]<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />\r\n[/user]<br />\r\n</verbatim><br />\r\n</code></blockquote>Second, I modified <code>AmphetaDesk/lib/AmphetaDesk/Settings.pm</code> to account for the new setting:<blockquote><code>...<br />\r\n   $SETTINGS{user_http_referer}               = \"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\";<br />\r\n   $SETTINGS{user_user_url}                   = \"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\";<br />\r\n   $SETTINGS{user_link_target}                = \"_blank\";<br />\r\n...</code></blockquote>Third, I modified the <code>create_ua()</code> subroutine in <code>AmphetaDesk/lib/AmphetaDesk/WWW.pm</code> to actually use the new setting:<blockquote><code><br />\r\nsub create_ua {<br />\r\n...<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my $ua = new LWP::UserAgent; $ua->env_proxy();<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ua->timeout(get_setting(\"user_request_timeout\"));<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my ($app_v, $app_u, $app_o, $user_u) = (get_setting(\"app_version\"),<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get_setting(\"app_url\"), get_setting(\"app_os\"), get_setting(\"user_user_url\"));<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ua->agent(\"AmphetaDesk/$app_v ($app_o; $app_u; $user_u)\");<br />\r\n...<br />\r\n}<br />\r\n</code></blockquote>And voila - no more referer abuse.  If you want to discover my thank-you message, examine the User-Agent string.  Seems like this would be a good idea for all news aggregators to pick up.  And if I get ambitious and have spare time today, I'll be sending off a patch to <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/about/morbus.shtml\" target=\"_top\">Morbus</a> &amp; friends later today.</p>\r\n<p><b>Update</b>: Gagh!

I&#x2019;ve always found it irritating that news aggregators insert their URL into the referrer field. ... It would be nice if there was some sort of browser header the aggregator could send to identify itself instead of using the referrer field. Oh, that&#x2019;s right, there is. It&#x2019;s called User-Agent. \n<p>The user agent field is designed for browsers, robots, and other user agents to identify themselves to the Web server. You can even add additional information, like a contact URL or email address. I&#x2019;d like to see aggregators start using it. <br>\n</p></blockquote><div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://kalsey.com/blog/2003/01/referral_abuse/index.html\">Kalsey Consulting Group: Referral Abuse</a></cite>.</small></div><p></p>\n<p>Hmm, being mostly a standards neophyte, I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000185.phtml#000185\" target=\"_top\">thought this was a great idea</a>, you know, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/NeatLikeDigitalWatches\">NeatLikeDigitalWatches</a>.  I thought this was more a semi-clever <strong>overloading</strong> of the referer, rather than outright abuse.  And this, I thought, was reasonably okay since there wasn&apos;t, I thought, anywhere else to stick a backlink to myself while consuming <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds.</p>\n<p>Well, yeah, now that I read some of the complaints against this use of referers, I agree.  And, yes, now that I read the fine RFC, I see that the User-Agent string is more appropriate for this purpose.</p>\n<p>So!  From now on, hits from my copy of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> will leave behind a User-Agent string similar to this:</p>\n<p><code>&quot;AmphetaDesk/0.93 (darwin; http: //www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/; http: //www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml)&quot;</code></p>\n<p>I tack my own personal thanks URL onto the end of the list within the parenthesis.  In addition, I no longer send a referrer string when I download <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds.  How did I do it?  Very simply.</p>\n<p>First, I modify my <code>AmphetaDesk/data/mySettings.xml</code> file by hand to supply a blank referer and a new user URL (having some angle-bracket problems, bear with me):</p><blockquote><code><br>\n[user]<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;... <br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;[http_referer][/http_referer]<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;[user_url]http://www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml[/user_url]<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;...<br>\n[/user]<br>\n<br>\n</code></blockquote>Second, I modified <code>AmphetaDesk/lib/AmphetaDesk/Settings.pm</code> to account for the new setting:<blockquote><code>...<br>\n   $SETTINGS{user_http_referer}               = &quot;http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/&quot;;<br>\n   $SETTINGS{user_user_url}                   = &quot;http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/&quot;;<br>\n   $SETTINGS{user_link_target}                = &quot;_blank&quot;;<br>\n...</code></blockquote>Third, I modified the <code>create_ua()</code> subroutine in <code>AmphetaDesk/lib/AmphetaDesk/WWW.pm</code> to actually use the new setting:<blockquote><code><br>\nsub create_ua {<br>\n...<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;my $ua = new LWP::UserAgent; $ua-&gt;env_proxy();<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;$ua-&gt;timeout(get_setting(&quot;user_request_timeout&quot;));<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;my ($app_v, $app_u, $app_o, $user_u) = (get_setting(&quot;app_version&quot;),<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;get_setting(&quot;app_url&quot;), get_setting(&quot;app_os&quot;), get_setting(&quot;user_user_url&quot;));<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;$ua-&gt;agent(&quot;AmphetaDesk/$app_v ($app_o; $app_u; $user_u)&quot;);<br>\n...<br>\n}<br>\n</code></blockquote>And voila - no more referer abuse.  If you want to discover my thank-you message, examine the User-Agent string.  Seems like this would be a good idea for all news aggregators to pick up.  And if I get ambitious and have spare time today, I&apos;ll be sending off a patch to <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/about/morbus.shtml\" target=\"_top\">Morbus</a> &amp; friends later today.<p></p>\n<p><b>Update</b>: Gagh!  This has been the hardest post to try to format correctly within the fancy schmancy auto-formatting widgets I have piped together.  All apologies for content resembling garbage.  I think I&apos;ll use this excuse in the future whenever I write something completely daft.  (Which means I&apos;ll be using it a lot, most likely.)</p>\n",

I've got <a href=\"http://www.hpl.hp.com/semweb/jena.htm\" target=\"_top\">Jena</a> and <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/\" target=\"_top\">Lucene</a> and <a href=\"http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_top\">HSQL</a> and <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/index.html\" target=\"_top\">BSF</a> and <a href=\"http://www.part.net/quartz.html\" target=\"_top\">Quartz</a> and <a href=\"http://muffin.doit.org\" target=\"_top\">Muffin</a> and...  well, a lot of stuff that feels pretty nice to me.</p>\n<p>But, with respect to <a href=\"http://www.beanshell.org\" target=\"_top\">BeanShell</a> in particular, I've got a lot of the nifty live hackability that I had with the things I was playing with in Python.  With no more than 5 lines of code, I've tossed a live interactive shell into my running proxy, into which I can telnet or access via Java console in a browser.

Then, I bought a 2400 baud modem with an adapter, and became the envy of everyone - until they all moved up to 2400 and then 14.4K.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m sure someone else can give me an oh yeah, too, and we can work up a skit ala <a href=\"http://www.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=003KZC\" target=\"_top\">Monty Python&apos;s &quot;We Were Poor&quot;</a>.

    "summary": "<blockquote cite=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001222.html\">Dear Operating System Vendors. \n<p>I no longer want to know where my files are stored. I no longer care. I have hordes of directories on my various computers called stuff ,downloads and documents , and the effort that it would take to organise them into a proper heirarchy is just not worth it. The heirarchical filesystem is a really wonderful thing for programmers and websites, but it just doesn&apos;t cut it for personal use. </p>\n<p>I no longer care where my files are stored. </p></blockquote><div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001222.html\">The Fishbowl: Filesystem sacrilege</a></cite>.</small></div><p></p>\n<p>I&apos;ll be burned at the next stake over from Charles when the time comes, for this filesystem heresy.  Just the other night, a co-worker was asking me about how diligent I was in organizing my email.  I told her, &quot;Not at all.  I leave it all in one pile and then run the Find command on it later.&quot;  She was shocked that I, alpha geek and info freako, didn&apos;t have some intricate taxonomy of folders into which mail was sorted by carefully crafted filters.</p>\n<p>Years ago, when I first started using email, I did indeed do this with procmail and other arcane beasties.  Then, I found myself cursing that I couldn&apos;t do cross-folder searches very easily.  Also, the filters and folders started making less sense as their structure represented only one possible scheme for finding what I was looking for, and I was needing many possible kinds of schemes over time.  So, eventually it all ended up in one pile, and searches became my way of finding things.</p>\n<p>I abandoned bookmarks for Google by the same principle.  Now, my bookmarks consist completely of bookmarklets and a few stray links to local on-disk pages like Python documentation.  In fact, I&apos;m wishing that I could create bookmark folders that are fed by Google API powered persistent searches.</p>\n<p>So, now I&apos;m looking balefully upon my filesystem.  I haven&apos;t had much chance to play with BeOS, but I&apos;ve read about <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558604979\" target=\"_top\">the design of the BeOS file system</a> and drooled.  I hear about <a href=\"http://www.winsupersite.com/faq/longhorn.asp\" target=\"_top\">Microsoft&apos;s Longhorn and its WinFS</a> and grind my teeth - I very much dislike Microsoft, but if they pulled this off, I&apos;d have to sing their praises.  Apple?  Do they have any aces up their sleeves in this regard?  Don&apos;t let a new fanboy down.  :)</p>\n<p>Anyway, that&apos;s what I want to see:  Storage without explicit organization, but with super-rich metadata for super-fast searches.  Allow me to create views made from persistent searches - my &quot;project folder&quot; is simply a collection of resources tied together by a common tag, one of many.  And, if I want to form a project hierarchy, make my persistent searches into file objects too.  </p>\n<p>The main thing in all this, though, is that it be woven very deeply within the OS.  I don&apos;t want a helper app.  I want this to replace the standard metaphor completely.</p>\n<p>RDF triples at the inode-level anyone?  Heh, heh.</p>\n",

As easy as the links-and-commentary genre is with all the blogging apps out there, I&#39;m too lazy for the commentary bit, and so I tend to drag-and-drop links to my desktop for later posting -- and then promptly forget about them. Consequently my desktop is a mess, and my blog is stagnating. Bad.</i>\n<br /><br />\nSo... what he made, with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AppleScript\">AppleScript</a>&#39;s Folder Actions, is a magic folder on his desktop.  When links are dropped into the folder, a script is triggered which posts the link to a weblog via <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BloggerAPI\">BloggerAPI</a>.  I&#39;ve tweaked it a bit to ask me for a link title, quote, and a tiny bit of commentary, but it still needs a bit more work.\n<br /><br />\nI had never heard of Folder Actions before this.  This is very nifty stuff - blogging woven into the OS X desktop itself with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AppleScript\">AppleScript</a>.  Whew.\n<br /><br />\nWhat I&#39;d <strong>really</strong> love is to be able to drop a folder onto my dock, and then drop things onto it there.  I&#39;m thinking of a bunch of &quot;bins&quot; on the dock that shuttle files off to different destinations and through various transformations, right there, always in view.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ooochc</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082645\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://disco.ucsd.edu/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3c561e62d8fc9a93d5409bea44cf1231&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://disco.ucsd.edu/blog\">Michael McCracken</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082645\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-01-16T18:28:12\">2003-01-16T18:28:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Your dock idea works fine - try it.

Probably a sign of old age.\nAnyway, I'll keep my eyes on the project, and when it appears you're ready for the semi-literate to start playing - or when I have free time to code and can convince myself I want this bad enough - then I'll grab it.\nThanks for listening,\nEwan</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
