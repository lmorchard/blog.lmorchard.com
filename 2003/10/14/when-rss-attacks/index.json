This kind of thing is what's wrong.  We need to take\nat least three deep breaths before reacting like this, whether\nor not we've taken 900 beep breaths in the past already.  It's the\nnature of these things.  As an interested but outside observer, the\natmosphere created by such reactions makes me very sad.  And it's not\njust one person doing this, either.\n\n\n\nSo, chill out.  It's just data.  In fact, the proposal at question\nhere is just a friggen outline of feeds!  It's just a list of\nlists!  Most of the geeks out there just want to play, and are happy\nto have more geeks to play with.  Can't we just get along and play the\ngame together, rather than gaming each other?",
