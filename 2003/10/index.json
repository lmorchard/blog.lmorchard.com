So, I won't make any attempt to catalog the new things.\n\n\nA few impressions though:\n\n\nEverything feels faster.  Windows slide around and resize like they've been waxed underneath.  Things seem to launch faster.\nA few small things have improved, like System Preferences quitting when I close the window, rather than hanging around waiting for me to open the window again or quit.\nSome third-party extension I had installed threw Finder into a launch-and-crash loop for awhile.  So, if you've yet to install, try to purge your system of extensions first.  This should be obvious, but is sometimes a surprise when it's actually a problem.\nExpose looked like a neat feature when I first heard of it.  I fully expected it to be slow, stuttery, and 'cute' when I finally played with it.  Now, having used it and slowly incorporating it into my usage habits, it's amazing.  Smooth and not stuttery at all, it looks like a computer interface feature from the movies.\nFast user switching, where desktops rotate in and out of view, also looks like you wish it would, and seems like it's from the movies.\nI hate metal.\nI hate metal.\nI hate metal.\n\n\nThat is all.

    "summary": "For the past year or two, I've been trying an experiment in my\npersonal research and learning.  I've been seeking out tools and\ntechnologies which are as different as possible from those with which\nI already have experience.  I want to break up some prejudices and\nhabits I have, and expose myself to more ways of looking at things.\nNow that I write this, it sounds like a great approach to life in\ngeneral, but for now I'm focusing on computer science.  :)\n\n\n\nMy success \nwith this has been entirely dependant on free time and brain cycles,\nof which I've had precious little.  But, I have managed to wean myself\naway from Perl to learning Python, developing a few apps with it and\nincorporating it into my problem solving kit.  I've also managed to\nget myself away from XEmacs for hours at a time in order to weave Vim\ninto my work-a-day life.  These two things haven't been easy for me,\nsince I've been using both Perl and some variant of Emacs for almost\n12 years now, and I've done my share of sneering at that which is not\nperl or emacs.  \n\n\n\nAnd, although I've yet to spring upon them, I've also been making wary, \nnarrowing circles around Lisp, Smalltalk, Prolog, and .NET.  There\nbeen occasional forays into Java, as well as my daily attachment to\nFlash and Actionscript lately.  And then, there've been my hefting and\nswinging of XSLT and XPath, as well as RDF, countered by a few feints\nwith plaintext shell tools and YAML.  There's been more, but most\ninvestigations have been too tentative to mention.\n\n\n\nIf there's a \"holy war\" between two things, I want to explore them both.\nI tend to see two apparently intelligent parties in an extended debate\nover which of them has a hold on the One True Way.  In my\nexperience, though, there's a high likelyhood that such a phenomenon\npoints toward a real truth which lies somewhere inbetween.  (This, of\ncourse, ignoring such cases where one party is correct, and the other\nis WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!)  There tend to be very good reasons why smart\npeople on either side of a fence have taken up with what they have,\nand I want to know both sides thoroughly.  I know full well that both\nsides have at least some valid criticisms against the other, but I\nwant a synthesis of the two.\n\n\n\nIn this field of computer science, there\nare as many ways of working with the dreamstuff as there\nare ways of structuring thoughts.  And, rather than there ever being\nOne True Way to do things, there will always be another smart person\ndeveloping another powerfully expressive and insightful way of doing\nthings.  Someday, I'd like to be one of those smart people, so I need\nto have a sense for that truth in the middle that other One True Ways \nbracket and zero in on.  And then, I want to know enough to jump out\nof the frame altogether, and in which ways I can invert and twist\nthings to encircle some new spark.\n\n\n\nSomeday in the next few years, I'd like to get back into school so I\ncan get to even higher levels of growing up to be a computer scientist.\nBut for now, it's back to work for me.  And, if you happen to think of\nany geeky holy wars, let me know.  I'm collecting them for study.",

    "summary": "I agree with Derek Balling [who criticized Foo Camp], and when you come back to earth, I bet you will too Jeremy.\nDid I read that you guys had meetings about RSS? At a private invitation-only event? Do you realize how WRONG that is?\n\nSource:Dave Winer in a comment on \"Some Foo Camp Links\"\n\n\nOne of the sessions on Sunday morning at FOO Camp was a brainstorming session on how a site could provide a list of feeds.\n...A working name for this effort is \"FDML\".  The stands for Feed (Discovery / Directory / Detailing) Markup Language, depending on who you ask. ;-)\n\nSource:Sam Ruby: FDML\n\n\nJust so it is absolutely clear: all I have done is listed a set of requirements, many if not most of which are directly from Jeremy himself.  The acronym was suggested by David Sifry.\nPeople are welcome to question, refine, or add to the requirements, or present proposals on how these requirements can best be implemented.  Perhaps even with OPML.\n\nSource:A later comment on Sam Ruby: FDML\n\n\nFor anyone who wonders why people talk about politics and animosity in\nthe tiny sphere of web syndication tech, here's a case in point.\n\n\n\nYou see, there was a private event over the weekend, called Foo Camp.\nTo this, many smart people were invited, and many more weren't.\nGrousing about invitations, funding, and elitism aside, it sounded\nlike a great time and a cool change from your average conference.  I\nhope it turns into a regular event, and hope that someday I'm given\nthe opportunity to go to something like it.  I'm sure a lot of us\nout here would like to make it to something like that.\n\n\n\nBut, for what it was, you can only gather so many people before it\nbecomes a circus (or a conference).  Charging a price serves as a\nlimiter, while making the event invitation-only works as well.  The\ndifference is whether you're bringing in people who can afford it\nversus people who are favored by the organizer.  Either way, someone's\ngoing to be pissed about not going.  The difference is whether you're\npissed off at the organizer's economics or the organizer's\npersonality.  Oh well.\n\n\n\nSo anyway, around mid-September, Jeremy Zawodny had floated\nan idea\ninvolving publishing and discovery of lists of RSS feeds.\nHe was one of those invited to Foo Camp, and in one of their\nhuddles, he brought the idea up for a brainstorming session.\nFrom the sounds of it, they tossed around a few ideas, but\ndidn't really come up with much other than that it was an idea\nworth discussing.\n\n\n\nNo sooner than the camp breaks up, though, and the angry buzz\nhas already started.  How dare a bunch of geeks talk about\ntechnology they're interested in while at a private gathering?\nHow dare they not invite all of us?  Conspiracy!  Elitism!\nThey didn't pick me for their kickball team!  By the way,\nthis isn't an attempt to put words in mouths.  This is my\noff-the-cuff impression of what I read yesterday.  It all\nseems repeatedly and unnecessarily childish to me, and it's\ncertainly not limited to one person.\n\n\n\nSo, by today, there's already\na wiki\ndevoted to exploring this idea, along with a scattering of blog\nposts. This seems pretty speedy to me,\nconsidering campers returning to the work-a-day world after\na geek retreat.  This doesn't seem at all the work of a sinister\ncabal bent on wresting control and domination over a technology,\nas what I saw implied in the first comment I quoted above.\n\n\n\nDave Winer's already posted a\nfirst proposal\ntoward implementing the idea.  And, believe it or not, as Sam comments\non above, this approach has not been ruled out.  In fact,\nJeremy had suggested using OPML in his original posting of the idea.\n\n\n\nWhy couldn't we just have seen the collaboration without the\nantagonism, in at least this case?  Yeah, there was a small, private\ngathering at which discussions were had.  Sounds like what happens at\nwork, or with friends, or in classes.  Granted, I suppose an argument\ncould be made concerning the relative openness of these gatherings as\ncompared to Foo Camp.  But, this is mooted by the fact that the\npeople involved were already moving toward sharing the discussion.\n\n\n\nFor all the grousing about flame wars and personality clashes on\nmailing lists and working groups, sometimes it's nice to work on an\nidea in a smaller group with a good dynamic.  It helps to get\nsomething together before throwing the doors open to have the thing\nbuffeted by opinions and criticism from all sides.  It's one way to\navoid \"stop\nenergy\" while trying to build some momentum.\n\n\n\nAs Dave himself wrote, \"I heard at a working group meeting that things\nlike SOAP can only happen when no one is paying attention.\"  So, it\nsounds like a bunch of geeks tried to get something rolling before the\nattentional heat lamps turned on it.  Had they wanted to be a sinister\ncabal, we certainly wouldn't have heard about any of this until long,\nlong after the event.  It would have been kept behind closed corporate\ndoors until the day of embrace-and-extend.  Then, profit!  As it is, I\nthink they erred on the side of throwing open the discussion\ntoo early.\n\n\n\nSo anyway, the reason I write at such length about this is that I\ndon't think that this should be let to pass without comment or\nconsideration.  This kind of thing is what's wrong.  We need to take\nat least three deep breaths before reacting like this, whether\nor not we've taken 900 beep breaths in the past already.  It's the\nnature of these things.  As an interested but outside observer, the\natmosphere created by such reactions makes me very sad.  And it's not\njust one person doing this, either.\n\n\n\nSo, chill out.  It's just data.  In fact, the proposal at question\nhere is just a friggen outline of feeds!  It's just a list of\nlists!  Most of the geeks out there just want to play, and are happy\nto have more geeks to play with.  Can't we just get along and play the\ngame together, rather than gaming each other?",

    "summary": "In response to the opposition to RSS-Data,\nMarc asks,\n\"Where are the Reviews, Resumes, Recipes, Topics and other cool new\nforms of micro-content?\"\n\n\nWell, I did a bit of Googling this morning, and this is what I found:\n\n\n\nOn the subject of reviews, A.M. Kuchling\nhas provided an\nRDF namespace\nfor embedding book review metadata within XHTML documents.\n\n\nFor resumes,\nUldis Bojars\nhas been working on an\nRDF schema for resumes and CV.\n\n\nTo offer up recipes, I found\nthis RDF schema\nfor recipes hosted on\ndonnafales.com.\n\n\nAs for topics, well, there's already a straight RSS 2.0 namespace\nextension called Easy News Topics.\n\n\nAnd, finally, for events there is\nmod_event,\nand RSS 1.0 module used for presenting calendar event information.\n\n\n\nYes, with the exception of ENT, these are RDF schema or namespaces.\nBut, any one of them could likely be adapted to straight XML and used as an RSS 2.0\nnamespace, thereby leveraging the work these people have already done\nin modeling these kinds of content, as well as potentially providing\nan easy transformation path to RDF for those who care.\n\n\nWhat does RSS-Data provide out of the box which makes any of the\nabove obsolete?  There's no magic here, other than translating between\nraw data sctructures.  You'll still need to do the same sort of\nmodeling and structure work that the authors of all the above have\ndone.

This prevents issues like\n each application hacking up its own validator or\n \"liberal RSS parser\". \n\n* Allows vocabulary to co-exist with technologies and\n tools that already support features specific to a\n schema language such as relational to XML mapping,\n object to XML mapping, directed editting, etc.\n\nSource:Finally Atom: Why use schema?\n\nDanny [Ayers]: \"...and the same can already be done using RSS 1.0 as it stands.\"\n\nBut are we talking about the same \"same\"?  The appeal of RSS-Data is that I don't need to work up a schema, get anyone to buy-in, or map anything to an external resource... I take an existing data structure, and plug it into a syndication feed. That's it.\n\nSource:Roger Benningfield in a comment on his \"RSS-Data: A Working Demo\" \n\nYes - we know that RDF can do many of the things RSS-Data was designed for.? But (believe it or not) it really has nothing to do with RSS 1.0 at all.? RSS-Data is about extending RSS 2.0.? OK?? Not RSS 1.0.\n\nThe point here being that the world is bi-forcated and what do we do?? Can't we all live together?? Can't we put our heads together and come up with solutions that BRIDGE between these two standards - which just happen to have almost the same dam name?\n\nI gotta believe there's a way that once we \"structure\" something - like a Calendar Events, Resumes, Recipes or Reviews - we SHOULD be able to express and subscribe to these micro-content?formats - via EITHER RSS 1.0 or RSS 2.0.\n\nOK - get it?? BRIDGE BETWEEN BOTH RSS 1.0 & RSS 2.0.? That's what we want.? BOTH!\nSource:Marc's Voice: We want BOTH RSS 1.0 & RSS 2.0!\n\nSo, it looks like this RSS-Data thing is gaining momentum and demos, so I'm guessing that it's going to become one of the thing us rock-bangers will have to contend with at some point or another in tinkering with things in syndication and interoperability.  I have my misgivings about it, which mostly center around the issue of schema.\n\nSee, the goal of RSS-Data, as I understand it, is to bridge raw data from one programming environment to another, and package it up to be syndicated within RSS feeds for which an existing infrastructure already exists.  So, it's \"easy\".  Just throw your data structures at a library, which serializes them into some magic XML.  At the receiving end, another library, written possibly in a different language altogether, transliterates the magic XML into local idiomatic data structures.  You never think much about XML, nor does the consumer of your data.\n\nBut...  we're still talking about structures here.  Whether they're represented by XML tags, RDF triples, RDF/XML serialization, or hashtables and arrays-- there's still a structure involved.  From whence did it come?\n\nAbout RSS-Data, Roger Benningfield writes, \"...I don't need to work up a schema...\", which is literally true.  He goes on to write, \"I take an existing data structure, and plug it into a syndication feed. That's it.\"\n\nFrom where did this \"existing data structure\" originate?  For my examples, I used an existing schema from the Amazon web services.  Where'd you get yours?\n\nI'd guess that you got it from somewhere in the bowels of your scripts, a hash or rough structure once limited to intra- or inter- module data exchange, but now pressed into service as a unit of interoperation.  I wouldn't expect that you'd put much specific effort toward making this data structure particularly concise or friendly for interoperation.  This might not be a big deal for now.  And anyway, why bother with it?  That's not the philosophy with this tech, as far as I understand it.  The idea, is that hopefully this data structure is already good enough for sharing.  And, luckily enough, this is sometimes the case.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe you're sitting down to come up with a new data structure for sharing, from scratch.  During this activity, I imagine that you'll be mulling over what goes where, what's contained by what, what this hash or dictionary key means versus that one.  You'll likely be deciding whether to use a string here, or a date time here, and you'll likely have some idea about ranges of values for various things.  This is a bit more abstract an activity than you may have gone through, were you simply creating an internal data structure for your app.  In this case, you'd likely be thinking more about the data in and of itself, rather than the specific needs of your app and its API. In my opinion, this is a bit better for sharing.\n\nBut, how's your documentation?  Will I be able to reliably accept data from your application by just looking at a write-up or a rough spec?  Will I have to walk through your source code to reverse engineer general usage?  Will I have to examine RSS-Data dumps to come up with a rough approximation of what to expect from your data structure?  If this is a data structure plucked from the depths of your script, who knows?  If this structure was designed specifically for sharing, I hope that you've documented as you go along.\n\nWhat RSS-Data makes me worry about is an abundance of fuzzy, adhoc structures for interchange that no one ever quite documents well enough because they're too busy hacking along and pushing things out the door.  Maybe they'll be good enough, given discipline and thoughtfulness, but then maybe they'll end up in a mess.  But, just like many scripting languages, there are no facilities in RSS-Data currently to either require or even merely encourage clean and documented interchange structures.\n\nThis is a code-first-schema-later approach:  The schema stems, eventually, from general usage and tradition, and if we're lucky, from documentation.  If the people hacking on the project have discipline and are thoughtful, this documentation will be well maintained, and changes well communicated.  It can be a train-wreck, but it doesn't have to be.\n\nOn the other hand, we can circle back to that Amazon Web Services schema I used in my previous examples.  This technology, XML Schema, represents the opposite approach: schema-first-code-later.  In coming up with such a schema, I think still think about information and data structures just as I would while hacking on a script and thinking about a native data structure for sharing.  It's just that, with this approach, I'm doing things in a different order and front-loading the thinking. \n\nBut, there's more: if I build something like an XML Schema, I'm creating something which is both documentation and a machine readable resource.  I'm sure someone out there is working on or has released tools or stylesheets to convert XML Schema into HTML or RTF or something human readable.  Hell, you could even apply some transformation to the schema to generate code or data entry forms.\n\nOnce I have a schema, implementing code to produce and handle XML data conforming to it isn't really all that much harder than using straight RSS-Data.  This is an item for much dispute, but my gut and limited experience tells me that the difference in complexity will usually be more like a dozen lines of code or less in a decent environment rather than, say, an order of magnitude.  I think we'll find that things will tend to be consistent with Phillip Pearson's example implementations of an RSS namespace extension versus an RSS-Data example.\n\nWhat we get for the added complexity, though, is certainty.  I can say, \"Here.  This is a URL to the schema for the XML data my application produces.\"  If I've lived up to my end \nof the bargain, you won't even need to see my application's code or documentation.  You can implement with the schema, and our apps will interoperate.  We can treat the data formats as separate entities from applications.  In other words, we can treat interchange as neutral ground.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that this business with schema carries with it a bit of overhead, as well as a demand that you do some homework.  You'll need to know more than your immediate programming environment.  You'll need to think about XML and XML schemas, and you can't just stay in your comfortable favorite environment of programing language idiom.  This is off-putting to some, to say the least.\n\nSo...  how about Marc's question?  \"Can't we all live together?? Can't we put our heads together and come up with solutions that BRIDGE between these two standards - which just happen to have almost the same dam name?\"  On the one side, I see hackers who want to get down and code, and who consider themselves and each other thoughtful and disciplined enough to do the right thing and prevent trainwrecks.  On the other side, I see hackers who want to put discipline and thoughtfulness upfront and in writing (or typing?) before they code, because they don't really trust themselves or others to keep from wrecking the trains all the time.\n\nPersonally, I want to live somewhere in the middle.  Just enough distrust of myself and others to discourage sloppy problems, but not too much so that I have to trudge through careful molasses to get anywhere.\n\nI don't think I'm thrilled with RSS-Data.  But if you're going to use RSS-Data anyway, but here's one thought out of all this:  Is there some way we could come up with an RSS-Data-analogue for schema?  Forget about XML schema and standards groups and the like.  Think about some semi-universal way of translating meta-data-structures composed within one's favorite scripting language which forms documentation and a promise about what to expect over the wire?  If done right, maybe we could even generate an XML schema with this, and that could be a bridge between the two approaches.  On the surface, it sounds like a wonky idea to me, but hey...\n\nThanks for bearing with me through this much-longer-than-usual post.  :)",

    "summary": "So, for the same of argument, yesterday I threw together\nexamples\nof what a use of RSS-Data might look like alongside what\nthe same data in an RSS namespace extension might look like.\nI promised code, but never got a chance to circle back around.\nFortunately, Phillip Pearson\nconnected the rest of the dots for me with two examples:\n\n\nParsing RSS-Data\nParsing an RSS namespace extension\n\n\nI was just a little surprised by his results, since I expected\nthe code to handle an RSS namespace to be at least a bit more complex\nthan the RSS-Data example.  But,\nas Phillip observed later,\nthe scripts were pretty much equivalent in length, complexity, and\nease of construction.\n\n\nThen, this morning, I saw that Danny Ayers had posted an\nexample in RDF\nof this same data.  It doesn't differ very much from my namespace\nextension example, except that the few differences there are enables\nhis example to flow through RDF tools (as well as, usually, XML tools like\nXPath and XSLT).\n\n\nIn a comment\non one of Phillip's posts, though, Roger Benningfield makes\nthe point that this example is a bit biased:\n\n\nI agree that there won't be a ton of difference between a struct full\nof strings and plain ol' XML. But that's kind of a stacked example,\nsince SDL would allow a lot more than that... arrays, integers, and\narrays of integers inside structs.\n\n\nWhat I did could be obscuring some work.  I just took an existing\nschema from Amazon, which gave me some initial work already for free.\n(Though, there's something to be said for that in and of itself.)\nThe structures were already established, and the schema was created\nwith XML representation already in mind.  This could have placed\nRSS-Data at an example.  While I really don't think\nthat XML-RPC serialization offers more flexibility in expression than\nXML itself, I could be wrong and I don't want to be tilting\nat straw men.  \n\n\nSo, while I doubt that I'll have a whole lot of time today, I think\nfor the same of completeness, someone should go through the parallel\nprocesses of going from problem statement up through data modeling and\non to production and consumption of RSS-Data and an RSS namespace\nextension.  While doing this, capture the work involved in both.\n\n\nI could see shortcuts taken on the RSS-Data side, since you don't have\nto be concerened with various bits of XML tech like DTDs or schema\nor whatnot.  You can jump right into coding up an example usage and\ncome up with your data model on the fly.  Whether this is a good thing\nor not, I'm sure many will disagree.  Also, I'm sure others would\ngo through this differently than I would.  Again, your mojo may\nexceed mine.\n\n\nAt this point, I can see the benefits of RSS-Data in rapidly cobbling\ntogether scripts, but I lean toward having a decently defined data\nmodel first.  You can do this in your scripts, but using the existing\nXML tech forces you through some specific processes.  On the other\nhand, I can see where some busy developers don't have time or spare\nbrain cycles to absorb all the XML tech.  It could be made easier\nat that end of things, which is where I'd rather spend my effort.\n\n\nAnyway, I'm really interested in seeing where this goes, because\nthis comparison of RSS-Data, RSS namespace extensions, and even\nRDF seems like another very concrete, non-theoretical way to demonstrate\nthe benefits and drawbacks of these ways of thinking about data\nand interoperability.",

The Amazon-specific\nnamespace version looks much more compact and readable; I'd rather\nView Source\non that one.\n\n\n\n\nPython comes out of the box with\nxmlrpclib,\nand other languages have XML-RPC facilities available as well.  I can't imagine\nit'd be too hard to get a hold of the core of it and employ it in\nunmarshalling the RSS-Data straight into idiomatic Python structures.\nOn the other hand, I'll need to write my own handlers for the Amazon XML\nusing the XML parser modules that come with Python.\n\n\n\n\nWith its clean, almost self-documenting structure, the Amazon XML is easily\nhandled with XPath and XSL.  If I had a pile of ProductInfo elements\nin a document, I could yank out all their images with something like:\n//az:ProductInfo/az:Details/az:ImageUrlSmall\n\n\nUsing the RSS-Data\nexample, it'd probably be something more like:\n//sdl:data/sdl:struct/sdl:member/sdl:name[@text='ImageUrlSmall']/../sdl:value,\nand that's not considering if I have mixed kinds of RSS-Data schema represented in the\nfeed.\n\n\nI suppose I could help this out by surrounding the struct with another\nstruct, containing one member named 'AzProductInfo', making the path something\nlike so:\n//sdl:data/sdl:struct/sdl:member/sdl:name[@text='AzProductInfo']\n/../sdl:value/sdl:struct/sdl:member/sdl:name[@text='ImageUrlSmall']/../sdl:value.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd these are the conclusions I'm jumping to at the moment, before experimenting:\n\n\n\n\nRSS-Data's convenience to script authors is at odds with the RSS 2.0\nspirit of View Source.\n\n\nProducing and consuming RSS-Data could be easier than handling\npurpose-specific XML schema in scripts.\n\n\nSince RSS-Data doesn't follow in the spirit of XML specs and schema,\nusing formal XML tools to handle this stuff will give you\nnothing but headaches.  (Then again, it seems like some of the\nstuff that's fully in the spirit of XML yields headaches just\nthe same.)\n\n\nRSS-Data might catch on and spread nonetheless, because lots\nof people don't read XML, don't use formal XML tools, and just\nwrite scripts to get their jobs done.",

    "summary": "A few months ago I approached Dave Winer and a few other people with a very simple idea.? Why not use XML-RPC's data serialization format to create a simple data language for object meta-data in RSS (and other!) applications.? Interestingly, if you subtract the message envelop from XML-RPC, add Unicode and time-zone support to the standard, you've actually got WDDX, quite literally.? Dave really liked the idea, and we came up with the idea of RSS-Data.\n\n\nWhy use RSS-Data?? Pragmatism.? Because of the rapid growth of blogging software, XML-RPC parsers are already implemented in dozens of languages and platforms.? As a result, a simple data language based on XML-RPC's data model could emerge in a matter of days or weeks, as developers quickly refactor their parsers to simply provide data serialization/deserialization components.\nSource: Jeremy Allaire's Radio  (via Silicon Valley - Dan Gillmor's eJournal - Expanding the Scope of RSS)\tGrr. I can’t decide whether I hate this idea or can live with it.  On the one hand, I have benefitted from XML-RPC and it’s quick integration between disparate scripting environments.  But on the other hand, the tendency to use adhoc data structures in scripting has given me numerous headaches and plenty of inexplicable bugs.The further I get, the less I want quick and dirty, and the more I want thoughtful chaos and at least some documentation.  I’d like some schemas, rather than reverse engineering from example.  But sometimes it’s nice to short circuit over-designed processes and take expedient shortcuts, even if there lies the road to madness.  Sleep is good sometimes.",
