For the past year or two, I&amp;apos;ve been trying an experiment in my
personal research and learning.  I&amp;apos;ve been seeking out tools and
technologies which are as different as possible from those with which
I already have experience.  I want to break up some prejudices and
habits I have, and expose myself to more ways of looking at things.
Now that I write this, it sounds like a great approach to life in
general, but for now I&amp;apos;m focusing on computer science.  :)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My success 
with this has been entirely dependant on free time and brain cycles,
of which I&amp;apos;ve had precious little.  But, I have managed to wean myself
away from Perl to learning Python, developing a few apps with it and
incorporating it into my problem solving kit.  I&amp;apos;ve also managed to
get myself away from XEmacs for hours at a time in order to weave Vim
into my work-a-day life.  These two things haven&amp;apos;t been easy for me,
since I&amp;apos;ve been using both Perl and some variant of Emacs for almost
12 years now, and I&amp;apos;ve done my share of sneering at that which is not
perl or emacs.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And, although I&amp;apos;ve yet to spring upon them, I&amp;apos;ve also been making wary, 
narrowing circles around Lisp, Smalltalk, Prolog, and .NET.  There
been occasional forays into Java, as well as my daily attachment to
Flash and Actionscript lately.  And then, there&amp;apos;ve been my hefting and
swinging of XSLT and XPath, as well as RDF, countered by a few feints
with plaintext shell tools and YAML.  There&amp;apos;s been more, but most
investigations have been too tentative to mention.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If there&amp;apos;s a &amp;quot;holy war&amp;quot; between two things, I want to explore them both.
I tend to see two apparently intelligent parties in an extended debate
over which of them has a hold on the One True Way.  In my
experience, though, there&amp;apos;s a high likelyhood that such a phenomenon
points toward a real truth which lies somewhere inbetween.  (This, of
course, ignoring such cases where one party is correct, and the other
is WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!)  There tend to be very good reasons why smart
people on either side of a fence have taken up with what they have,
and I want to know both sides thoroughly.  I know full well that both
sides have at least some valid criticisms against the other, but I
want a synthesis of the two.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In this field of computer science, there
are as many ways of working with the dreamstuff as there
are ways of structuring thoughts.  And, rather than there ever being
One True Way to do things, there will always be another smart person
developing another powerfully expressive and insightful way of doing
things.  Someday, I&amp;apos;d like to be one of those smart people, so I need
to have a sense for that truth in the middle that other One True Ways 
bracket and zero in on.  And then, I want to know enough to jump out
of the frame altogether, and in which ways I can invert and twist
things to encircle some new spark.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Someday in the next few years, I&amp;apos;d like to get back into school so I
can get to even higher levels of growing up to be a computer scientist.
But for now, it&amp;apos;s back to work for me.  And, if you happen to think of
any geeky holy wars, let me know.  I&amp;apos;m collecting them for study.

<div class="content">In a group of friends we keep a list of these things.  Some of the technolgy ones are:
1. Windows vs. Unix
2. Linux vs. BSD
3. Emacs vs. the unmentionable one (vi)
6. Fortran vs. C/C++
7. Perl vs. Python
9. LaTeX vs. Word or Framemaker
10. Steered Code (via scripts) vs. Not
Then there are even pronunciations of some products that de-evolve into holy wars:
12. Pronunciation:
b. .gif: Gif vs. Jif
d. LaTeX: lah-TEK vs. LAH-tek vs. LAY-tex
e. data: DAH-tah vs. DAY-tah
I look forward to more information from you on this and seeing what you find.</div>

<div class="content">Here are a few:
* IDE vs. multiple tools
* HTML vs. Flash MX (or Java Applets, I suppose)
* learning an existing tool or writing your own
I also find that some tools are cool to know, because in a narrow set of uses, they're fscking awesome:
* Expect (for use in automating some cron scripts)
* awk (for piping through output)
* ANSI color codes for making output more readable
Plus there are great add-ons to the software you already use:
* various emacs modes and tools (recentf is killer)
* CPAN modules you might not have known about
* list comprehensions and the __foo__() methods you can override in python</div>

Ok, but what struck me was not the holy war per se, but the pursuit.
