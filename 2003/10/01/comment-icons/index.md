This is an interesting thing over at
<a href="http://kasei.evilfunhouse.com/blog/">Life on Mars</a>:
<a href="http://kasei.evilfunhouse.com/blog/archives/2003/09/30/icons">Comment Icons</a>.
</p>
<p>
Post a comment, supply the URL to your blog, and if your
blog has a locatable RSS feed which points to an image,
that image will be displayed next to your comments.  As I've
been known to have <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog.cgi/?q=livejournal">a mild obsession with LiveJournal</a>, this reminds
me a lot of the usericons in use there, only distributed
across blogspace, which is what I've wanted to see done for a
long time.
</p>
<p>
All the infrastructure of LiveJournal,
Friendster, and the like could be recast as distributed
feeds and metadata, with smarts on blog servers or
personal clients.  One piece at a time...
