I intend to eventually wipe this PowerBook completely and install fresh, but I couldn&amp;apos;t wait.  :)   Mark Pilgrim published the most definitive coverage of the beastie I&amp;apos;ve seen yet, with help of the denizens of #joiito to manage the onslaught of readers.  So, I won&amp;apos;t make any attempt to catalog the new things.   A few impressions though:   Everything feels faster.  Windows slide around and resize like they&amp;apos;ve been waxed underneath.  Things seem to launch faster. A few small things have improved, like System Preferences quitting when I close the window, rather than hanging around waiting for me to open the window again or quit. Some third-party extension I had installed threw Finder into a launch-and-crash loop for awhile.  So, if you&amp;apos;ve yet to install, try to purge your system of extensions first.  This should be obvious, but is sometimes a surprise when it&amp;apos;s actually a problem. Expose looked like a neat feature when I first heard of it.  I fully expected it to be slow, stuttery, and &amp;apos;cute&amp;apos; when I finally played with it.  Now, having used it and slowly incorporating it into my usage habits, it&amp;apos;s amazing.  Smooth and not stuttery at all, it looks like a computer interface feature from the movies. Fast user switching, where desktops rotate in and out of view, also looks like you wish it would, and seems like it&amp;apos;s from the movies. I hate metal. I hate metal. I hate metal.   That is all.  For now.  Maybe.  " />
