I know I&amp;apos;m late to the blogosphere release party for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&quot;&gt;Panther&lt;/a&gt;, but I just got it last night and, biting the bullet, installed it with only minimal effort toward backing things up.  I intend to eventually wipe this PowerBook completely and install fresh, but I couldn&amp;apos;t wait.  :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/10/24/panther&quot;&gt;Mark Pilgrim&lt;/a&gt; published the most definitive coverage of the beastie I&amp;apos;ve seen yet, with help of the denizens of &lt;a href=&quot;http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel&quot;&gt;#joiito&lt;/a&gt; to manage the onslaught of readers.  So, I won&amp;apos;t make any attempt to catalog the new things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few impressions though:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everything&lt;/b&gt; feels faster.  Windows slide around and resize like they&amp;apos;ve been waxed underneath.  Things seem to launch faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few small things have improved, like System Preferences quitting when I close the window, rather than hanging around waiting for me to open the window again or quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some third-party extension I had installed threw Finder into a launch-and-crash loop for awhile.  So, if you&amp;apos;ve yet to install, try to purge your system of extensions first.  This should be obvious, but is sometimes a surprise when it&amp;apos;s actually a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expose looked like a neat feature when I first heard of it.  I fully expected it to be slow, stuttery, and &amp;apos;cute&amp;apos; when I finally played with it.  Now, having used it and slowly incorporating it into my usage habits, it&amp;apos;s amazing.  Smooth and not stuttery at all, it looks like a computer interface feature from the movies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast user switching, where desktops rotate in and out of view, also looks like you wish it would, and seems like it&amp;apos;s from the movies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;b&gt;hate&lt;/b&gt; metal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hate &lt;i&gt;metal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;I hate metal.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That is all.  For now.  Maybe.
