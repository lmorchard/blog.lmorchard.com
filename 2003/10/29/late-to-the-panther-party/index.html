        <meta property="og:description" content="I know I&#39;m late to the blogosphere release party for Panther, but I just got it last night and, biting the bullet, installed it with only minimal effort toward backing things up.  I intend to eventually wipe this PowerBook completely and install fresh, but I couldn&#39;t wait.  :)


Mark Pilgrim published the most definitive coverage of the beastie I&#39;ve seen yet, with help of the denizens of #joiito to manage the onslaught of readers.  So, I won&#39;t make any attempt to catalog the new things.


A few impressions though:


Everything feels faster.  Windows slide around and resize like they&#39;ve been waxed underneath.  Things seem to launch faster.
A few small things have improved, like System Preferences quitting when I close the window, rather than hanging around waiting for me to open the window again or quit.
Some third-party extension I had installed threw Finder into a launch-and-crash loop for awhile.  So, if you&#39;ve yet to install, try to purge your system of extensions first.  This should be obvious, but is sometimes a surprise when it&#39;s actually a problem.
Expose looked like a neat feature when I first heard of it.  I fully expected it to be slow, stuttery, and &#39;cute&#39; when I finally played with it.  Now, having used it and slowly incorporating it into my usage habits, it&#39;s amazing.  Smooth and not stuttery at all, it looks like a computer interface feature from the movies.
Fast user switching, where desktops rotate in and out of view, also looks like you wish it would, and seems like it&#39;s from the movies.
I hate metal.

That is all.  For now.  Maybe." />
