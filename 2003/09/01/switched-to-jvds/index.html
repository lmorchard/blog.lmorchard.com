        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&#39;s been one year since I
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooobfc.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;signed up for a &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies&quot;&gt;JohnCompanies&lt;/a&gt; server,
and though I&#39;ve had no complaints whatsoever, I&#39;ve signed up for
a server instance with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jvds.com/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;JVDS.com&lt;/a&gt; and have moved
just about everything over.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Why?  Because it&#39;s cheaper, and I have less disposable income these
days.  And, well, it seemed like fun to try another virtual server
company, since I&#39;ve been looking into it so much lately.  The new
server has less capacity than the one I&#39;ve had at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies&quot;&gt;JohnCompanies&lt;/a&gt;, but I
really don&#39;t need all that much -- just a roof over my files and a
root password.  Well, I don&#39;t really need a root password, but it&#39;s
nice to have so that I can tinker around with more things with fewer
questions asked of the management.  (For what it&#39;s worth, we&#39;re still
using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies&quot;&gt;JohnCompanies&lt;/a&gt; servers for hosting at my work.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;ve almost got this server migration thing down to a science, though,
since I had everything over and up in a few hours.  And that was going
from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FreeBSD&quot;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt; system to Debian Linux.  Personally, though I fully
respect &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FreeBSD&quot;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt; and the ports collection, I like Debian and apt-get
so much better.  But who knows, maybe in another year, I&#39;ll be moving
again for the hell of it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I don&#39;t have much in the way of reputation for JVDS, but the management
has been very responsive to requests so far.  In fact, they&#39;re using
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bestpractical.com/rt//&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;RT&lt;/a&gt; for their support ticket
management.  Responsiveness has been one of the most impressive aspects
of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies&quot;&gt;JohnCompanies&lt;/a&gt;, since between my personal server and the servers
I use at work, it tends to take less than an hour to get resolution
on any problems I&#39;ve had.  So far, JVDS has yet to disappoint me as
well.&lt;/p&gt;

<div class="content">I had a JohnCompanies server which I was also very happy with but wanted a bit more control and space for some things as well as to run linux instead of freebsd (nothing wrong with freebsd - I just prefer linux) so I went the other way and switched up to a rackshack.net server. I had fun installing debian over the installed redhat remotely. It was a bit scary to say the least installing an operating system 4000 miles away over an ssh link but it did work... And I'm very happy with my new server.</div>

<div class="content">keep us posted on uptime/availability.  i went with johncompanies on your good word and haven't been disappointed yet.  i can imagine a few backup/secondary servers i'd like to run on a jvds server if it stays up reliably and doesn't choke on limited pooled resources.</div>

<div class="content">"Responsiveness has been one of the most impressive aspects of JohnCompanies, since between my personal server and the servers I use at work, it tends to take less than an hour to get resolution on any problems I've had."
Comments like this on kuro5hin.com is largely why I switched to JC several months ago. However, my experience has been far from that. My requests (emailed to linux@johncompanies.com - is there another way?) take forever to be resolved. Once I had to call Castle (their colo provider) to get in touch with them. I'm a bit disappointed in the tech support end of things. I'm not a guru, but I know my way around and by the time I need to call tech support, I really need to call tech support.</div>
