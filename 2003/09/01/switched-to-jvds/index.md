<br /><br />
It's been one year since I
<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooobfc.html" target="_top">signed up for a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies">JohnCompanies</a> server</a>,
and though I've had no complaints whatsoever, I've signed up for
a server instance with <a href="http://www.jvds.com/" target="_top">JVDS.com</a> and have moved
just about everything over.
<br /><br />
Why?  Because it's cheaper, and I have less disposable income these
days.  And, well, it seemed like fun to try another virtual server
company, since I've been looking into it so much lately.  The new
server has less capacity than the one I've had at <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies">JohnCompanies</a>, but I
really don't need all that much -- just a roof over my files and a
root password.  Well, I don't really need a root password, but it's
nice to have so that I can tinker around with more things with fewer
questions asked of the management.  (For what it's worth, we're still
using <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies">JohnCompanies</a> servers for hosting at my work.)
<br /><br />
I've almost got this server migration thing down to a science, though,
since I had everything over and up in a few hours.  And that was going
from a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a> system to Debian Linux.  Personally, though I fully
respect <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a> and the ports collection, I like Debian and apt-get
so much better.  But who knows, maybe in another year, I'll be moving
again for the hell of it.
<br /><br />
I don't have much in the way of reputation for JVDS, but the management
has been very responsive to requests so far.  In fact, they're using
<a href="http://www.bestpractical.com/rt//" target="_top">RT</a> for their support ticket
management.  Responsiveness has been one of the most impressive aspects
of <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies">JohnCompanies</a>, since between my personal server and the servers
I use at work, it tends to take less than an hour to get resolution
on any problems I've had.  So far, JVDS has yet to disappoint me as
well.

            <div class="content">I had a JohnCompanies server which I was also very happy with but wanted a bit more control and space for some things as well as to run linux instead of freebsd (nothing wrong with freebsd - I just prefer linux) so I went the other way and switched up to a rackshack.net server. I had fun installing debian over the installed redhat remotely. It was a bit scary to say the least installing an operating system 4000 miles away over an ssh link but it did work... And I'm very happy with my new server.</div>

Comments like this on kuro5hin.com is largely why I switched to JC several months ago. However, my experience has been far from that. My requests (emailed to linux@johncompanies.com - is there another way?) take forever to be resolved. Once I had to call Castle (their colo provider) to get in touch with them. I'm a bit disappointed in the tech support end of things. I'm not a guru, but I know my way around and by the time I need to call tech support, I really need to call tech support.</div>
