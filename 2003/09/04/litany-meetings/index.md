Speaking of Infobots:

    <deusx> litany against meetings?
    <purl> "I must not attend meetings. Meetings are the mind killer.
    Meetings re the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face 
    my meeting. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And 
    when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. 
    Where the wasted time has gone there will be nothing. Only 
    I will remain."
