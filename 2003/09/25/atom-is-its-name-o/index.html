<p>I haven&#39;t been anywhere near the epicenter of Atom/Pie/Echo much,

seems telling to me.</p>

<p>On one hand, I could take it to be representative of what&#39;s going

how can they settle on what&#39;s included in the spec?)  On the other hand,
it could just be that naming the thing is the least interesting aspect
of the project.  But I consider that because I&#39;m a nerd, I&#39;ve been
