Source:Morbus Iff: &#39;Atom&#39; Should Be It&#39;s Name, and It&#39;s Name Was Atom

I haven&#39;t been anywhere near the epicenter of Atom/Pie/Echo much,
so this is mostly a &#39;me too&#39; kind of posting.  But, you know, as an
interested hacker waiting for dust to settle before I start paying
much attention, the decision on a name, as superficial as it is,
seems telling to me.

On one hand, I could take it to be representative of what&#39;s going
on inside the project as a whole.  (If they can&#39;t settle on a name,
how can they settle on what&#39;s included in the spec?)  On the other hand,
it could just be that naming the thing is the least interesting aspect
of the project.  But I consider that because I&#39;m a nerd, I&#39;ve been
there, and I want to see the project thrive.  Others might not be so
charitable or patient. :)

So just name the dang thing Atom already." />
