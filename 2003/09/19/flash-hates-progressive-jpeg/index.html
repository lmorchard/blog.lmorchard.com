<div class="content">Wow... and here&#39;s me just embarking on a project in Flash that&#39;s going to have to deal with JPEGs uploaded by random people on the web. Thank you, I think you&#39;ve just saved me a lot of trouble.</div>

<div class="content">And of course, there&#39;s always the GD library, too, which may or may not be easier to install than ImageMagick. Many PHP environments already have it, in case that helps. Yaarrr!
Just gdImageCreateFromJpeg, gdImageInterlace, then gdImageJpeg, and you can get a non-interlaced version of your image.</div>
