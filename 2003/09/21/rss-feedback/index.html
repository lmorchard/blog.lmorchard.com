Then we factor in their attention.xml lists weighted by their location on your list, average the newly weighted list based on this trusted group of &amp;quot;advisors&amp;quot;, and return it to your aggregator, which rewrites the list accordingly.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crn.com/weblogs/stevegillmor/2003/09/20/20.asp&quot;&gt;Steve Gillmor&amp;apos;s Emerging Opps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/09/21#When:10:08:20AM&quot;&gt;Dave Winer says&lt;/a&gt; this guy&amp;#x2019;s full of shit.

What did you read, and find interesting, that I didn&amp;amp;#8217;t read and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;might&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; find interesting?
