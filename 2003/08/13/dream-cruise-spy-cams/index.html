Source: freep.com: Police try spy cameras for better cruise control 	This has privacy advocates around here worried.  I’m thinking it’s a tempest in a teacup, but reading a quote like this is a bit unfortunate:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;#8220;We can zoom in tight enough to read someone&amp;#8217;s watch,&amp;#8221; said Jonathan Hollander, chief technology officer for GigaTrans, which designed the system for the use of the Oakland County Sheriff&amp;#8217;s Department and local police departments along the route.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But, as a futurist geek, what I really want to know, having read David Brin&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738201448/0xdecafbad-20&quot;&gt;The Transparent Society&lt;/a&gt; , is when I get to look for traffic jams up ahead using my &lt;strong&gt;own&lt;/strong&gt; wireless communicator.&lt;/p&gt;" />
