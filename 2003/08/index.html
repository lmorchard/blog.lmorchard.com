      </h2>
    
    <p class="summary">
      It's been one year since I
signed up for a JohnCompanies server,
and though I've had no complaints whatsoever, I've signed up for
a server instance with JVDS.com and have moved
just about everything over.
Why?  Because it's cheaper, and I have less disposable income these
days.  And, well, it seemed like fun to try another virtual server
company, since I've been looking into it so much lately.  The new
server has less capacity than the one I've had at JohnCompanies, but I
really don't need all that much -- just a roof over my files and a
root password.  Well, I don't really need a root password, but it's
nice to have so that I can tinker around with more things with fewer
questions asked of the management.  (For what it's worth, we're still
using JohnCompanies servers for hosting at my work.)
I've almost got this server migration thing down to a science, though,
since I had everything over and up in a few hours.  And that was going
from a FreeBSD system to Debian Linux.  Personally, though I fully
respect FreeBSD and the ports collection, I like Debian and apt-get
so much better.  But who knows, maybe in another year, I'll be moving
again for the hell of it.
I don't have much in the way of reputation for JVDS, but the management
has been very responsive to requests so far.  In fact, they're using
RT for their support ticket
management.  Responsiveness has been one of the most impressive aspects
of JohnCompanies, since between my personal server and the servers
I use at work, it tends to take less than an hour to get resolution
on any problems I've had.  So far, JVDS has yet to disappoint me as
well.

Yup, and you can do the same for every other pseudo-class of an anchor tag.  I read about this via Eric Meyer’s article on the O‘Reilly Network.  I’m still very much a CSS neophyte, but it’s helped me incredibly at work, where I was able to create a site layout with one set of HTML pages styled by a small library of CSS files for look & feel.

<p>Yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s for, you say.  But it surprised the hell out of me that I was able to abuse background image properties of containers to create JavaScript-free rollovers, as well as select between completely different image-based layout elements.  This isn&#8217;t pure utopian <span class="caps">CSS</span> that I&#8217;m doing, and most of my position is still with tables, but thanks to blank pixel images atop <span class="caps">CSS</span>-controlled background images, I can do what I think are amazing things.</p>

<p>Now I just have to break free of the rest of my <span class="caps">HTML</span> crutches, circa 1996.</p>

      </h2>
    
    <p class="summary">
      After checking out Bill Humphries’ approach to scraping yesterday, I recalled the various things Jon Udell has written about URL-as-command-line and the various places I’ve seen the W3C XSLT Servlet used in XSLT tinkering.  I also remembered that there’s an HTML Tidy service offered by W3C as well.

<p>So&#8230;  these are all URLs.  I figured I could pull together the site <span class="caps">URL</span>, <a href="http://www.whump.com/dropbox/nationrss/nation.xsl">Bill&#8217;s <span class="caps">XSLT</span></a>, the tidy service, and the <span class="caps">XSLT</span> service, and have a whole lot of scraping going on right in my browser or via wget or curl.  Here are the steps in how I composed the <span class="caps">URL</span>:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.thenation.com">http://www.thenation.com</a></li>

http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/tidy?docAddr=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenation.com
http://www.w3.org/2000/06/webdata/xslt?

xslfile=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whump.com%2Fdropbox%2Fnationrss%2Fnation.xsl&#38;
xmlfile=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.w3.org%2Fcgi-bin%2Ftidy%3F
docAddr%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.thenation.com&transform=Submit


<p>Unfortunately, this doesn&#8217;t work.  In particular, step [#2](/tag/2) fails, the Tidy service reporting a failure in processing the original <span class="caps">HTML</span>.  I imagine, had that worked, the whole process at step [#3](/tag/3) would be producing <span class="caps">RSS</span>.  On my command line, <span class="caps">HTML </span>Tidy works fine, so I&#8217;ve been thinking of throwing together my own web interface to that program and seeing if that works.</p>

<p>If it works, this with the addition of a cache at each stage could allow for what I think is a pretty nifty, all web-based means of scraping news items from web sites.  </p>

    <p>What would really be nice for apps like this is a better way to express the URLs-within-URLs without escaping and escaping and escaping and...  Thinking some very lightweight scripting here, or some LISP-ish expressions would help.</p>

Using curl, tidy, and XSL to scrape content from HTML pages into an RSS feed.  This is basically what I do now with a half-baked Java app using JTidy, XPath, and BeanShell.  I keep meaning to release it, but it’s too embarassing to share so far.  Yet, it’s been working well enough to scrape what sites I’m interested in such that I haven’t been too motivated to tidy it up and tarball it.  One thing I like better about Bill Humphries’ approach, though, is that it doesn’t use Java :)

I linked to D.J.Bernstein’s Internet Mail 2000 project a little while back, and I think what Adam Curry says here is along a similar path.

<p>Internet Mail 2000 starts off with the assumption, &#8220;Mail storage is the sender&#8217;s responsibility.&#8221;  So, you want to send me an email?  Post it on your server and tell me to come &#38; get it.  When I get the notification, I&#8217;ll then decide whether or not I want to bother.  There are a lot of details to fill in here, such as secure posting and retrieval, trust and identity, notification mechanisms.  But, it certainly would seem to balance out the equation a bit.</p>

<p>How to do it, though, so that things are still at least as simple to use as existing email, such as it is?</p>

        <a href="/blog.lmorchard.com/2003/08/16/bayes-agg-one/">Issues in using SpamBayes to filter news items</a>
      </h2>
    
    <p class="summary">
      Despite a reading an entry by Srijith
discussing Bayes-based classification as unsuitable
for use in news aggregators, I tied SpamBayes
into my homebrew news aggregator
and have been trying it out this week.  I know I’ve been talking about it
for awhile, but procrastination and being busy all round kept me from getting
to it.  Funny thing is, when I finally got a chance to really check things out,
the integration was a snap.  I’d anticipated a bit of work, but was pleasantly
surprised.  I doubt that any other aggregator written in
Python would have a hard time with it.

<p>If, that is, anyone else wants to do it.  I already knew it wasn&#8217;t

magic pixy dust
but I figured it might be worth a try.  I will be eating my dogfood
for awhile with this, but I’m thinking already that what’s good for spam
might not be so good for news aggregators.
<p>Srijith&#8217;s <a href="http://www.srijith.net/trinetre/archives/2003/08/11/index.shtml#000373">post</a>

mentions some snags in ignoring some of the semantics of a news item,
such as whether a word appears in the item’s title or information about
the item’s source.  I don’t think that this completely
applies to how I’m doing classification, since SpamBayes appears to
differentiate between words found in email headers and the body itself.
When I feed an item to SpamBayes for training and scoring, I represent
it as something like an email message, with headers like date, subject,
from, and an “X-Link” header for the link.  However, even with this,
I think Srijith’s got a point when he writes that this method will miss
a lot of available clues for classification.
<p>Unlike Srijith&#8217;s examples, though, I&#8217;m not trying to train my

aggregator to sift entries into any specific categories.  So far, I’ve
been trying to get it to discriminate between what I really want to
read, and what I’m not so interested in.  So, I figured that something
which can learn the difference between spam and normal email could help.
But, although it’s early, I’m noticing a few things about the results and
I’ve had a few things occur to me.
<p>See, in the case of ham vs spam, I really want all the ham and none of

the spam.  A method to differentiate between these two should be
optimized toward one answer or the other.  SpamBayes offers “I don’t
know” as a third answer, but it’s not geared toward anything else
in-between.  However, in measuring something like “interest“,
inbetween answers are useful.  I want all of the interesting stuff,
some of the sort-of interesting stuff, and a little of the rest.
<p>This is also a problem for me in deciding to what I

should give a thumbs up and what gets the thumbs down.  Even though
I’ve subscribed to a little over 300 feeds, every item from each of
them is somewhat interesting to me.  I wouldn’t have subscribed to the
feed if there wasn’t anything of interest there, so I’ve already
biased the content of what I receive.  Some items are more interesting
than others, but the difference between them is nowhere near the
difference of wanted ham vs unsolicited spam.  So, I find myself
giving the nod to lots of items, but only turning down a few.
SpamBayes would like equal examples of both, if possible.
<p>I&#8217;ll still be playing with this for awhile, but I need to look

around at other machine learning tech.  I’m just hacking around,
but the important thing is to try to understand the algorithms
better and know how they work and why.  Bayes is in vogue right now,
but as Mark Pilgrim intimated, it’s not magic.  It’s just “advanced” :)
<p>In the immortal words of <a href="http://www.spidereyeballs.com/os6/set3/small_os6_d3_3596_sm.html">Mark Jason Dominus</a>: &#8220;You can&#8217;t just make shit

up and expect the computer to know what you mean, retardo!”

This has privacy advocates around here worried.  I’m thinking it’s a tempest in a teacup, but reading a quote like this is a bit unfortunate:

<blockquote>&#8220;We can zoom in tight enough to read someone&#8217;s watch,&#8221; said Jonathan Hollander, chief technology officer for GigaTrans, which designed the system for the use of the Oakland County Sheriff&#8217;s Department and local police departments along the route.</blockquote>



<p>It also doesn&#8217;t help that a <a href="http://www.freep.com/news/locway/probe12_20030612.htm">Federal investigation into the Detroit Police</a> found that they were &#8220;the most troubled force they have seen in 10 years of scrutinizing police nationwide&#8220;.

Although I currently am on the low end of disposable income, I’m keeping my eye on tiny cases, motherboards, and just-slightly-slower-than-insanity CPUs for projects just such as these.  I want a PVR, a few file servers, maybe a homebrew game console.  I also wouldn’t mind buying a pile of OpenBricks for general living-in-the-future purposes around the house, and to experiment with clustering and networking.

    <p class="summary">
      I joined the Apache project for the software. I stayed for the community. Likewise Perl. The software is interesting, but the people are more interesting. So now that I'm really not even writing much Perl, I'm still involved with the community, to some degree, because they are cool people. 

Source: DrBacchus' Journal: Software and community



I’ve been working with Perl for just about 10 years now, and though I’ve been a bit of a stranger lately, I used to be a regular on [#perl](/tag/perl) on several IRC networks.  And, when companies I worked for paid for travel as freely as for paper clips, I made rounds at a few conferences.  I was lucky enough to meet a few other [#perl](/tag/perl) regulars.  I doubt most of them remember me since they‘re a fairly close-nit group, and I’d only made the one appearance, despite constantly swearing I’d make it to a YAPC at some point.  But I always thought it was cool as hell to actually have had a beer at the same table in Boston with authors of some of my favorite O‘Reilly perl books.

<p>But, I got busy, stopped hanging out in <span class="caps">IRC</span> so much, and also decided that I needed to expand my horizons and stop being so narrowly focused on one language.  I got into Java, Python, shell scripting, and <span class="caps">PHP</span>.  I started this weblog, and I tried to purposefully keep away from Perl.  Of course, I can&#8217;t stay away, because Perl code comes out of my fingertips as naturally as breathing when a problem presents itself for solution.</p>

<p>And then there&#8217;s community.  I&#8217;ve yet to find a Java community as quirky and entertaining as that surrounding Perl.  Thus, Java bores me.  I use it, but it&#8217;s strictly business, mostly.</p>

<p>When what you&#8216;re doing <strong>is</strong> strictly business, I guess that&#8217;s desirable.  But when you eat, sleep, and breathe this stuff, having a group of people constantly doing clever things and being odd certainly makes it more rewarding.  It&#8217;s predictability versus creativity.  To get the job done, you want solid and dependable tools.  To have fun, you want some challenge and unexpected results.</p>

<p>To me, Perl and its community offers both.  I think Python might, also, but I&#8217;m not as familiar there.  Java and other technologies are mostly business.  Maybe this also crosses over into the difference between IT people and CS people, and whether you&#8216;re here to work or here to play and get paid.</p>

<p>Hmm.</p>
