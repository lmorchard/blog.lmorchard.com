Because it&#39;s cheaper, and I have less disposable income these\ndays.  And, well, it seemed like fun to try another virtual server\ncompany, since I&#39;ve been looking into it so much lately.  The new\nserver has less capacity than the one I&#39;ve had at <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies\">JohnCompanies</a>, but I\nreally don&#39;t need all that much -- just a roof over my files and a\nroot password.  Well, I don&#39;t really need a root password, but it&#39;s\nnice to have so that I can tinker around with more things with fewer\nquestions asked of the management.  (For what it&#39;s worth, we&#39;re still\nusing <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies\">JohnCompanies</a> servers for hosting at my work.)\n<br /><br />\nI&#39;ve almost got this server migration thing down to a science, though,\nsince I had everything over and up in a few hours.  And that was going\nfrom a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FreeBSD\">FreeBSD</a> system to Debian Linux.  Personally, though I fully\nrespect <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FreeBSD\">FreeBSD</a> and the ports collection, I like Debian and apt-get\nso much better.  But who knows, maybe in another year, I&#39;ll be moving\nagain for the hell of it.\n<br /><br />\nI don&#39;t have much in the way of reputation for JVDS, but the management\nhas been very responsive to requests so far.  In fact, they&#39;re using\n<a href=\"http://www.bestpractical.com/rt//\" target=\"_top\">RT</a> for their support ticket\nmanagement.

But who knows, maybe in another year, I&apos;ll be moving\nagain for the hell of it.\n<br><br>\nI don&apos;t have much in the way of reputation for JVDS, but the management\nhas been very responsive to requests so far.  In fact, they&apos;re using\n<a href=\"http://www.bestpractical.com/rt//\" target=\"_top\">RT</a> for their support ticket\nmanagement.  Responsiveness has been one of the most impressive aspects\nof <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies\">JohnCompanies</a>, since between my personal server and the servers\nI use at work, it tends to take less than an hour to get resolution\non any problems I&apos;ve had.  So far, JVDS has yet to disappoint me as\nwell.</p>\n"
