I had fun installing debian over the installed redhat remotely. It was a bit scary to say the least installing an operating system 4000 miles away over an ssh link but it did work... And I&#39;m very happy with my new server.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085825&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=06bc69070d91c9c9eeeb39851796a2f6&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tom Wiebe&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085825&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-09-01T14:39:42&quot;&gt;2003-09-01T14:39:42&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;I signed up for an account with JVDS.com the other week too.

However, my experience has been far from that. My requests (emailed to <a href=\"mailto:linux@johncompanies.com\">linux@johncompanies.com</a> - is there another way?) take forever to be resolved. Once I had to call Castle (their colo provider) to get in touch with them. I&#39;m a bit disappointed in the tech support end of things. I&#39;m not a guru, but I know my way around and by the time I need to call tech support, I really need to call tech support.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085831&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.monokromatik.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b37a607f0fc8a1dd8dab303acbf3aacb&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.monokromatik.com&quot;&gt;brian donovan&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085831&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-09-28T13:42:56&quot;&gt;2003-09-28T13:42:56&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;So how are you faring with JDVS ?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
