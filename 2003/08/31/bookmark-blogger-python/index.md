Remember my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger">BookmarkBlogger</a>?  Well, I rewrote it in <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Python">Python</a>.  For
a little while, I was making little apps in Java, wishing it were a
scripting language.  I've stopped that now.  Also, I've added the
ability to include both link text and a non-linked comment in the
bookmarks to be blogged.  This new version is quite a bit simpler
and contained all in one script -- configuration, template, and all.
