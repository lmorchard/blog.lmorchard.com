I hope to drag myself to one of the US python conferences too (since I live here :)\n\nAfter years in the perl community (I&#39;ve recently gotten email requests for code that I wrote under perl 3) (but also distant from it in more recent times) I&#39;ve found the python community (as it centers around comp.lang.python) to be receptive and polite, as well as creative.  It&#39;s a little less insane - I remember the glee with which s/foo/bar/eieio was received, when marc -at- mit discovered it - but still exciting and useful...\n\nOf course, I&#39;ve only been in python-space since January 2003.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221082750&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fc79316f72b984535d99411e12ea71db&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/&quot;&gt;Randal L.
