    "summary": "It's been one year since I\nsigned up for a JohnCompanies server,\nand though I've had no complaints whatsoever, I've signed up for\na server instance with JVDS.com and have moved\njust about everything over.\n\nWhy?  Because it's cheaper, and I have less disposable income these\ndays.  And, well, it seemed like fun to try another virtual server\ncompany, since I've been looking into it so much lately.  The new\nserver has less capacity than the one I've had at JohnCompanies, but I\nreally don't need all that much -- just a roof over my files and a\nroot password.  Well, I don't really need a root password, but it's\nnice to have so that I can tinker around with more things with fewer\nquestions asked of the management.  (For what it's worth, we're still\nusing JohnCompanies servers for hosting at my work.)\n\nI've almost got this server migration thing down to a science, though,\nsince I had everything over and up in a few hours.  And that was going\nfrom a FreeBSD system to Debian Linux.  Personally, though I fully\nrespect FreeBSD and the ports collection, I like Debian and apt-get\nso much better.  But who knows, maybe in another year, I'll be moving\nagain for the hell of it.\n\nI don't have much in the way of reputation for JVDS, but the management\nhas been very responsive to requests so far.  In fact, they're using\nRT for their support ticket\nmanagement.  Responsiveness has been one of the most impressive aspects\nof JohnCompanies, since between my personal server and the servers\nI use at work, it tends to take less than an hour to get resolution\non any problems I've had.  So far, JVDS has yet to disappoint me as\nwell.",

    "summary": "Despite a reading an entry by Srijith\ndiscussing Bayes-based classification as unsuitable\nfor use in news aggregators, I tied SpamBayes\ninto my homebrew news aggregator\nand have been trying it out this week.  I know I’ve been talking about it\nfor awhile, but procrastination and being busy all round kept me from getting\nto it.  Funny thing is, when I finally got a chance to really check things out,\nthe integration was a snap.  I’d anticipated a bit of work, but was pleasantly\nsurprised.  I doubt that any other aggregator written in\nPython would have a hard time with it.\n\n<p>If, that is, anyone else wants to do it.  I already knew it wasn&#8217;t\n\nmagic pixy dust\nbut I figured it might be worth a try.  I will be eating my dogfood\nfor awhile with this, but I’m thinking already that what’s good for spam\nmight not be so good for news aggregators.\n<p>Srijith&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.srijith.net/trinetre/archives/2003/08/11/index.shtml#000373\">post</a>\n\nmentions some snags in ignoring some of the semantics of a news item,\nsuch as whether a word appears in the item’s title or information about\nthe item’s source.  I don’t think that this completely\napplies to how I’m doing classification, since SpamBayes appears to\ndifferentiate between words found in email headers and the body itself.\nWhen I feed an item to SpamBayes for training and scoring, I represent\nit as something like an email message, with headers like date, subject,\nfrom, and an “X-Link” header for the link.  However, even with this,\nI think Srijith’s got a point when he writes that this method will miss\na lot of available clues for classification.\n<p>Unlike Srijith&#8217;s examples, though, I&#8217;m not trying to train my\n\naggregator to sift entries into any specific categories.  So far, I’ve\nbeen trying to get it to discriminate between what I really want to\nread, and what I’m not so interested in.  So, I figured that something\nwhich can learn the difference between spam and normal email could help.\nBut, although it’s early, I’m noticing a few things about the results and\nI’ve had a few things occur to me.\n<p>See, in the case of ham vs spam, I really want all the ham and none of\n\nthe spam.  A method to differentiate between these two should be\noptimized toward one answer or the other.  SpamBayes offers “I don’t\nknow” as a third answer, but it’s not geared toward anything else\nin-between.  However, in measuring something like “interest“,\ninbetween answers are useful.  I want all of the interesting stuff,\nsome of the sort-of interesting stuff, and a little of the rest.\n<p>This is also a problem for me in deciding to what I\n\nshould give a thumbs up and what gets the thumbs down.  Even though\nI’ve subscribed to a little over 300 feeds, every item from each of\nthem is somewhat interesting to me.  I wouldn’t have subscribed to the\nfeed if there wasn’t anything of interest there, so I’ve already\nbiased the content of what I receive.  Some items are more interesting\nthan others, but the difference between them is nowhere near the\ndifference of wanted ham vs unsolicited spam.  So, I find myself\ngiving the nod to lots of items, but only turning down a few.\nSpamBayes would like equal examples of both, if possible.\n<p>I&#8217;ll still be playing with this for awhile, but I need to look\n\naround at other machine learning tech.  I’m just hacking around,\nbut the important thing is to try to understand the algorithms\nbetter and know how they work and why.  Bayes is in vogue right now,\nbut as Mark Pilgrim intimated, it’s not magic.  It’s just “advanced” :)\n<p>In the immortal words of <a href=\"http://www.spidereyeballs.com/os6/set3/small_os6_d3_3596_sm.html\">Mark Jason Dominus</a>: &#8220;You can&#8217;t just make shit\n\nup and expect the computer to know what you mean, retardo!”",

Tiny, cheap, fanless PCs with trailing-edge processors -- only  1GHz -- are nevertheless a really amazingly cool idea, especially when you start thinking in terms of turning them into personal video recorders (running things like FreeVo) or in-car GPS navigation systems. Or Beowulf clusters.Source: Charlie's Diary    (via Boing Boing)\tAlthough I currently am on the low end of disposable income, I’m keeping my eye on tiny cases, motherboards, and just-slightly-slower-than-insanity CPUs for projects just such as these.  I want a PVR, a few file servers, maybe a homebrew game console.  I also wouldn’t mind buying a pile of OpenBricks for general living-in-the-future purposes around the house, and to experiment with clustering and networking.  Would also be neat to learn some hardware hacking again to build some clever devices like this CD changing robot",

    "summary": "I joined the Apache project for the software. I stayed for the community. Likewise Perl. The software is interesting, but the people are more interesting. So now that I'm really not even writing much Perl, I'm still involved with the community, to some degree, because they are cool people. Source: DrBacchus' Journal: Software and community\tI’ve been working with Perl for just about 10 years now, and though I’ve been a bit of a stranger lately, I used to be a regular on #perl on several IRC networks.  And, when companies I worked for paid for travel as freely as for paper clips, I made rounds at a few conferences.  I was lucky enough to meet a few other #perl regulars.  I doubt most of them remember me since they‘re a fairly close-nit group, and I’d only made the one appearance, despite constantly swearing I’d make it to a YAPC at some point.  But I always thought it was cool as hell to actually have had a beer at the same table in Boston with authors of some of my favorite O‘Reilly perl books.\n\n<p>But, I got busy, stopped hanging out in <span class=\"caps\">IRC</span> so much, and also decided that I needed to expand my horizons and stop being so narrowly focused on one language.  I got into Java, Python, shell scripting, and <span class=\"caps\">PHP</span>.  I started this weblog, and I tried to purposefully keep away from Perl.  Of course, I can&#8217;t stay away, because Perl code comes out of my fingertips as naturally as breathing when a problem presents itself for solution.</p>\n\n<p>And then there&#8217;s community.  I&#8217;ve yet to find a Java community as quirky and entertaining as that surrounding Perl.  Thus, Java bores me.  I use it, but it&#8217;s strictly business, mostly.</p>\n\n<p>When what you&#8216;re doing <strong>is</strong> strictly business, I guess that&#8217;s desirable.  But when you eat, sleep, and breathe this stuff, having a group of people constantly doing clever things and being odd certainly makes it more rewarding.  It&#8217;s predictability versus creativity.  To get the job done, you want solid and dependable tools.  To have fun, you want some challenge and unexpected results.</p>\n\n<p>To me, Perl and its community offers both.  I think Python might, also, but I&#8217;m not as familiar there.  Java and other technologies are mostly business.  Maybe this also crosses over into the difference between IT people and CS people, and whether you&#8216;re here to work or here to play and get paid.</p>\n\n<p>Hmm.</p>",
