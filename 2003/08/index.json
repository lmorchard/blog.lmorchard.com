Because it&#39;s cheaper, and I have less disposable income these\ndays.  And, well, it seemed like fun to try another virtual server\ncompany, since I&#39;ve been looking into it so much lately.  The new\nserver has less capacity than the one I&#39;ve had at <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies\">JohnCompanies</a>, but I\nreally don&#39;t need all that much -- just a roof over my files and a\nroot password.  Well, I don&#39;t really need a root password, but it&#39;s\nnice to have so that I can tinker around with more things with fewer\nquestions asked of the management.  (For what it&#39;s worth, we&#39;re still\nusing <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies\">JohnCompanies</a> servers for hosting at my work.)\n<br /><br />\nI&#39;ve almost got this server migration thing down to a science, though,\nsince I had everything over and up in a few hours.

In fact, they&apos;re using\n<a href=\"http://www.bestpractical.com/rt//\" target=\"_top\">RT</a> for their support ticket\nmanagement.  Responsiveness has been one of the most impressive aspects\nof <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies\">JohnCompanies</a>, since between my personal server and the servers\nI use at work, it tends to take less than an hour to get resolution\non any problems I&apos;ve had.  So far, JVDS has yet to disappoint me as\nwell.</p>\n"

Post it on your server and tell me to come &amp;#38; get it.  When I get the notification, I&amp;#8217;ll then decide whether or not I want to bother.  There are a lot of details to fill in here, such as secure posting and retrieval, trust and identity, notification mechanisms.  But, it certainly would seem to balance out the equation a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to do it, though, so that things are still at least as simple to use as existing email, such as it is?&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=email_feeds</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090668\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=09c273bf21e69f92aa048905f94a4f21&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Martin Atkins</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090668\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-08-22T13:51:20\">2003-08-22T13:51:20</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Internet Mail 2000 will never happen. The time for creating Internet standards passed a decade ago. ISPs currently support email as it is today only because it was around when they started to exist. The same applies to USENET. Getting them to provide a new alternative email service to their customers is as unlikely as all ISPs running a Jabber server with accounts for each customer, or providing an Atom syndication proxy which sucks down Atom feeds and re-syndicates them to customers.\nGeeks can, of course, run their own Internet Mail 2000 servers and services, but today's average Internet user will not do this and will go on using the service provided by their ISP or free mail service of choice.\nIt's a shame, but that's how it is.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090669\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ac977ef3ec28ccaca80e5cbf6db0b1b7&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Curtis Seyfried</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090669\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-08-22T17:40:20\">2003-08-22T17:40:20</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">On first reading this concept is definetly interesting. But, a flaw becomes evident. The notification that userX wants to send an e-mail to userZ, is the same as sending e-mail.

The time for creating Internet standards passed a decade ago. ISPs currently support email as it is today only because it was around when they started to exist. The same applies to USENET. Getting them to provide a new alternative email service to their customers is as unlikely as all ISPs running a Jabber server with accounts for each customer, or providing an Atom syndication proxy which sucks down Atom feeds and re-syndicates them to customers.\r\n\r\nGeeks can, of course, run their own Internet Mail 2000 servers and services, but today's average Internet user will not do this and will go on using the service provided by their ISP or free mail service of choice.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame, but that's how it is.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090669\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ac977ef3ec28ccaca80e5cbf6db0b1b7&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Curtis Seyfried</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090669\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-08-22T17:40:20\">2003-08-22T17:40:20</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">On first reading this concept is definetly interesting.

I know I&#8217;ve been <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/syndicated_whuffie.phtml\">talking about it</a>\nfor awhile, but procrastination and being busy all round kept me from getting\nto it.  Funny thing is, when I finally got a chance to really check things out,\nthe integration was a snap.  I&#8217;d anticipated a bit of work, but was pleasantly\nsurprised.  I doubt that any other aggregator written in\nPython would have a hard time with it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;If, that is, anyone else wants to do it.  I already knew it wasn&amp;#8217;t</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/07/linkdumps_are_like_sex\">magic pixy dust</a>\nbut I figured it might be worth a try.  I will be eating my dogfood\nfor awhile with this, but I&#8217;m thinking already that what&#8217;s good for spam\nmight not be so good for news aggregators.</p></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Srijith&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.srijith.net/trinetre/archives/2003/08/11/index.shtml#000373&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>mentions some snags in ignoring some of the semantics of a news item,\nsuch as whether a word appears in the item&#8217;s title or information about\nthe item&#8217;s source.  I don&#8217;t think that this completely\napplies to how I&#8217;m doing classification, since SpamBayes appears to\ndifferentiate between words found in email headers and the body itself.\nWhen I feed an item to SpamBayes for training and scoring, I represent\nit as something like an email message, with headers like date, subject,\nfrom, and an &#8220;X-Link&#8221; header for the link.  However, even with this,\nI think Srijith&#8217;s got a point when he writes that this method will miss\na lot of available clues for classification.</p></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Unlike Srijith&amp;#8217;s examples, though, I&amp;#8217;m not trying to train my</code></pre>\n<p>aggregator to sift entries into any specific categories.  So far, I&#8217;ve\nbeen trying to get it to discriminate between what I really want to\nread, and what I&#8217;m not so interested in.  So, I figured that something\nwhich can learn the difference between spam and normal email could help.\nBut, although it&#8217;s early, I&#8217;m noticing a few things about the results and\nI&#8217;ve had a few things occur to me.</p></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;See, in the case of ham vs spam, I really want all the ham and none of</code></pre>\n<p>the spam.  A method to differentiate between these two should be\noptimized toward one answer or the other.  SpamBayes offers &#8220;I don&#8217;t\nknow&#8221; as a third answer, but it&#8217;s not geared toward anything else\nin-between.  However, in measuring something like &#8220;interest&#8220;,\ninbetween answers are useful.  I want all of the interesting stuff,\nsome of the sort-of interesting stuff, and a little of the rest.</p></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This is also a problem for me in deciding to what I</code></pre>\n<p>should give a thumbs up and what gets the thumbs down.  Even though\nI&#8217;ve subscribed to a little over 300 feeds, every item from each of\nthem is somewhat interesting to me.  I wouldn&#8217;t have subscribed to the\nfeed if there wasn&#8217;t anything of interest there, so I&#8217;ve already\nbiased the content of what I receive.  Some items are more interesting\nthan others, but the difference between them is nowhere near the\ndifference of wanted ham vs unsolicited spam.  So, I find myself\ngiving the nod to lots of items, but only turning down a few.\nSpamBayes would like equal examples of both, if possible.</p></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll still be playing with this for awhile, but I need to look</code></pre>\n<p>around at other machine learning tech.

I know I&#8217;ve been <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/syndicated_whuffie.phtml\">talking about it</a>\r\nfor awhile, but procrastination and being busy all round kept me from getting\r\nto it.  Funny thing is, when I finally got a chance to really check things out,\r\nthe integration was a snap.  I&#8217;d anticipated a bit of work, but was pleasantly\r\nsurprised.  I doubt that any other aggregator written in\r\nPython would have a hard time with it.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>If, that is, anyone else wants to do it.  I already knew it wasn&#8217;t\r\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/07/linkdumps_are_like_sex\">magic pixy dust</a>\r\nbut I figured it might be worth a try.  I will be eating my dogfood\r\nfor awhile with this, but I&#8217;m thinking already that what&#8217;s good for spam\r\nmight not be so good for news aggregators.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Srijith&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.srijith.net/trinetre/archives/2003/08/11/index.shtml#000373\">post</a>\r\nmentions some snags in ignoring some of the semantics of a news item,\r\nsuch as whether a word appears in the item&#8217;s title or information about\r\nthe item&#8217;s source.  I don&#8217;t think that this completely\r\napplies to how I&#8217;m doing classification, since SpamBayes appears to\r\ndifferentiate between words found in email headers and the body itself.\r\nWhen I feed an item to SpamBayes for training and scoring, I represent\r\nit as something like an email message, with headers like date, subject,\r\nfrom, and an &#8220;X-Link&#8221; header for the link.  However, even with this,\r\nI think Srijith&#8217;s got a point when he writes that this method will miss\r\na lot of available clues for classification.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Unlike Srijith&#8217;s examples, though, I&#8217;m not trying to train my\r\naggregator to sift entries into any specific categories.  So far, I&#8217;ve\r\nbeen trying to get it to discriminate between what I really want to\r\nread, and what I&#8217;m not so interested in.  So, I figured that something\r\nwhich can learn the difference between spam and normal email could help.\r\nBut, although it&#8217;s early, I&#8217;m noticing a few things about the results and\r\nI&#8217;ve had a few things occur to me.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>See, in the case of ham vs spam, I really want all the ham and none of\r\nthe spam.  A method to differentiate between these two should be\r\noptimized toward one answer or the other.  SpamBayes offers &#8220;I don&#8217;t\r\nknow&#8221; as a third answer, but it&#8217;s not geared toward anything else\r\nin-between.  However, in measuring something like &#8220;interest&#8220;,\r\ninbetween answers are useful.  I want all of the interesting stuff,\r\nsome of the sort-of interesting stuff, and a little of the rest.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>This is also a problem for me in deciding to what I\r\nshould give a thumbs up and what gets the thumbs down.  Even though\r\nI&#8217;ve subscribed to a little over 300 feeds, every item from each of\r\nthem is somewhat interesting to me.  I wouldn&#8217;t have subscribed to the\r\nfeed if there wasn&#8217;t anything of interest there, so I&#8217;ve already\r\nbiased the content of what I receive.  Some items are more interesting\r\nthan others, but the difference between them is nowhere near the\r\ndifference of wanted ham vs unsolicited spam.  So, I find myself\r\ngiving the nod to lots of items, but only turning down a few.\r\nSpamBayes would like equal examples of both, if possible.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I&#8217;ll still be playing with this for awhile, but I need to look\r\naround at other machine learning tech.  I&#8217;m just hacking around,\r\nbut the important thing is to try to understand the algorithms\r\nbetter and know how they work and why.
