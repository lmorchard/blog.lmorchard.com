I think it was during the first grade, when I was a hyper,\neasily bored kid.  I would get class work done quickly and early, yet\nforget to turn it in.  Then, I would disrupt class until I was somehow\ncalmed down or sent to the principal.  I seem to remember that, once,\nI was caught scaling a classroom wall via the curtains.

I remember\nhim as a tall, bald, and imposing man whose breath always smelled\nfunny.  (This was long, long before I knew about coffee and had become\nhopelessly addicted myself.)  The man scared me, since he was known\nhave spanked students in the old days, and though he wasn&apos;t allowed to\ndo that anymore he still had the power to call my Mom.

Though I had\nalready been introduced to video games via our Atari 2600 at home, I\nhad little idea what this thing was.\n<br><br>\nHe showed me how to turn everything on, and introduced me to a stack\nof workbooks as tall as I was.  Each book was about 1/4&quot; thick and the\ncover colors were a rainbow of progressive difficulty.  He told me\nthat he was trying to decide whether or not to start teaching\ncomputers in the school, and that these books were what the company\nsent him for classes.  He wanted me to try them out for him and see\nwhat I could do with the computer before he bought more for the\nschool.\n<br><br>\nFrom then on, when my class work was done, I had a pass to go to the\nprincipal&apos;s office and work through the books with the computer until\neither I ran out of books or the year ended.  I worked mostly on my\nown, with a heavy sense that it was something special I&apos;d been trusted\nwith.  As the principal went about his daily work, I was barely\nsupervised with this expensive machine, and I felt I needed to prove I\nwas worth it.\n<br><br>\n<img src=\"http://www.futurecast.com/futurechronicles/images/y2k.gif\" width=\"79\" height=\"75\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\">\nMy grades and my behavior improved as I tore through the workbooks in\nhis office.  There was so much to learn and play with.  I remember\nwith unusual clarity writing a program that asked me for my birthday\nand replied with my age in the year 2000.  It dazzled me that\nsomething I programmed into the computer could tell me about myself,\nall grown up, in the twenty-first century.  You know, the year when\nall science fiction stories came true!  But there I was, playing with\nthe stuff of sci-fi already.\n<br><br>\nAnd the greatest thing, as the books began to ask more creativity and\noriginality from me in my assignments, I felt my mind stretch.  I&apos;d\nnever quite felt that before, and it was so amazing.  Part of it was,\nI&apos;m sure, just a property of the elasticity of the brain at that age,\nbut I&apos;m sure my time at the computer helped.  Every day, I remembered\nand could do more.  My thoughts were becoming more ordered and\norganized, as programming the computer required it.\n<br><br>\nBut, after a few months, observing my obvious enthusiasm for the work,\nthe principal took me out of his experiment.  I was disappointed but\nhe told me that he&apos;d decided to build a computer lab and turn what I&apos;d\nbeen doing into a real class for everyone in the school.  I crossed my\nfingers: There were still plenty of books left to get through, and I\nwas just getting to the fun things like graphics and sound.\n<br><br>\nWhen the school&apos;s little computer lab was finally opened, all the kids\ngot sorted into groups of five or so, and each rotated through a\nweekly schedule of hour-long visits.  When my group&apos;s turn came, I was\ncrushed: I found that there were no assignments, just Pac Man and\nMissile Command and a smattering of math and vocabulary games.  We\nwere handed joysticks and told not to touch anything else.\n<br><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=76\"><img src=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/atari_400.jpg\" width=\"175\" height=\"138\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"></a>\nThese machines were <a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=76\" target=\"_top\">Atari 400</a>&apos;s \nand looked so much less advanced than what I&apos;d been used to.  I\nremember there being an intense nervous aura radiating from the\nsupervising teacher on duty in the lab, just waiting for one of us to\ndestroy these things.  And, when I asked if I could have a BASIC\ncartridge to work on some of my programs, I told that if I didn&apos;t\nwant to participate in the computer activities I could just go back to\nclass.

And, now that everyone played with the\ncomputers, I got teased for not being so special anymore.
