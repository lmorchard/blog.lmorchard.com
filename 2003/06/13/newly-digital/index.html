along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/06/09/television.visitors.reut/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;the news&lt;/a&gt;
that NBC may be revisiting the old 1983 scifi series &quot;V&quot;, and I was reminded that that
was right around the time I got my first computer.  I&#39;ve been meaning
to write something for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalsey.com/2003/05/newly_digital/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Newly Digital&lt;/a&gt;,
so here goes:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My history with computers starts a few years earlier than 1983,
though.  I think it was during the first grade, when I was a hyper,
easily bored kid.  I would get class work done quickly and early, yet
forget to turn it in.  Then, I would disrupt class until I was somehow
calmed down or sent to the principal.  I seem to remember that, once,
I was caught scaling a classroom wall via the curtains.  How far I
made if before being caught, I&#39;m not sure, but it seemed like miles
to me at the time.  I remember being the only one happy about it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One day though, the usual trip to the principal changed.  I remember
him as a tall, bald, and imposing man whose breath always smelled
funny.  (This was long, long before I knew about coffee and had become
hopelessly addicted myself.)  The man scared me, since he was known
have spanked students in the old days, and though he wasn&#39;t allowed to
do that anymore he still had the power to call my Mom.  And I&#39;m pretty
sure most everyone knows the little-kid terror of that.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=460&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/atari_800.jpg&quot; width=&quot;175&quot; height=&quot;123&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; hspace=&quot;8&quot; vspace=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
This particular visit, though, he led me back into his office, and sat
me down in front of an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;amp;c=460&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Atari 800&lt;/a&gt;
and a TV screen.  Though I had
already been introduced to video games via our Atari 2600 at home, I
had little idea what this thing was.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He showed me how to turn everything on, and introduced me to a stack
of workbooks as tall as I was.  Each book was about 1/4&quot; thick and the
cover colors were a rainbow of progressive difficulty.  He told me
that he was trying to decide whether or not to start teaching
computers in the school, and that these books were what the company
sent him for classes.  He wanted me to try them out for him and see
what I could do with the computer before he bought more for the
school.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From then on, when my class work was done, I had a pass to go to the
principal&#39;s office and work through the books with the computer until
either I ran out of books or the year ended.  I worked mostly on my
own, with a heavy sense that it was something special I&#39;d been trusted
with.  As the principal went about his daily work, I was barely
supervised with this expensive machine, and I felt I needed to prove I
was worth it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.futurecast.com/futurechronicles/images/y2k.gif&quot; width=&quot;79&quot; height=&quot;75&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; hspace=&quot;8&quot; vspace=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
My grades and my behavior improved as I tore through the workbooks in
his office.  There was so much to learn and play with.  I remember
with unusual clarity writing a program that asked me for my birthday
and replied with my age in the year 2000.  It dazzled me that
something I programmed into the computer could tell me about myself,
all grown up, in the twenty-first century.  You know, the year when
all science fiction stories came true!  But there I was, playing with
the stuff of sci-fi already.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And the greatest thing, as the books began to ask more creativity and
originality from me in my assignments, I felt my mind stretch.  I&#39;d
never quite felt that before, and it was so amazing.  Part of it was,
I&#39;m sure, just a property of the elasticity of the brain at that age,
but I&#39;m sure my time at the computer helped.  Every day, I remembered
and could do more.  My thoughts were becoming more ordered and
organized, as programming the computer required it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But, after a few months, observing my obvious enthusiasm for the work,
the principal took me out of his experiment.  I was disappointed but
he told me that he&#39;d decided to build a computer lab and turn what I&#39;d
been doing into a real class for everyone in the school.  I crossed my
fingers: There were still plenty of books left to get through, and I
was just getting to the fun things like graphics and sound.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When the school&#39;s little computer lab was finally opened, all the kids
got sorted into groups of five or so, and each rotated through a
weekly schedule of hour-long visits.  When my group&#39;s turn came, I was
crushed: I found that there were no assignments, just Pac Man and
Missile Command and a smattering of math and vocabulary games.  We
were handed joysticks and told not to touch anything else.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=76&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/atari_400.jpg&quot; width=&quot;175&quot; height=&quot;138&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; hspace=&quot;8&quot; vspace=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
These machines were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;amp;c=76&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Atari 400&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s 
and looked so much less advanced than what I&#39;d been used to.  I
remember there being an intense nervous aura radiating from the
supervising teacher on duty in the lab, just waiting for one of us to
destroy these things.  And, when I asked if I could have a BASIC
cartridge to work on some of my programs, I told that if I didn&#39;t
want to participate in the computer activities I could just go back to
class.  As bitter as a first or second grader could be, I was.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
See, I&#39;d gotten teased a bit for the special treatment in the
beginning, but I didn&#39;t mind.  And, now that everyone played with the
computers, I got teased for not being so special anymore.  What I
couldn&#39;t get across to anyone, not even my teachers, was that they
weren&#39;t getting what I had.  There was so much more they could have.
Well, I&#39;m not sure my thoughts were so mature at the time, but I felt
like everyone, including me, had been cheated.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/TN_basicgames.JPG&quot; width=&quot;97&quot; height=&quot;128&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; hspace=&quot;8&quot; vspace=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
So that ended my education in hands-on programming, temporarily.  I took to
reading more computer books, often bought from the school book fair,
like David Ahl&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;BASIC Computer Games&lt;/a&gt;.
Lacking a computer of my own, I read and ran though the
programs in my head.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;amp;c=18&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/tandy_trs80-model3_1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;120&quot; height=&quot;105&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; hspace=&quot;8&quot; vspace=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
For the next year or so, I had sporadic access to computers.  My Uncle had a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;amp;c=18&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;TRS 80 Model III&lt;/a&gt;
that he let me use during visits.  That thing mostly
confused me though, as I was introduced for the first time to an
alternate flavor of BASIC.  And still, there was the not-mine feeling
and my Uncle&#39;s protectiveness of his expensive business machine.
My grandparents also had a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;amp;c=252&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;VIC-20&lt;/a&gt;,
but sans tape drive or hard drive, so every visit was starting over
from scratch.  Nothing would substitute for what I&#39;d had: My own time
with the machine, doing things myself, building one thing atop another.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then, the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;amp;c=98&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Commodore 64&lt;/a&gt;
arrived at the local K-Mart.  I was in love.  This was it for me, and
I raved about it constantly.  I never quite expected to get one,
though, since the thing was expensive, especially for a kid my age.  And
besides, computers were always something that someone else had.  But I
guess I must&#39;ve really gotten on Santa&#39;s good side, because I was met
with this surprise on Christmas morning that year:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog-images/first-c64.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog-images/first-c64-sm.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That first computer was really something.  It was mine, given to me by
my family as a whole.  No one protecting it from me, fearing I&#39;d break
it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So I attacked it.  I learned everything about it, buried myself in
books and magazines, figured out how every bit of it worked and could
be used.  More than once, I&#39;d gone at it with a screwdriver to see
what was inside.  Then I went at it with a soldering iron to add
things like a reset switch and RCA audio output.  I made friends with
people at a local computer store, and they let me be a guinea pig to
test new software and hardware for the thing.  At one point in fourth
grade, I learned 6502 assembly, printed out a disassembly of the
machine&#39;s kernel, and mapped out what everything did.  I still have
that print-out, bound with rubber cement, and full of my scrawlings.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That Commodore 64 would be my gateway to all sorts of further hackery
and geekery, as well as a means of meeting more of my kind.  After
getting a modem, it became my entry point to local (and not-so-local)
bulletin boards, and eventually my first tastes of the Internet.  I
was still using that Commodore 64 up until my last year of High
School, coincidentally the year of the machine&#39;s last production
run.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;ve had other computers since that Commodore 64, but it was opening
that box on Christmas Morning that let me continue the process that my
Elementary School principal had started for me, and I haven&#39;t stopped
since.  I love to feel my mind stretch, and I love to take things
apart and see what&#39;s inside.

guess I must&#39;ve really gotten on Santa&#39;s good side, because I was met
with this surprise on Christmas morning that year:
<br /><br /></p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog-images/first-c64.jpg"><img src="http://www.decafbad.com/blog-images/first-c64-sm.jpg" width="320" height="240" /></a></div>
<br /><br />
That first computer was really something.  It was mine, given to me by
my family as a whole.  No one protecting it from me, fearing I'd break
it.
<br /><br />
So I attacked it.  I learned everything about it, buried myself in
books and magazines, figured out how every bit of it worked and could
be used.  More than once, I'd gone at it with a screwdriver to see
what was inside.  Then I went at it with a soldering iron to add
things like a reset switch and RCA audio output.  I made friends with
people at a local computer store, and they let me be a guinea pig to
test new software and hardware for the thing.  At one point in fourth
grade, I learned 6502 assembly, printed out a disassembly of the
machine's kernel, and mapped out what everything did.  I still have
that print-out, bound with rubber cement, and full of my scrawlings.
<br /><br />
That Commodore 64 would be my gateway to all sorts of further hackery
and geekery, as well as a means of meeting more of my kind.  After
getting a modem, it became my entry point to local (and not-so-local)
bulletin boards, and eventually my first tastes of the Internet.  I
was still using that Commodore 64 up until my last year of High
School, coincidentally the year of the machine's last production
run.
<br /><br />
I've had other computers since that Commodore 64, but it was opening
that box on Christmas Morning that let me continue the process that my
Elementary School principal had started for me, and I haven't stopped
since.  I love to feel my mind stretch, and I love to take things
apart and see what's inside.

<div class="content">David Ahl's BASIC Computer Games!  I think I still have that somewhere, the one with the red cover.
All the games were written for PC-flavored BASIC, so I remember having to make adjustments on the fly for Applesoft on our family's II+.</div>
