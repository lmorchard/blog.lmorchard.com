Finding the pattern is assumed to mean the ping was successful.\nA successful ping, then, causes the plugin to update the contents and timestamp\nof the status file with the response.\n<br /><br />\nThe status file is used by the plugin to determine whether or not a ping\nshould be sent.  This check is made everytime an item is viewed on my blog,\nand if the plugin sees a blog item whose timestamp is newer than that of\nthe status file, a ping is sent.\n<br /><br />\nSo!  Onto the punch-line: The appearance of the word &#39;congratulations&#39; and\nthe successful registration of a ping are not the same thing.  Apparently,\n<a href=\"http://www.blo.gs\" target=\"_top\">blo.gs</a> has been throwing up an error message in response to a ping, while\nstill registering a ping.  This error message does not contain the word\n&#39;congratulations&#39;, and so my plugin never updates the status file, and so\nit happily tries pinging <a href=\"http://www.blo.gs\" target=\"_top\">blo.gs</a> again with the next blog view.\n<br /><br />\nTwo lessons learned here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> When using a web service, whether a \"real\" service or a \"scraped\" service, be very sure to know and handle the difference between a valid response and an exception or error in the service itself.\n</li>\n<li> When using a web service, take care with your usage pattern.  That is, just how important is success?  Important enough to try again and again?  Or could you wait awhile, whether successful or not?  Or should you even try again?\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br /><br />\nMy plugin doesn't know the real meaning of the response to a ping.  And further,\nthe fact that it's designed to try, try again in the case of apparent failure\nis not the greatest choice for a usage pattern.\n<br /><br />\nSo... longwinded post, but I think the realizations are valuable.\n<!--more-->\nshortname=blo_gs_gone_wild\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083912\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://trikuare.cx/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0a5b2c20fe4587a2b0abc3738c953e53&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://trikuare.cx/\">magenta</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083912\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-06-05T00:29:21\">2003-06-05T00:29:21</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">What would be really nice is if the blo.gs response page made clever use of CSS like the W3C validator, by putting one (and, of course, only one) &lt;div id=\"result\" class=\"valid\"&gt; (or class=\"error\") in the response, with the actual error message inside.
