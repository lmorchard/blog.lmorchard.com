        <meta property="og:description" content="I&#39;ve written before that I love XML-RPC, and
that it has served me well in the past couple of years.  I think it&#39;s the right tool for a broad
range of jobs.  But, after having studied the spec, and after having implemented it in a handful
of languages for a handful of well-used apps, I think the spec needs just a bit of fixing.
In particular, the spec needs a tweak with regards to this &quot;ASCII limitation&quot;.  There is confusion
about this, period.  I&#39;ve had to hash this out with clients before, this 
was an issue of note while
working out an XML-RPC based Wiki API,
and it&#39;s obviously an issue in many other projects.  This, of course, includes the current
hubbub surrounding weblog APIs and whatnot.
So, please fix the spec.  It shouldn&#39;t take long to make this issue a non-issue by some simple
clarification in the main XmlRpc to which everyone refers.
Yes, I know there&#39;s a bit of clarification at the end of the spec, involving escaping (
not encoding) &lt; and &amp; along
with the statement that &quot;A string can be used to encode binary data.&quot;  
Well, yeah, I do that
all the time with Base64.  And, since
the spec earlier had called for &quot;ASCII&quot;, I assume that&#39;s what encoding
binary data means in the context of this spec.  To me, encoding implies a transformation 
from original form to some other form later requiring decoding.
But, apparently, my interpretation and 
the interpretation of others
is wrong on that score.  But still, I&#39;ve been confused, and so have others.  Consider this a bug report.
I&#39;ve been referred by Fredrik Lundh (via Dave Winer), 
to &quot;private conversations&quot;,
&quot;various public fora&quot;, and &quot;early archives for the XML-RPC mailing list&quot;.  And, again by Fredrik Lundh,
I&#39;m told:
But even if you don&#39;t know all this, it&#39;s not that hard to figure it out for
yourself. Just make sure you read and digest the entire specification, apply some common sense
to sort out the contradictions, and you&#39;ll find that it&#39;s pretty obvious that the intent is that
you can use any character allowed by XML.





Well, let&#39;s see.  I read the whole spec, more than once, and what I figured out for myself with my 
&quot;common sense&quot; is what I wrote above.  I thought
the spec called for ASCII (as in: ASCII), and assumed that
encoding binary data called for something like Base64.  Yes, I realize that XmlRpc is XML, but
when a spec calls for ASCII as a particular part, I assume that there&#39;s a reason for it
since that&#39;s what the specification specified.  
In my experience, specifications are not about common sense, figuring it out, and
connotation.  Specifications are
about declaration, clarity, and 
denotation.  
Yes, I understand that no
spec is perfect, and that many are steaming piles meeting none of the criteria I just mentioned,
but that doesn&#39;t alter the goal.  A spec can always be made better by revising 
with these things in mind, given the input of consumers of the spec.  This is what a process
of communication is all about, and specifications are intended as a form of communication.
So, instead of talking about intent and things that have been talked about somewhere
at some time, with the implication that I should just go off and search for these things, can 
we just get a clarifying fix to the XmlRpc spec?  I don&#39;t want to send my clients off to 
mailing list and discussion archives, or present XmlRpc with any corrections or caveats.  I
want to say, as I have been, &quot;Here, go to xmlrpc.com, read the spec, implement to the API
I emailed you, and get back to me.&quot;  Only, it&#39;d be nice if the first question is about my API, 
not about character encoding.
I&#39;ve been confused, and so have others.  I consider myself a smart person, and I consider most
of the others who have been confused as even smarter.  I apologize if my &quot;common sense&quot; is of a
different sort, but that&#39;s what you have to deal with in the world of people.  As young as I am,
even I&#39;ve discovered this already.
So, can we just get a clarifying revision of the spec?  And if not, why not?
Update: Rock on.  After catching up 
on a bit of banter over at Sam&#39;s place, I see that
the same Fredrik Lundh I quoted before has already begun an
XML-RPC errata page with the goal of clarification.
(I just missed it in my daily reading thus far.)  As 
Mark comments, I fear bumps in the
road as any confused implementors find things weren&#39;t what they thought, but I&#39;m happy to see
the clarification accepted.
Update again: If you&#39;ve stopped rocking, resume.  Dave Winer 
updated the XML-RPC spec.
It was a small change, could have been more, but had not been done at all until now.  I
doubt that my asking please really had much to do with it, but I couldn&#39;t guess that it 
hurt.  Thanks!" />

<div class="content">"I consider myself a smart person, and I consider most of the others who have been confused as even smarter."
Oh, I'm really stupid, but I had no problem noticing that the specification wasn't consistent with itself, and that three out of four references to encodings said that "any XML character" could be used ;-)
"So, can we just get a clarifying revision of the spec?"
Sure can; the "ASCII" is gone.
"And if not, why not?"
I don't have access to Dave's site ;-)
