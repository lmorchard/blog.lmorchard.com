        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;ve written before that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooccb.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;I love XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt;, and
that it has served me well in the past couple of years.  I think it&amp;apos;s the right tool for a broad
range of jobs.  But, after having studied the spec, and after having implemented it in a handful
of languages for a handful of well-used apps, I think the spec needs just a bit of fixing.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In particular, the spec needs a tweak with regards to this &amp;quot;ASCII limitation&amp;quot;.  There is confusion
about this, period.  I&amp;apos;ve had to hash this out with clients before, this 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=WikiRPCInterfaceUTF8VsBase64&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;was an issue of note&lt;/a&gt; while
working out an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;XML-RPC based Wiki API&lt;/a&gt;,
and it&amp;apos;s obviously an issue in many other projects.  This, of course, includes the current
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/06/why_we_need_ech.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;hubbub surrounding weblog APIs and whatnot&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, please fix the spec.  It shouldn&amp;apos;t take long to make this issue a non-issue by some simple
clarification in the main &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc&quot;&gt;XmlRpc&lt;/a&gt; to which everyone refers.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes, I know there&amp;apos;s a bit of clarification at the end of the spec, involving escaping (
&lt;a href=&quot;http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/28/Learning&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;not encoding&lt;/a&gt;) &amp;lt; and &amp;amp; along
with the statement that &amp;quot;A string can be used to encode binary data.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Well, yeah, I do that
all the time with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/base64/rfc1341.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Base64&lt;/a&gt;.  And, since
the spec earlier had called for &amp;quot;ASCII&amp;quot;, I assume that&amp;apos;s what &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=encoding&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;encoding&lt;/a&gt;
binary data means in the context of this spec.  To me, encoding implies a transformation 
from original form to some other form later requiring decoding.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But, apparently, my interpretation and 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1498.html#c1056921193&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;the interpretation of others&lt;/a&gt;
is wrong on that score.  But still, I&amp;apos;ve been confused, and so have others.  Consider this a bug report.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;apos;ve been referred &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-ascii.htm&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;by Fredrik Lundh&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/06/29#When:6:21:27AM&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;via Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt;), 
to &amp;quot;private conversations&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;various public fora&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;early archives for the XML-RPC mailing list&amp;quot;.  And, again by Fredrik Lundh,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-ascii.htm&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;I&amp;apos;m told&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;But even if you don&amp;apos;t know all this, it&amp;apos;s not that hard to figure it out for
yourself. Just make sure you read and digest the entire specification, apply some common sense
to sort out the contradictions, and you&amp;apos;ll find that it&amp;apos;s pretty obvious that the intent is that
you can use any character allowed by XML.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Well, let&amp;apos;s see.  I read the whole spec, more than once, and what I figured out for myself with my 
&amp;quot;common sense&amp;quot; is what I wrote above.  I thought
the spec called for ASCII (as in: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asciitable.com/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;ASCII&lt;/a&gt;), and assumed that
encoding binary data called for something like Base64.  Yes, I realize that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc&quot;&gt;XmlRpc&lt;/a&gt; is XML, but
when a spec calls for ASCII as a particular part, I assume that there&amp;apos;s a reason for it
since that&amp;apos;s what the specification specified.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In my experience, specifications are not about common sense, figuring it out, and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=connotation&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;connotation&lt;/a&gt;.  Specifications are
about declaration, clarity, and 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=denotation&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;denotation&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes, I understand that no
spec is perfect, and that many are steaming piles meeting none of the criteria I just mentioned,
but that doesn&amp;apos;t alter the goal.  A spec can always be made better by revising 
with these things in mind, given the input of consumers of the spec.  This is what a process
of communication is all about, and specifications are intended as a form of communication.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, instead of talking about &lt;i&gt;intent&lt;/i&gt; and things that have been talked about somewhere
at some time, with the implication that I should just go off and search for these things, can 
we just get a clarifying fix to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc&quot;&gt;XmlRpc&lt;/a&gt; spec?  I don&amp;apos;t want to send my clients off to 
mailing list and discussion archives, or present &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc&quot;&gt;XmlRpc&lt;/a&gt; with any corrections or caveats.  I
want to say, as I have been, &amp;quot;Here, go to xmlrpc.com, read the spec, implement to the API
I emailed you, and get back to me.&amp;quot;  Only, it&amp;apos;d be nice if the first question is about my API, 
not about character encoding.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;apos;ve been confused, and so have others.  I consider myself a smart person, and I consider most
of the others who have been confused as even smarter.  I apologize if my &amp;quot;common sense&amp;quot; is of a
different sort, but that&amp;apos;s what you have to deal with in the world of people.  As young as I am,
even I&amp;apos;ve discovered this already.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, can we just get a clarifying revision of the spec?  And if not, why not?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; Rock on.  After &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1498.html#c1056890028&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;catching up&lt;/a&gt; 
on a bit of banter over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1498.htm&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Sam&amp;apos;s place&lt;/a&gt;, I see that
the same Fredrik Lundh I quoted before has already begun an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-errata.htm&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;XML-RPC errata&lt;/a&gt; page with the goal of clarification.
(I just missed it in my daily reading thus far.)  As 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1498.html#c1056904400&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Mark comments&lt;/a&gt;, I fear bumps in the
road as any confused implementors find things weren&amp;apos;t what they thought, but I&amp;apos;m happy to see
the clarification accepted.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Update again:&lt;/b&gt; If you&amp;apos;ve stopped rocking, resume.  Dave Winer 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/06/30#When:11:41:21AM&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;updated the XML-RPC spec&lt;/a&gt;.
It was a small change, could have been more, but had not been done at all until now.  I
doubt that my asking please really had much to do with it, but I couldn&amp;apos;t guess that it 
hurt.  Thanks!

<div class="content">"I consider myself a smart person, and I consider most of the others who have been confused as even smarter."
Oh, I'm really stupid, but I had no problem noticing that the specification wasn't consistent with itself, and that three out of four references to encodings said that "any XML character" could be used ;-)
"So, can we just get a clarifying revision of the spec?"
Sure can; the "ASCII" is gone.
"And if not, why not?"
I don't have access to Dave's site ;-)
