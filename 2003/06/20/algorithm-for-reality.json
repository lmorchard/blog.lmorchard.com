Apparently something about the way the dreaming brain processes text makes it impossible for it to present the same thing twice.\n\nI don&#39;t know if this holds for hallucinations, which of course, aren&#39;t the same as dreams.  But it&#39;s safer than stepping in front of a bus.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221088411&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://ironmonkey.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=083fc6c2f9383f0f8365b2100d465b2b&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://ironmonkey.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221088411&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-07-07T14:35:59&quot;&gt;2003-07-07T14:35:59&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;This won&#39;t tell you whether you are in the Matrix, since the simulated calculator in the Matrix would work just fine.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
