So, after having seen Matrix Reloaded, and having read advice on 
<a href="http://www.jetpress.org/volume7/simulation.html" target="_top">how to live in a simulation</a>,
I find myself wondering, how might I determine whether I&#39;m living in a simulation?<br>Well, I figure chances are, I&#39;m not even living in a decent simulation.  In fact, I could
just be hallucinating right now.  So, Aaron Swartz comes to the rescue with a very
reasonable empirical test I can perform.  Everything seems to check out.
<br /><br />
Problem is, though, the test is completely dependant upon me and my perceptions.
First, I have to pick a really big number that&#39;s outside my ability to perform
a square root on it in my head.  Then, someone else performs the square root
on a calculator.  I then square that number by hand, and that answer should match
my first, and since I couldn&#39;t possibly perform a square root that large in
my head, the answer must&#39;ve come from outside my head.
<br /><br />
Except for this:  If I&#39;m hallucinating, then there&#39;s a subdivision of me controlling
the perceptions of another subdivision of me.  Who&#39;s to say that the me who&#39;s
performing this test isn&#39;t a complete idiot, and all the math skills are in the
part producing the hallucinations?  Or, hell, what if for the duration of the test
my hallucination producing side decides to make me blind to any numbers greater than
4?
<br /><br />
Hmm.  Well, just to be safe, I won&#39;t try the alternate &quot;Step in front of a bus
and see what happens&quot; test.

<div class="content">A generally accepted technique for determining if you are dreaming or not is to read some text, look away, and then attempt to read the same text.  Apparently something about the way the dreaming brain processes text makes it impossible for it to present the same thing twice.
I don&#39;t know if this holds for hallucinations, which of course, aren&#39;t the same as dreams.  But it&#39;s safer than stepping in front of a bus.</div>
