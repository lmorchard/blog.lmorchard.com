It just saves so much time, even though it can look a little wierd when the GUIDs are visible.\n\nThe thing about permalinks is that some people like them readable and meaningful - but hey, you do the coding, you make the choices. :)\n\nBTW, I&#39;m curious about your RSS stuff, since I&#39;ve just dropped in after jotting down some thoughts on Bayesian filtering over at <a href=\"http://mac.against.org/time/mac.2003-06-26\">http://mac.against.org/time/mac.2003-06-26</a> (please forgive the CSS and layout bugs, I&#39;m redecorating). I&#39;d kill for Bayesian categorization in Mail.app and a matching RSS reader, so if you can find the time, let us know more about it :)</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085017&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.voidstar.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4ca7f18e6a976271f93b665a6a84cec4&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.voidstar.com&quot;&gt;Julian Bond&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085017&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-06-26T04:12:34&quot;&gt;2003-06-26T04:12:34&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Puzzled by your last para. &quot;Personally, I think the GUID should be the permalink, if at all possible. I used to think that that was what the link of an RSS item should be, but then I never really maintained a weblog in the quote-link-comment style for long stretches.&quot; Are you sure you&#39;ve got that the right way round? I also agree that the link should be the permalink is at all possible, and I prefer that to link being the URL of some external article mentioned in the text of description. And that&#39;s *because* not all weblog entries are &quot;quote-link-comment&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085018&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085018&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-06-26T10:08:28&quot;&gt;2003-06-26T10:08:28&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Julian:\n</code></pre><p>Hmm, maybe that does need some clarification:  I do actually think that the &quot;link&quot; should be a link to which the entry refers, for the case of q-l-c-style entries.  I say this because there exist weblog entries in this style, a point that Dave Winer has reiterated many times and that I just understood recently.</p>\n<p>So, what I say is this:  Use the GUID to identify at your entry, in all cases, preferrably by permalink.  Only use the link tag if your entry happens to be mainly a comment on some other resource, and use the link tag to point at it.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;d <em>actually</em> wished that things worked out such that link points to the entry, and links under discussion remain in the description or body of the entry.  But since there&#39;s a disagreement over it, I&#39;d just as soon give up the link tag to link bloggers and assume the GUID tag for permalinks and have done with it.</p>\n<p>This makes sense to me as a way to clear up the variations from blog to blog - right now, I&#39;m never quite sure where I&#39;ll end up when I click on the link in my aggregator.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085019&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.seizethedave.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=82d457ebf5b4b9dc0a17c8cf4f32d92f&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.seizethedave.com/&quot;&gt;seizethedave&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085019&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-07-01T15:01:14&quot;&gt;2003-07-01T15:01:14&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;So, it&#39;s just talking about a unique identifier such as the URL to the post, not the 32-bit {4A4DBF1F-81D8-4063-AE33-F6D1F942BB13} GUID MS cooked up?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
