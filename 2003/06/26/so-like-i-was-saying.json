Imagine an Ebert &amp; Roeper feed, where the description would contain thumbs up or down, the link would point to the movie home page, and the GUID would be a permalink to the commentary page on the E&amp;R website.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221090509&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://philringnalda.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e68e9944f50a481a64b5a32fdfc02e0d&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://philringnalda.com&quot;&gt;Phil Ringnalda&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221090509&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-06-26T23:58:41&quot;&gt;2003-06-26T23:58:41&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;I think part of the constant confusion comes from the way that nobody ever says whether they are talking to producers of feeds, or developers of aggregators. A developer of an aggregator needs to know that if they see a guid and !(isPermalink=&quot;false&quot;) then that&#39;s the permalink, and if the link !== the guid, then it&#39;s a separate outbound link. What a producer of a feed needs to know is that they have the option of using link to point to what they are talking about, not themselves, and if they also want to point to themselves they should use guid. But the talk about only using guid for permalink, and omitting link if you don&#39;t want to use it for an outside link, is just flat out crazy. If you don&#39;t want to do an outside link, then by using link for the permalink you have a feed that will work with every aggregator written since 0.90. If you use guid and omit link, you have a feed that will work with some but not all aggregators written or rewritten since last fall. That&#39;s not just crazy, it&#39;s completely the opposite approach to the &quot;backward compatibility no matter what the cost&quot; way that Dave has always done RSS development. I just flat out don&#39;t understand why he would say that link SHOULD NOT be used for a weblog permalink.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221090510&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221090510&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-06-27T08:15:24&quot;&gt;2003-06-27T08:15:24&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Phil:  Yikes, that&#39;s an amazingly good point.  Not quite sure why issues of backwards compatibility hadn&#39;t occured to me, but thanks for cluing me in...  Most of the major resistance to the Echo Project going on over at Sam&#39;s call on backward compatibility and &quot;tearing up the pavement&quot; on the existing installed base, but they&#39;re just suggesting a new common framework for people to take or leave.  This link/guid thing is coming from what should already be established and unchanging.  Yuck.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
