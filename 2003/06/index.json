    "summary": "I've written before that I love XML-RPC, and\nthat it has served me well in the past couple of years.  I think it's the right tool for a broad\nrange of jobs.  But, after having studied the spec, and after having implemented it in a handful\nof languages for a handful of well-used apps, I think the spec needs just a bit of fixing.\n\nIn particular, the spec needs a tweak with regards to this \"ASCII limitation\".  There is confusion\nabout this, period.  I've had to hash this out with clients before, this \nwas an issue of note while\nworking out an XML-RPC based Wiki API,\nand it's obviously an issue in many other projects.  This, of course, includes the current\nhubbub surrounding weblog APIs and whatnot.\n\nSo, please fix the spec.  It shouldn't take long to make this issue a non-issue by some simple\nclarification in the main XmlRpc to which everyone refers.\n\nYes, I know there's a bit of clarification at the end of the spec, involving escaping (\nnot encoding) < and & along\nwith the statement that \"A string can be used to encode binary data.\"\nWell, yeah, I do that\nall the time with Base64.  And, since\nthe spec earlier had called for \"ASCII\", I assume that's what encoding\nbinary data means in the context of this spec.  To me, encoding implies a transformation \nfrom original form to some other form later requiring decoding.\n\nBut, apparently, my interpretation and \nthe interpretation of others\nis wrong on that score.  But still, I've been confused, and so have others.  Consider this a bug report.\n\nI've been referred by Fredrik Lundh (via Dave Winer), \nto \"private conversations\",\n\"various public fora\", and \"early archives for the XML-RPC mailing list\".  And, again by Fredrik Lundh,\nI'm told:\nBut even if you don't know all this, it's not that hard to figure it out for\nyourself. Just make sure you read and digest the entire specification, apply some common sense\nto sort out the contradictions, and you'll find that it's pretty obvious that the intent is that\nyou can use any character allowed by XML.\n\nWell, let's see.  I read the whole spec, more than once, and what I figured out for myself with my \n\"common sense\" is what I wrote above.  I thought\nthe spec called for ASCII (as in: ASCII), and assumed that\nencoding binary data called for something like Base64.  Yes, I realize that XmlRpc is XML, but\nwhen a spec calls for ASCII as a particular part, I assume that there's a reason for it\nsince that's what the specification specified.  \n\nIn my experience, specifications are not about common sense, figuring it out, and\nconnotation.  Specifications are\nabout declaration, clarity, and \ndenotation.  \n\nYes, I understand that no\nspec is perfect, and that many are steaming piles meeting none of the criteria I just mentioned,\nbut that doesn't alter the goal.  A spec can always be made better by revising \nwith these things in mind, given the input of consumers of the spec.  This is what a process\nof communication is all about, and specifications are intended as a form of communication.\n\nSo, instead of talking about intent and things that have been talked about somewhere\nat some time, with the implication that I should just go off and search for these things, can \nwe just get a clarifying fix to the XmlRpc spec?  I don't want to send my clients off to \nmailing list and discussion archives, or present XmlRpc with any corrections or caveats.  I\nwant to say, as I have been, \"Here, go to xmlrpc.com, read the spec, implement to the API\nI emailed you, and get back to me.\"  Only, it'd be nice if the first question is about my API, \nnot about character encoding.\n\nI've been confused, and so have others.  I consider myself a smart person, and I consider most\nof the others who have been confused as even smarter.  I apologize if my \"common sense\" is of a\ndifferent sort, but that's what you have to deal with in the world of people.  As young as I am,\neven I've discovered this already.\n\nSo, can we just get a clarifying revision of the spec?  And if not, why not?\n\nUpdate: Rock on.  After catching up \non a bit of banter over at Sam's place, I see that\nthe same Fredrik Lundh I quoted before has already begun an\nXML-RPC errata page with the goal of clarification.\n(I just missed it in my daily reading thus far.)  As \nMark comments, I fear bumps in the\nroad as any confused implementors find things weren't what they thought, but I'm happy to see\nthe clarification accepted.\n\nUpdate again: If you've stopped rocking, resume.  Dave Winer \nupdated the XML-RPC spec.\nIt was a small change, could have been more, but had not been done at all until now.  I\ndoubt that my asking please really had much to do with it, but I couldn't guess that it \nhurt.  Thanks!",

    "summary": "So yeah,\nlike I was saying,\nI've kept my head out of the RSS frey lately.  This past post about GUIDs and\ntheir properties of rocking in RSS hadn't had much thought behind it, other\nthan that the idea of having something well defined and uncontestably intended\nfor the use or uniquely identifying a weblog post seems like a good idea,\nespecially if it's a permalink.  Because, you know, permalinks seem great things\nto serve as both globally unique identifier and locator in one go.\n\nI had a feeling that I was confused about the purpose of the link element in RSS\n2.0, but having not really studied the spec, I just kept to maintaining a student\nmind and assumed that there were Things Not Yet Understood.  Now I read the spec,\ncuriosity sparked by the recent hubbub over at\nMark's place\nand Phil's place.\n\nDave\nwrote that\nthe link tag in items was \"designed for something else\".  Cool\nby me, I assume that I am not yet well informed.  So, I read in the\nspec, where assumedly I'll be illuminated as to its designed purpose,\nthat link is \"The URL of the item\".  To me, this means that the link\ntag was designed to point at the item, being the URL of that item.\nAnd, as far as I can tell, \"the item\" is what is being described by\nthe item tag, in other words: the weblog entry.\n\nBut this seems contrary to the statement that it's been \"designed for\nsomething else\".  Designed when and documented where?\nJon Udell writes\nthat RSS is in no way broken, but I personally think it's got a funky widget\nor two in it and is not free of confusion.  Bah, really I\ndon't care.  I still think a GUID for a weblog entry is a good idea,\nand that maybe some people who comment on links exclusively should\nhave a tag devoted to that.  Maybe in a separate namespace devoted\nto link-blogger vocabulary.\n\nMeanwhile, I'll be making occasional pokes at participating\nover at Sam's wiki and The Echo Project.\nI like the wiki approach he's\noffered for participation, especially the potential for zero-ego participation\nwhen it works.  I love seeing something I contribute in a wiki eventually\nfloat free from my attribution, to later land in the midst of a summary\nelsewhere.  And in the end, if it all works right, it'll be something\nthat everyone had a part in, yet no one owns, and further yet didn't take a\nformal committee to approve.",

I don't want to run MD5 on another RSS item, and I don't\ncare to track the minor edits people do on their entries, like Dave said.\n\nPersonally, I think the GUID should be the permalink, if at all possible.  I used \nto think that that was what the link of an RSS item should be, but then I never really\nmaintained a weblog in the quote-link-comment style for long stretches.  My entries\naren't usually completely about someone else's article.  But, some weblogs are \nlike that.  So, link points to a subject under comment, GUID identifies the entry and\nideally does it via permalink.\n\nNifty.",

    "summary": "I caught Gizmodo 1983 this week,\nalong with the news\nthat NBC may be revisiting the old 1983 scifi series \"V\", and I was reminded that that\nwas right around the time I got my first computer.  I've been meaning\nto write something for Newly Digital,\nso here goes:\n\nMy history with computers starts a few years earlier than 1983,\nthough.  I think it was during the first grade, when I was a hyper,\neasily bored kid.  I would get class work done quickly and early, yet\nforget to turn it in.  Then, I would disrupt class until I was somehow\ncalmed down or sent to the principal.  I seem to remember that, once,\nI was caught scaling a classroom wall via the curtains.  How far I\nmade if before being caught, I'm not sure, but it seemed like miles\nto me at the time.  I remember being the only one happy about it.\n\nOne day though, the usual trip to the principal changed.  I remember\nhim as a tall, bald, and imposing man whose breath always smelled\nfunny.  (This was long, long before I knew about coffee and had become\nhopelessly addicted myself.)  The man scared me, since he was known\nhave spanked students in the old days, and though he wasn't allowed to\ndo that anymore he still had the power to call my Mom.  And I'm pretty\nsure most everyone knows the little-kid terror of that.\n\n\nThis particular visit, though, he led me back into his office, and sat\nme down in front of an\nAtari 800\nand a TV screen.  Though I had\nalready been introduced to video games via our Atari 2600 at home, I\nhad little idea what this thing was.\n\nHe showed me how to turn everything on, and introduced me to a stack\nof workbooks as tall as I was.  Each book was about 1/4\" thick and the\ncover colors were a rainbow of progressive difficulty.  He told me\nthat he was trying to decide whether or not to start teaching\ncomputers in the school, and that these books were what the company\nsent him for classes.  He wanted me to try them out for him and see\nwhat I could do with the computer before he bought more for the\nschool.\n\nFrom then on, when my class work was done, I had a pass to go to the\nprincipal's office and work through the books with the computer until\neither I ran out of books or the year ended.  I worked mostly on my\nown, with a heavy sense that it was something special I'd been trusted\nwith.  As the principal went about his daily work, I was barely\nsupervised with this expensive machine, and I felt I needed to prove I\nwas worth it.\n\n\nMy grades and my behavior improved as I tore through the workbooks in\nhis office.  There was so much to learn and play with.  I remember\nwith unusual clarity writing a program that asked me for my birthday\nand replied with my age in the year 2000.  It dazzled me that\nsomething I programmed into the computer could tell me about myself,\nall grown up, in the twenty-first century.  You know, the year when\nall science fiction stories came true!  But there I was, playing with\nthe stuff of sci-fi already.\n\nAnd the greatest thing, as the books began to ask more creativity and\noriginality from me in my assignments, I felt my mind stretch.  I'd\nnever quite felt that before, and it was so amazing.  Part of it was,\nI'm sure, just a property of the elasticity of the brain at that age,\nbut I'm sure my time at the computer helped.  Every day, I remembered\nand could do more.  My thoughts were becoming more ordered and\norganized, as programming the computer required it.\n\nBut, after a few months, observing my obvious enthusiasm for the work,\nthe principal took me out of his experiment.  I was disappointed but\nhe told me that he'd decided to build a computer lab and turn what I'd\nbeen doing into a real class for everyone in the school.  I crossed my\nfingers: There were still plenty of books left to get through, and I\nwas just getting to the fun things like graphics and sound.\n\nWhen the school's little computer lab was finally opened, all the kids\ngot sorted into groups of five or so, and each rotated through a\nweekly schedule of hour-long visits.  When my group's turn came, I was\ncrushed: I found that there were no assignments, just Pac Man and\nMissile Command and a smattering of math and vocabulary games.  We\nwere handed joysticks and told not to touch anything else.\n\n\nThese machines were Atari 400's \nand looked so much less advanced than what I'd been used to.  I\nremember there being an intense nervous aura radiating from the\nsupervising teacher on duty in the lab, just waiting for one of us to\ndestroy these things.  And, when I asked if I could have a BASIC\ncartridge to work on some of my programs, I told that if I didn't\nwant to participate in the computer activities I could just go back to\nclass.  As bitter as a first or second grader could be, I was.\n\nSee, I'd gotten teased a bit for the special treatment in the\nbeginning, but I didn't mind.  And, now that everyone played with the\ncomputers, I got teased for not being so special anymore.  What I\ncouldn't get across to anyone, not even my teachers, was that they\nweren't getting what I had.  There was so much more they could have.\nWell, I'm not sure my thoughts were so mature at the time, but I felt\nlike everyone, including me, had been cheated.\n\n\nSo that ended my education in hands-on programming, temporarily.  I took to\nreading more computer books, often bought from the school book fair,\nlike David Ahl's\nBASIC Computer Games.\nLacking a computer of my own, I read and ran though the\nprograms in my head.\n\n\nFor the next year or so, I had sporadic access to computers.  My Uncle had a\nTRS 80 Model III\nthat he let me use during visits.  That thing mostly\nconfused me though, as I was introduced for the first time to an\nalternate flavor of BASIC.  And still, there was the not-mine feeling\nand my Uncle's protectiveness of his expensive business machine.\nMy grandparents also had a\nVIC-20,\nbut sans tape drive or hard drive, so every visit was starting over\nfrom scratch.  Nothing would substitute for what I'd had: My own time\nwith the machine, doing things myself, building one thing atop another.\n\nThen, the\nCommodore 64\narrived at the local K-Mart.  I was in love.  This was it for me, and\nI raved about it constantly.  I never quite expected to get one,\nthough, since the thing was expensive, especially for a kid my age.  And\nbesides, computers were always something that someone else had.  But I\nguess I must've really gotten on Santa's good side, because I was met\nwith this surprise on Christmas morning that year:\n\n\n\nThat first computer was really something.  It was mine, given to me by\nmy family as a whole.  No one protecting it from me, fearing I'd break\nit.\n\nSo I attacked it.  I learned everything about it, buried myself in\nbooks and magazines, figured out how every bit of it worked and could\nbe used.  More than once, I'd gone at it with a screwdriver to see\nwhat was inside.  Then I went at it with a soldering iron to add\nthings like a reset switch and RCA audio output.  I made friends with\npeople at a local computer store, and they let me be a guinea pig to\ntest new software and hardware for the thing.  At one point in fourth\ngrade, I learned 6502 assembly, printed out a disassembly of the\nmachine's kernel, and mapped out what everything did.  I still have\nthat print-out, bound with rubber cement, and full of my scrawlings.\n\nThat Commodore 64 would be my gateway to all sorts of further hackery\nand geekery, as well as a means of meeting more of my kind.  After\ngetting a modem, it became my entry point to local (and not-so-local)\nbulletin boards, and eventually my first tastes of the Internet.  I\nwas still using that Commodore 64 up until my last year of High\nSchool, coincidentally the year of the machine's last production\nrun.\n\nI've had other computers since that Commodore 64, but it was opening\nthat box on Christmas Morning that let me continue the process that my\nElementary School principal had started for me, and I haven't stopped\nsince.  I love to feel my mind stretch, and I love to take things\napart and see what's inside.",

    "summary": "Shawn Yeager just dropped me a line to let\nme know that my blog has apparently been pinging blo.gs like crazy today, and\nsince he's set to recieve IM's on blog updates from blo.gs, he's been getting\nflooded with IMs.\n\nFirst off, if this is happening to you:  Sorry out there!\n\nSecond thing, this\nmight be interesting for anyone using a blosxom plugin to ping blo.gs or weblogs.com like me.\nBasically, I took the ping_weblogs_com\nplugin for blosxom, replaced the weblogs.com request with one to blo.gs,\nand searched for the pattern 'congratulations' instead of 'Thanks for the ping'\nin the response.  Finding the pattern is assumed to mean the ping was successful.\nA successful ping, then, causes the plugin to update the contents and timestamp\nof the status file with the response.\n\nThe status file is used by the plugin to determine whether or not a ping\nshould be sent.  This check is made everytime an item is viewed on my blog,\nand if the plugin sees a blog item whose timestamp is newer than that of\nthe status file, a ping is sent.\n\nSo!  Onto the punch-line: The appearance of the word 'congratulations' and\nthe successful registration of a ping are not the same thing.  Apparently,\nblo.gs has been throwing up an error message in response to a ping, while\nstill registering a ping.  This error message does not contain the word\n'congratulations', and so my plugin never updates the status file, and so\nit happily tries pinging blo.gs again with the next blog view.\n\nTwo lessons learned here:\n\n When using a web service, whether a \"real\" service or a \"scraped\" service, be very sure to know and handle the difference between a valid response and an exception or error in the service itself.\n\n When using a web service, take care with your usage pattern.  That is, just how important is success?  Important enough to try again and again?  Or could you wait awhile, whether successful or not?  Or should you even try again?\n\n\n\nMy plugin doesn't know the real meaning of the response to a ping.  And further,\nthe fact that it's designed to try, try again in the case of apparent failure\nis not the greatest choice for a usage pattern.\n\nSo... longwinded post, but I think the realizations are valuable.",
