I think it&#39;s the right tool for a broad\nrange of jobs.  But, after having studied the spec, and after having implemented it in a handful\nof languages for a handful of well-used apps, I think the spec needs just a bit of fixing.\n<br /><br />\nIn particular, the spec needs a tweak with regards to this &quot;ASCII limitation&quot;.  There is confusion\nabout this, period.  I&#39;ve had to hash this out with clients before, this \n<a href=\"http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=WikiRPCInterfaceUTF8VsBase64\" target=\"_top\">was an issue of note</a> while\nworking out an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\" target=\"_top\">XML-RPC based Wiki API</a>,\nand it&#39;s obviously an issue in many other projects.  This, of course, includes the current\n<a href=\"http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/06/why_we_need_ech.shtml\" target=\"_top\">hubbub surrounding weblog APIs and whatnot</a>.\n<br /><br />\nSo, please fix the spec.  It shouldn&#39;t take long to make this issue a non-issue by some simple\nclarification in the main <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> to which everyone refers.\n<br /><br />\nYes, I know there&#39;s a bit of clarification at the end of the spec, involving escaping (\n<a href=\"http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/28/Learning\" target=\"_top\">not encoding</a>) &lt; and &amp; along\nwith the statement that &quot;A string can be used to encode binary data.&quot;<br><br /><br />\nWell, yeah, I do that\nall the time with <a href=\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/base64/rfc1341.html\" target=\"_top\">Base64</a>.  And, since\nthe spec earlier had called for &quot;ASCII&quot;, I assume that&#39;s what <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=encoding\" target=\"_top\">encoding</a>\nbinary data means in the context of this spec.  To me, encoding implies a transformation \nfrom original form to some other form later requiring decoding.\n<br /><br />\nBut, apparently, my interpretation and \n<a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1498.html#c1056921193\" target=\"_top\">the interpretation of others</a>\nis wrong on that score.  But still, I&#39;ve been confused, and so have others.  Consider this a bug report.\n<br /><br />\nI&#39;ve been referred <a href=\"http://www.effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-ascii.htm\" target=\"_top\">by Fredrik Lundh</a> (<a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/06/29#When:6:21:27AM\" target=\"_top\">via Dave Winer</a>), \nto &quot;private conversations&quot;,\n&quot;various public fora&quot;, and &quot;early archives for the XML-RPC mailing list&quot;.  And, again by Fredrik Lundh,\n<a href=\"http://www.effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-ascii.htm\" target=\"_top\">I&#39;m told</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><i>But even if you don't know all this, it's not that hard to figure it out for\nyourself. Just make sure you read and digest the entire specification, apply some common sense\nto sort out the contradictions, and you'll find that it's pretty obvious that the intent is that\nyou can use any character allowed by XML.</i></blockquote>\n<br /><br />\nWell, let's see.  I read the whole spec, more than once, and what I figured out for myself with my \n\"common sense\" is what I wrote above.  I thought\nthe spec called for ASCII (as in: <a href=\"http://www.asciitable.com/\" target=\"_top\">ASCII</a>), and assumed that\nencoding binary data called for something like Base64.  Yes, I realize that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> is XML, but\nwhen a spec calls for ASCII as a particular part, I assume that there's a reason for it\nsince that's what the specification specified.  \n<br /><br />\nIn my experience, specifications are not about common sense, figuring it out, and\n<a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=connotation\" target=\"_top\">connotation</a>.  Specifications are\nabout declaration, clarity, and \n<a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=denotation\" target=\"_top\">denotation</a>.  \n<br /><br />\nYes, I understand that no\nspec is perfect, and that many are steaming piles meeting none of the criteria I just mentioned,\nbut that doesn't alter the goal.  A spec can always be made better by revising \nwith these things in mind, given the input of consumers of the spec.  This is what a process\nof communication is all about, and specifications are intended as a form of communication.\n<br /><br />\nSo, instead of talking about <i>intent</i> and things that have been talked about somewhere\nat some time, with the implication that I should just go off and search for these things, can \nwe just get a clarifying fix to the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> spec?  I don't want to send my clients off to \nmailing list and discussion archives, or present <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> with any corrections or caveats.  I\nwant to say, as I have been, \"Here, go to xmlrpc.com, read the spec, implement to the API\nI emailed you, and get back to me.\"  Only, it'd be nice if the first question is about my API, \nnot about character encoding.\n<br /><br />\nI've been confused, and so have others.  I consider myself a smart person, and I consider most\nof the others who have been confused as even smarter.  I apologize if my \"common sense\" is of a\ndifferent sort, but that's what you have to deal with in the world of people.  As young as I am,\neven I've discovered this already.\n<br /><br />\nSo, can we just get a clarifying revision of the spec?  And if not, why not?\n<br /><br />\n<b>Update:</b> Rock on.

    "summary": "<p>I&apos;ve written before that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooccb.html\" target=\"_top\">I love XML-RPC</a>, and\nthat it has served me well in the past couple of years.  I think it&apos;s the right tool for a broad\nrange of jobs.  But, after having studied the spec, and after having implemented it in a handful\nof languages for a handful of well-used apps, I think the spec needs just a bit of fixing.\n<br><br>\nIn particular, the spec needs a tweak with regards to this &quot;ASCII limitation&quot;.  There is confusion\nabout this, period.  I&apos;ve had to hash this out with clients before, this \n<a href=\"http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=WikiRPCInterfaceUTF8VsBase64\" target=\"_top\">was an issue of note</a> while\nworking out an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcToWiki\" target=\"_top\">XML-RPC based Wiki API</a>,\nand it&apos;s obviously an issue in many other projects.  This, of course, includes the current\n<a href=\"http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/06/why_we_need_ech.shtml\" target=\"_top\">hubbub surrounding weblog APIs and whatnot</a>.\n<br><br>\nSo, please fix the spec.  It shouldn&apos;t take long to make this issue a non-issue by some simple\nclarification in the main <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> to which everyone refers.\n<br><br>\nYes, I know there&apos;s a bit of clarification at the end of the spec, involving escaping (\n<a href=\"http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/28/Learning\" target=\"_top\">not encoding</a>) &lt; and &amp; along\nwith the statement that &quot;A string can be used to encode binary data.&quot;<br><br><br>\nWell, yeah, I do that\nall the time with <a href=\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/base64/rfc1341.html\" target=\"_top\">Base64</a>.  And, since\nthe spec earlier had called for &quot;ASCII&quot;, I assume that&apos;s what <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=encoding\" target=\"_top\">encoding</a>\nbinary data means in the context of this spec.  To me, encoding implies a transformation \nfrom original form to some other form later requiring decoding.\n<br><br>\nBut, apparently, my interpretation and \n<a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1498.html#c1056921193\" target=\"_top\">the interpretation of others</a>\nis wrong on that score.  But still, I&apos;ve been confused, and so have others.  Consider this a bug report.\n<br><br>\nI&apos;ve been referred <a href=\"http://www.effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-ascii.htm\" target=\"_top\">by Fredrik Lundh</a> (<a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/06/29#When:6:21:27AM\" target=\"_top\">via Dave Winer</a>), \nto &quot;private conversations&quot;,\n&quot;various public fora&quot;, and &quot;early archives for the XML-RPC mailing list&quot;.  And, again by Fredrik Lundh,\n<a href=\"http://www.effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-ascii.htm\" target=\"_top\">I&apos;m told</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><i>But even if you don&apos;t know all this, it&apos;s not that hard to figure it out for\nyourself. Just make sure you read and digest the entire specification, apply some common sense\nto sort out the contradictions, and you&apos;ll find that it&apos;s pretty obvious that the intent is that\nyou can use any character allowed by XML.</i></blockquote>\n<br><br>\nWell, let&apos;s see.  I read the whole spec, more than once, and what I figured out for myself with my \n&quot;common sense&quot; is what I wrote above.  I thought\nthe spec called for ASCII (as in: <a href=\"http://www.asciitable.com/\" target=\"_top\">ASCII</a>), and assumed that\nencoding binary data called for something like Base64.  Yes, I realize that <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> is XML, but\nwhen a spec calls for ASCII as a particular part, I assume that there&apos;s a reason for it\nsince that&apos;s what the specification specified.  \n<br><br>\nIn my experience, specifications are not about common sense, figuring it out, and\n<a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=connotation\" target=\"_top\">connotation</a>.  Specifications are\nabout declaration, clarity, and \n<a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=denotation\" target=\"_top\">denotation</a>.  \n<br><br>\nYes, I understand that no\nspec is perfect, and that many are steaming piles meeting none of the criteria I just mentioned,\nbut that doesn&apos;t alter the goal.  A spec can always be made better by revising \nwith these things in mind, given the input of consumers of the spec.  This is what a process\nof communication is all about, and specifications are intended as a form of communication.\n<br><br>\nSo, instead of talking about <i>intent</i> and things that have been talked about somewhere\nat some time, with the implication that I should just go off and search for these things, can \nwe just get a clarifying fix to the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> spec?  I don&apos;t want to send my clients off to \nmailing list and discussion archives, or present <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpc\">XmlRpc</a> with any corrections or caveats.  I\nwant to say, as I have been, &quot;Here, go to xmlrpc.com, read the spec, implement to the API\nI emailed you, and get back to me.&quot;  Only, it&apos;d be nice if the first question is about my API, \nnot about character encoding.\n<br><br>\nI&apos;ve been confused, and so have others.  I consider myself a smart person, and I consider most\nof the others who have been confused as even smarter.  I apologize if my &quot;common sense&quot; is of a\ndifferent sort, but that&apos;s what you have to deal with in the world of people.  As young as I am,\neven I&apos;ve discovered this already.\n<br><br>\nSo, can we just get a clarifying revision of the spec?  And if not, why not?\n<br><br>\n<b>Update:</b> Rock on.  After <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1498.html#c1056890028\" target=\"_top\">catching up</a> \non a bit of banter over at <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1498.htm\" target=\"_top\">Sam&apos;s place</a>, I see that\nthe same Fredrik Lundh I quoted before has already begun an\n<a href=\"http://effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-errata.htm\" target=\"_top\">XML-RPC errata</a> page with the goal of clarification.\n(I just missed it in my daily reading thus far.)  As \n<a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1498.html#c1056904400\" target=\"_top\">Mark comments</a>, I fear bumps in the\nroad as any confused implementors find things weren&apos;t what they thought, but I&apos;m happy to see\nthe clarification accepted.\n<br><br>\n<b>Update again:</b> If you&apos;ve stopped rocking, resume.  Dave Winer \n<a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/06/30#When:11:41:21AM\" target=\"_top\">updated the XML-RPC spec</a>.\nIt was a small change, could have been more, but had not been done at all until now.  I\ndoubt that my asking please really had much to do with it, but I couldn&apos;t guess that it \nhurt.  Thanks!\n",

This past post about GUIDs and\ntheir properties of rocking in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> hadn&#39;t had much thought behind it, other\nthan that the idea of having <strong>something</strong> well defined and uncontestably intended\nfor the use or uniquely identifying a weblog post seems like a good idea,\nespecially if it&#39;s a permalink.  Because, you know, permalinks seem great things\nto serve as both globally unique identifier and locator in one go.\n<br /><br />\nI had a feeling that I was confused about the purpose of the link element in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a>\n2.0, but having not really studied the spec, I just kept to maintaining a student\nmind and assumed that there were Things Not Yet Understood.  Now I read the spec,\ncuriosity sparked by the recent hubbub over at\n<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/26/will_the_real_rss_validator_please_stand_up.html\" target=\"_top\">Mark&#39;s place</a>\nand <a href=\"http://philringnalda.com/blog/2003/06/say_it_loud_im_funky_and_im_proud.php#006367\" target=\"_top\">Phil&#39;s place</a>.\n<br /><br />\nDave\n<a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/06/25#theLizardBrainOfRss\" target=\"_top\">wrote that</a>\nthe link tag in items was &quot;designed for something else&quot;.  Cool\nby me, I assume that I am not yet well informed.  So, I read in the\nspec, where assumedly I&#39;ll be illuminated as to its designed purpose,\nthat link is &quot;The URL of the item&quot;.  To me, this means that the link\ntag was designed to point at the item, being the URL of that item.\nAnd, as far as I can tell, &quot;the item&quot; is what is being described by\nthe item tag, in other words: the weblog entry.\n<br /><br />\nBut this seems contrary to the statement that it&#39;s been &quot;designed for\nsomething else&quot;.  Designed when and documented where?\n<a href=\"http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/06/25.html#a732\" target=\"_top\">Jon Udell</a> writes\nthat <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> is in no way broken, but I personally think it&#39;s got a funky widget\nor two in it and is not free of confusion.  Bah, really I\ndon&#39;t care.  I still think a GUID for a weblog entry is a good idea,\nand that maybe some people who comment on links exclusively should\nhave a tag devoted to that.  Maybe in a separate namespace devoted\nto link-blogger vocabulary.\n<br /><br />\nMeanwhile, I&#39;ll be making occasional pokes at participating\nover at Sam&#39;s wiki and <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage\" target=\"_top\">The Echo Project</a>.\nI like the wiki approach he&#39;s\noffered for participation, especially the potential for zero-ego participation\nwhen it works.  I love seeing something I contribute in a wiki eventually\nfloat free from my attribution, to later land in the midst of a summary\nelsewhere.  And in the end, if it all works right, it&#39;ll be something\nthat everyone had a part in, yet no one owns, and further yet didn&#39;t take a\nformal committee to approve.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=so_like_i_was_saying</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090508\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.majid.info/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c4f047528ef2dfcd3cdccb82cf2a04ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.majid.info/\">Fazal Majid</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090508\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-06-26T14:41:24\">2003-06-26T14:41:24</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">You can have an RSS feed that is mostly commentary about articles hosted elsewhere, actually Radio's aggregator encourages this. Imagine an Ebert & Roeper feed, where the description would contain thumbs up or down, the link would point to the movie home page, and the GUID would be a permalink to the commentary page on the E&R website.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090509\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://philringnalda.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e68e9944f50a481a64b5a32fdfc02e0d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://philringnalda.com\">Phil Ringnalda</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090509\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-06-26T23:58:41\">2003-06-26T23:58:41</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I think part of the constant confusion comes from the way that nobody ever says whether they are talking to producers of feeds, or developers of aggregators. A developer of an aggregator needs to know that if they see a guid and !(isPermalink=\"false\") then that's the permalink, and if the link !== the guid, then it's a separate outbound link. What a producer of a feed needs to know is that they have the option of using link to point to what they are talking about, not themselves, and if they also want to point to themselves they should use guid. But the talk about only using guid for permalink, and omitting link if you don't want to use it for an outside link, is just flat out crazy. If you don't want to do an outside link, then by using link for the permalink you have a feed that will work with every aggregator written since 0.90. If you use guid and omit link, you have a feed that will work with some but not all aggregators written or rewritten since last fall. That's not just crazy, it's completely the opposite approach to the \"backward compatibility no matter what the cost\" way that Dave has always done RSS development. I just flat out don't understand why he would say that link SHOULD NOT be used for a weblog permalink.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090510\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090510\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-06-27T08:15:24\">2003-06-27T08:15:24</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Phil:  Yikes, that's an amazingly good point.

Imagine an Ebert & Roeper feed, where the description would contain thumbs up or down, the link would point to the movie home page, and the GUID would be a permalink to the commentary page on the E&R website.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090509\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://philringnalda.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e68e9944f50a481a64b5a32fdfc02e0d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://philringnalda.com\">Phil Ringnalda</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090509\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-06-26T23:58:41\">2003-06-26T23:58:41</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I think part of the constant confusion comes from the way that nobody ever says whether they are talking to producers of feeds, or developers of aggregators. A developer of an aggregator needs to know that if they see a guid and !(isPermalink=\"false\") then that's the permalink, and if the link !== the guid, then it's a separate outbound link. What a producer of a feed needs to know is that they have the option of using link to point to what they are talking about, not themselves, and if they also want to point to themselves they should use guid. But the talk about only using guid for permalink, and omitting link if you don't want to use it for an outside link, is just flat out crazy. If you don't want to do an outside link, then by using link for the permalink you have a feed that will work with every aggregator written since 0.90. If you use guid and omit link, you have a feed that will work with some but not all aggregators written or rewritten since last fall. That's not just crazy, it's completely the opposite approach to the \"backward compatibility no matter what the cost\" way that Dave has always done RSS development. I just flat out don't understand why he would say that link SHOULD NOT be used for a weblog permalink.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090510\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ac2cffd36ada8c734b90e02a1e5c1ac&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090510\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-06-27T08:15:24\">2003-06-27T08:15:24</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Phil:  Yikes, that's an amazingly good point.

I used to think that that was what the link of an RSS item should be, but then I never really maintained a weblog in the quote-link-comment style for long stretches.\" Are you sure you've got that the right way round? I also agree that the link should be the permalink is at all possible, and I prefer that to link being the URL of some external article mentioned in the text of description.

I say this because there exist weblog entries in this style, a point that Dave Winer has reiterated many times and that I just understood recently.\nSo, what I say is this:  Use the GUID to identify at your entry, in all cases, preferrably by permalink.  Only use the link tag if your entry happens to be mainly a comment on some other resource, and use the link tag to point at it.  \nI'd *actually* wished that things worked out such that link points to the entry, and links under discussion remain in the description or body of the entry.  But since there's a disagreement over it, I'd just as soon give up the link tag to link bloggers and assume the GUID tag for permalinks and have done with it.\nThis makes sense to me as a way to clear up the variations from blog to blog - right now, I'm never quite sure where I'll end up when I click on the link in my aggregator.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085019\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.seizethedave.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=82d457ebf5b4b9dc0a17c8cf4f32d92f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.seizethedave.com/\">seizethedave</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085019\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-01T15:01:14\">2003-07-01T15:01:14</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">So, it's just talking about a unique identifier such as the URL to the post, not the 32-bit {4A4DBF1F-81D8-4063-AE33-F6D1F942BB13} GUID MS cooked up?</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

I also agree that the link should be the permalink is at all possible, and I prefer that to link being the URL of some external article mentioned in the text of description.

I say this because there exist weblog entries in this style, a point that Dave Winer has reiterated many times and that I just understood recently.\r\n\r\nSo, what I say is this:  Use the GUID to identify at your entry, in all cases, preferrably by permalink.  Only use the link tag if your entry happens to be mainly a comment on some other resource, and use the link tag to point at it.  \r\n\r\nI'd *actually* wished that things worked out such that link points to the entry, and links under discussion remain in the description or body of the entry.  But since there's a disagreement over it, I'd just as soon give up the link tag to link bloggers and assume the GUID tag for permalinks and have done with it.\r\n\r\nThis makes sense to me as a way to clear up the variations from blog to blog - right now, I'm never quite sure where I'll end up when I click on the link in my aggregator.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085019\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.seizethedave.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=82d457ebf5b4b9dc0a17c8cf4f32d92f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.seizethedave.com/\">seizethedave</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085019\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-07-01T15:01:14\">2003-07-01T15:01:14</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">So, it's just talking about a unique identifier such as the URL to the post, not the 32-bit {4A4DBF1F-81D8-4063-AE33-F6D1F942BB13} GUID MS cooked up?</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

I&#39;ve been meaning\nto write something for <a href=\"http://www.kalsey.com/2003/05/newly_digital/\" target=\"_top\">Newly Digital</a>,\nso here goes:\n<br /><br />\nMy history with computers starts a few years earlier than 1983,\nthough.  I think it was during the first grade, when I was a hyper,\neasily bored kid.  I would get class work done quickly and early, yet\nforget to turn it in.  Then, I would disrupt class until I was somehow\ncalmed down or sent to the principal.  I seem to remember that, once,\nI was caught scaling a classroom wall via the curtains.  How far I\nmade if before being caught, I&#39;m not sure, but it seemed like miles\nto me at the time.  I remember being the only one happy about it.\n<br /><br />\nOne day though, the usual trip to the principal changed.  I remember\nhim as a tall, bald, and imposing man whose breath always smelled\nfunny.  (This was long, long before I knew about coffee and had become\nhopelessly addicted myself.)  The man scared me, since he was known\nhave spanked students in the old days, and though he wasn&#39;t allowed to\ndo that anymore he still had the power to call my Mom.  And I&#39;m pretty\nsure most everyone knows the little-kid terror of that.\n<br /><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=460\"><img src=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/atari_800.jpg\" width=\"175\" height=\"123\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"/></a>\nThis particular visit, though, he led me back into his office, and sat\nme down in front of an\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=460\" target=\"_top\">Atari 800</a>\nand a TV screen.  Though I had\nalready been introduced to video games via our Atari 2600 at home, I\nhad little idea what this thing was.\n<br /><br />\nHe showed me how to turn everything on, and introduced me to a stack\nof workbooks as tall as I was.  Each book was about 1/4&quot; thick and the\ncover colors were a rainbow of progressive difficulty.  He told me\nthat he was trying to decide whether or not to start teaching\ncomputers in the school, and that these books were what the company\nsent him for classes.  He wanted me to try them out for him and see\nwhat I could do with the computer before he bought more for the\nschool.\n<br /><br />\nFrom then on, when my class work was done, I had a pass to go to the\nprincipal&#39;s office and work through the books with the computer until\neither I ran out of books or the year ended.  I worked mostly on my\nown, with a heavy sense that it was something special I&#39;d been trusted\nwith.  As the principal went about his daily work, I was barely\nsupervised with this expensive machine, and I felt I needed to prove I\nwas worth it.\n<br /><br />\n<img src=\"http://www.futurecast.com/futurechronicles/images/y2k.gif\" width=\"79\" height=\"75\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\" />\nMy grades and my behavior improved as I tore through the workbooks in\nhis office.  There was so much to learn and play with.  I remember\nwith unusual clarity writing a program that asked me for my birthday\nand replied with my age in the year 2000.  It dazzled me that\nsomething I programmed into the computer could tell me about myself,\nall grown up, in the twenty-first century.  You know, the year when\nall science fiction stories came true!  But there I was, playing with\nthe stuff of sci-fi already.\n<br /><br />\nAnd the greatest thing, as the books began to ask more creativity and\noriginality from me in my assignments, I felt my mind stretch.  I&#39;d\nnever quite felt that before, and it was so amazing.  Part of it was,\nI&#39;m sure, just a property of the elasticity of the brain at that age,\nbut I&#39;m sure my time at the computer helped.  Every day, I remembered\nand could do more.  My thoughts were becoming more ordered and\norganized, as programming the computer required it.\n<br /><br />\nBut, after a few months, observing my obvious enthusiasm for the work,\nthe principal took me out of his experiment.  I was disappointed but\nhe told me that he&#39;d decided to build a computer lab and turn what I&#39;d\nbeen doing into a real class for everyone in the school.  I crossed my\nfingers: There were still plenty of books left to get through, and I\nwas just getting to the fun things like graphics and sound.\n<br /><br />\nWhen the school&#39;s little computer lab was finally opened, all the kids\ngot sorted into groups of five or so, and each rotated through a\nweekly schedule of hour-long visits.  When my group&#39;s turn came, I was\ncrushed: I found that there were no assignments, just Pac Man and\nMissile Command and a smattering of math and vocabulary games.  We\nwere handed joysticks and told not to touch anything else.\n<br /><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=76\"><img src=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/atari_400.jpg\" width=\"175\" height=\"138\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"/></a>\nThese machines were <a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=76\" target=\"_top\">Atari 400</a>&#39;s \nand looked so much less advanced than what I&#39;d been used to.  I\nremember there being an intense nervous aura radiating from the\nsupervising teacher on duty in the lab, just waiting for one of us to\ndestroy these things.  And, when I asked if I could have a BASIC\ncartridge to work on some of my programs, I told that if I didn&#39;t\nwant to participate in the computer activities I could just go back to\nclass.  As bitter as a first or second grader could be, I was.\n<br /><br />\nSee, I&#39;d gotten teased a bit for the special treatment in the\nbeginning, but I didn&#39;t mind.  And, now that everyone played with the\ncomputers, I got teased for not being so special anymore.  What I\ncouldn&#39;t get across to anyone, not even my teachers, was that they\nweren&#39;t getting what I had.  There was so much more they could have.\nWell, I&#39;m not sure my thoughts were so mature at the time, but I felt\nlike everyone, including me, had been cheated.\n<br /><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/\"><img src=\"http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/TN_basicgames.JPG\" width=\"97\" height=\"128\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"/></a>\nSo that ended my education in hands-on programming, temporarily.  I took to\nreading more computer books, often bought from the school book fair,\nlike David Ahl&#39;s\n<a href=\"http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/\" target=\"_top\">BASIC Computer Games</a>.\nLacking a computer of my own, I read and ran though the\nprograms in my head.\n<br /><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=18\"><img src=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/tandy_trs80-model3_1.jpg\" width=\"120\" height=\"105\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"/></a>\nFor the next year or so, I had sporadic access to computers.  My Uncle had a\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=18\" target=\"_top\">TRS 80 Model III</a>\nthat he let me use during visits.  That thing mostly\nconfused me though, as I was introduced for the first time to an\nalternate flavor of BASIC.  And still, there was the not-mine feeling\nand my Uncle&#39;s protectiveness of his expensive business machine.\nMy grandparents also had a\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=252\" target=\"_top\">VIC-20</a>,\nbut sans tape drive or hard drive, so every visit was starting over\nfrom scratch.  Nothing would substitute for what I&#39;d had: My own time\nwith the machine, doing things myself, building one thing atop another.\n<br /><br />\nThen, the\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=98\" target=\"_top\">Commodore 64</a>\narrived at the local K-Mart.  I was in love.  This was it for me, and\nI raved about it constantly.  I never quite expected to get one,\nthough, since the thing was expensive, especially for a kid my age.  And\nbesides, computers were always something that someone else had.  But I\nguess I must&#39;ve really gotten on Santa&#39;s good side, because I was met\nwith this surprise on Christmas morning that year:\n<br /><br /></p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog-images/first-c64.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog-images/first-c64-sm.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" /></a></div>\n<br /><br />\nThat first computer was really something.  It was mine, given to me by\nmy family as a whole.  No one protecting it from me, fearing I'd break\nit.\n<br /><br />\nSo I attacked it.  I learned everything about it, buried myself in\nbooks and magazines, figured out how every bit of it worked and could\nbe used.  More than once, I'd gone at it with a screwdriver to see\nwhat was inside.  Then I went at it with a soldering iron to add\nthings like a reset switch and RCA audio output.  I made friends with\npeople at a local computer store, and they let me be a guinea pig to\ntest new software and hardware for the thing.  At one point in fourth\ngrade, I learned 6502 assembly, printed out a disassembly of the\nmachine's kernel, and mapped out what everything did.  I still have\nthat print-out, bound with rubber cement, and full of my scrawlings.\n<br /><br />\nThat Commodore 64 would be my gateway to all sorts of further hackery\nand geekery, as well as a means of meeting more of my kind.  After\ngetting a modem, it became my entry point to local (and not-so-local)\nbulletin boards, and eventually my first tastes of the Internet.  I\nwas still using that Commodore 64 up until my last year of High\nSchool, coincidentally the year of the machine's last production\nrun.\n<br /><br />\nI've had other computers since that Commodore 64, but it was opening\nthat box on Christmas Morning that let me continue the process that my\nElementary School principal had started for me, and I haven't stopped\nsince.  I love to feel my mind stretch, and I love to take things\napart and see what's inside.\n<!--more-->\nshortname=newly_digital\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082790\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://stevenf.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ae2c0b2d1d3219cac5409a77a1c99fb2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://stevenf.com/\">stevenf</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082790\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-06-11T21:04:17\">2003-06-11T21:04:17</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">David Ahl's BASIC Computer Games!

As bitter as a first or second grader could be, I was.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSee, I'd gotten teased a bit for the special treatment in the\r\nbeginning, but I didn't mind.  And, now that everyone played with the\r\ncomputers, I got teased for not being so special anymore.  What I\r\ncouldn't get across to anyone, not even my teachers, was that they\r\nweren't getting what I had.  There was so much more they could have.\r\nWell, I'm not sure my thoughts were so mature at the time, but I felt\r\nlike everyone, including me, had been cheated.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/\"><img src=\"http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/TN_basicgames.JPG\" width=\"97\" height=\"128\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"/></a>\r\nSo that ended my education in hands-on programming, temporarily.  I took to\r\nreading more computer books, often bought from the school book fair,\r\nlike David Ahl's\r\n<a href=\"http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/basicgames/\" target=\"_top\">BASIC Computer Games</a>.\r\nLacking a computer of my own, I read and ran though the\r\nprograms in my head.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=18\"><img src=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/tandy_trs80-model3_1.jpg\" width=\"120\" height=\"105\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"/></a>\r\nFor the next year or so, I had sporadic access to computers.  My Uncle had a\r\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=18\" target=\"_top\">TRS 80 Model III</a>\r\nthat he let me use during visits.  That thing mostly\r\nconfused me though, as I was introduced for the first time to an\r\nalternate flavor of BASIC.  And still, there was the not-mine feeling\r\nand my Uncle's protectiveness of his expensive business machine.\r\nMy grandparents also had a\r\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=252\" target=\"_top\">VIC-20</a>,\r\nbut sans tape drive or hard drive, so every visit was starting over\r\nfrom scratch.  Nothing would substitute for what I'd had: My own time\r\nwith the machine, doing things myself, building one thing atop another.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThen, the\r\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=98\" target=\"_top\">Commodore 64</a>\r\narrived at the local K-Mart.  I was in love.  This was it for me, and\r\nI raved about it constantly.  I never quite expected to get one,\r\nthough, since the thing was expensive, especially for a kid my age.  And\r\nbesides, computers were always something that someone else had.  But I\r\nguess I must've really gotten on Santa's good side, because I was met\r\nwith this surprise on Christmas morning that year:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog-images/first-c64.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog-images/first-c64-sm.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" /></a></div>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThat first computer was really something.  It was mine, given to me by\r\nmy family as a whole.  No one protecting it from me, fearing I'd break\r\nit.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo I attacked it.  I learned everything about it, buried myself in\r\nbooks and magazines, figured out how every bit of it worked and could\r\nbe used.  More than once, I'd gone at it with a screwdriver to see\r\nwhat was inside.  Then I went at it with a soldering iron to add\r\nthings like a reset switch and RCA audio output.  I made friends with\r\npeople at a local computer store, and they let me be a guinea pig to\r\ntest new software and hardware for the thing.  At one point in fourth\r\ngrade, I learned 6502 assembly, printed out a disassembly of the\r\nmachine's kernel, and mapped out what everything did.  I still have\r\nthat print-out, bound with rubber cement, and full of my scrawlings.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThat Commodore 64 would be my gateway to all sorts of further hackery\r\nand geekery, as well as a means of meeting more of my kind.  After\r\ngetting a modem, it became my entry point to local (and not-so-local)\r\nbulletin boards, and eventually my first tastes of the Internet.  I\r\nwas still using that Commodore 64 up until my last year of High\r\nSchool, coincidentally the year of the machine's last production\r\nrun.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nI've had other computers since that Commodore 64, but it was opening\r\nthat box on Christmas Morning that let me continue the process that my\r\nElementary School principal had started for me, and I haven't stopped\r\nsince.  I love to feel my mind stretch, and I love to take things\r\napart and see what's inside.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=newly_digital\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082790\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://stevenf.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ae2c0b2d1d3219cac5409a77a1c99fb2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://stevenf.com/\">stevenf</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082790\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-06-11T21:04:17\">2003-06-11T21:04:17</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">David Ahl's BASIC Computer Games!

    "summary": "<p>I caught <a href=\"http://gizmodo.net/archives/002242.php#002242\" target=\"_top\">Gizmodo 1983</a> this week,\nalong with <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/06/09/television.visitors.reut/index.html\" target=\"_top\">the news</a>\nthat NBC may be revisiting the old 1983 scifi series &quot;V&quot;, and I was reminded that that\nwas right around the time I got my first computer.  I&apos;ve been meaning\nto write something for <a href=\"http://www.kalsey.com/2003/05/newly_digital/\" target=\"_top\">Newly Digital</a>,\nso here goes:\n<br><br>\nMy history with computers starts a few years earlier than 1983,\nthough.  I think it was during the first grade, when I was a hyper,\neasily bored kid.  I would get class work done quickly and early, yet\nforget to turn it in.  Then, I would disrupt class until I was somehow\ncalmed down or sent to the principal.  I seem to remember that, once,\nI was caught scaling a classroom wall via the curtains.  How far I\nmade if before being caught, I&apos;m not sure, but it seemed like miles\nto me at the time.  I remember being the only one happy about it.\n<br><br>\nOne day though, the usual trip to the principal changed.  I remember\nhim as a tall, bald, and imposing man whose breath always smelled\nfunny.  (This was long, long before I knew about coffee and had become\nhopelessly addicted myself.)  The man scared me, since he was known\nhave spanked students in the old days, and though he wasn&apos;t allowed to\ndo that anymore he still had the power to call my Mom.  And I&apos;m pretty\nsure most everyone knows the little-kid terror of that.\n<br><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=460\"><img src=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/atari_800.jpg\" width=\"175\" height=\"123\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"></a>\nThis particular visit, though, he led me back into his office, and sat\nme down in front of an\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=460\" target=\"_top\">Atari 800</a>\nand a TV screen.  Though I had\nalready been introduced to video games via our Atari 2600 at home, I\nhad little idea what this thing was.\n<br><br>\nHe showed me how to turn everything on, and introduced me to a stack\nof workbooks as tall as I was.  Each book was about 1/4&quot; thick and the\ncover colors were a rainbow of progressive difficulty.  He told me\nthat he was trying to decide whether or not to start teaching\ncomputers in the school, and that these books were what the company\nsent him for classes.  He wanted me to try them out for him and see\nwhat I could do with the computer before he bought more for the\nschool.\n<br><br>\nFrom then on, when my class work was done, I had a pass to go to the\nprincipal&apos;s office and work through the books with the computer until\neither I ran out of books or the year ended.  I worked mostly on my\nown, with a heavy sense that it was something special I&apos;d been trusted\nwith.  As the principal went about his daily work, I was barely\nsupervised with this expensive machine, and I felt I needed to prove I\nwas worth it.\n<br><br>\n<img src=\"http://www.futurecast.com/futurechronicles/images/y2k.gif\" width=\"79\" height=\"75\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\">\nMy grades and my behavior improved as I tore through the workbooks in\nhis office.  There was so much to learn and play with.  I remember\nwith unusual clarity writing a program that asked me for my birthday\nand replied with my age in the year 2000.  It dazzled me that\nsomething I programmed into the computer could tell me about myself,\nall grown up, in the twenty-first century.  You know, the year when\nall science fiction stories came true!  But there I was, playing with\nthe stuff of sci-fi already.\n<br><br>\nAnd the greatest thing, as the books began to ask more creativity and\noriginality from me in my assignments, I felt my mind stretch.  I&apos;d\nnever quite felt that before, and it was so amazing.  Part of it was,\nI&apos;m sure, just a property of the elasticity of the brain at that age,\nbut I&apos;m sure my time at the computer helped.  Every day, I remembered\nand could do more.  My thoughts were becoming more ordered and\norganized, as programming the computer required it.\n<br><br>\nBut, after a few months, observing my obvious enthusiasm for the work,\nthe principal took me out of his experiment.  I was disappointed but\nhe told me that he&apos;d decided to build a computer lab and turn what I&apos;d\nbeen doing into a real class for everyone in the school.  I crossed my\nfingers: There were still plenty of books left to get through, and I\nwas just getting to the fun things like graphics and sound.\n<br><br>\nWhen the school&apos;s little computer lab was finally opened, all the kids\ngot sorted into groups of five or so, and each rotated through a\nweekly schedule of hour-long visits.  When my group&apos;s turn came, I was\ncrushed: I found that there were no assignments, just Pac Man and\nMissile Command and a smattering of math and vocabulary games.  We\nwere handed joysticks and told not to touch anything else.\n<br><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=76\"><img src=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/atari_400.jpg\" width=\"175\" height=\"138\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"8\"></a>\nThese machines were <a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=76\" target=\"_top\">Atari 400</a>&apos;s \nand looked so much less advanced than what I&apos;d been used to.  I\nremember there being an intense nervous aura radiating from the\nsupervising teacher on duty in the lab, just waiting for one of us to\ndestroy these things.  And, when I asked if I could have a BASIC\ncartridge to work on some of my programs, I told that if I didn&apos;t\nwant to participate in the computer activities I could just go back to\nclass.

Finding the pattern is assumed to mean the ping was successful.\nA successful ping, then, causes the plugin to update the contents and timestamp\nof the status file with the response.\n<br /><br />\nThe status file is used by the plugin to determine whether or not a ping\nshould be sent.  This check is made everytime an item is viewed on my blog,\nand if the plugin sees a blog item whose timestamp is newer than that of\nthe status file, a ping is sent.\n<br /><br />\nSo!  Onto the punch-line: The appearance of the word &#39;congratulations&#39; and\nthe successful registration of a ping are not the same thing.  Apparently,\n<a href=\"http://www.blo.gs\" target=\"_top\">blo.gs</a> has been throwing up an error message in response to a ping, while\nstill registering a ping.  This error message does not contain the word\n&#39;congratulations&#39;, and so my plugin never updates the status file, and so\nit happily tries pinging <a href=\"http://www.blo.gs\" target=\"_top\">blo.gs</a> again with the next blog view.\n<br /><br />\nTwo lessons learned here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> When using a web service, whether a \"real\" service or a \"scraped\" service, be very sure to know and handle the difference between a valid response and an exception or error in the service itself.\n</li>\n<li> When using a web service, take care with your usage pattern.  That is, just how important is success?  Important enough to try again and again?  Or could you wait awhile, whether successful or not?  Or should you even try again?\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br /><br />\nMy plugin doesn't know the real meaning of the response to a ping.  And further,\nthe fact that it's designed to try, try again in the case of apparent failure\nis not the greatest choice for a usage pattern.\n<br /><br />\nSo... longwinded post, but I think the realizations are valuable.\n<!--more-->\nshortname=blo_gs_gone_wild\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083912\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://trikuare.cx/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0a5b2c20fe4587a2b0abc3738c953e53&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://trikuare.cx/\">magenta</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083912\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-06-05T00:29:21\">2003-06-05T00:29:21</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">What would be really nice is if the blo.gs response page made clever use of CSS like the W3C validator, by putting one (and, of course, only one) &lt;div id=\"result\" class=\"valid\"&gt; (or class=\"error\") in the response, with the actual error message inside.

Finding the pattern is assumed to mean the ping was successful.\r\nA successful ping, then, causes the plugin to update the contents and timestamp\r\nof the status file with the response.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe status file is used by the plugin to determine whether or not a ping\r\nshould be sent.  This check is made everytime an item is viewed on my blog,\r\nand if the plugin sees a blog item whose timestamp is newer than that of\r\nthe status file, a ping is sent.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo!  Onto the punch-line: The appearance of the word 'congratulations' and\r\nthe successful registration of a ping are not the same thing.  Apparently,\r\n<a href=\"http://www.blo.gs\" target=\"_top\">blo.gs</a> has been throwing up an error message in response to a ping, while\r\nstill registering a ping.  This error message does not contain the word\r\n'congratulations', and so my plugin never updates the status file, and so\r\nit happily tries pinging <a href=\"http://www.blo.gs\" target=\"_top\">blo.gs</a> again with the next blog view.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTwo lessons learned here:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> When using a web service, whether a \"real\" service or a \"scraped\" service, be very sure to know and handle the difference between a valid response and an exception or error in the service itself.\r\n</li>\r\n<li> When using a web service, take care with your usage pattern.  That is, just how important is success?  Important enough to try again and again?  Or could you wait awhile, whether successful or not?  Or should you even try again?\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMy plugin doesn't know the real meaning of the response to a ping.  And further,\r\nthe fact that it's designed to try, try again in the case of apparent failure\r\nis not the greatest choice for a usage pattern.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo... longwinded post, but I think the realizations are valuable.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=blo_gs_gone_wild\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083912\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://trikuare.cx/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0a5b2c20fe4587a2b0abc3738c953e53&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://trikuare.cx/\">magenta</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083912\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-06-05T00:29:21\">2003-06-05T00:29:21</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">What would be really nice is if the blo.gs response page made clever use of CSS like the W3C validator, by putting one (and, of course, only one) &lt;div id=\"result\" class=\"valid\"&gt; (or class=\"error\") in the response, with the actual error message inside.
