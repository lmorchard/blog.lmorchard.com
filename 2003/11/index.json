    "summary": "<p>I haven’t had much time to tinker in the past week or two, but I have still been thinking about recipes and blogs.  I’ve also been trading emails with <a href=\"http://www.troyandgay.com/\">Troy Hakala</a>, who’s one of the food &amp; techie geeks responsible for <a href=\"http://www.recipezaar.com/about/people.zsp\">RecipeZaar</a> and who also has had a hand in the aforementioned <a href=\"http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml/\">RecipeML</a> spec -- clearly, this is someone who knows what’s what with recipes online.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://www.recipezaar.com\"&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; site is very rich in functionality, allowing you to refine searches by various types of information in recipes such as ingredient, course, dietary needs, preparation, and occasion.  The recipes themselves are shown with calculated nutritional information, and discussion and ratings are offered as well.  But, what looks like one of the best features of the site is the recipe submission process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With all the various ways recipes are organized and indexed on this site, I would expect that entering a new recipe would demand some tedious form field entry to get the information into the database.  And, while there is a tiny bit of that toward the end, with regard to categorization and cooking time, the entry of ingredients and cooking steps is done by pasting them in whole into two text areas.  It seems similar to some job listing sites which manage to parse &lt;span class=\"caps\"&gt;ASCII&lt;/span&gt; dumps of applicants&amp;#8217; resumes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#8217;d guess, a parser -- which I&amp;#8217;ve been told has been in constant refinement since the site started -- churns through the text of the ingredient list and separates things into their parts.  And these parts include things like amounts and units, and ingredients which are themselves linked to nutritional and descriptive data.  It&amp;#8217;s all cross-referenced and classified in a way that makes the &lt;span class=\"caps\"&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt; fan in me cheer -- although this ain&amp;#8217;t &lt;span class=\"caps\"&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt; or the Semantic Web.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what if it could be?  Or, at the least, what if recipes could join the list of content types available to be published by bloggers.  If not in &lt;span class=\"caps\"&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt;, then say maybe in some further developed form of RecipeML?  I see recipes in my aggregator from &lt;a href=\"http://www.10500bc.org/archive/006335.php#006335\"&gt;a weblog like this&lt;/a&gt; and I wonder what things could be done with data like this if it were in some structured and machine-readable form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, for one thing, bloggers could ping &lt;a href=\"http://www.recipezaar.com\"&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; when they post new recipes, and that site could become the &lt;a href=\"http://www.feedster.com\"&gt;Feedster&lt;/a&gt; of recipes.  Bloggers could also provide &lt;span class=\"caps\"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; indexes of their recipe postings, possibly for use by future aggregators -- although, I think some major work needs to be done on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/dynamic_polling_freq_too.html\"&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/21/atom_aggregator_behavior_http_level\"&gt;aggregators&lt;/a&gt; before we go too far down that road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what would probably be a great start is to come up with some MovableType plugin which helps support recipe post authoring.  Ideally, this would produce both &lt;span class=\"caps\"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and RecipeML (or better) content, for both human and machine consumption.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But,  there&amp;#8217;s that filling-out-of-forms issue again.  I just read &lt;a href=\"http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/11/18.html#a2022\"&gt;a post by Marc Canter&lt;/a&gt; talking about the growing formats for reviews, where he asks why there aren&amp;#8217;t more fields to fill out for a properly constructed post.  He acknowledges that end-users might not want to fill those out, but we need that data to be potentially available -- but my take on it is that end-users won&amp;#8217;t &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt; want to fill out any fields that they don&amp;#8217;t have to.  And, if there are too many fields that they &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; have to fill out, they&amp;#8217;ll never do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll never get people posting reviews or recipes or anything beyond blog entries without dead simple tools to do it.  Because, of course, your average person sharing recipes has absolutely zero interest in authoring &lt;span class=\"caps\"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=\"caps\"&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt;.  It&amp;#8217;s the techies and machines that want to see things authored in these strange formats, so the motivation to see rich, structured data is on the wrong side of the fence to encourage its production.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, &lt;a href=\"http://www.recipezaar.com\"&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; uses a parser in its recipe submission forms to ease the process as much as possible.  And, it&amp;#8217;s been successful, since they can point to over 70,000 recipes submitted to their site by users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One solution for this, if the people behind &lt;a href=\"http://www.recipezaar.com\"&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; like the idea, is to borrow their parser via web service for use in my hypothetical MovableType plugin.  This could also be used for any number of other blogging tools.  On the upside, we get the benefit of all the work done by Troy and company, and they get to pull in more recipes.  On the downside, we&amp;#8217;re dependant on a web service not under our control for the basic functionality of this plugin.  Maybe not such a bad option, practically speaking, since its a great site run by great people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, just sharing some thoughts here.  I&amp;#8217;m excited to see more varieties of micro-content shared between the people of the web, but the thing I see least talked about is how this stuff will be authored.  I read about data formats and all that, but in terms of user interface, we haven&amp;#8217;t progressed much past the &lt;span class=\"caps\"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; textarea.  Also, I often see handwaving and assumptions that the content is really pretty simple -- but as Troy Hakala would tell you, not even something as &amp;#8220;simple&amp;#8221; as a recipe is a slam dunk in terms of digestion by a machine.  There needs to be some happy medium between a natural human expression of information, and the rigorous structuring required by a machine, mediated by good user interface.&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n",

Actually, I've been thinking about them for a couple of years now, since I'd really like to start cooking some decent meals with the web's help.  Oh yeah, and I'm a geek, so tinkering with some data would be fun too.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne thing I rarely notice mentioned when ideas like this come up is pre-existing work.  Like <a href=\"http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml/index.html\">RecipeML</a> or even the non-XML MealMaster format.  Both of these have been around for quite a long time, especially so in the case of MealMaster.  In fact, if someone wanted to bootstrap a collection of recipes, you can find <a href=\"http://www.thehoseys.com/recipes.html\">a ton (150,000) of MealMaster recipes</a> as well as <a href=\"http://dsquirrel.tripod.com/recipeml/indexrecipes.html\">a smaller archive (10,000) of RecipeML files</a>.  Of course, I'm not sure about the copyright situation with any of these, but it's a start anyway.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut, the real strength in a recipe web would come from cooking bloggers.  Supply them with tools to generate RecipeML, post them on a blog server, and <a href=\"http://bitsko.slc.ut.us/blog/feed-data.html\">index them in an RSS feed</a>.  Then, geeks get to work building the recipe aggregators.  Hell, I'm thinking I might even give this a shot.  Since I'd really like to play with some RDF concepts, maybe I'll write some adaptors to munge RecipeML and MealMaster into <a href=\"http://donnafales.com/2002/07/28/recipe-schema#\">RDF recipe data</a>.  Cross that with FOAF and other RDF whackyness, and build an empire of recipe data.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe thing I wonder, though, is why hasn't anyone done this already?  And why hasn't anyone really mentioned much about what's out there already like RecipeML and MealMaster?  It seems like the perfect time to add this into the blogosphere.\n</p>\n",

There's a matter of scale involved here, where the relative A's through Z's are completely different given your choice of grouping.  And, where choice of grouping is around topic area, the world's a bit of a smaller place and getting your questions answered is likely much easier.  Especially if you've built up some Whuffie in that domain area by generating some useful answers and knowledge yourself.  For newcomers to a domain of knowledge, who have lesser stockpiles of Whuffie, they'll hopefully be fortunate enough to find much of what they're looking for chronicled in the archives of blogs of those who've come before.  When they don't, though, it can still be a frustrating experience.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut, semantic web tech in and of itself doesn't solve the problem where data or knowledge is missing altogether.  How could it?  So, although I was a bit dismissive at first thought about <a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/scriptingArchive/2003/11/10#When:3:49:55PM\">what Dave Winer wrote</a>, he nonetheless has a good point.  Even if the semantic web were richly populated with data and running in full swing, it would still be missing large swaths of Things People Know.  And, well, the thing to use in that case is-- wait for it-- People Who Know Things.  And the way you hopefully can get to them is by being nice and interesting, then blog the answers or ask the people answering your query to blog it themselves.  Then, hopefully, we have blogging tools which can do the bits of pre-digestion to allow that knowledge to be accessed via semantic web machinery to fill in the gaps.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis all takes me back to when I first encountered Usenet in my Freshman year of college, and became instantly enamoured with FAQs.  It seemed like there was a FAQ for everything: <a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/faqs/caffeine-faq/\">coffee</a>, <a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/faqs/anime/faq/\">anime</a>, <a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/faqs/meditation/faq/\">meditation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/faqs/bahai-faith/introduction/\">Baha'i faith</a>, <a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/faqs/objectivism/faq/\">Objectivism</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/faqs/hedgehog-faq/\">hedgehogs</a>.  It seems mighty naive to me now, but at the time, I <i>so</i> thought that this was the modern knowledge factory.  Through the contentious and anal bickerings of discussion threads on Usenet, and the subsequent meticulous maintenance of FAQ files, every trivial bit about everything within the sphere of human concerns would be documented and verified and available for perusal by interested parties.  Netiquette demanded that one pour over the FAQs before entering the conversational fray, so the same ground wouldn't be endlessly rehashed.  Approval from one's peers in the group came from generating new and novel things to add to the FAQ, and all were happy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis, of course, summarizes thoughts coming from a Freshman compsci student getting his first relatively unfettered access to the internet, gushing about everything.  On the other hand, I have many of the above enthusiasms for the Semantic Web's promises.  In a few years, I expect that my enthusiasm will be more even, yet at the same time, I expect there still to be some real uses and benefits to this stuff stabilizing out of it all.  Hopefully, it doesn't get obliterated by spam before then, like Usenet, like email, and now (but hopefully not) in-blog discussions.\n</p>\n",

It is sexy. They say it only works with Windows, but Doc thinks it probably works with Linux too. A couple of thousand really smart people will read this. I'm sure one of them knows the answer. Probably more than one. There's the query. Human intelligence is so under-rated by computer researchers, but when we do our job well, that's what we facilitate. Human minds communicating with other human minds. What could be easier to understand?</i></blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://www.scripting.com/\">Scripting News</a></cite></small></div>\n\n<p>\nWell, I certainly wouldn't call this the Semantic Web-- more like the Whuffie Web.  See, if we were all A-List bloggers, with our own constellations of readers willing to pitch in to answer a question, we could all make queries like the above.  A-List bloggers have the big Whuffie.  Most everyone else has much less Whuffie, thus their query powers are much less.  I somehow doubt that the Whuffie Web, if it were to take off in a big way, would work to equal benefit for everyone.  A cousin, the Lazyweb, sometime serves its petitioners well, but it's a fickle and unpredictable thing indeed.  Sometimes you get magic, sometimes you get shrugs.  This also links into the Whuffie Web, in that Lazyweb contributors will be more likely to service a request if it comes from a Big Time Blogger.  It's all about the Whuffie exchange.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn the other hand, if this Semantic Web thing were to take off, it'd benefit anyone who could lay hands on the connectivity to acquire the data, and the CPU power to churn through it.  The data itself could come from anyone with the connectivity to provide the data, and the brain power to create and assemble it from information and knowledge.  No underestimation of human intelligence here.  If anything, it's an attempt to better respect the exercise human intelligence, to conserve it, and make it more available.  Were the Semantic Web to take off in a big and easy to use way, people could spend more time creating answers and less time answering questions, since the machines do the job of fielding the questions themselves.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course... without the Whuffie, where's the motivation to provide the data?\n</p>\n",
