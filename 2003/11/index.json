    "html": "<p>I haven&#8217;t had much time to tinker in the past week or two, but I have still been thinking about recipes and blogs.  I&#8217;ve also been trading emails with <a href=\"http://www.troyandgay.com/\">Troy Hakala</a>, who&#8217;s one of the food &#38; techie geeks responsible for <a href=\"http://www.recipezaar.com/about/people.zsp\">RecipeZaar</a> and who also has had a hand in the aforementioned <a href=\"http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml/\">RecipeML</a> spec -- clearly, this is someone who knows what&#8217;s what with recipes online.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recipezaar.com&quot;&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; site is very rich in functionality, allowing you to refine searches by various types of information in recipes such as ingredient, course, dietary needs, preparation, and occasion.  The recipes themselves are shown with calculated nutritional information, and discussion and ratings are offered as well.  But, what looks like one of the best features of the site is the recipe submission process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With all the various ways recipes are organized and indexed on this site, I would expect that entering a new recipe would demand some tedious form field entry to get the information into the database.  And, while there is a tiny bit of that toward the end, with regard to categorization and cooking time, the entry of ingredients and cooking steps is done by pasting them in whole into two text areas.  It seems similar to some job listing sites which manage to parse &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASCII&lt;/span&gt; dumps of applicants&amp;#8217; resumes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#8217;d guess, a parser -- which I&amp;#8217;ve been told has been in constant refinement since the site started -- churns through the text of the ingredient list and separates things into their parts.  And these parts include things like amounts and units, and ingredients which are themselves linked to nutritional and descriptive data.  It&amp;#8217;s all cross-referenced and classified in a way that makes the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt; fan in me cheer -- although this ain&amp;#8217;t &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt; or the Semantic Web.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what if it could be?  Or, at the least, what if recipes could join the list of content types available to be published by bloggers.  If not in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt;, then say maybe in some further developed form of RecipeML?  I see recipes in my aggregator from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.10500bc.org/archive/006335.php#006335&quot;&gt;a weblog like this&lt;/a&gt; and I wonder what things could be done with data like this if it were in some structured and machine-readable form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, for one thing, bloggers could ping &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recipezaar.com&quot;&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; when they post new recipes, and that site could become the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedster.com&quot;&gt;Feedster&lt;/a&gt; of recipes.  Bloggers could also provide &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; indexes of their recipe postings, possibly for use by future aggregators -- although, I think some major work needs to be done on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/dynamic_polling_freq_too.html&quot;&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/21/atom_aggregator_behavior_http_level&quot;&gt;aggregators&lt;/a&gt; before we go too far down that road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what would probably be a great start is to come up with some MovableType plugin which helps support recipe post authoring.  Ideally, this would produce both &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and RecipeML (or better) content, for both human and machine consumption.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But,  there&amp;#8217;s that filling-out-of-forms issue again.  I just read &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/11/18.html#a2022&quot;&gt;a post by Marc Canter&lt;/a&gt; talking about the growing formats for reviews, where he asks why there aren&amp;#8217;t more fields to fill out for a properly constructed post.  He acknowledges that end-users might not want to fill those out, but we need that data to be potentially available -- but my take on it is that end-users won&amp;#8217;t &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt; want to fill out any fields that they don&amp;#8217;t have to.  And, if there are too many fields that they &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; have to fill out, they&amp;#8217;ll never do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll never get people posting reviews or recipes or anything beyond blog entries without dead simple tools to do it.  Because, of course, your average person sharing recipes has absolutely zero interest in authoring &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt;.  It&amp;#8217;s the techies and machines that want to see things authored in these strange formats, so the motivation to see rich, structured data is on the wrong side of the fence to encourage its production.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recipezaar.com&quot;&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; uses a parser in its recipe submission forms to ease the process as much as possible.  And, it&amp;#8217;s been successful, since they can point to over 70,000 recipes submitted to their site by users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One solution for this, if the people behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recipezaar.com&quot;&gt;RecipeZaar&lt;/a&gt; like the idea, is to borrow their parser via web service for use in my hypothetical MovableType plugin.  This could also be used for any number of other blogging tools.  On the upside, we get the benefit of all the work done by Troy and company, and they get to pull in more recipes.  On the downside, we&amp;#8217;re dependant on a web service not under our control for the basic functionality of this plugin.  Maybe not such a bad option, practically speaking, since its a great site run by great people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, just sharing some thoughts here.  I&amp;#8217;m excited to see more varieties of micro-content shared between the people of the web, but the thing I see least talked about is how this stuff will be authored.  I read about data formats and all that, but in terms of user interface, we haven&amp;#8217;t progressed much past the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; textarea.  Also, I often see handwaving and assumptions that the content is really pretty simple -- but as Troy Hakala would tell you, not even something as &amp;#8220;simple&amp;#8221; as a recipe is a slam dunk in terms of digestion by a machine.  There needs to be some happy medium between a natural human expression of information, and the rigorous structuring required by a machine, mediated by good user interface.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=recipe_web_3</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090410\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=941b31363609ee1e6144ee4ef937a290&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">blaine</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090410\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-27T04:15:17\">2004-04-27T04:15:17</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">This makes sense; I've also been wanting to do something like this for some time, but alas, it's waaaaay down on my list of priorities.\nHowever, I think it would be best if RecipeZaar just opened up their parser; I really, really hate having to rely on web services for basic tasks.

I read about data formats and all that, but in terms of user interface, we haven&amp;#8217;t progressed much past the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; textarea.  Also, I often see handwaving and assumptions that the content is really pretty simple -- but as Troy Hakala would tell you, not even something as &amp;#8220;simple&amp;#8221; as a recipe is a slam dunk in terms of digestion by a machine.  There needs to be some happy medium between a natural human expression of information, and the rigorous structuring required by a machine, mediated by good user interface.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n",

However, it isn't useful in practice. Imagine the same thing for auctions. There could be an XML format for auctions, everyone can post their items for sale on their weblog and auction aggregators would replace eBay. This would not be as good as eBay, obviously, as there is significant value to a centralized database of auctions. The same is true for recipes, in my opinion. \nAdditionally, creating RecipeML for recipes is a difficult task. Sure, it's fairly easy to write a few recipes in RecipeML if you're technically adept, but to do thousands becomes impossible and for the average recipe producer (grandmothers, chefs, etc) it just won't happen. And you really do need thousands to be a useful database (even your average cooking magazine publishes hundreds a month). \nWe (Recipezaar) wrote a natural language recipe parser to make this possible and it's a difficult job. It took us 3 years to write it!  Recipes are far more complicated than you might think, believe it or not. And a natural language recipe parser is not trivial software, which is why no other recipe web site has done this except for Recipezaar. We could release the software under the GPL so that everyone can start creating XML recipes. We've considered it and we've talked to people about doing it but after some thought, people do realize that it wouldn't be useful. Because, again, having recipes distributed across web sites is less powerful than a centralized repository of freely-available recipes. \nImagine a world of XML recipes distributed around the web on weblogs. An aggregator would need to aggregate millions of weblogs just to cull together a few hundred or thousand recipes. Now imagine millions of aggregator users doing this daily or hourly the way they do this today for weblogs. And if a weblogger had 1,000 recipes on their weblog archives, they wouldn't want millions of aggregators eating their bandwidth every day to maintain the database for each individual using an aggregator (webloggers today already complain about aggregators costing them too much money in bandwidth costs). Additionally, 99.999% of people who create recipes are unlikely to have a weblog to post their XML recipes so you'd lose the majority of the potential content. \nA centralized repository provides a place for regular users to post their recipes and get them seen by the most number of people. And a centralized repository provides an easy way to search for recipes, browse for recipes, review & rate recipes, discuss recipes, etc. And let's talk numbers.... today, Recipezaar has 73,000 recipes in the database and, while it's the largest database of recipes on the internet, people still can't find a particular recipe because there is an infinite number of possible recipes that can be created. Having a few hundred or a few thousand recipes is not a useful database to people. More is better. And acquiring more via an aggregator is a big and expensive job.\nDistributed databases are useful in some contexts and centralized databases are useful in other contexts. Each has their own advantages and disadvantages, but like auctions, recipes are best stored centrally where everyone has access to them.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087754\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rjasmin.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9479c9c2b46970b26fe7642ddaf893a5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rjasmin.net\">rich</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087754\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-07-11T02:26:03\">2009-07-11T02:26:03</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with the central database theory.BUT, why limit to KRAFT or epicurious or the like.There are LOTS TONS even of unpublished or un-online recipies out there.My mother has several shoe boxes full and can't organize them yet.</p>\n<p>I know HOW to do it, but there is no stable MMF reader for OSX that fixes corrupted input yet.MacGourmet FAILS.

Each has their own advantages and disadvantages, but like auctions, recipes are best stored centrally where everyone has access to them.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087754\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rjasmin.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9479c9c2b46970b26fe7642ddaf893a5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rjasmin.net\">rich</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087754\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-07-11T02:26:03\">2009-07-11T02:26:03</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I agree with the central database theory.BUT, why limit to KRAFT or epicurious or the like.There are LOTS TONS even of unpublished or un-online recipies out there.My mother has several shoe boxes full and can't organize them yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know HOW to do it, but there is no stable MMF reader for OSX that fixes corrupted input yet.MacGourmet FAILS.

It is written in the increasingly popularExtensible Markup Language - XML.\n<br><br>\nIf you run a recipe web site, or are creating a software program -- on any platform -- that works with recipes, then you should consider using RecipeML for coding your recipes! See the FAQs and the new examples for more info.\n</i></blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml/index.html\">RecipeML - Format for Online Recipes</a></cite></small></div>\n\n<p>\nSo I&apos;m all about this microcontent thing, thinking recently about recipes since reading <a href=\"http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/11/10.html#a1972\">Marc Canter&apos;s post</a> about them.  Actually, I&apos;ve been thinking about them for a couple of years now, since I&apos;d really like to start cooking some decent meals with the web&apos;s help.  Oh yeah, and I&apos;m a geek, so tinkering with some data would be fun too.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne thing I rarely notice mentioned when ideas like this come up is pre-existing work.  Like <a href=\"http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml/index.html\">RecipeML</a> or even the non-XML MealMaster format.  Both of these have been around for quite a long time, especially so in the case of MealMaster.  In fact, if someone wanted to bootstrap a collection of recipes, you can find <a href=\"http://www.thehoseys.com/recipes.html\">a ton (150,000) of MealMaster recipes</a> as well as <a href=\"http://dsquirrel.tripod.com/recipeml/indexrecipes.html\">a smaller archive (10,000) of RecipeML files</a>.  Of course, I&apos;m not sure about the copyright situation with any of these, but it&apos;s a start anyway.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut, the real strength in a recipe web would come from cooking bloggers.  Supply them with tools to generate RecipeML, post them on a blog server, and <a href=\"http://bitsko.slc.ut.us/blog/feed-data.html\">index them in an RSS feed</a>.  Then, geeks get to work building the recipe aggregators.  Hell, I&apos;m thinking I might even give this a shot.  Since I&apos;d really like to play with some RDF concepts, maybe I&apos;ll write some adaptors to munge RecipeML and MealMaster into <a href=\"http://donnafales.com/2002/07/28/recipe-schema#\">RDF recipe data</a>.  Cross that with FOAF and other RDF whackyness, and build an empire of recipe data.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe thing I wonder, though, is why hasn&apos;t anyone done this already?  And why hasn&apos;t anyone really mentioned much about what&apos;s out there already like RecipeML and MealMaster?  It seems like the perfect time to add this into the blogosphere.\n</p>\n",
