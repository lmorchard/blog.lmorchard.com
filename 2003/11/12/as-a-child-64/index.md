I see that Mark Pilgrim has posted <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/11/11/iie">a picture of himself as a kid</a>, working at an Apple //e.  Based on what I wrote this past Summer about being <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/newly_digital.html">Newly Digital in 1983</a>, I would guess that around the same time I was working on a Commodore 64, and I would have teased him in a relentlessly geeky way about his clearly inferior machine.
