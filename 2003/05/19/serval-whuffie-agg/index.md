<blockquote cite="http://john.beimler.org/serval_aggregator_first_post.html">I've given the aggregator a concept of whuffie. I can give any item that has been aggregated a thumbs up or thumbs down, increasing or decreasing the item and site's wuffie. I sort the sites out as I display them by their whuffie. It is a simplistic way of keeping the sites I'm interested in at the top of the list. I'd like to wire in a Bayesian classifier too, and see if that helps me get the items I like to the top.</blockquote>

<div class="excerpt">Yay, an aggregator with whuffie-tech!  This is very similar to what I was doing with
<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines">AmphetaOutlines</a> for <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk">AmphetaDesk</a> - when I click on an item from a channel, I increment
a counter for that channel.  And, when I sort channels for display, I use that count as
a factor in the sort.</div>
<br /><br />
And, of course, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/rssbayes_now.html" target="_top">I want to use Bayesian filtering to see what I <strong>do</strong> want.</a>
<br /><br />
What would really be whuffie-riffic about aggregators that support this kind of
thumbs-up/down tracking, would be to have some P2P sharing of these decisions
to come up with something actually more like whuffie.  That is, I would like
to see how much right-handed whuffie some item has gotten, and possibly
bubblesort up or visually tag items I've yet to read based on that whuffie.
Right-handed whuffie being, of course, the accumulation of whuffie an item
has be given by authors to whom I've given lots of whuffie.

            <div class="content">I've been using amphetaoutlines for a while now, and the one trouble I've had with its sorting is that if I read an item in the aggregator itself it's not up-ranked.  And I prefer to read the items in amphetadesk if I can.  (I'm not sure there's a good way to track such a thing, though.)</div>

            <div class="content">Yeah, there is that.  I had been meaning for awhile to have some mechanism for informing AmphetaDesk when an outline triangle on an item was opened, and allow one level of thumbs up for that, and maybe another higher weight thumbs up for clicking on the link</div>
