<div class="content">Oh, it&#39;s rambled about on the wiki page.  I just updated the blog entry with more info though.  Seems there&#39;s a parameter (fcid) to the URL for just added albums that I can&#39;t decipher.</div>

<div class="content">I imagine fcId is tied to an internal value that&#39;s changed by a content management system.  Even if it changes a few times in a noticeable pattern, I don&#39;t imagine that it would be reliable forever.  The only foolproof way I can think of retrieving the contents of a (or all of them) Just Added &#39;playlist&#39; is by doing the following;
1. Retrieving the XML from viewPlaylistsPage without any parameters and storing the attribute of the ViewGenre element that matches your preferred genre(s).  I don&#39;t imagine these would remain static for all time either, judging from the numbers;
2. For each genre id that was stored from step 1, load the XML from vewGenre?id=.  Find the GotoURL element that contains the text Just Added and grab it&#39;s url attribute.  Add on &amp;batchNumber=0;
3. If you&#39;re fine with just one page being transformed, use the resulting XML for the transformation to RSS.  Otherwise, store the album information that you want to keep from the page and look for the value &#39;X-Y of Z&#39;.  If Y and Z don&#39;t match, increment batchNumber and process the resulting XML.  Repeat for other genres.
It&#39;d probably be best to cache the resulting RSS feed and let it live for at least 24 hours.  With at least three to four round trips to determine the albums in a playlist without knowledge of the fcId values, I don&#39;t imagine it would be very responsive.</div>

<div class="content">Nathan: Hrm...  Yeah, that&#39;s the approach I was afraid that I&#39;d have to end up taking, but it&#39;s probably the most reliable.  Hmph.</div>
