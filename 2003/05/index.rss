          <title>Don&#39;t Call It an Obsession</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Just read Matt Gemmell&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scotlandsoftware.com/blog/?entry=/games/games_stuff.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;bit of a catalog&lt;/a&gt;
of his Nintendo collection, and ever since Russell &lt;a href=&quot;http://beattie.info/notebook/20021201.html#184646&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;professed his love&lt;/a&gt;
for his &lt;span style=&quot;background : #FFFFCE;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/GameBoy?topicparent=Main.FilterData&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;GameBoy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Advance, I&#39;ve been meaning to write something about my personal video game addiction.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For the past few months, with everything
that&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/misc/first_week_off.phtml&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;been&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/misc/still_breathing.phtml&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;going&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/misc/thirsty_ibook.phtml&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;on&lt;/a&gt;
in my life,
I&#39;ve not had much time for nursing my habit.  But, since things have calmed
down a bit, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/~missadroit&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;my girlfriend&lt;/a&gt; and I
both purchased &lt;span style=&quot;background : #FFFFCE;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/GameBoy?topicparent=Main.FilterData&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;GameBoy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; SP&#39;s, our time mashing buttons and cursing at glowing
screens has picked back up.  I count myself as infinitely fortunate to have
found a girl who not only tolerates my video gaming ways, but insists that
we display the collection of consoles in the living room.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have a photo of the entertainment rack around here somewhere, but it
may have been a casualty of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/misc/thirsty_ibook.phtml&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;thirsty iBook&lt;/a&gt;
incident.  (Still tinkering with getting a Linux box to mount the HFS+
partition on the apparently undamaged hard drive.)  From where I&#39;m sitting,
though, I see the following systems either connected via switchbox to
the TV, or stowed away in a mesh drawer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Nintendo
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; NES (classic frontloader)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; SNES
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; N64
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;background : #FFFFCE;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/GameCube?topicparent=Main.FilterData&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;GameCube&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;background : #FFFFCE;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/GameBoy?topicparent=Main.FilterData&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;GameBoy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Classic
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Pocket
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Color
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Advance 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; purple with TV connector mod
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; pink 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Advance SP (x 2 platinum)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Sega
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Genesis
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Dreamcast
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; XBox
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; PS2
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Stowed away in closets and, possibly, at my Mom&#39;s house, I&#39;ve also
got an Atari and &lt;span style=&quot;background : #FFFFCE;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/ColecoVision?topicparent=Main.FilterData&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;ColecoVision&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  Also, I have a small start on a
computer collection as well, including a C64, Atari 800, Amiga 1200,
and of course a smattering of random PCs.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Eventually, I want a house, and a room in this house will be dedicated
to the display and use of these machines.  Also, eventually, I want
to work on a proper collection of these things and their games and
software.  (For instance, I&#39;m in desperate need of a second generation
top-loading NES.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The funny thing is that people still ask me occasionally if I really
need or use all this stuff.  How could the answer be anything but yes? :)

          <title>Thank You, Readers</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I&#39;ve been meaning to post a little note of thanks to everyone
who&#39;re still reading this blog.  I haven&#39;t done or said much of note
around these parts in some time, with the only saving grace being my
automated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger&quot;&gt;BookmarkBlogger&lt;/a&gt; posting every night.  More than I expected,
those posts have actually caught the interest of a few people.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But I never wanted this
place to turn into just another link-blog.  And I also have been feeling
a bit guilty that my Quick Links give no indication of source where
I found these tidbits.  They are, more often than not, gleaned from
the 320 or so sites whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds I slurp down 12 or so times a day.
I really need to get some sort of blog roll going again, but somehow I
doubt that everyone wants to download my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feed list when they visit
here.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Anyway, that&#39;s all.  Thanks for reading and sticking around as I get
things sorted and stitched back together in the offline world.  I hope
to come back with some nifty things soon, since I&#39;m itching to hack.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>No More Mr. RSSify</title>
          <description>&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.voidstar.com/rssify.php&quot;&gt;RSSify is a rather horrible hack that shouldn&#39;t be needed any more. Please ask the owner of the site you&#39;re reading (...) to change to a system that generates &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; natively such as Blogger Pro or Movable Type. Alternatively consider hosting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.voidstar.com/downloads/rssify.php.txt&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;RSSify&lt;/a&gt; yourself rather than using my bandwidth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source:&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.voidstar.com/rssify.php&quot;&gt;22-May-03 Moving away from &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;ify&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Noticed this show up suddenly today as the new item to a surprising number of
feeds to which I subscribe.  I knew &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.voidstar.com&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Julian Bond&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s public &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;ifying service
had gotten used far and wide, but wow.  The bandwidth bills must&#39;ve been getting
quite annoying, having become a sort of adhoc bit of the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rube-goldberg.com/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Rube Goldberg&lt;/a&gt; blog
infrastructure.  So, as for my own consumption, thanks for the use of your tool Julian, and
all apologies for being a leech!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Well, I&#39;m still working a bit on my own Java-based transmogrifier robot
to scrape disparate sources of info into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds for me.  I suppose I
should get to work trading my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;ify-based subscriptions for my own
DIY-scraped versions.  If I get some time soon, I&#39;ll wrap this thing
up and release it.  But first, I hope to get it fully automatedly working with the
iTunes Music Store, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/itunes_rss.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;as I&#39;ve been tinkering&lt;/a&gt;.

          <title>Programming Web Services with Perl</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pwebserperl/&quot;&gt;Programming Web Services with Perl&lt;/a&gt;
surprised me yesterday by arriving on my doorstep.  I&#39;d forgotten that back in March,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kulchenko.com/&quot;&gt;Paul Kulchenko&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/catalog/view/au/208&quot;&gt;one author&lt;/a&gt;
of the book&#39;s two) had offered me a free copy of it response to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/web_service_pipelines.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;a quick thought of mine&lt;/a&gt; about
a more Unix-like model for filtering web services (something I want to get back to).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Anyway, I&#39;ve yet to get very much into the book, but a cursory skim tells me
that this looks like a great book.  Thank you very much for sending me a copy, Paul!&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Mad Trackback Disease</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just started experimenting with integrating
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intertwingly.net/code/autoping.py&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Sam Ruby&#39;s autoping.py&lt;/a&gt; with my blogging
rig here, and discovered that I really had rushed things a bit and didn&#39;t
understand what the thing was doing.  I think my caffeine intake for today is
way below baseline, so if yours happens to be one of the sites I mistakenly
vandalized or spammed with broken or erroneous trackbacks, I apologize profusely!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Update:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  Speaking of Trackback, I just duct taped an initial implementation on
the receiving end with a revision to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlosxomDbcomments&quot;&gt;BlosxomDbcomments&lt;/a&gt; plugin.  It needs some testing,
so if you see this, and don&#39;t mind, pummel this entry with trackbacks!  Next, I&#39;m
considering integrating referrers, thus bringing this new blogging rig up to
where I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooaab.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;a little over a year ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>You&#39;ve Got Your Whuffie in My Aggregator!</title>
          <description>&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://john.beimler.org/serval_aggregator_first_post.html&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve given the aggregator a concept of whuffie. I can give any item that has been aggregated a thumbs up or thumbs down, increasing or decreasing the item and site&#39;s wuffie. I sort the sites out as I display them by their whuffie. It is a simplistic way of keeping the sites I&#39;m interested in at the top of the list. I&#39;d like to wire in a Bayesian classifier too, and see if that helps me get the items I like to the top.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source:&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://john.beimler.org/serval_aggregator_first_post.html&quot;&gt;Serval, an aggregator with Whuffie&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;http://matt.griffith.com/weblog/2003/05/19.html#a142&quot;&gt;matt.griffith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;excerpt&quot;&gt;Yay, an aggregator with whuffie-tech!  This is very similar to what I was doing with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines&quot;&gt;AmphetaOutlines&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk&quot;&gt;AmphetaDesk&lt;/a&gt; - when I click on an item from a channel, I increment
a counter for that channel.  And, when I sort channels for display, I use that count as
a factor in the sort.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And, of course, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/rssbayes_now.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;I want to use Bayesian filtering to see what I &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; want.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What would really be whuffie-riffic about aggregators that support this kind of
thumbs-up/down tracking, would be to have some P2P sharing of these decisions
to come up with something actually more like whuffie.  That is, I would like
to see how much right-handed whuffie some item has gotten, and possibly
bubblesort up or visually tag items I&#39;ve yet to read based on that whuffie.
Right-handed whuffie being, of course, the accumulation of whuffie an item
has be given by authors to whom I&#39;ve given lots of whuffie.

          <title>The Matrix BrickPhone</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samsungtelecom.com/matrix/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.samsungtelecom.com/matrix/images/home_phone.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Okay, no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samsungtelecom.com/matrix/&quot;&gt;This new Matrix-inspired phone&lt;/a&gt; is ugly as hell and not cool at all.  Do they actually use this thing in the movie?  I hope this isn&#39;t a sign for what the movie will be like -- clumsy, bulky, cartoonish and not at all subtle like the original.  See, the first movie had a phone.  I forget the model number, but I think it was a Nokia.  its sliding keypad cover was modified especially for the movie with a switchblade-springload action for extra cool factor.  And, unlike a lot of phones at the time, it was slick and sleek and tiny.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So what the hell is this thing?  It looks like a walkee-talkee for grade school kids, not the &quot;ultimate conversation piece&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Google Blog Clog?</title>
          <description>&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/20030509.html#095103&quot;&gt;...Personally, I&#39;m getting SICK of running into my OWN BLOG while doing research into any of the topics that I&#39;ve ranted about here. I spend a couple posts talking about a technology with questions or thoughts, then later I go to implement this tech and need specifics and yet 2 or 3 of the top ranks are filled with my annoying blather. Urgh!...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source:&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/20030509.html#095103&quot;&gt;Russell Beattie Notebook: Those who Live by Google...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Amen.  More and more, I&#39;m running into myself on Google.  I&#39;ll be looking for expert information
on something I&#39;m trying to tinker with, and discover that one of more of the top
search results are me writing about looking for expert information on the thing I&#39;m
trying to tinker with.  Just occasionally do I find myself having actually provided
the information that I&#39;m currently seeking.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I mean, it&#39;s not a gigantic shocker-- my interests are relatively stable over
time, and I circle back to things after long periods of time, so this is to
be expected I suppose.  But I&#39;m starting to feel like I&#39;m in a bad time travel
movie.

          <title>Bayesian Filtering for what I DO want?</title>
          <description>&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://matt.griffith.com/weblog/2003/05/08.html#a129&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve never gotten much spam. I closely guard the email addresses I care about. Spamex makes it simple but I did it before without Spamex. My problem is information overload. I&#39;m much more interested in seeing the same thing for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of blocking stuff I don&#39;t want I want it to highlight the stuff I might want. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;ve been out of the loop lately because I can&#39;t keep up with all of the feeds I would like to monitor. I need help.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source:&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://matt.griffith.com/weblog/2003/05/08.html#a129&quot;&gt;matt.griffith: Where is RSSBayes?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ditto.  Using a Bayesian approach, or some other form of machine learning, as applied
to my aggregator and my viewing patterns is something I&#39;ve been wanting for awhile now.
I&#39;ve done some very, very primitive self-monitoring with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines&quot;&gt;AmphetaOutlines&lt;/a&gt;, but I&#39;d
like to get back to some machine learning research and build an enhanced
aggregator that learns what makes me click.

last week in response to discovering DRM under the hood.  But I&#39;ve softened in
my opinion since then.  And bought a few more songs that I haven&#39;t heard in years.
And burned an Audio CD.  And wasn&#39;t &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; inconvenienced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My girlfriend and I almost
bought iPods last night, and though we resisted the temptation this time, I expect that
we&#39;ll end up with them before long.  And when that happens, I imagine we&#39;ll try sharing
tracks, and that doesn&#39;t seem to be too inconvenient either.  And then, there&#39;s the
fact that the iTMS seems to have a pretty nifty set of underpinnings that look like
fun to play with.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So now, like anything I&#39;m interested in on the interweb, I want to swallow it up with my aggregator.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Thus, I attempt a new project:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ItunesMusicStoreToRss&quot;&gt;ItunesMusicStoreToRss&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Progress so far, but I&#39;ve hit a stumbling block.  Anyone want to help?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; A little bit of cut &amp;amp; paste from the wiki page:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you spy on iTunes while browsing to a &quot;Just Added&quot; section of a genre, you&#39;ll find that a URL like the following is accessed: 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/com.apple.jingle.app.store.DirectAction/viewPlayListsPage?fcId=145690&amp;amp;pageType=justAdded&amp;amp;id=21&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;(it&#39;s a long URL)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The response to that URL is some very interesting XML that looks like a GUI language.  Buried in the GUI recipe, however, is what I want flowing into my aggregator.  So, I dust off my XSL skills and have a go at mangling this content into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;.  I seem to have been successful.  A test run appears to validate, and is accepted in my aggregator. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The problem, though, lies in the aforementioned URL.  Everything seems pretty clear and straightforward, and I can change genre&#39;s by supplying discovered ID&#39;s to the id parameter.  However, the  &quot;fcid=145690&quot; parameter  is an unknown to me.  It seems to change, though I haven&#39;t yet investigated its derivation or how often it changes.  I was working on things yesterday, and the value was one thing, this morning it was another. If the number is not valid, unexpected results happen, sometimes resulting in HTML output describing an application exception.  So, until the fcid mystery is solved, I&#39;ve yet to automate this transformation. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Any ideas out there on the lazyweb?  Visit the wiki page (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ItunesMusicStoreToRss&quot;&gt;ItunesMusicStoreToRss&lt;/a&gt;) and feel free to poke fun at my XSL skills.&lt;/p&gt;
