        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I&amp;apos;ve been meaning to post a little note of thanks to everyone
who&amp;apos;re still reading this blog.  I haven&amp;apos;t done or said much of note
around these parts in some time, with the only saving grace being my
automated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger&quot;&gt;BookmarkBlogger&lt;/a&gt; posting every night.  More than I expected,
those posts have actually caught the interest of a few people.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But I never wanted this
place to turn into just another link-blog.  And I also have been feeling
a bit guilty that my Quick Links give no indication of source where
I found these tidbits.  They are, more often than not, gleaned from
the 320 or so sites whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds I slurp down 12 or so times a day.
I really need to get some sort of blog roll going again, but somehow I
doubt that everyone wants to download my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feed list when they visit
here.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Anyway, that&amp;apos;s all.  Thanks for reading and sticking around as I get
things sorted and stitched back together in the offline world.  I hope
to come back with some nifty things soon, since I&amp;apos;m itching to hack.&lt;/p&gt;
