    "summary": "Just read Matt Gemmell's bit of a catalog\nof his Nintendo collection, and ever since Russell professed his love\nfor his ?GameBoy Advance, I've been meaning to write something about my personal video game addiction.\n\nFor the past few months, with everything\nthat's been\ngoing on\nin my life,\nI've not had much time for nursing my habit.  But, since things have calmed\ndown a bit, and my girlfriend and I\nboth purchased ?GameBoy SP's, our time mashing buttons and cursing at glowing\nscreens has picked back up.  I count myself as infinitely fortunate to have\nfound a girl who not only tolerates my video gaming ways, but insists that\nwe display the collection of consoles in the living room.\n\nI have a photo of the entertainment rack around here somewhere, but it\nmay have been a casualty of the thirsty iBook\nincident.  (Still tinkering with getting a Linux box to mount the HFS+\npartition on the apparently undamaged hard drive.)  From where I'm sitting,\nthough, I see the following systems either connected via switchbox to\nthe TV, or stowed away in a mesh drawer:\n\n Nintendo\n\n NES (classic frontloader)\n\n SNES\n\n N64\n\n ?GameCube\n\n ?GameBoy\n\n Classic\n\n Pocket\n\n Color\n\n Advance \n\n purple with TV connector mod\n\n pink \n\n\n\n Advance SP (x 2 platinum)\n\n\n\n\n\n Sega\n\n Genesis\n\n Dreamcast\n\n\n\n XBox\n\n PS2\n\n\nStowed away in closets and, possibly, at my Mom's house, I've also\ngot an Atari and ?ColecoVision.  Also, I have a small start on a\ncomputer collection as well, including a C64, Atari 800, Amiga 1200,\nand of course a smattering of random PCs.\n\nEventually, I want a house, and a room in this house will be dedicated\nto the display and use of these machines.  Also, eventually, I want\nto work on a proper collection of these things and their games and\nsoftware.  (For instance, I'm in desperate need of a second generation\ntop-loading NES.)\n\nThe funny thing is that people still ask me occasionally if I really\nneed or use all this stuff.  How could the answer be anything but yes? :)",

A test run appears to validate, and is accepted in my aggregator. \n\nThe problem, though, lies in the aforementioned URL.  Everything seems pretty clear and straightforward, and I can change genre's by supplying discovered ID's to the id parameter.  However, the  \"fcid=145690\" parameter  is an unknown to me.  It seems to change, though I haven't yet investigated its derivation or how often it changes.  I was working on things yesterday, and the value was one thing, this morning it was another. If the number is not valid, unexpected results happen, sometimes resulting in HTML output describing an application exception.  So, until the fcid mystery is solved, I've yet to automate this transformation. \n\nAny ideas out there on the lazyweb?
