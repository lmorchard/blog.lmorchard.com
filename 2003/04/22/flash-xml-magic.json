I&#39;ve managed to move from backend to front a few years back and while I mainly play in Mozilla, Flash MX is a welcome treat on occasion, see link in comment.\n\nI&#39;m also doing some of this in an open source card sorting application where I pass javascript data from Mozilla chrome into Flash via WDDX (an xml format for data structures),  uzilla.mozdev.org. Lots of possibilities for merging things like browser history with Flash viz.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221082846&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://simon.incutio.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ecb4f56e961dd226352c4dd51eff26&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://simon.incutio.com/&quot;&gt;Simon Willison&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221082846&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-04-22T15:17:47&quot;&gt;2003-04-22T15:17:47&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Erk, didn&#39;t realise Blosxom displays my email address if I provide it (I thought it would be over-ridden by my URL) :(&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221082847&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://simon.incutio.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ecb4f56e961dd226352c4dd51eff26&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://simon.incutio.com/&quot;&gt;Simon Willison&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221082847&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-04-22T20:44:35&quot;&gt;2003-04-22T20:44:35&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Just don&#39;t make me read content from Flash.
