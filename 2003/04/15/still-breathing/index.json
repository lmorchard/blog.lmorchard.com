In theory, this is plenty of time to accomplish moving\nand cleaning and decorating.  But, some things are hard to move gradually, especially when both she\nand I have compact cars and trucks rent by the hour.  And then there&#39;s the fact that our new residence\nis found on the third floor, providing much exercise to the both of us.
