So yeah, I wanted tabs in Safari.  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooche.html" target="_top">Or something like tabs.</a>
<br /><br />
But since discovering that the "Window" menu in OS X is not painful to
use, and that CMD-Backquote rotates between open windows, I've not missed
tabs an incredible amount.  I think my tab usage was a response to my experience
with Windows and Linux window managers, though even those have changed since
I started using tabs in my browser.
<br /><br />
However, I still love using <a href="http://www.students.tut.fi/~tuomov/pwm/" target="_top">pwm</a> as
my window manager under X11, with its tab collections and windowshading.  Go
figure.
