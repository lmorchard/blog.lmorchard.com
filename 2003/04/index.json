Although I'm not interested\nin approximately 90% of the music offered so far, that still leaves me with\n2000 songs whose \"buy\" buttons call my name.  The process is simple, the files\nare mine and not locked up with DRM, and although I hope and expect the price\nstructure to change (ie. maybe price based on popularity?), a dollar a song\nisn't horrendous considering that I get what I want on demand and without \nhopping in the car and going anywhere.  So far, so good.\n\nSo...  This got me to thinking in the last 10 minutes:  What about an indie\nclone of the Apple Music Service?  One using RDF or some other XML format to\noffer up the catalogues of record labels?  Include all artists, albums, songs,\nand any various and sundry bits of trivia about all the above.  Establish a\nmodular mechanism for specifying payment process (ie. paypal, credit card,\nfree, upload a song), and make the whole interface as slick and easy as\niTunes'.\n\nThe real trick I see in this, though, is to make the file format for music\nvendors fairly easy yet flexible.  It should be as easy or easier than an\nRSS feed for a blog.  Let a hundred of these mushrooms bloom, aggregate, \nsearch, and buy.  Make it distributed and not dependant on any particular\nmusic company or technology company.\n\nNot a terribly original idea, but that's what I just thought of.  Sounds\nlike a good semantic web app that could have some umph going for it in\nthe immediate future.",

Instead, I've had\na project hurled at me that combines Flash MX and XML, something I've\njust barely touched before.\n\nWow, is this stuff fun.  And I write that without a trace of sarcasm--\nthis app I've inherited for maintenance and extension, though it's a\nbit grungy and shows some signs of late-night expediency, does some\nneat things with actions and buttons dynamically wired up in response\nto XML config files loaded via URL, which are in turn generated from a\ndatabase managed by a simple end-user admin interface.  Not sure how\nmuch more I should write about it, but I'm dying to post a link.  Of\ncourse, this isn't revolutionary stuff in general.  It's just a revelation\nto me.\n\nThe last time I had an opportunity to really, really dig around in\nFlash was just about when Flash 5 came out.  I was immersed daily in\nFlash in the years between the initial acquisition by Macromedia, up\nthrough version 4, and just started drifting away, sadly, when things\nstarted getting really interesting with v5.  That was when my daily\njob swung entirely into the backend, and client-side concerns were\nno longer my task.\n\nBut now I'm back in this old neighborhood, and I can see why some\npeople would love nothing better but to build entire websites in\nFlash.  Yeah, that's evil, but it's sexy.  Despite some clunkiness,\nthere are some very nice possibilities I see now.  I love Java, and\nloved cobbling together funky applets 5 years or so ago, but Flash\nmakes me want to toy with rich client-side apps again.\n\nAnd then, there's this\nSony Clie PEG-TG50\nhandheld I've recently started pining for, and it appears to run a\nFlash 5 player.  It's probably underwhelming, but who knows?\n\nAnyway, back to work, but just had to spill some enthusiasm for\nFlash.",

Or, at least,\nI'd love to see more stories from the same setting or playing with the\nsame themes of the Bitchun Society.  I have seen some of these things\nin stories before, though.  So, hey, I haven't posted anything here in\na few days - have some babble and book links (feel free to comment and\nleave some more links):\n\nOf course I love the notion of ubiquitous computing and personal\nHUD's.  I've babbled about that at length for sure.  If you want more\nof that, go check out Vernor Vinge's\nFast Times at Fairmont High.\nMediated reality with P2P computing woven into clothing and projected\nacross contact lens displays.  A little less obtrusive than\nseisure-inducing in-brain electronics, but just as post-human.\n\nAnd then there's backup-and-restore and the cure for death.  Although\nin David Brin's\nKiln People,\nthings start with disposable\ndoppelgangers, survival of personality after bodily death is promised\nin the ending.  What could change human nature more than transcending\nmortality?\n\nAs for deadheading, check out Vinge's\nAcross Realtime\nseries.  In\nparticular, read up on bobbling in Marooned in Realtime.  There's also\nOrson Scott Card's The Worthing Saga.\nA one-way trip into the far future\nthrough geological periods of time seems particularly external to\nknown human experience, especially when combined with immortality.\n\nOne thing I've yet to see much in stories or speculations is how\nsociety could function in a post-mortality and post-scarcity\nconditions.  I've never been satisfied with the way Star Trek dodges\nthe day-to-day realities of a post-capitalistic Federation of plenty.\nWalter Jon Williams' Aristoi\nexplores an interesting track with a\nmeritocratic society whose top members have godlike powers matched to\ngodlike creativity and self-possession (not to mention possession by\nmultiple selves).\n\nBut so far, Whuffie and its currency in reputation is the best game\nI've seen yet.  Since, even if the problems of mortality and material\nscarcity are solved, human attention and cooperation will never be\ngratis.  So, how else do you herd the cats when you can neither\nthreaten nor reward them via any physical means?  Seems like the\nblogosphere, gift culture, and open source noosphere brought to\nreality.\n\nKinda makes me want to get back to fiction writing meself and finally\nget out the dozen or so stories I've had bouncing around in my head\nthese past years.  Doesn't necessarily mean I'd churn out anything\ngood, but who knows?  Maybe after some work and some stumbling I could\nproduce something passable.  All those creative writing classes in\ncollege and short stories in spiral-bound notebooks from high school\nhave to count for something.  I'd even love to squat in the Bitchun\nSociety for a few stories, but that might be a bit presumptuous, even though\nMr. Doctorow himself has let on\nthat he's not likely to write more\ntales from the same Bitchun universe.\nBetter to get some practice in before jamming in someone else's club.",

And when Dave first introduced the idea of an OPML-based distributed web directory,\nI figured it was the start of another nifty twist in the web fabric.  (You know, the kind that makes wrinkles?\nThe kind of wrinkles that make brains smarter?)\n\nAnyway, even given all this, OPML has always bugged me, and I'm not alone.  In fact, today I found a\nlink to OML, the Outline Markup Language project on ?SourceForge,\nwhich seems to seek to address many of the same things that have bugged me.  That is, things like\nUserLand application-specific tags, and extension via arbitrary attributes.  Though I'm no master\nof deep XML magic, these things struck me as grungy.\n\nBut you know, we're designing for recombinant growth with the lazyweb here\n(or at least, Dave Winer was and is), and OPML looks like one of those dirty things that got\nthrown together quickly in order to enable a laundry list of further projects.  It works, isn't\nall that hard to grasp, and has gotten adopted quickly.  There's momentum there.  As \nDave says, there is no wait for\ntools.\n\nSo, now there's also OML starting.  Hopefully this won't become another rehash of the RSS fight.Because, I sense many similar issues between the two.  Maybe it would have been better still if OML had been named something\ncompletely avoiding the letters O, P, M, or L.  I already see mailing list charters being called out in order to quiet unwanted\ndiscussion of fundamentals, but, hopefully we can avoid anyone claiming that they have the One True Format, all fighting for the\nsame name and slapping each other around with version numbers.  Gah.\n\nAnyway.  I like OML but see some grunge in it as well.  At the moment, I'm using an OPML-supporting tool. I can't imagine that\nconversion would be more than an XSLT file away.  Well, maybe more than that.  Beyond that, let's agree to disagree and viva le\nfork.  Let the best, most demonstratably capable format win.
