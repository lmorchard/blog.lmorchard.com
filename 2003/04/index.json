Although I'm not interested\nin approximately 90% of the music offered so far, that still leaves me with\n2000 songs whose \"buy\" buttons call my name.  The process is simple, the files\nare mine and not locked up with DRM, and although I hope and expect the price\nstructure to change (ie. maybe price based on popularity?), a dollar a song\nisn't horrendous considering that I get what I want on demand and without \nhopping in the car and going anywhere.  So far, so good.\n<br><br>\nSo...  This got me to thinking in the last 10 minutes:  What about an indie\nclone of the Apple Music Service?  One using <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> or some other XML format to\noffer up the catalogues of record labels?  Include all artists, albums, songs,\nand any various and sundry bits of trivia about all the above.  Establish a\nmodular mechanism for specifying payment process (ie. paypal, credit card,\nfree, upload a song), and make the whole interface as slick and easy as\niTunes'.\n<br><br>\nThe real trick I see in this, though, is to make the file format for music\nvendors fairly easy yet flexible.  It should be as easy or easier than an\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feed for a blog.  Let a hundred of these mushrooms bloom, aggregate, \nsearch, and buy.  Make it distributed and not dependant on any particular\nmusic company or technology company.\n<br><br>\nNot a terribly original idea, but that's what I just thought of.

I love Java, and\nloved cobbling together funky applets 5 years or so ago, but Flash\nmakes me want to toy with rich client-side apps again.\n<br><br>\nAnd then, there's this\n<a href=\"http://sonyelectronics.sonystyle.com/micros/clie/models/tg50.html\" target=\"_top\">Sony Clie PEG-TG50</a>\nhandheld I've recently started pining for, and it appears to run a\nFlash 5 player.

Or, at least,\nI'd love to see more stories from the same setting or playing with the\nsame themes of the Bitchun Society.  I have seen some of these things\nin stories before, though.  So, hey, I haven't posted anything here in\na few days - have some babble and book links (feel free to comment and\nleave some more links):\n<br><br>\nOf course I love the notion of ubiquitous computing and personal\nHUD's.  I've babbled about that at length for sure.  If you want more\nof that, go check out Vernor Vinge's\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312875843/0xdecafbad-20\" target=\"_top\">Fast Times at Fairmont High</a>.\nMediated reality with P2P computing woven into clothing and projected\nacross contact lens displays.  A little less obtrusive than\nseisure-inducing in-brain electronics, but just as post-human.\n<br><br>\nAnd then there's backup-and-restore and the cure for death.

What could change human nature more than transcending\nmortality?\n<br><br>\nAs for deadheading, check out Vinge's\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671720988/0xdecafbad-20\" target=\"_top\">Across Realtime</a>\nseries.  In\nparticular, read up on bobbling in Marooned in Realtime.  There's also\nOrson Scott Card's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812533313/0xdecafbad-20\" target=\"_top\">The Worthing Saga</a>.\nA one-way trip into the far future\nthrough geological periods of time seems particularly external to\nknown human experience, especially when combined with immortality.\n<br><br>\nOne thing I've yet to see much in stories or speculations is how\nsociety could function in a post-mortality and post-scarcity\nconditions.  I've never been satisfied with the way Star Trek dodges\nthe day-to-day realities of a post-capitalistic Federation of plenty.\nWalter Jon Williams' <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312851723/0xdecafbad-20\" target=\"_top\">Aristoi</a>\nexplores an interesting track with a\nmeritocratic society whose top members have godlike powers matched to\ngodlike creativity and self-possession (not to mention possession by\nmultiple selves).\n<br><br>\nBut so far, Whuffie and its currency in reputation is the best game\nI've seen yet.  Since, even if the problems of mortality and material\nscarcity are solved, human attention and cooperation will never be\ngratis.  So, how else do you herd the cats when you can neither\nthreaten nor reward them via any physical means?  Seems like the\nblogosphere, gift culture, and open source noosphere brought to\nreality.\n<br><br>\nKinda makes me want to get back to fiction writing meself and finally\nget out the dozen or so stories I've had bouncing around in my head\nthese past years.  Doesn't necessarily mean I'd churn out anything\ngood, but who knows?  Maybe after some work and some stumbling I could\nproduce something passable.  All those creative writing classes in\ncollege and short stories in spiral-bound notebooks from high school\nhave to count for something.  I'd even love to squat in the Bitchun\nSociety for a few stories, but that might be a bit presumptuous, even though\nMr. Doctorow himself <a href=\"http://www.craphound.com/down/archives/2003_01.php#000054\" target=\"_top\">has let on</a>\nthat he's not likely to write more\ntales from the same Bitchun universe.\nBetter to get some practice in before jamming in someone else's club.</p>\n",

It works, isn't\nall that hard to grasp, and has gotten adopted quickly.  There's momentum there.  As \n<a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/04/15#noWaitForTools\" target=\"_top\">Dave says</a>, there is no wait for\ntools.\n<br><br>\nSo, now there's also <a href=\"http://oml.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_top\">OML</a> starting.  Hopefully this won't become another rehash of the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> fight.<br>Because, I sense many similar issues between the two.  Maybe it would have been better still if OML had been named something\ncompletely avoiding the letters O, P, M, or L.  I already see mailing list charters being called out in order to quiet unwanted\ndiscussion of fundamentals, but, hopefully we can avoid anyone claiming that they have the One True Format, all fighting for the\nsame name and slapping each other around with version numbers.  Gah.\n<br><br>\nAnyway.  I like OML but see some grunge in it as well.  At the moment, I'm using an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML\">OPML</a>-supporting tool. I can't imagine that\nconversion would be more than an XSLT file away.  Well, maybe more than that.  Beyond that, let's agree to disagree and viva le\nfork.  Let the best, most demonstratably capable format win.  Meanwhile, I'm still considering that Tinderbox license to see if I\nmight like multi-dimensional outlining...</p>\n",

    "summary": "<p>Been out of touch with my usual online haunts as of late, and have barely had time to think straight,\nlet alone write. \n<br><br>\nMy girlfriend and I have moved just from one end of town to the other, and we have an overlapping\nmonth of leases between the new place and old.  In theory, this is plenty of time to accomplish moving\nand cleaning and decorating.  But, some things are hard to move gradually, especially when both she\nand I have compact cars and trucks rent by the hour.  And then there's the fact that our new residence\nis found on the third floor, providing much exercise to the both of us.  So, it's been a hectic couple\nof weeks so far, though well worth it for us to start settling down in new and improved digs.\n<br><br>\nAnd then, right in the middle of things, I was offered an opportunity for a few months' work as a\ncontractor for a startup located almost (but not quite) within walking distance of the new apartment. \nSo, I decided to snatch that up, and since then things have been doubly busy.  Whew.  This'll give me\nsome breathing room to figure out what's next, hopefully.\n<br><br>\nSo anyway, here's hoping things settle down a bit and stop feeling like I've jumped the tracks.  After\ngetting life in general into some semblance of happy chaos, I hope to get a chance to catch up on\nhappenings and maybe even take a stab at some of my projects around here again.</p>\n",
