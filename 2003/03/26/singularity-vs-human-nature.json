But as with the second essay, I think we&apos;ve outpaced\nevolution in terms of changing the conditions under which the process\nitself occurs.\n<br><br>\nJust look around you.  You&apos;re likely indoors, in a building composed\nof simple straight lines which register easily on your visual pattern\nrecognizers, with corridors and doorways and rooms proportioned to\nyour bodily dimensions.  The air is conditioned to your respiratory\nand temperature tolerances.  Things are padded and accessible.  Food\nand drink are likely plentiful.

Only now, we&apos;ve jumped the\ntracks, reversed the flow of control, and have reshaped our corner of\nthe universe to fit our status quo.  So, where does that leave the\nnatural process of evolution with regard to us?  Stopped or slowed to\na crawl, that&apos;s where.  Maybe falling backward, since we have\nprosthetics, glasses, and other forms of propping up imperfections\nthat would have otherwise been faced with disincentives by natural\nselection.\n<br><br>\nSo, where are we without a natural evolution?  We&apos;re left as an\nunfinished species, with a peculiar mix of awesome abilities matched\nwith amazing disabilities.  Very clever people, but with a lot of\nblind spots.  There are certain ways in which it is very difficult and\nsometimes nearly impossible for us to think.  We have biases toward\ngrouping things by similarity, dividing them by difference - which\nallows for a very elegant economy of memory and thought, but allows\nfor peculiarly devastating things like racism and xenophobia.\nCritical thinking is counterintuitive, yet is one of our most powerful\ntools.\n<br><br>\nAnd there are definite flaws in our perceptions of reality, as any\nbook of optical illusions will tell you.

I can&apos;t find a reference to back\nme up, so this is just from memory: I was taught that flies have\ndeveloped a particularly zig-zaggy and erratic flight pattern to evade\njust our kind of mammalian vision system.  But, studies of fly-eating\nfrogs have shown that their vision systems appear particularly tweaked\nto react to a fly&apos;s midair dance.  Imagine what else slips past us, or\ncomes to our attention garbled because our very apparatus contains\nbiases of which we&apos;re yet to even conceive?\n<br><br>\nHere we are, then, flawed and incomplete yet with a growing ability to\nself-modify.  As an amateur computer scientist, I shudder a bit at any\ncode that&apos;s self-modifying.  It can be done, and it can be powerfully\nenabling, but it&apos;s just so damn easy to blow a foot off with the\ntechnique.  So too with ourselves, then.  There&apos;s a possiblity that we\ncan push ourselves into a richer level of thought and perception and\nability without destroying ourselves completely.  But, we&apos;re going to\nmiss things, important things.\n<br><br>\nIf we&apos;re lucky, we&apos;ll roll with it and survive.  But, as the second\nDisenchanted essay explores, we&apos;ll most certainly render the species\nas we know it extinct, and push ourselves our of a natural niche and\ninto a wholly artificial niche in need of perpetual maintenance and\nrenewal.  Maybe this artifical niche will be easily sustained and\nportable enough to take with us if we want to leave the planet.  On\nthe other hand, maybe this artificial niche will prove our undoing as\nit outstrips our ability to keep it up.\n<br><br>\nSo, given all this, I think the inevitable predicted verticality of\nthe Singularity&apos;s curve has an incredibly strong counter-force\nstemming from human nature itself.
