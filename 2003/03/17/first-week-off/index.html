Last week was strange.  Having been let go on a Friday, I had a
weekend to pretend things were all as usual.  But, when Monday hit,
things were different.  I still got up at the usual time, did the
usual morning things, and got out of the apartment as if I were going
to work.  But instead of heading for the highway, I headed for a
<a href="http://www.espresso-royale.com/locations_detail.cfm?state=Michigan" target="_top">coffee shop</a>

<div class="content">Good luck. Did you at least get a severance package (e.g. 2 weeks&#39; pay and unused vacation time)?
If it makes you feel any better, I have a friend who didn&#39;t get paid for a month (first pay period, they claimed there was &quot;a problem with the bank&quot; that they were working out; second one, they said money was tight and they were looking for funding). So he got left with nothing, except being towards the end of a long line of creditors. Ugh.</div>

<div class="content">Actually, they gave me a very decent severance package.  Not enough for me to take any European vacations (heh, heh), but enough to turn my job search panic level down a few notches.  So things could be <em>much</em> worse.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry to hear about the job. I recently got laid off too. Same old thing, compaby got bought out and they didn&#39;t need all our staff. Regarding .NET, I&#39;m also learning it. I&#39;d be curious to know your thoughts on it after a week or two of tinkering with it. I look forward to reading your future posts.
Oh, and regarding Metroid Prime... I can see how you could easily kill six hours on it. When I rented it, initially I didn&#39;t stop for 7 or 8. Very good game. :)</div>
