So he got left with nothing, except being towards the end of a long line of creditors.

I recently got laid off too. Same old thing, compaby got bought out and they didn&#39;t need all our staff. Regarding .NET, I&#39;m also learning it. I&#39;d be curious to know your thoughts on it after a week or two of tinkering with it. I look forward to reading your future posts.\n\nOh, and regarding Metroid Prime... I can see how you could easily kill six hours on it. When I rented it, initially I didn&#39;t stop for 7 or 8.
