Source:GBAx.com review of the GP32







Just read a review of the GP32,
a handheld game console I&#39;d never heard of before.
Pictures of it look amazing,
and the specs aren&#39;t too shabby either.  Powerful enough to run
emulators of a sickening array of game platforms, uses ?SmartMedia
cards, support wireless multiplayer via cell phone.  And, oh yeah, it
looks like you can actually see the screen.
The biggest flaw I see in this thing is that it would be so easy to
pirate games for it.  Supposedly there were some attempts to provide
for a mechanism to &quot;lock&quot; games to a particular handheld, but that
appears to already have been circumvented.  So, while the thing looks
like a dream machine to me, it probably looks like a nightmare to game
producers.
Still, though, I want one.  And I bet Russell Beattie wouldn&#39;t mind
one either, if he hasn&#39;t heard about it yet, given his
professed love for his GameBoy Advance.
And, speaking of Russell, I wonder just how well that wireless
multiplayer support works..." />
