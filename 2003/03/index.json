The problem-solving intelligence part can be tuned and revved up to high levels, but it becomes unstable like early supersonic jet prototypes that shook themselves to pieces just after reaching the sound barrier. Nature has outstripped itself, producing a freak organism with a feature that's obscenely over-developed but under-refined. We've seen examples of evolution getting ahead of itself before, like the rapid conversion to an erect, bipedal skeletal frame without properly modifying the spine to withstand the back-aching load of pregnancy. To get a better grip of human failings, and human stupidity, you have to realize that modern Homo sapiens sapiens just isn't done yet.</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/humanity/brainbuilder.html?id=8Mir9Pz5\">Disenchanted: * Early prototype, expect instability</a></cite></small></div>\n<blockquote cite=\"http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/technology/mediated.html?id=AtW2JdUp\">When our own instincts are inadequate, or become a hazard, and the surrogate activities to control them aren't sufficient anymore, then there certainly will be a push to change human nature to fit his new, self-crafted niche.

Homo sapien will die, and homo modified will inherit the earth.</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/technology/mediated.html?id=AtW2JdUp\">Disenchanted: Invent this and die</a></cite></small></div>\n<br><br>\nThere's only an essay or two per month published over at Disenchanted,\nbut they're gems, each and every one.  And what I read almost never\nfails to resonate with something I've been thinking or musing about,\nfrom my perspective as a geek wondering about life, the universe, and\neverything and as a fan of Kurzweil, Vinge, and all of post-humanity.\nBut my anticipation of the Singularity is constantly swayed by things\nsuch as the theses of the above quoted essays.\n<br><br>\nSee, as an irredeemable believer in the ways of better living through\ntechnology, I look forward to our increasing ability to further\nself-improve and bootstrap to higher levels of living, longevity,\nability, understanding, and exploration.  But, there's a neopagan\nmystic and naturalist in me who keeps looking for the catch.  There\nmust be natural limits we don't yet understand.\n<br><br>\nNo matter the precocious cleverness of our species, there's got to be\nplenty of good reasons it takes millions of years to achieve progress\nin forms and patterns of life.  There are lots of little subtle\ndetails to be easily missed.  We're smart, but not yet endowed with\nthe patience and wisdom that eternity grants.  I both breathlessly\nawait and fear the arrival of our ability to fundamentally change\nhuman nature directly through genetic manipulation and device\nimplantation.\n<br><br>\nAs the first essay quoted above asserts, I believe the human species\nis unfinished.  But as with the second essay, I think we've outpaced\nevolution in terms of changing the conditions under which the process\nitself occurs.\n<br><br>\nJust look around you.  You're likely indoors, in a building composed\nof simple straight lines which register easily on your visual pattern\nrecognizers, with corridors and doorways and rooms proportioned to\nyour bodily dimensions.  The air is conditioned to your respiratory\nand temperature tolerances.  Things are padded and accessible.  Food\nand drink are likely plentiful.  The only predators you're likely to\nmeet up with during your day are of your own species.  Nothing really\nchallenges your basic nature.\n<br><br>\nYet, this is just what the universe has been doing to forms of life\nthroughout the history of evolution.  Only now, we've jumped the\ntracks, reversed the flow of control, and have reshaped our corner of\nthe universe to fit our status quo.  So, where does that leave the\nnatural process of evolution with regard to us?  Stopped or slowed to\na crawl, that's where.  Maybe falling backward, since we have\nprosthetics, glasses, and other forms of propping up imperfections\nthat would have otherwise been faced with disincentives by natural\nselection.\n<br><br>\nSo, where are we without a natural evolution?  We're left as an\nunfinished species, with a peculiar mix of awesome abilities matched\nwith amazing disabilities.  Very clever people, but with a lot of\nblind spots.  There are certain ways in which it is very difficult and\nsometimes nearly impossible for us to think.  We have biases toward\ngrouping things by similarity, dividing them by difference - which\nallows for a very elegant economy of memory and thought, but allows\nfor peculiarly devastating things like racism and xenophobia.\nCritical thinking is counterintuitive, yet is one of our most powerful\ntools.\n<br><br>\nAnd there are definite flaws in our perceptions of reality, as any\nbook of optical illusions will tell you.  One thing that struck me\nlike a thunderbolt came from a human biology class: Ever try following\na common housefly with your eyes?  Isn't it frustrating how it just\nseems to <strong>vanish</strong> from your sight?  I can't find a reference to back\nme up, so this is just from memory: I was taught that flies have\ndeveloped a particularly zig-zaggy and erratic flight pattern to evade\njust our kind of mammalian vision system.  But, studies of fly-eating\nfrogs have shown that their vision systems appear particularly tweaked\nto react to a fly's midair dance.  Imagine what else slips past us, or\ncomes to our attention garbled because our very apparatus contains\nbiases of which we're yet to even conceive?\n<br><br>\nHere we are, then, flawed and incomplete yet with a growing ability to\nself-modify.  As an amateur computer scientist, I shudder a bit at any\ncode that's self-modifying.  It can be done, and it can be powerfully\nenabling, but it's just so damn easy to blow a foot off with the\ntechnique.  So too with ourselves, then.  There's a possiblity that we\ncan push ourselves into a richer level of thought and perception and\nability without destroying ourselves completely.  But, we're going to\nmiss things, important things.\n<br><br>\nIf we're lucky, we'll roll with it and survive.  But, as the second\nDisenchanted essay explores, we'll most certainly render the species\nas we know it extinct, and push ourselves our of a natural niche and\ninto a wholly artificial niche in need of perpetual maintenance and\nrenewal.  Maybe this artifical niche will be easily sustained and\nportable enough to take with us if we want to leave the planet.  On\nthe other hand, maybe this artificial niche will prove our undoing as\nit outstrips our ability to keep it up.\n<br><br>\nSo, given all this, I think the inevitable predicted verticality of\nthe Singularity's curve has an incredibly strong counter-force\nstemming from human nature itself.  What does this mean?  Not sure.\nWhat to do?  Not sure.  But it tells me that the Kurzweilan and\nVingian predictions of which I'm so fond face some severe reality\nchecks.\n<br><br>\nMore thinking to do.  Thanks to Disenchanted for making me think this\nfar today.  :)\n",

I'd meant to revise my initial\npost announcing my being laid of - but instead, I simply lost it\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/misc/thirsty_ibook.html\" target=\"_top\">when the iBook got doused</a>.\n<br><br>\nSo, to those of you who haven't heard my news: I was laid off a little\nover a week and a weekend ago.  No hard feelings or fireworks, just\ntypical bad economy reasons.  Nevertheless, it took me by surprise.\nSo now I'm shopping my resume around.\n<br><br>\nIf you're interested, my resume is available here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2003/03/l-m-orchard-resume.doc\" target=\"_top\">http://www.decafbad.com/2003/03/l-m-orchard-resume.doc</a>\n</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2003/03/l-m-orchard-resume.pdf\" target=\"_top\">http://www.decafbad.com/2003/03/l-m-orchard-resume.pdf</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br><br>\nLast week was strange.  Having been let go on a Friday, I had a\nweekend to pretend things were all as usual.  But, when Monday hit,\nthings were different.  I still got up at the usual time, did the\nusual morning things, and got out of the apartment as if I were going\nto work.  But instead of heading for the highway, I headed for a\n<a href=\"http://www.espresso-royale.com/locations_detail.cfm?state=Michigan\" target=\"_top\">coffee shop</a>\nnear campus with wireless internet.  Trying to keep the old\npatterns as normal as possible, only now my job is finding a job and\ngetting myself in shape for what's out there.\n<br><br>\nIt wouldn't be news to anyone to hear that the job market, at least\nwhat I've seen of it so far, is nothing like the verdant plains and\nvalleys of even 3 years ago - which is about the last time I took a\nserious look.  After a first survey of a few job boards online, I\nfired off a handful of resumes and apps, and took notes on what's\nbeing asked for so as to prepare some semblance of a learning plan\nwhile I'm off.\n<br><br>\nSo by the end of last week, I'd accomplished these various and sundry\nthings:\n<ul>\n<li> 5 cups of coffee consumed per day\n</li>\n<li> 1 resume updated and revised\n</li>\n<li> 6 resumes emailed and 4 online applications filled\n</li>\n<li> 5 profiles completed at online recruiting sites\n</li>\n<li> 1 application for unemployment filed\n</li>\n<li> 1 12\" G4 <span style=\"background : #FFFFCE;\"><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/PowerBook?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">PowerBook</font></span> acquired and configured\n</li>\n<li> 3 Microsoft operating systems installed and configured under Virtual PC\n</li>\n<li> 1 .NET Framework installed and exploration begun\n</li>\n<li> 1 novel finished, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0872863328/103-7733542-0669406?vi=glance\" target=\"_top\">Close to the Machine</a> by Ellen Ullman\n</li>\n<li> 6 hours of Metroid Prime played\n</li>\n</ul>\nThere's been more, but it's the amount of Metroid Prime play I'm most\nproud of - had I not gotten out of the apartment in the morning, the\nhours invested in that would have been immensely greater.  Maybe after\nI've fired off a few more resumes, I'll feel better about actually\ntaking a rest since my brane's been going full speed for months now at\nwork.\n<br><br>\nThought a bit about striking out on my own with freelance work, but\nthe Ellen Ullman book has given me a bit of a strange mood.  She makes\nworking for oneself sound both promising and desolate at once - though\nthe promising bits would seem to be the things that disappeared with\nthe 90's.  So that leaves it sounding pretty unpalatable.  Who knows,\nthough - I always wanted to work from (but not at) a coffee shop.  \n<br><br>\nWell, back to searching and my first baby steps with .NET - wish me\nluck.  And if you happen to be in town, stop by and say haloo.\n",

    "summary": "<p>So <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooodh.html\" target=\"_top\">on this day last year</a>,\nI was excitely thinking about pipelining webservices together like commands in a\nUNIX command line shell.  Lately, I've been doing quite a bit of work at the\ncommand line level, more so than I ever have before.  And for all the clunkiness\nand inelegances to be found there, I think the zen has stuck me.\n<br><br>\nSure, it's an ass-ugly string of characters that connects commands\nlike find, sort, awk, sed, grep, and ssh together.  But, in constructing such\nmonstrosities, I find myself generating new disposable tools at a rate\nof at least one every minute or so.  And, though a few have found themselves graduating\ninto fuller, cleaner, more general tools, I would have been stuck for\nhours were it not for a quick multi-file grep across a vast plain of comma-separated\nvalue files digested by a tag team of sed and awk.  Then, like magic, I toss in\nan incredibly slow yet, at the time, convenient call to mysql on another server\nbehind a firewall via ssh with a SQL call constructed from the regurgitations\nof said sed and awk brothers.\n<br><br>\nSo, I'm thinking again:  How hot would this be if it were web services replacing\neach of my commands?  How hot would it be if there was a STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR\nfor a whole class of web services?  Imagine an enhanced bash or zsh piping these\nbeasts together.  For awhile, I thought my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XmlRpcFilteringPipe</a> API was the way to\ngo, but lately I've been thinking more in the direction of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST\">REST</a>.  I have to admit\nthat the XML-RPC API is a bit clunky to use, and besides, no one's really paid\nit much notice besides using it in the peculiar fashion I do to make my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki\">WeblogWithWiki</a>.\n<br><br>\nHow about this for a simpler API:  Post data to a URL, receive data in response.\nThere's your STDIN and STDOUT.  What about STDERR?  Well, I suppose it's an\neither-or affair, but standard HTTP header error codes can fill in there.  What\nabout command line arguments?  Use query parameters on the URL to which you're\nposting.  This all seems very web-natural.\n<br><br>\nNow I just have to write a shell that treats URLs as executable commands.</p>\n",
