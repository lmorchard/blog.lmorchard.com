<div class="content">The RSS feeds seem somewhat borked, the index one points to all 404&#39;s (permalinks are also wrong on comment pages) and contains an extra &#39;items&#39; element, while the e.g. the &quot;links&quot; feed contains waaayyy too many nested items/rdf:Seq...
Other than that, it looks really nice!</div>
