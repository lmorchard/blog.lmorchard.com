And, of course, Google doesn&amp;apos;t help me much except to point me at all sorts of pages saying that BSF supports scripting languages &quot;like Python and Perl&quot;, but without actually showing me the Perl money. Well, if not, I have a horribly hackish and inefficient idea that might just work, involving either pipes or sockets to external perl daemons and extreme abuse of perl&amp;apos;s AUTOLOAD and Java&amp;apos;s reflection to build proxy objects.  Yeah, yeah, someone could maybe embed Perl in a JNI-ish thing, but I&amp;apos;m not at the level of wizardry to be mucking about with Perl guts - nor do I want to be.  But, I think this idea of mine just might work. Why bother?  Because it&amp;apos;s depraved and possibly very fun. " />
