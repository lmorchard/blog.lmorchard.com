Cool!  Hope it actually works for him.</p>\n<p>Currently it's very big, because it's got everything in it, all the JARs and the kitchen sink from everything I thought I'd start using at some point.  My actual original code is likely less than 100k so far, if that.  Suggestions are <strong>more</strong> than welcome.  </p>\n<p>The same goes for the license - all I want out of this thing is to share it and get interested tinkerers tinkering.  It'd be nice if anyone who tinkers with it gets credit for said tinkering, but that's about all I care about.  Hell, if it gets incorporated into a commercial product, I'd like some credit, and some cash would be nice, but otherwise I'd just be flattered.  Is there a license to cover that?  Maybe I should research a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy\">ShareAndEnjoy</a> license.</p>\n<p>This first code dump is very much premature - I'm not even pretending that this deserves a version number.  It's more a conversation piece and an a tangible starting point to play with things I've been thinking.  It's 99% crap code that apparently works, at this point.  I fully expect it to get rewritten before it rates a version number.</p>\n<p>So... have at it.  Play with it, make fun of it, send me patches and abuse.</p>\n",
