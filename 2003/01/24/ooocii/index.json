If it does, I can't find it.  I've been playing around with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AppleScript\">AppleScript</a> folder actions, <a href=\"http://interconnected.org/notes/2003/01/Lazy_MacOSX_Weblogging_1.shtml\" target=\"_top\">Matt Webb's link blogging folder hack</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.webentourage.com/blogscript.php\" target=\"_top\">BlogScript</a>.  I've been thinking, for good or bad, I'd like to do more link blogging.  Well, in Safari, I've created a toolbar bookmark folder called \"READ/BLOG QUEUE\" into which I drop links for later reading and/or blogging.</p>\n<p>So...  If I could get at that bookmark folder via <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AppleScript\">AppleScript</a>, I could schedule and generate a templated blog entry for auto-posting every night, listing just the links I've left in that bookmark folder, and clear it out when it's all done.  I <strong>could</strong> do the same thing with just a Folder Action enabled desktop folder, but it's just so much more convenient to drop things on the toolbar.</p>\n<p>And then, there's the other wild idea I'd use scriptable bookmarks for:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> aggregation.
