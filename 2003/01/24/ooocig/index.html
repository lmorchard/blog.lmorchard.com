Neat!  Now...  can we do something about making access to those services a bit more prominent?  System-wide functions buried in a menu obscurely labeled &quot;Services&quot; under an app-specific menu label doesn&#39;t seem very inviting or intuitive.  AppleScript gets insanely better treatment than this.  I&#39;d like to see these services pushed just as far forward, and more easily discoverable.  It&#39;s been awhile since I played in Cocoa, but for awhile I was wondering if rearrange things a bit, maybe pull the service items for the currently active app into a menu extra or something.  Or, at least pull the menu up a level, maybe stick it next to the &quot;Script&quot; where appropriate.  And, I&#39;d love to be able to customize the keyboard shortcuts assigned to them - some have shortcuts and I&#39;ll rarely use them, while others have no shortcut and I wish I could use them all the time.
It&#39;s good stuff, Apple, show it off." />

<div class="content">Hey, if you want to do a cocoa project to make services more visible, you might want to take a look at one of my old projects - I called it Self Service. http://disco.ucsd.edu/blog/computers/apps/SelfService 
The idea was to make Services into floating windows that you could drag and drop to. It works fine, but I keep forgetting to use it. (And Safari doesn't have a service)
If you want the code, just ask.</div>
