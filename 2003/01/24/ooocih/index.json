With no more than 5 lines of code, I've tossed a live interactive shell into my running proxy, into which I can telnet or access via Java console in a browser.  With this, I can get into the machinery before I take the time composing a UI, inserting/removing plugins at will, tossing together new proxy filters on the fly, composing RDQL queries adhoc, tweaking Lucene searches.</p>\n<p>Fun stuff, and so easy.  But, sorry, no further code from me yet.  It's very ugly, and barely works, but it's just a sketchpad at the moment.  I hope to have a little something before the end of the month to pass around, should anyone still be interested.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooocih\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086319\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.a1e1blog.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e1dd9659ab197d276c87cc80116f73e0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.a1e1blog.com\">Ewan Grantham</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086319\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-01-24T14:46:23\">2003-01-24T14:46:23</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Consider me to still be interested and looking forward to testing the personal proxy (though on a WinXP machine)...</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
