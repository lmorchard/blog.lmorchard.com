        <meta property="og:description" content="Dear Operating System Vendors. 
I no longer want to know where my files are stored. I no longer care. I have hordes of directories on my various computers called stuff ,downloads and documents , and the effort that it would take to organise them into a proper heirarchy is just not worth it. The heirarchical filesystem is a really wonderful thing for programmers and websites, but it just doesn&#39;t cut it for personal use. 
I no longer care where my files are stored. Source:The Fishbowl: Filesystem sacrilege.
I&#39;ll be burned at the next stake over from Charles when the time comes, for this filesystem heresy.  Just the other night, a co-worker was asking me about how diligent I was in organizing my email.  I told her, &quot;Not at all.  I leave it all in one pile and then run the Find command on it later.&quot;  She was shocked that I, alpha geek and info freako, didn&#39;t have some intricate taxonomy of folders into which mail was sorted by carefully crafted filters.
Years ago, when I first started using email, I did indeed do this with procmail and other arcane beasties.  Then, I found myself cursing that I couldn&#39;t do cross-folder searches very easily.  Also, the filters and folders started making less sense as their structure represented only one possible scheme for finding what I was looking for, and I was needing many possible kinds of schemes over time.  So, eventually it all ended up in one pile, and searches became my way of finding things.
I abandoned bookmarks for Google by the same principle.  Now, my bookmarks consist completely of bookmarklets and a few stray links to local on-disk pages like Python documentation.  In fact, I&#39;m wishing that I could create bookmark folders that are fed by Google API powered persistent searches.
So, now I&#39;m looking balefully upon my filesystem.  I haven&#39;t had much chance to play with BeOS, but I&#39;ve read about the design of the BeOS file system and drooled.  I hear about Microsoft&#39;s Longhorn and its WinFS and grind my teeth - I very much dislike Microsoft, but if they pulled this off, I&#39;d have to sing their praises.  Apple?  Do they have any aces up their sleeves in this regard?  Don&#39;t let a new fanboy down.  :)
Anyway, that&#39;s what I want to see:  Storage without explicit organization, but with super-rich metadata for super-fast searches.  Allow me to create views made from persistent searches - my &quot;project folder&quot; is simply a collection of resources tied together by a common tag, one of many.  And, if I want to form a project hierarchy, make my persistent searches into file objects too.  
The main thing in all this, though, is that it be woven very deeply within the OS.  I don&#39;t want a helper app.  I want this to replace the standard metaphor completely.

<div class="content">I share your annoyance with present file/filing systems!
The main change needed as I see it is to move the emphasis from bookmarks as locators to bookmarks as identifiers (of course somewhere around there needs to be a locator). Given this then it makes things like including the same item in many folders (/categories) easy and doesn't tie you to hierarchical systems.
One of the things I want my Ideagraph project (http://ideagraph.net) to be able to do is to maintain all this stuff in a friendlier (usable!) fashion. Ok, so it's layering on top of the OS but anything's got to be better than the organization Win (even Lin) gives you.</div>

P2P bookmark cluster searches would eliminate the lag of publishing in the associative link loop. Making us, collaboratively, an order of magnitude smarter by virtue of enhanced proximity.
