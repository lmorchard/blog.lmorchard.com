Don&amp;apos;t blame me for that, it comes with longevity and flow. The longer the site is around and the higher the flow, the more losers one attracts. I can see where these things work for a lower flow site, but they would never work for Scripting News, I&amp;apos;d have to turn it off quickly because of the low-roaders. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source:&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/01/19/aGlobalConversation#comments&quot;&gt;Dave Winer in comments on Simon Willison&amp;apos;s Weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;apos;m too lazy to search for the links at the moment, I&amp;apos;ve sung the praises to automatic trackback and referrers and friends.  Like Simon, I&amp;apos;ve also bemoaned the apparent lack of participation Dave has in this self-organizing chaos of blogs auto-discovering each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, Dave&amp;apos;s right.  Get too much flow, piss off too many people, say too many controversial or contrary things against too many camps - in other words, assert a strong opinion, right or wrong, and get it read widely enough and do it often enough - and your weblog will turn into a cesspool with all its graciously thrown open doors clogged with trolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, I&amp;apos;m safe.  My rating is Mostly Harmless, so all my open systems are mostly free from abuse.  But, the first time I really strike a nerve somewhere, I&amp;apos;m a sitting duck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;ve got some pretty pretentious ideas floating in my head about how this relates to an open civilization and culture in general, but I&amp;apos;ll save them.  Basically, I don&amp;apos;t want to give up my openness, but I want to deflect the barbarians.  Need to think more, but I suspect this may cross streams with the spam crisis, eventually.&lt;br&gt;
