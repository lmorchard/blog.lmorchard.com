Although I&#39;m too lazy to search for the links at the moment, I&#39;ve sung the praises to automatic trackback and referrers and friends.  Like Simon, I&#39;ve also bemoaned the apparent lack of participation Dave has in this self-organizing chaos of blogs auto-discovering each other.
But, Dave&#39;s right.  Get too much flow, piss off too many people, say too many controversial or contrary things against too many camps - in other words, assert a strong opinion, right or wrong, and get it read widely enough and do it often enough - and your weblog will turn into a cesspool with all its graciously thrown open doors clogged with trolls.
At present, I&#39;m safe.  My rating is Mostly Harmless, so all my open systems are mostly free from abuse.  But, the first time I really strike a nerve somewhere, I&#39;m a sitting duck.
I&#39;ve got some pretty pretentious ideas floating in my head about how this relates to an open civilization and culture in general, but I&#39;ll save them.  Basically, I don&#39;t want to give up my openness, but I want to deflect the barbarians.  Need to think more, but I suspect this may cross streams with the spam crisis, eventually." />
