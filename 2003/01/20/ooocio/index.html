  <meta property="og:description" content="If I did have comments on my weblog it would be like Slashdot, a very low signal to noise ratio. Don&amp;apos;t blame me for that, it comes with longevity and flow. The longer the site is around and the higher the flow, the more losers one attracts. I can see where these things work for a lower flow site, but they would never work for Scripting News, I&amp;apos;d have to turn it off quickly because of the low-roaders. Source:Dave Winer in comments on Simon Willison&amp;apos;s Weblog. Although I&amp;apos;m too lazy to search for the links at the moment, I&amp;apos;ve sung the praises to automatic trackback and referrers and friends.  Like Simon, I&amp;apos;ve also bemoaned the apparent lack of participation Dave has in this self-organizing chaos of blogs auto-discovering each other. But, Dave&amp;apos;s right.  Get too much flow, piss off too many people, say too many controversial or contrary things against too many camps - in other words, assert a strong opinion, right or wrong, and get it read widely enough and do it often enough - and your weblog will turn into a cesspool with all its graciously thrown open doors clogged with trolls. At present, I&amp;apos;m safe.  My rating is Mostly Harmless, so all my open systems are mostly free from abuse.  But, the first time I really strike a nerve somewhere, I&amp;apos;m a sitting duck. I&amp;apos;ve got some pretty pretentious ideas floating in my head about how this relates to an open civilization and culture in general, but I&amp;apos;ll save them.  Basically, I don&amp;apos;t want to give up my openness, but I want to deflect the barbarians.  Need to think more, but I suspect this may cross streams with the spam crisis, eventually.  " />
