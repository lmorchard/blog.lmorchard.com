Not wanting to suggest feature drift/bloat or anything, but a mail proxy would be nice too...</div>

<div class="content">I need to rename this project and stop referring to it as a Personal Web Proxy, though that&#39;s the first goal.  I want it to be a personal agent platform when it grows up, so a mail proxy would fall under that.
But, for now, one protocol at a time for me :)</div>

<div class="content">&quot;If this thing is to run on more than one platform, it can&#39;t rely on the facilities of any particular platform. So, all these lovely things I like OS X for are somewhat off limits.&quot;
Well... not necessarily... Taking another &quot;monster&quot; as an example, ZOE interacts with core Mac OS X services even if it&#39;s written in Java and cross-platform...
As somebody green famously said:
&quot;Software are like onions.&quot;
&quot;Layers! Onions have layers. Software have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers.&quot;
-- Shrek, 2001
ZOE integrates with Apple&#39;s system services. It uses Rendezvous directly. Integrates with Apple&#39;s Mail.app. And even the Finder itself.
So, not everything is lost ;-)
