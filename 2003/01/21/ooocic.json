Blogged photos and little multimedia clips don&#39;t have to be &quot;important&quot;, as long as they are in some way interesting.  The view out of your office window is probably the most boring thing in the world to you, but to someone who has never seen it before, it might be interesting.<br>\nI always get complaints about the frequency of cat pictures on snapclub.com but you gotta take the bad with the god.  :)</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221084893&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://stevenf.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f510366ec3ac7bf4a95992134b63fb68&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://stevenf.com/&quot;&gt;Steven Frank&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221084893&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-01-22T17:08:16&quot;&gt;2003-01-22T17:08:16&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;uh, &quot;good&quot;, not &quot;god&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
