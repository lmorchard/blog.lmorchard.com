Lots and lots of flexibility, easy to get started, and being built on top of amazing Log::Dispatch hierarchy was a stroke of genius that opens up lots of resources.  Can&#39;t wait until I have an excusre to use the fact that it can parse log4j config files transparently.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221088759&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.mmadsen.org/radioblog&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2fc977e82d9f8395a0f49e6f4958bc84&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.mmadsen.org/radioblog&quot;&gt;mark&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221088759&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-02-16T00:13:53&quot;&gt;2003-02-16T00:13:53&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve been using Log4perl as well, as a means of getitng common logging between our Perl and Java code bases.  It works really well, other than the fact that not all the layout formatting codes are yet implemented.  But with a little care, it&#39;s easily possible to have your Perl apps logging to the same places as your Java or J2EE based applications, which really improves the ability to debug and analyze systems which use both....&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
