I thought this was more a semi-clever <strong>overloading</strong> of the referer, rather than outright abuse.

From now on, hits from my copy of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> will leave behind a User-Agent string similar to this:</p>\n<p><code>\"AmphetaDesk/0.93 (darwin; http: //www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/; http: //www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml)\"</code></p>\n<p>I tack my own personal thanks URL onto the end of the list within the parenthesis.  In addition, I no longer send a referrer string when I download <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds.  How did I do it?  Very simply.</p>\n<p>First, I modify my <code>AmphetaDesk/data/mySettings.xml</code> file by hand to supply a blank referer and a new user URL (having some angle-bracket problems, bear with me):<blockquote><code><br />\n[user]<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... <br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[http_referer][/http_referer]<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[user_url]http://www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml[/user_url]<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />\n[/user]<br />\n</verbatim><br />\n</code></blockquote>Second, I modified <code>AmphetaDesk/lib/AmphetaDesk/Settings.pm</code> to account for the new setting:<blockquote><code>...<br />\n   $SETTINGS{user_http_referer}               = \"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\";<br />\n   $SETTINGS{user_user_url}                   = \"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\";<br />\n   $SETTINGS{user_link_target}                = \"_blank\";<br />\n...</code></blockquote>Third, I modified the <code>create_ua()</code> subroutine in <code>AmphetaDesk/lib/AmphetaDesk/WWW.pm</code> to actually use the new setting:<blockquote><code><br />\nsub create_ua {<br />\n...<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my $ua = new LWP::UserAgent; $ua->env_proxy();<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ua->timeout(get_setting(\"user_request_timeout\"));<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my ($app_v, $app_u, $app_o, $user_u) = (get_setting(\"app_version\"),<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get_setting(\"app_url\"), get_setting(\"app_os\"), get_setting(\"user_user_url\"));<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ua->agent(\"AmphetaDesk/$app_v ($app_o; $app_u; $user_u)\");<br />\n...<br />\n}<br />\n</code></blockquote>And voila - no more referer abuse.  If you want to discover my thank-you message, examine the User-Agent string.  Seems like this would be a good idea for all news aggregators to pick up.

According to the RFC link http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.43 the user agent request header \"contains information about the user agent originating the request\", specifically \"[t]he field can contain multiple product tokens [...] and comments identifying the agent and any subproducts which form a significant part of the user agent.\"\nThe url \"http://www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml\" doesn't really identify a product (the aggregator itself) or a subproduct (presumably libraries used by the aggregator, like the Python/Java runtime, the .NET Framework, PERL etc.)\nMy reading of the RFC might be incorrect, but I don't see anything about what was originally the whole point of this excersise - to provide feedback (no pun intended) to feed producers about who was reading them etc. - by providing links back to a specific user's weblog (or any kind of \"trail\" back to any other url-identifiable resource for that matter.)\nIn theory, I guess you could say that your subscriptions file (\"myChannels.opml\" or whatever it is called in your aggregator) is a part/subproduct of your aggregator since it provides the configuration settings about which feeds to download. So you could probably rename your configuration file to something that uniquely referred to your weblog (\"www.decafbad.com-daily-reading.opml\") and add that to your User-Agent header after the standard Amphetadesk header bits. A naming convention (like the old \"userWeblog=...\") that could be used across different weblogs would help feed producers *if* they had access to User-Agent header information.\nHowever, if the only objections against the current practice of overloading the referer header is that 1) user-agent information shouldn't be in the referer header, and 2) that \"[t]he Referer field MUST NOT be sent if the Request-URI was obtained from a source that does not have its own URI\", then we could just publish our subscription files on the web (so they have their own URIs) under a descriptive name (\"http://www.decafbad.com/feeds-i-subscribe-to.opml\") and use that as the (now legal) referer header? This would help feed producers who have access to Referer reports.\nI'm sure I'm missing something. Like the ultra-precisely defined header that identifies individual webloggers and/or their weblogs in a flexible, decentralized fashion. Seems like a good thing to have for a more two-way web and all that...</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085963\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ca174946a4c86dddda8106aa28f58ae1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Brian Lenihan</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085963\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-02-01T09:08:26\">2003-02-01T09:08:26</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">If you are a paranoid sysadmin type like me, you have a file of 1500 or so User Agents and rotate them, along with the referrer, et al, for every single Web transaction.\nIt makes this type of concern meaningless, or at least misguided.

According to the RFC link http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.43 the user agent request header \"contains information about the user agent originating the request\", specifically \"[t]he field can contain multiple product tokens [...] and comments identifying the agent and any subproducts which form a significant part of the user agent.\"\r\n\r\nThe url \"http://www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml\" doesn't really identify a product (the aggregator itself) or a subproduct (presumably libraries used by the aggregator, like the Python/Java runtime, the .NET Framework, PERL etc.)\r\n\r\nMy reading of the RFC might be incorrect, but I don't see anything about what was originally the whole point of this excersise - to provide feedback (no pun intended) to feed producers about who was reading them etc. - by providing links back to a specific user's weblog (or any kind of \"trail\" back to any other url-identifiable resource for that matter.)\r\n\r\nIn theory, I guess you could say that your subscriptions file (\"myChannels.opml\" or whatever it is called in your aggregator) is a part/subproduct of your aggregator since it provides the configuration settings about which feeds to download. So you could probably rename your configuration file to something that uniquely referred to your weblog (\"www.decafbad.com-daily-reading.opml\") and add that to your User-Agent header after the standard Amphetadesk header bits. A naming convention (like the old \"userWeblog=...\") that could be used across different weblogs would help feed producers *if* they had access to User-Agent header information.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the only objections against the current practice of overloading the referer header is that 1) user-agent information shouldn't be in the referer header, and 2) that \"[t]he Referer field MUST NOT be sent if the Request-URI was obtained from a source that does not have its own URI\", then we could just publish our subscription files on the web (so they have their own URIs) under a descriptive name (\"http://www.decafbad.com/feeds-i-subscribe-to.opml\") and use that as the (now legal) referer header? This would help feed producers who have access to Referer reports.\r\n\r\nI'm sure I'm missing something. Like the ultra-precisely defined header that identifies individual webloggers and/or their weblogs in a flexible, decentralized fashion. Seems like a good thing to have for a more two-way web and all that...</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085963\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ca174946a4c86dddda8106aa28f58ae1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Brian Lenihan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085963\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-02-01T09:08:26\">2003-02-01T09:08:26</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">If you are a paranoid sysadmin type like me, you have a file of 1500 or so User Agents and rotate them, along with the referrer, et al, for every single Web transaction.\r\n\r\nIt makes this type of concern meaningless, or at least misguided.

I thought this was more a semi-clever <strong>overloading</strong> of the referer, rather than outright abuse.  And this, I thought, was reasonably okay since there wasn&apos;t, I thought, anywhere else to stick a backlink to myself while consuming <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds.</p>\n<p>Well, yeah, now that I read some of the complaints against this use of referers, I agree.  And, yes, now that I read the fine RFC, I see that the User-Agent string is more appropriate for this purpose.</p>\n<p>So!  From now on, hits from my copy of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> will leave behind a User-Agent string similar to this:</p>\n<p><code>&quot;AmphetaDesk/0.93 (darwin; http: //www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/; http: //www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml)&quot;</code></p>\n<p>I tack my own personal thanks URL onto the end of the list within the parenthesis.  In addition, I no longer send a referrer string when I download <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds.  How did I do it?  Very simply.</p>\n<p>First, I modify my <code>AmphetaDesk/data/mySettings.xml</code> file by hand to supply a blank referer and a new user URL (having some angle-bracket problems, bear with me):</p><blockquote><code><br>\n[user]<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;... <br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;[http_referer][/http_referer]<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;[user_url]http://www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml[/user_url]<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;...<br>\n[/user]<br>\n<br>\n</code></blockquote>Second, I modified <code>AmphetaDesk/lib/AmphetaDesk/Settings.pm</code> to account for the new setting:<blockquote><code>...<br>\n   $SETTINGS{user_http_referer}               = &quot;http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/&quot;;<br>\n   $SETTINGS{user_user_url}                   = &quot;http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/&quot;;<br>\n   $SETTINGS{user_link_target}                = &quot;_blank&quot;;<br>\n...</code></blockquote>Third, I modified the <code>create_ua()</code> subroutine in <code>AmphetaDesk/lib/AmphetaDesk/WWW.pm</code> to actually use the new setting:<blockquote><code><br>\nsub create_ua {<br>\n...<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;my $ua = new LWP::UserAgent; $ua-&gt;env_proxy();<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;$ua-&gt;timeout(get_setting(&quot;user_request_timeout&quot;));<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;my ($app_v, $app_u, $app_o, $user_u) = (get_setting(&quot;app_version&quot;),<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;get_setting(&quot;app_url&quot;), get_setting(&quot;app_os&quot;), get_setting(&quot;user_user_url&quot;));<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;$ua-&gt;agent(&quot;AmphetaDesk/$app_v ($app_o; $app_u; $user_u)&quot;);<br>\n...<br>\n}<br>\n</code></blockquote>And voila - no more referer abuse.  If you want to discover my thank-you message, examine the User-Agent string.  Seems like this would be a good idea for all news aggregators to pick up.  And if I get ambitious and have spare time today, I&apos;ll be sending off a patch to <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/about/morbus.shtml\" target=\"_top\">Morbus</a> &amp; friends later today.<p></p>\n<p><b>Update</b>: Gagh!

It&apos;ll have a web server, a web proxy, telnet-able shell, scripting languages, scheduler, full text search and index engine, persistence &amp; metadata storage, and whatever else I can eventually think to toss in.  There are just so many nice toys for Java, and most are a snap to glue together.  But, I can&apos;t really use any of the toys that come with the OS itself.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s something <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000092.phtml#000092\" target=\"_top\">I&apos;ve rambled on about before</a>, as has <a href=\"http://udell.roninhouse.com/\" target=\"_top\">Jon Udell</a> in his old Byte column: <a href=\"http://udell.roninhouse.com/bytecols/2002-04-10.html\" target=\"_top\">Zope Lessons Learned</a>.

So, all these lovely things I like OS X for are somewhat off limits.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if I get tired of doing this thing in Java, I could always just finally embrace the platform and go straight for Cocoa.  :)  Yes, that would make for 3 environments tried, but hey - it&apos;s still fun for me!</p>\n",

I have hordes of directories on my various computers called stuff ,downloads and documents , and the effort that it would take to organise them into a proper heirarchy is just not worth it. The heirarchical filesystem is a really wonderful thing for programmers and websites, but it just doesn't cut it for personal use. </p>\n<p>I no longer care where my files are stored. </blockquote><div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001222.html\">The Fishbowl: Filesystem sacrilege</a></cite>.</small></div></p>\n<p>I'll be burned at the next stake over from Charles when the time comes, for this filesystem heresy.  Just the other night, a co-worker was asking me about how diligent I was in organizing my email.  I told her, \"Not at all.  I leave it all in one pile and then run the Find command on it later.\"  She was shocked that I, alpha geek and info freako, didn't have some intricate taxonomy of folders into which mail was sorted by carefully crafted filters.</p>\n<p>Years ago, when I first started using email, I did indeed do this with procmail and other arcane beasties.  Then, I found myself cursing that I couldn't do cross-folder searches very easily.  Also, the filters and folders started making less sense as their structure represented only one possible scheme for finding what I was looking for, and I was needing many possible kinds of schemes over time.  So, eventually it all ended up in one pile, and searches became my way of finding things.</p>\n<p>I abandoned bookmarks for Google by the same principle.  Now, my bookmarks consist completely of bookmarklets and a few stray links to local on-disk pages like Python documentation.  In fact, I'm wishing that I could create bookmark folders that are fed by Google API powered persistent searches.</p>\n<p>So, now I'm looking balefully upon my filesystem.  I haven't had much chance to play with BeOS, but I've read about <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558604979\" target=\"_top\">the design of the BeOS file system</a> and drooled.  I hear about <a href=\"http://www.winsupersite.com/faq/longhorn.asp\" target=\"_top\">Microsoft's Longhorn and its WinFS</a> and grind my teeth - I very much dislike Microsoft, but if they pulled this off, I'd have to sing their praises.  Apple?  Do they have any aces up their sleeves in this regard?  Don't let a new fanboy down.  :)</p>\n<p>Anyway, that's what I want to see:  Storage without explicit organization, but with super-rich metadata for super-fast searches.  Allow me to create views made from persistent searches - my \"project folder\" is simply a collection of resources tied together by a common tag, one of many.  And, if I want to form a project hierarchy, make my persistent searches into file objects too.  </p>\n<p>The main thing in all this, though, is that it be woven very deeply within the OS.  I don't want a helper app.  I want this to replace the standard metaphor completely.</p>\n<p>RDF triples at the inode-level anyone?  Heh, heh.</p>\n<!--more-->\nshortname=ooochg\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086231\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=07562a116db2503c602d3444d4ccbb54&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org\">Charles Miller</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086231\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-01-19T22:19:03\">2003-01-19T22:19:03</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">When BeOS went under, Apple hired their filesystem guy.

    "body": "<blockquote cite=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001222.html\">Dear Operating System Vendors. \r\n<p>I no longer want to know where my files are stored. I no longer care. I have hordes of directories on my various computers called stuff ,downloads and documents , and the effort that it would take to organise them into a proper heirarchy is just not worth it. The heirarchical filesystem is a really wonderful thing for programmers and websites, but it just doesn't cut it for personal use. </p>\r\n<p>I no longer care where my files are stored. </blockquote><div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001222.html\">The Fishbowl: Filesystem sacrilege</a></cite>.</small></div></p>\r\n<p>I'll be burned at the next stake over from Charles when the time comes, for this filesystem heresy.  Just the other night, a co-worker was asking me about how diligent I was in organizing my email.  I told her, \"Not at all.  I leave it all in one pile and then run the Find command on it later.\"  She was shocked that I, alpha geek and info freako, didn't have some intricate taxonomy of folders into which mail was sorted by carefully crafted filters.</p>\r\n<p>Years ago, when I first started using email, I did indeed do this with procmail and other arcane beasties.  Then, I found myself cursing that I couldn't do cross-folder searches very easily.  Also, the filters and folders started making less sense as their structure represented only one possible scheme for finding what I was looking for, and I was needing many possible kinds of schemes over time.  So, eventually it all ended up in one pile, and searches became my way of finding things.</p>\r\n<p>I abandoned bookmarks for Google by the same principle.  Now, my bookmarks consist completely of bookmarklets and a few stray links to local on-disk pages like Python documentation.  In fact, I'm wishing that I could create bookmark folders that are fed by Google API powered persistent searches.</p>\r\n<p>So, now I'm looking balefully upon my filesystem.  I haven't had much chance to play with BeOS, but I've read about <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558604979\" target=\"_top\">the design of the BeOS file system</a> and drooled.  I hear about <a href=\"http://www.winsupersite.com/faq/longhorn.asp\" target=\"_top\">Microsoft's Longhorn and its WinFS</a> and grind my teeth - I very much dislike Microsoft, but if they pulled this off, I'd have to sing their praises.  Apple?  Do they have any aces up their sleeves in this regard?  Don't let a new fanboy down.  :)</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, that's what I want to see:  Storage without explicit organization, but with super-rich metadata for super-fast searches.  Allow me to create views made from persistent searches - my \"project folder\" is simply a collection of resources tied together by a common tag, one of many.  And, if I want to form a project hierarchy, make my persistent searches into file objects too.  </p>\r\n<p>The main thing in all this, though, is that it be woven very deeply within the OS.  I don't want a helper app.  I want this to replace the standard metaphor completely.</p>\r\n<p>RDF triples at the inode-level anyone?  Heh, heh.</p>\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=ooochg\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086231\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=07562a116db2503c602d3444d4ccbb54&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org\">Charles Miller</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086231\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-01-19T22:19:03\">2003-01-19T22:19:03</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">When BeOS went under, Apple hired their filesystem guy.

    "summary": "<blockquote cite=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001222.html\">Dear Operating System Vendors. \n<p>I no longer want to know where my files are stored. I no longer care. I have hordes of directories on my various computers called stuff ,downloads and documents , and the effort that it would take to organise them into a proper heirarchy is just not worth it. The heirarchical filesystem is a really wonderful thing for programmers and websites, but it just doesn&apos;t cut it for personal use. </p>\n<p>I no longer care where my files are stored. </p></blockquote><div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001222.html\">The Fishbowl: Filesystem sacrilege</a></cite>.</small></div><p></p>\n<p>I&apos;ll be burned at the next stake over from Charles when the time comes, for this filesystem heresy.  Just the other night, a co-worker was asking me about how diligent I was in organizing my email.  I told her, &quot;Not at all.  I leave it all in one pile and then run the Find command on it later.&quot;  She was shocked that I, alpha geek and info freako, didn&apos;t have some intricate taxonomy of folders into which mail was sorted by carefully crafted filters.</p>\n<p>Years ago, when I first started using email, I did indeed do this with procmail and other arcane beasties.  Then, I found myself cursing that I couldn&apos;t do cross-folder searches very easily.  Also, the filters and folders started making less sense as their structure represented only one possible scheme for finding what I was looking for, and I was needing many possible kinds of schemes over time.  So, eventually it all ended up in one pile, and searches became my way of finding things.</p>\n<p>I abandoned bookmarks for Google by the same principle.  Now, my bookmarks consist completely of bookmarklets and a few stray links to local on-disk pages like Python documentation.  In fact, I&apos;m wishing that I could create bookmark folders that are fed by Google API powered persistent searches.</p>\n<p>So, now I&apos;m looking balefully upon my filesystem.  I haven&apos;t had much chance to play with BeOS, but I&apos;ve read about <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558604979\" target=\"_top\">the design of the BeOS file system</a> and drooled.  I hear about <a href=\"http://www.winsupersite.com/faq/longhorn.asp\" target=\"_top\">Microsoft&apos;s Longhorn and its WinFS</a> and grind my teeth - I very much dislike Microsoft, but if they pulled this off, I&apos;d have to sing their praises.  Apple?  Do they have any aces up their sleeves in this regard?  Don&apos;t let a new fanboy down.  :)</p>\n<p>Anyway, that&apos;s what I want to see:  Storage without explicit organization, but with super-rich metadata for super-fast searches.  Allow me to create views made from persistent searches - my &quot;project folder&quot; is simply a collection of resources tied together by a common tag, one of many.  And, if I want to form a project hierarchy, make my persistent searches into file objects too.  </p>\n<p>The main thing in all this, though, is that it be woven very deeply within the OS.  I don&apos;t want a helper app.  I want this to replace the standard metaphor completely.</p>\n<p>RDF triples at the inode-level anyone?  Heh, heh.</p>\n",

Seems like there&apos;s a lot to work with here, and I have a better vibe about it.\n<br><br>\nBesides that, Jena seems stronger than rdflib for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> support, and I&apos;m just biting at the bit to pour damn near everything at Apache Jakarta into this thing.  Also, I suspect I may be able to preserve the quick scripty hackability I want out of the this thing by using BSF and Jython, with some assembly and config in BML.\n<br><br>\nHmm.  Still tinkering.</p>\n",

And fast.  Mozilla&#39;s shipped with talkback, but Safari&#39;s got a bug submission button right up front.  And the fact that they <strong>did</strong> snub Mozilla for a dark horse like Konqueror seems a bit provocative (at least in techie / Open Source circles), and after all that talk of innovation I doubt that they&#39;re going to let it rest as-is or back down.  I expect lots of movement from here.  Think different and all that.  And, from my minuscule bits of Cocoa dev, I&#39;m looking forward to poking around with <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/WebCore?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">WebCore</font></span> and the <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/JavaScript?topicparent=Main.FilterData\"><b>?</b></a><font color=\"#0000FF\">JavaScript</font></span> framework.  Unless it&#39;s a complete disaster, I expect the building blocks of Safari to pop up in projects everywhere.\n<br /><br />\nThese things tell me to expect good things from Safari.  I hope Mozilla can keep up.  As for IE, well, I deleted that a long time ago.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ooocge</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089938\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://algorhythm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=546b2f1947278db93fa8f7c734876111&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://algorhythm.org/\">Shawn</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089938\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2003-01-08T03:43:51\">2003-01-08T03:43:51</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Right on.

    "summary": "<p>Okay, this is getting close to outstripping my enthusiasm and invoking my laziness:  Does anyone happen to have RDFLib and ZODB working under Mac OS X 10.2.3?  Have also tried compiling Redland and its Python and Java APIs, but that&apos;s not been a 100% success.  Or can someone recommend another decent <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> repository to play with under Python?  I&apos;ve had fun with Jena under Java, love using RDQL, and dig switching between <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MySQL\">MySQL</a> and BDB stores.\n<br><br>\nI want an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> repository I can integrate into my proxy experiments, currently implemented in Python.  I&apos;ve been very tempted to switch to Java, which I know better and have a better sense of tools available.  But I&apos;m still pulling for Python.  I suppose I <strong>could</strong> just go with an in-memory repository at first, but I don&apos;t want to stick with that.\n<br><br>\nI&apos;m still finishing up the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy\">PersonalWebProxy</a> notes and plan I&apos;ve been working on, but I&apos;ve still got an itch to play in code.  The next major thing I want to do is extract as much metadata as I can from every HTML page I visit and load the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> repository up with statements based on what I harvest.  Examples would include things like HTML title, visitation date, referring url, any meta tags, any autodiscovered <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF\">FOAF</a> URLs, and anything else I could eventually dig out.  Then, I want to amass some data and play with it.  I&apos;m thinking this could give me a kind of uber-history with which to work.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Update:</strong> Seems like I managed to get Python, RDFLib, and ZODB working, but I started completely from scratch and compiled everything from clean source.  I guess Apple&apos;s build of Python has more hiccups in it than just the Makefile thing.</p>\n",
