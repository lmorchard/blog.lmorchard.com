It would be nice if there was some sort of browser header the aggregator could send to identify itself instead of using the referrer field. Oh, that’s right, there is. It’s called User-Agent. \n<p>The user agent field is designed for browsers, robots, and other user agents to identify themselves to the Web server. You can even add additional information, like a contact URL or email address. I’d like to see aggregators start using it. <br>\n</p></blockquote><div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://kalsey.com/blog/2003/01/referral_abuse/index.html\">Kalsey Consulting Group: Referral Abuse</a></cite>.</small></div><p></p>\n<p>Hmm, being mostly a standards neophyte, I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000185.phtml#000185\" target=\"_top\">thought this was a great idea</a>, you know, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/NeatLikeDigitalWatches\">NeatLikeDigitalWatches</a>.  I thought this was more a semi-clever <strong>overloading</strong> of the referer, rather than outright abuse.  And this, I thought, was reasonably okay since there wasn't, I thought, anywhere else to stick a backlink to myself while consuming <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds.</p>\n<p>Well, yeah, now that I read some of the complaints against this use of referers, I agree.  And, yes, now that I read the fine RFC, I see that the User-Agent string is more appropriate for this purpose.</p>\n<p>So!  From now on, hits from my copy of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk\">AmphetaDesk</a> will leave behind a User-Agent string similar to this:</p>\n<p><code>\"AmphetaDesk/0.93 (darwin; http: //www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/; http: //www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml)\"</code></p>\n<p>I tack my own personal thanks URL onto the end of the list within the parenthesis.  In addition, I no longer send a referrer string when I download <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> feeds.  How did I do it?  Very simply.</p>\n<p>First, I modify my <code>AmphetaDesk/data/mySettings.xml</code> file by hand to supply a blank referer and a new user URL (having some angle-bracket problems, bear with me):</p><blockquote><code><br>\n[user]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... <br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[http_referer][/http_referer]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[user_url]http://www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml[/user_url]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>\n[/user]<br>\n<br>\n</code></blockquote>Second, I modified <code>AmphetaDesk/lib/AmphetaDesk/Settings.pm</code> to account for the new setting:<blockquote><code>...<br>\n   $SETTINGS{user_http_referer}               = \"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\";<br>\n   $SETTINGS{user_user_url}                   = \"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\";<br>\n   $SETTINGS{user_link_target}                = \"_blank\";<br>\n...</code></blockquote>Third, I modified the <code>create_ua()</code> subroutine in <code>AmphetaDesk/lib/AmphetaDesk/WWW.pm</code> to actually use the new setting:<blockquote><code><br>\nsub create_ua {<br>\n...<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my $ua = new LWP::UserAgent; $ua-&gt;env_proxy();<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ua-&gt;timeout(get_setting(\"user_request_timeout\"));<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my ($app_v, $app_u, $app_o, $user_u) = (get_setting(\"app_version\"),<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get_setting(\"app_url\"), get_setting(\"app_os\"), get_setting(\"user_user_url\"));<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ua-&gt;agent(\"AmphetaDesk/$app_v ($app_o; $app_u; $user_u)\");<br>\n...<br>\n}<br>\n</code></blockquote>And voila - no more referer abuse.  If you want to discover my thank-you message, examine the User-Agent string.  Seems like this would be a good idea for all news aggregators to pick up.  And if I get ambitious and have spare time today, I'll be sending off a patch to <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/about/morbus.shtml\" target=\"_top\">Morbus</a> &amp; friends later today.<p></p>\n<p><b>Update</b>: Gagh!  This has been the hardest post to try to format correctly within the fancy schmancy auto-formatting widgets I have piped together.  All apologies for content resembling garbage.  I think I'll use this excuse in the future whenever I write something completely daft.  (Which means I'll be using it a lot, most likely.)</p>\n",

I'd like to see these services pushed just as far forward, and more easily discoverable.  It's been awhile since I played in Cocoa, but for awhile I was wondering if rearrange things a bit, maybe pull the service items for the currently active app into a menu extra or something.  Or, at least pull the menu up a level, maybe stick it next to the \"Script\" where appropriate.  And, I'd love to be able to customize the keyboard shortcuts assigned to them - some have shortcuts and I'll rarely use them, while others have no shortcut and I wish I could use them all the time.</p>\n<p>It's good stuff, Apple, show it off.</p>\n",

Then, I found myself cursing that I couldn't do cross-folder searches very easily.  Also, the filters and folders started making less sense as their structure represented only one possible scheme for finding what I was looking for, and I was needing many possible kinds of schemes over time.  So, eventually it all ended up in one pile, and searches became my way of finding things.</p>\n<p>I abandoned bookmarks for Google by the same principle.  Now, my bookmarks consist completely of bookmarklets and a few stray links to local on-disk pages like Python documentation.  In fact, I'm wishing that I could create bookmark folders that are fed by Google API powered persistent searches.</p>\n<p>So, now I'm looking balefully upon my filesystem.  I haven't had much chance to play with BeOS, but I've read about <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558604979\" target=\"_top\">the design of the BeOS file system</a> and drooled.  I hear about <a href=\"http://www.winsupersite.com/faq/longhorn.asp\" target=\"_top\">Microsoft's Longhorn and its WinFS</a> and grind my teeth - I very much dislike Microsoft, but if they pulled this off, I'd have to sing their praises.  Apple?  Do they have any aces up their sleeves in this regard?  Don't let a new fanboy down.  :)</p>\n<p>Anyway, that's what I want to see:  Storage without explicit organization, but with super-rich metadata for super-fast searches.  Allow me to create views made from persistent searches - my \"project folder\" is simply a collection of resources tied together by a common tag, one of many.  And, if I want to form a project hierarchy, make my persistent searches into file objects too.  </p>\n<p>The main thing in all this, though, is that it be woven very deeply within the OS.  I don't want a helper app.  I want this to replace the standard metaphor completely.</p>\n<p>RDF triples at the inode-level anyone?  Heh, heh.</p>\n",

I've had fun with Jena under Java, love using RDQL, and dig switching between <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MySQL\">MySQL</a> and BDB stores.\n<br><br>\nI want an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> repository I can integrate into my proxy experiments, currently implemented in Python.  I've been very tempted to switch to Java, which I know better and have a better sense of tools available.  But I'm still pulling for Python.  I suppose I <strong>could</strong> just go with an in-memory repository at first, but I don't want to stick with that.\n<br><br>\nI'm still finishing up the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy\">PersonalWebProxy</a> notes and plan I've been working on, but I've still got an itch to play in code.  The next major thing I want to do is extract as much metadata as I can from every HTML page I visit and load the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> repository up with statements based on what I harvest.  Examples would include things like HTML title, visitation date, referring url, any meta tags, any autodiscovered <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF\">FOAF</a> URLs, and anything else I could eventually dig out.  Then, I want to amass some data and play with it.  I'm thinking this could give me a kind of uber-history with which to work.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Update:</strong> Seems like I managed to get Python, RDFLib, and ZODB working, but I started completely from scratch and compiled everything from clean source.  I guess Apple's build of Python has more hiccups in it than just the Makefile thing.</p>\n",
