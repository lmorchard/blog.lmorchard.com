    "summary": "Amen. I’ve always found it irritating that news aggregators insert their URL into the referrer field. ... It would be nice if there was some sort of browser header the aggregator could send to identify itself instead of using the referrer field. Oh, that’s right, there is. It’s called User-Agent. \nThe user agent field is designed for browsers, robots, and other user agents to identify themselves to the Web server. You can even add additional information, like a contact URL or email address. I’d like to see aggregators start using it. \nSource:Kalsey Consulting Group: Referral Abuse.\nHmm, being mostly a standards neophyte, I thought this was a great idea, you know, NeatLikeDigitalWatches.  I thought this was more a semi-clever overloading of the referer, rather than outright abuse.  And this, I thought, was reasonably okay since there wasn't, I thought, anywhere else to stick a backlink to myself while consuming RSS feeds.\nWell, yeah, now that I read some of the complaints against this use of referers, I agree.  And, yes, now that I read the fine RFC, I see that the User-Agent string is more appropriate for this purpose.\nSo!  From now on, hits from my copy of AmphetaDesk will leave behind a User-Agent string similar to this:\n\"AmphetaDesk/0.93 (darwin; http: //www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/; http: //www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml)\"\nI tack my own personal thanks URL onto the end of the list within the parenthesis.  In addition, I no longer send a referrer string when I download RSS feeds.  How did I do it?  Very simply.\nFirst, I modify my AmphetaDesk/data/mySettings.xml file by hand to supply a blank referer and a new user URL (having some angle-bracket problems, bear with me):\n[user]\n    ... \n    [http_referer][/http_referer]\n    [user_url]http://www.decafbad.com/thanks-for-feeding-me.phtml[/user_url]\n    ...\n[/user]\n\nSecond, I modified AmphetaDesk/lib/AmphetaDesk/Settings.pm to account for the new setting:...\n   $SETTINGS{user_http_referer}               = \"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\";\n   $SETTINGS{user_user_url}                   = \"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\";\n   $SETTINGS{user_link_target}                = \"_blank\";\n...Third, I modified the create_ua() subroutine in AmphetaDesk/lib/AmphetaDesk/WWW.pm to actually use the new setting:\nsub create_ua {\n...\n    my $ua = new LWP::UserAgent; $ua->env_proxy();\n    $ua->timeout(get_setting(\"user_request_timeout\"));\n    my ($app_v, $app_u, $app_o, $user_u) = (get_setting(\"app_version\"),\n            get_setting(\"app_url\"), get_setting(\"app_os\"), get_setting(\"user_user_url\"));\n    $ua->agent(\"AmphetaDesk/$app_v ($app_o; $app_u; $user_u)\");\n...\n}\nAnd voila - no more referer abuse.  If you want to discover my thank-you message, examine the User-Agent string.  Seems like this would be a good idea for all news aggregators to pick up.  And if I get ambitious and have spare time today, I'll be sending off a patch to Morbus & friends later today.\nUpdate: Gagh!  This has been the hardest post to try to format correctly within the fancy schmancy auto-formatting widgets I have piped together.  All apologies for content resembling garbage.  I think I'll use this excuse in the future whenever I write something completely daft.  (Which means I'll be using it a lot, most likely.)",

    "summary": "I couldn't resist a bit of tinkering with NNTP, partly to follow up a little bit myself on RSS to/via NNTP, but mostly in fact to re-acquaint myself with the wonderfully arcane configuration of the  majestic beast that is inn . In addition, there's been talk recently of aggregators moving out of the realms of satellite applications and into the browser itself. The Blagg and Blosxom powered Morning Reading page - my personal (but open) news aggregator - is already web-based, so I thought I'd have a look in the other direction. Source:DJ's Weblog: Tinkering with RSS and NNTP .\nI've been toying around with doing this with inn for quite some time now, so I'm happy to see someone else actually follow through and give it a whirl.  And, using blagg with a plugin to do the posting seems just the right twist of clever.\nYeah, inn's a beast and meant for Usenet-scale beating, but it's Just There on many Linux installations.  And blagg seems to do a decent job of prying content out of RSS feeds, with just a few regular expression incantations.  DJ didn't have to reinvent an NNTP server, or create a brand new aggregator - just a few tweaks and glue, and two existing apps are joined in a completely new and interestingly complementary way.\nThough one thing he says:  \"As I saw it, there are two approaches to newsgroup article creation ... Send items from all weblogs to the same newsgroup ... Send items from each weblog to a separate newsgroup.\"  First thing I was wondering is:  Why not cross-post the articles and have both?\nAnd then there're the ideas for experimentation that come first to mind: \"... Combining the various weblog trackbacking mechanisms with NNTP article IDs to link  articles together in a thread; replying (to the newsgroup) to an  article might send a comment to the post at the source weblog.\"\nKinda retro, kinda nouveau, joining the new distributed RSS net up with the semi-distributed NNTP net.",

It'll have a web server, a web proxy, telnet-able shell, scripting languages, scheduler, full text search and index engine, persistence & metadata storage, and whatever else I can eventually think to toss in.  There are just so many nice toys for Java, and most are a snap to glue together.  But, I can't really use any of the toys that come with the OS itself.\nIt's something I've rambled on about before, as has Jon Udell in his old Byte column: Zope Lessons Learned.  If this thing is to run on more than one platform, it can't rely on the facilities of any particular platform.  So, all these lovely things I like OS X for are somewhat off limits.\nOn the other hand, if I get tired of doing this thing in Java, I could always just finally embrace the platform and go straight for Cocoa.  :)  Yes, that would make for 3 environments tried, but hey - it's still fun for me!",

If I could get at that bookmark folder via AppleScript, I could schedule and generate a templated blog entry for auto-posting every night, listing just the links I've left in that bookmark folder, and clear it out when it's all done.  I could do the same thing with just a Folder Action enabled desktop folder, but it's just so much more convenient to drop things on the toolbar.\nAnd then, there's the other wild idea I'd use scriptable bookmarks for:  RSS aggregation.

Source:Russell Beattie Notebook: Moblogging Thoughts .\nIs Russell losing the Moblogging faith already?  :)  He raises an interesting, mostly obvious point:  After all the whiz-bang setup and build up - what do you have that's so important that it's worth covering in mobile multimedia splendor?\nOn one hand, some would say, \"Nada mucho,\" and hang up their camera peripheral.  Me, well, I don't have the hardware yet to deluge my corner of the web with instant snaps and clips of me, my girl, the cats, and co-workers.  (Though I have gotten a start on it.)  But, I find what Russell's posted so far to be fascinating and amusing.  Of course, he's in an exotic locale with respect to me.  Why else, unless he was a photographic genius, would his lunch seem interesting to me?  Then again, I might be in an exotic locale with respect to someone else.\nAnyway, after all the fun of connecting various bits together, you always come back to finding a reason to use it if you hadn't had one to begin with.  Sometimes the reason ends up being that it's just fun to play with bits connected together, and that someone somewhere might just find the result interesting.  No one's forcing anyone to look at all the pictures of the world's cats, you know?",

Source:DJ's Weblog: The universal canvas and RSS apps .\nMy thoughts exactly.  Not sure if I've posted here about it, but I know during the whole RSS hubbub this fall, I'd babbled something about RSS being a messaging queue from machines to humans.  Or a transport for timely ephemera to people.  Or something like that.  Basically, I'd like to see RSS, or something like it, used beyond just headlines.  This is why I've leaned toward the RDF-in-RSS camp - I want to see lots of things besides titles and excerpts hung off the individual message events, and RDF seems downright nifty to me for this.\nBut either way, I like the expanded notion of RSS usage as a timestream-oriented stream of messages targeted at subscribed people.",

Source:postneo: 1200 bps .\nOh yeah?  Well, my first experience with dialing up in Jr. High was with a 300 bps modem on a C=64.  I used to pour over Horst Mann's 313 area code BBS list and sneak in calls to long-distance BBSes throughout Michigan, for which I'd later pay dearly out of my allowance.  :)  I remember coveting my friend's hulking Tandy PC and its 1200 baud modem (nearly a full screen of text at one time when playing BBS games).  Then, I bought a 2400 baud modem with an adapter, and became the envy of everyone - until they all moved up to 2400 and then 14.4K.\nI'm sure someone else can give me an oh yeah, too, and we can work up a skit ala Monty Python's \"We Were Poor\".  (\"You were lucky to have a lake! There were 15 of us living in a cardboard box in the middle of the road!\")\nWhat I really miss from the BBS days, though, is the local community.  Used to be that far away places were far away, and near places were near, and you had to go through the near places first before you could visit far places.  So, communities formed around BBSes, even as those around be began changing into mere portals onto the internet, and then later to become fledgling dialup ISPs.  Nowadays, the distance between points on the net is measured in terms of interest, attention, and affinity, without regard to physical location.  It's so much harder to get together for a cup of coffee with the people behind the keyboards these days.  :)",

I have hordes of directories on my various computers called stuff ,downloads and documents , and the effort that it would take to organise them into a proper heirarchy is just not worth it. The heirarchical filesystem is a really wonderful thing for programmers and websites, but it just doesn't cut it for personal use. \nI no longer care where my files are stored. Source:The Fishbowl: Filesystem sacrilege.\nI'll be burned at the next stake over from Charles when the time comes, for this filesystem heresy.  Just the other night, a co-worker was asking me about how diligent I was in organizing my email.  I told her, \"Not at all.  I leave it all in one pile and then run the Find command on it later.\"  She was shocked that I, alpha geek and info freako, didn't have some intricate taxonomy of folders into which mail was sorted by carefully crafted filters.\nYears ago, when I first started using email, I did indeed do this with procmail and other arcane beasties.  Then, I found myself cursing that I couldn't do cross-folder searches very easily.  Also, the filters and folders started making less sense as their structure represented only one possible scheme for finding what I was looking for, and I was needing many possible kinds of schemes over time.  So, eventually it all ended up in one pile, and searches became my way of finding things.\nI abandoned bookmarks for Google by the same principle.  Now, my bookmarks consist completely of bookmarklets and a few stray links to local on-disk pages like Python documentation.  In fact, I'm wishing that I could create bookmark folders that are fed by Google API powered persistent searches.\nSo, now I'm looking balefully upon my filesystem.  I haven't had much chance to play with BeOS, but I've read about the design of the BeOS file system and drooled.  I hear about Microsoft's Longhorn and its WinFS and grind my teeth - I very much dislike Microsoft, but if they pulled this off, I'd have to sing their praises.  Apple?  Do they have any aces up their sleeves in this regard?  Don't let a new fanboy down.  :)\nAnyway, that's what I want to see:  Storage without explicit organization, but with super-rich metadata for super-fast searches.  Allow me to create views made from persistent searches - my \"project folder\" is simply a collection of resources tied together by a common tag, one of many.  And, if I want to form a project hierarchy, make my persistent searches into file objects too.  \nThe main thing in all this, though, is that it be woven very deeply within the OS.  I don't want a helper app.  I want this to replace the standard metaphor completely.\nRDF triples at the inode-level anyone?  Heh, heh.",

    "summary": "In case anyone's interested, I've been hacking like mad on my toy proxy since New Years'.  Check out PersonalWebProxy for current downloads.  It's got primitive forms of proxy filters, browser-based UI, RDF-based metadata management, logging, config, plugins, and some other goodies.  So far, the major plugins include:\n\n\n a noisy logger;\n\n a content archiver that captures and saves all response headers and content in a directory structure loosely based on the requested URL;\n\n an initial metadata harvester that fills up the RDF database with triples based on headers and details encountered during browsing\n\n\n\nIt works, and does stuff, but I'm sure it demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of large portions of the Twisted framework, Python itself, and likely causes forest fires.  So, I hope many people will download it, snicker at it, and maybe set me straight on a few things and contribute a few patches and plugins.\n\nShareAndEnjoy!",

    "summary": "So... yeah.  I watched the keynote, and I'm lusting over the new mini-me ?PowerBook with a plan to purchase in the Spring.  I was aiming at a high end iBook but holding out for something better, and well, this new ?PowerBook is the precisely what I was holding out for.  It appears to be the rightful successor to my formerly beloved Sony Vaio 505TR.\n\nThen there's Safari.  Mark puts it under the microscope, as does Mena.  On the other hand, Ben writes that it's almost-shit.  Oh yeah, and JWZ reports: \"Apple says 'fuck you' to Mozilla\"  But he's not bitter.\n\nI haven't got the chops to seriously test the thing, so I'll be watching the more spec-wise out there for info.  But, what I do think about it makes me sound like an Apple fanboy:  I think it's great.\nIt's not perfect at the moment, but I've got a feeling that this will change.  And fast.  Mozilla's shipped with talkback, but Safari's got a bug submission button right up front.  And the fact that they did snub Mozilla for a dark horse like Konqueror seems a bit provocative (at least in techie / Open Source circles), and after all that talk of innovation I doubt that they're going to let it rest as-is or back down.  I expect lots of movement from here.  Think different and all that.  And, from my minuscule bits of Cocoa dev, I'm looking forward to poking around with ?WebCore and the ?JavaScript framework.  Unless it's a complete disaster, I expect the building blocks of Safari to pop up in projects everywhere.\n\nThese things tell me to expect good things from Safari.  I hope Mozilla can keep up.  As for IE, well, I deleted that a long time ago.",

    "summary": "Okay, this is getting close to outstripping my enthusiasm and invoking my laziness:  Does anyone happen to have RDFLib and ZODB working under Mac OS X 10.2.3?  Have also tried compiling Redland and its Python and Java APIs, but that's not been a 100% success.  Or can someone recommend another decent RDF repository to play with under Python?  I've had fun with Jena under Java, love using RDQL, and dig switching between MySQL and BDB stores.\n\nI want an RDF repository I can integrate into my proxy experiments, currently implemented in Python.  I've been very tempted to switch to Java, which I know better and have a better sense of tools available.  But I'm still pulling for Python.  I suppose I could just go with an in-memory repository at first, but I don't want to stick with that.\n\nI'm still finishing up the PersonalWebProxy notes and plan I've been working on, but I've still got an itch to play in code.  The next major thing I want to do is extract as much metadata as I can from every HTML page I visit and load the RDF repository up with statements based on what I harvest.  Examples would include things like HTML title, visitation date, referring url, any meta tags, any autodiscovered RSS and FOAF URLs, and anything else I could eventually dig out.  Then, I want to amass some data and play with it.  I'm thinking this could give me a kind of uber-history with which to work.\n\nUpdate: Seems like I managed to get Python, RDFLib, and ZODB working, but I started completely from scratch and compiled everything from clean source.  I guess Apple's build of Python has more hiccups in it than just the Makefile thing.",

Time to go back googling to find a solution or somewhere to whine.  I may also swap back into Java, since I like Jena better than anything I've found in Python for RDF support.",

It does do a few things I thought were nifty, like use Mark Pilgrim's rssfinder script in a thread to dig up RSS feeds for every URL with text/html content you visit.  There's no persistence yet, so they just appear in the log, but figuring out the integration and thread use so far was nifty to me.\n\nAnyway, enjoy.
