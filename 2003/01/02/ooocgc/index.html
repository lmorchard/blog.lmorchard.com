Then, I want to amass some data and play with it.  I&amp;apos;m thinking this could give me a kind of uber-history with which to work.  Update: Seems like I managed to get Python, RDFLib, and ZODB working, but I started completely from scratch and compiled everything from clean source.  I guess Apple&amp;apos;s build of Python has more hiccups in it than just the Makefile thing. " />

<div class="content">I&#39;m glad to hear you got everything working. 
Your choice of ZODB might make searching easier too. Especially since ZCatalog seems to be the best searching solution for Python. Python text searching is a hot topic lately. Here are some related links:

<div class="content">If  you haven&#39;t already, you might want to take a look at some of the OSAF/Chandler postings, since they&#39;re also using ZODB. They intend to provide an RDF interface, but I think that will be a &quot;layer&quot;, not the native/primary interface...
