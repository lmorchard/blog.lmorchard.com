Or can someone recommend another decent <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> repository to play with under Python?

I suppose I <strong>could</strong> just go with an in-memory repository at first, but I don&#39;t want to stick with that.\n<br /><br />\nI&#39;m still finishing up the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy\">PersonalWebProxy</a> notes and plan I&#39;ve been working on, but I&#39;ve still got an itch to play in code.  The next major thing I want to do is extract as much metadata as I can from every HTML page I visit and load the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> repository up with statements based on what I harvest.  Examples would include things like HTML title, visitation date, referring url, any meta tags, any autodiscovered <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS\">RSS</a> and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF\">FOAF</a> URLs, and anything else I could eventually dig out.
