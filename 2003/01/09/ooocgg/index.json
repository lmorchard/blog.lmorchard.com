Yeah, I know I just release a bunch of code to that effect, but it&#39;s still just a proof of concept.  While there are some impressive things in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Twisted\">Twisted</a> and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Python\">Python</a>, there&#39;s also a lot of flux and immaturity there.  Not a bad thing, since the hackers in that camp are doing mad crazy things, but I don&#39;t want to focus on mad crazy things in my toolkit - I want to focus on mad crazy things built on top of it.  The thing I&#39;ve been hoping for is that some of those mad crazy things in the toolkit would <strong>enable</strong> even madder crazier things down the line for me.  This may be true still - so I&#39;m not tossing anything out, just still experimenting.\n<br /><br />\nSo far, this is just playing for me.  For fun, I think I might do the whole thing over again in Java and play in parallel for a little while.  Well, not quite all over, since I think I&#39;ve found some pretty ready-made components:\n<br /><br />\nTake <a href=\"http://muffin.doit.org/\" target=\"_top\">Muffin</a>, for example.  It&#39;s a Java proxy that looks like it&#39;s been dormant for quite awhile, but seems ideal on the surface for my needs.  Just today, though, I checked back in the project&#39;s CVS repository and it seems that there&#39;s new activity and checkins starting up in there.  On the other hand, I&#39;ve also been poking at Jetty and the proxy classes it comes with.  Seems like there&#39;s a lot to work with here, and I have a better vibe about it.\n<br /><br />\nBesides that, Jena seems stronger than rdflib for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF\">RDF</a> support, and I&#39;m just biting at the bit to pour damn near everything at Apache Jakarta into this thing.  Also, I suspect I may be able to preserve the quick scripty hackability I want out of the this thing by using BSF and Jython, with some assembly and config in BML.\n<br /><br />\nHmm.
