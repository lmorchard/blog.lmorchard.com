        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still not entirely sold on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Python&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Twisted&quot;&gt;Twisted&lt;/a&gt; as the foundation for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy&quot;&gt;PersonalWebProxy&lt;/a&gt;.  Yeah, I know I just release a bunch of code to that effect, but it&#39;s still just a proof of concept.  While there are some impressive things in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Twisted&quot;&gt;Twisted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Python&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, there&#39;s also a lot of flux and immaturity there.  Not a bad thing, since the hackers in that camp are doing mad crazy things, but I don&#39;t want to focus on mad crazy things in my toolkit - I want to focus on mad crazy things built on top of it.  The thing I&#39;ve been hoping for is that some of those mad crazy things in the toolkit would &lt;strong&gt;enable&lt;/strong&gt; even madder crazier things down the line for me.  This may be true still - so I&#39;m not tossing anything out, just still experimenting.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So far, this is just playing for me.  For fun, I think I might do the whole thing over again in Java and play in parallel for a little while.  Well, not quite all over, since I think I&#39;ve found some pretty ready-made components:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Take &lt;a href=&quot;http://muffin.doit.org/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Muffin&lt;/a&gt;, for example.  It&#39;s a Java proxy that looks like it&#39;s been dormant for quite awhile, but seems ideal on the surface for my needs.  Just today, though, I checked back in the project&#39;s CVS repository and it seems that there&#39;s new activity and checkins starting up in there.  On the other hand, I&#39;ve also been poking at Jetty and the proxy classes it comes with.  Seems like there&#39;s a lot to work with here, and I have a better vibe about it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Besides that, Jena seems stronger than rdflib for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt; support, and I&#39;m just biting at the bit to pour damn near everything at Apache Jakarta into this thing.  Also, I suspect I may be able to preserve the quick scripty hackability I want out of the this thing by using BSF and Jython, with some assembly and config in BML.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hmm.  Still tinkering.&lt;/p&gt;

<div class="content">I've been bouncing between Java and Python working on RDF myself lately.  I first tried rdflib with ZODB but ended up back with Jena.  Maybe it's just my newbieness ( is that a word? ) with Python but Jena seems easier to work with for me.   What I need to do is spend more time coding the app and less time bouncing between languages :-)</div>

<div class="content">My experience with muffin was really good.  It's hackable and robust.  The lack of buzz is IMO because it was too far ahead of its time for people to get.</div>

<div class="content">Take a look at Webware ( http://webware.sf.net/ )
It has a clean servlet programming style and is easy to extend.
I'm runnning a number of business critcal apps on it and its very stable.  Try the CVS version, its stable and a new release is on the way.</div>
