Speaking of BML, what ever happened to it?  I first <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000232.phtml#000232" target="_top">wrote about it</a> back in August and later <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000234.phtml#000234" target="_top">got a response</a> from Sanjiva Weerawarana, one of the original authors at IBM.  Someone hinted to me that it was supposed to eventually land at Jakarta, and while the Bean Scripting Framework <strong>did</strong> land there, BML is still off the radar.  Meanwhile, I'm still using it at work, still sitting on <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000233.phtml#000233" target="_top">some dubiously-gotten source code</a>, and want to use it in more public projects.
<br /><br />
Anyone out there in Java-land besides me know about this thing and find it useful?  While it's still very likely that I'm delusioned, I have yet to find something equivalent to what it can do for me.  On the contrary, I've seen other projects rolling their own much less functional versions of BML.  But, I have to assume that I'm not realy a know-it-all, and that I'm likely missing something that makes this not-so-great and relatively unadopted.
