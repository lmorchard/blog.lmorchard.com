I first tried rdflib with ZODB but ended up back with Jena.  Maybe it&#39;s just my newbieness ( is that a word? ) with Python but Jena seems easier to work with for me.   What I need to do is spend more time coding the app and less time bouncing between languages :-)</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083342&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4d36a40c304b021a4ec3db86b526e8c5&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lucas Gonze&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083342&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2003-01-10T13:54:24&quot;&gt;2003-01-10T13:54:24&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;My experience with muffin was really good.
