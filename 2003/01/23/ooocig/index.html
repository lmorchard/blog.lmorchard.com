<div class="content">Hey, if you want to do a cocoa project to make services more visible, you might want to take a look at one of my old projects - I called it Self Service. <a href="http://disco.ucsd.edu/blog/computers/apps/SelfService">http://disco.ucsd.edu/blog/computers/apps/SelfService</a> 
The idea was to make Services into floating windows that you could drag and drop to. It works fine, but I keep forgetting to use it. (And Safari doesn&#39;t have a service)
If you want the code, just ask.</div>
