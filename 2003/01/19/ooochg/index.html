<div class="content">I share your annoyance with present file/filing systems!
The main change needed as I see it is to move the emphasis from bookmarks as locators to bookmarks as identifiers (of course somewhere around there needs to be a locator). Given this then it makes things like including the same item in many folders (/categories) easy and doesn&#39;t tie you to hierarchical systems.
One of the things I want my Ideagraph project (<a href="http://ideagraph.net">http://ideagraph.net</a>) to be able to do is to maintain all this stuff in a friendlier (usable!) fashion. Ok, so it&#39;s layering on top of the OS but anything&#39;s got to be better than the organization Win (even Lin) gives you.</div>

<div class="content">I abandoned bookmarks for Google by the same principle.

In fact, I&#39;m wishing that I could create bookmark folders that are fed by Google API powered persistent searches.
Why don&#39;t you? There is huge potential in this idea, particularly if the search is distributed across many eclectic researchers/clients. This is actually what I wanted to do for the Google API contest- but, as usual, the idea didn&#39;t fit into the requested parameters.
P2P bookmark cluster searches would eliminate the lag of publishing in the associative link loop. Making us, collaboratively, an order of magnitude smarter by virtue of enhanced proximity.
If you don&#39;t I will.</div>
