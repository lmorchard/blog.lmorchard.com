And, from my minuscule bits of Cocoa dev, I&amp;apos;m looking forward to poking around with ?WebCore and the ?JavaScript framework.  Unless it&amp;apos;s a complete disaster, I expect the building blocks of Safari to pop up in projects everywhere.  These things tell me to expect good things from Safari.  I hope Mozilla can keep up.  As for IE, well, I deleted that a long time ago. " />

<div class="content">Right on. Actually, I was /most/ impressed by the bug reporting feature. If you&#39;ve not already noticed, the &quot;More&quot; feature of the reporting dialog permits one-click sending of a screen shot and source. Brilliant!</div>
