The network effects of throwing open the doors on massive party silos soon dwarfed our little hobby homesteads on the open web. By the time I get a proper blog running and build myself <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_blogging#B\">a blogroll</a>, you&#8217;ve already gotten on both Twitter and Facebook and started making fun of me with all your new friends.</p>\n<p>However much I might grouse about the fix we find ourselves in now, it&#8217;s undeniable that these social networking silos have had massive success in connecting people around the world.
