It makes me giggle, which is important when you&#39;re\ncoding for the hell of it. It would tickle me if toot caught on, didn&#39;t get\ntrademarked, and everyone had a giggle too.</p>\n<p>Some important answers to questions no one&#39;s asked yet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>&quot;tiny&quot; means not necessarily 140 characters, but definitely not an essay.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A paragraph or less? Should be a single notion, easily scanned in one\nvisual gulp.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>&quot;outburst&quot; means it&#39;s outloud to a bunch of people</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Could be a public broadcast, could be an aside to a small group</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>&quot;text&quot; does not mean these should only be plain words and sentences.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>There&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/text\">a definition</a> of text that goes like &quot;something (as a\nstory or movie) considered as an object to be examined, explicated, or\ndeconstructed&quot;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>And texts we send each other these days are riddled with pictures and\nvideos and emoji and random expression.
