<p>Social media like Twitter and Facebook combine web publishing and hosting. You can&#8217;t run different software, and you can&#8217;t move your stuff. So, if you&#8217;re unhappy, your choices are a) deal with it or b) abandon your stuff and your friends. Those are pretty rough options.</p>
<p>But, what if you <em>could</em> move your stuff? And what if you <em>could</em> switch apps?</p>
<!--more-->

<h2 id="hosting-made-stupid-simple"><span id="Hosting_made_stupid_simple">Hosting made stupid simple</span></h2>
<p>Imagine a dead simple hosting service that puts stuff on the web for you. The main thing they do is support an API for apps. It&#8217;s not free-as-in-beer, but it&#8217;s cheap. Say $10 / year or maybe even $25 / year if you get serious and rent your own domain name. It could charge per usage, which might mean pennies-per-month if you&#8217;re a not yet a superstar celebrity.</p>
<p>They also make it easy to get backups and move to a competitor. If they annoy you or go down often or get hacked, you can just pack up and leave. And since your web stuff is made up of static <a target="_blank" title="HTML" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn">HTML</a> / <a target="_blank" title="JS" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn">JS</a> / <a target="_blank" title="CSS" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn">CSS</a> / image resources, moving is simple. All your URLs will change, unless you splurged on that domain name. But, I think we can smooth over that problem, like in the olden days when your phone number changed.</p>
<h2 id="theres-an-app-for-publishing-that"><span id="There8217s_an_app_for_publishing_that">There&#8217;s an app for publishing that</span></h2>
<p>Now, imagine a publishing app. This could run on a device you own &#8211; like your phone or tablet or laptop. It could also run on someone&#8217;s server in the cloud. When you start using a publishing app, it asks where you keep your stuff. Then, it does a permission dance with you and your hosting service &#8211; &#8220;so-and-so wants to do such-and-such, is this okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>Having gotten permission, the publishing app can manage some or all of your stuff at the hosting service. A Twitter-alike could maintain some <a target="_blank" title="HTML" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn">HTML</a> pages for your random thoughts, help you upload a header image &amp; a picture of yourself. If the authors of the Twitter app disappoint you, you can switch to the Ello-ish app. You don&#8217;t abandon anything or anyone.</p>
<p>Ideally, these competing apps support the same formats. Or, they offer a way to convert between the two. They&#8217;d have incentive to make transitions easy, because they want you to switch. And that&#8217;s because you can pay for these apps &#8211; say $1 or $5 or $10. They could even offer in-app purchases for themes or analytics or scheduled posts or whatever.</p>
<h2 id="its-complicated-but-worth-it"><span id="It8217s_complicated_but_worth_it">It&#8217;s complicated, but worth it</span></h2>
<p>There&#8217;s complexity introduced, here. But, it&#8217;s not that bad, relatively speaking: You don&#8217;t need to deal with configuring web servers, uploading PHP scripts, or logging in with SSH. The hosting service, again, is stupid simple and commoditized.</p>
<p>Apps can be as complex as their authors like, but that can be hidden from you with great UX &amp; UI. The main thing is that you manage the permissions between your hosting service and your apps &#8211; not nothing, but it&#8217;s not much.</p>
<p>And, remember, the reason you might choose to accept this extra complexity is because it gives you choice. Both the hosting services and the publishing apps have incentive to serve you &#8211; because you&#8217;re a paying customer and because you can leave.</p>
<h2 id="challenges"><span id="Challenges">Challenges</span></h2>
<p>What&#8217;s the incentive for bootstrapping this? I&#8217;m not really sure, beyond thinking it&#8217;s a neat idea. Is there a profit potential, even if just in the range of a lifestyle business?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a chicken-and-egg problem: There aren&#8217;t really many (any?) super simple web hosts with great UX, and there aren&#8217;t apps that use them. Which comes first? Probably a little of both, most likely from a web host who also offers their own apps.</p>
<p>Also, a central challenge in building this kind of ecosystem is to make sure the signup process for a hosting service and the permission dances with apps are easy. This is an opportunity to provide a great user experience, so that the only extra burden is the novelty of considering hosting &amp; publishing as separate concerns.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if all the above is a solution. It&#8217;s not a new idea, either. But, I think it deserves revisiting. It might make for some fun tinkering, at least.</p>
