My car doesn't get audio streams, nor do I when I'm out walking.  I also don't have to sit down and listen when the show happens to be on.\nYes, in the past, I've timeshifted / downloaded audio streams using some ripper tool and taken the cached stream with me.  But this time, I don't have to do anything-- it's timeshifted and cached to begin with.  This is what's different.\nAlso, you could say \"Hey, I put this MP3 up for download,\" but that'd be stupid.  Instead, push that notification in machine readable form into an RSS feed.  \nOn the other end, I have a machine (iTunes 4.9, most recently) that reads your feed and I don't have to pay attention and download anything myself-- it just shows up and I've got it by the time I think to look for it.  This is what's different.\nPut it all together, and you've got something that's actually a new thing.  It's a kind of subscription-based, timeshifted audio tech we didn't have before.  (At least, not for free.)\nIt's different enough that it needs a new word to hang the concept from-- thus, podcasting.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085038\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=665b78d0565078210ae9f72ed147a804&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Dan</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085038\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-28T01:16:18\">2005-07-28T01:16:18</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I do something similar to turn public radio RealAudio streams (All Things Considered, This American Life) into daily podcasts for ITunes 4.9.\ncron -> mplayer (with RealAudio DLLs) -> lame gives me the .mp3 file.\ncron -> wget (NPR website for show data) -> custom shell script builds the RSS file with description text\nScripts are quick and dirty but surprisingly reliable.

The name podcast came about because the people smart enough to make this all come about, HAPPENED TO OWN IPODS!  Get over it -the system works on others, it's a catchy name, and it's in millions of homes already.  \nIf you are sick of so-called 'stupid' or biased names then 1)Get smart, 2)Create something new, and 3)Call it I'mSoSmartCasting -until then, start enjoying the fruits of other peoples' labors and leave them be when they name it what they want.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085044\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jackkonblog.blogspot.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=6ee23e2be161988996f69c7a48d10daf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jackkonblog.blogspot.com/\">Jack Krupansky</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085044\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-08-11T17:26:54\">2005-08-11T17:26:54</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Call it what it really is:  Old wine in a new bottle.  Of course, there's nothing wrong with new bottle's per se.  A convenient handle, easy-pour, easy open/close, more appealing packaging, better distribution whatever.\nI agree that podcasting is really nothing intrinsically *new*, other than the packaging and distribution, but in our consumer economy, packaging and distribution are everything.\nNote:  I see a lot of references to podcasts which do *not* involve the use of web feeds, such as \"Click here to download our podcast\", are these misuses of the term \"podcast\"?  In other words, is the concept of a podcast inherently linked to the mechanism for distribution (i.e., via XML web feed)?\n-- Jack Krupansky</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085045\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085045\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-08-11T17:48:13\">2005-08-11T17:48:13</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Jack:  Yes, anyone who serves up a page with a link to an MP3 and calls that a podcast doesn't know what the term means.  They're just trying to ride the buzz without a clue.\nFeed subscription and automated download is the not-so-secret sauce of podcasting.  Automation is the key.  Otherwise, you might as well choose long division over using a calculator.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085046\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e0e01aa1d857dad66320e6c060fd5060&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Mike Prescott</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085046\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-08-18T18:44:40\">2005-08-18T18:44:40</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Streaming audio = technology\nStreaming audio + rss feed + podcatcher + whatever else I missed = service\nwe're a service oriented society\nI still like ReplayRadio (VCR for internet radio) because it doesn't require RSS which alot of the shows I like on BBC haven't gone to yet.

In other words, is the concept of a podcast inherently linked to the mechanism for distribution (i.e., via XML web feed)?\r\n\r\n-- Jack Krupansky</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085045\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085045\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-08-11T17:48:13\">2005-08-11T17:48:13</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Jack:  Yes, anyone who serves up a page with a link to an MP3 and calls that a podcast doesn't know what the term means.

In the meantime, I hope the XSLT filter as WSGI middleware is useful to someone.\r\n\r\n[awsxsl]: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/08/04/tr-xml.html\r\n[abook]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/12/23/abook1\r\n[ngwa]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/11/30/nextgenwebapps\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090666\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090666\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-19T01:34:39\">2005-07-19T01:34:39</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">It's cool to see this -- I had actually just mentioned an XSLT\r\nmiddleware a day ago in an email on Web-SIG about WSGI and possible\r\nmiddleware, and then there it is.

Well, I do have to say that I&#39;ve recovered rather well from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/05/exocortex_stroke\">the &quot;stroke&quot;</a> last week.  Things have been pretty busy since then, so I haven&#39;t had much of a chance to blather any more around these parts.</p>\n<p>However, in the spirit of a few <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/drag_the_boxes_stretch_the_lines\">recent</a> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/css_treemaps\">experiments</a>, I have another demo for you.  Here&#39;s the URL of the latest work in progress / proof of concept:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/map-test/tree2.html\">http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/map-test/tree2.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>What is it, you might ask before clicking a strange URL?  It&#39;s an outliner, in Javascript.  Or, rather, a first rough stab at one anyway.  It&#39;s got a long way to go, and there are indeed <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http://sproutliner.com/&amp;e=912\">better options out there already</a>, but I wanted to try making one myself.</p>\n<p>A quick summary of controls:  No mouse drag of items yet, but you can click on them to edit.  Use the up and down cursor keys to navigate through the outline.  Use shift along with the cursor keys to <em>shift</em> items around.  Use the control key along with the cursor keys to <em>control</em> visibility of child items.</p>\n<p><em>Update</em>: There&#39;re a few more things I didn&#39;t mention, as well as a few bug half-fixes.  Hitting return when the editor is on an existing item will insert a new blank item right after it.  Hitting shift-return will append a new child item to the current item.  Tab and shift-tab, as well as shift-right and shift-left, are supposed to indent and outdent items.  Unfortunately, they&#39;re not quite working yet and of course they semi-clobber other useful keyboard functions, so I&#39;m still feeling around for a good way to support these.</p>\n<p>The idea is that I want to unobtrusively drop some CSS and JavaScript into an HTML page with one or more <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/XOXO\">XOXO-style outlines</a>, magically turning them into in-browser outline editors.</p>\n<p>But, like I said, there&#39;s still lots of work to be done here, and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve riddled this thing with circular references that will make your <a href=\"http://jibbering.com/faq/faq_notes/closures.html#clMem\">IE/Win combination leak like crazy</a>.  I just wanted to see if I could make something like this work, though.  And, roughly, it seems to do so in Safari and Firefox.</p>\n<p>The next part of this equation will be coming up soon, I think.  And that is: Okay, now that I&#39;ve created / edited an outline in my browser--how can I save it?  </p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=xoxo_outliner_experiment</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084038\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rasterweb.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rasterweb.net/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084038\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-12T19:22:24\">2005-07-12T19:22:24</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Damn that is cool!</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084039\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f1d479db750c7e73e6f77a546e71432c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Charlie Wallace</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084039\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-12T21:03:36\">2005-07-12T21:03:36</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Way cool!

It got most of the basic stuff working already, and just needs a small last push to get it going. Anyone wants to help out finishing it and make it public? Drop me an email if you do.\n[evgeny.zislis gmail]</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "Testing, testing--is this thing on?  Well, I do have to say that I've recovered rather well from [the \"stroke\"][stroke] last week.  Things have been pretty busy since then, so I haven't had much of a chance to blather any more around these parts.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the spirit of a few [recent][graphs] [experiments][treemaps], I have another demo for you.  Here's the URL of the latest work in progress / proof of concept:\r\n\r\n* [http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/map-test/tree2.html](http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/map-test/tree2.html)\r\n\r\nWhat is it, you might ask before clicking a strange URL?  It's an outliner, in Javascript.  Or, rather, a first rough stab at one anyway.  It's got a long way to go, and there are indeed [better options out there already][sprout], but I wanted to try making one myself.\r\n\r\nA quick summary of controls:  No mouse drag of items yet, but you can click on them to edit.  Use the up and down cursor keys to navigate through the outline.  Use shift along with the cursor keys to *shift* items around.  Use the control key along with the cursor keys to *control* visibility of child items.\r\n\r\n*Update*: There're a few more things I didn't mention, as well as a few bug half-fixes.  Hitting return when the editor is on an existing item will insert a new blank item right after it.  Hitting shift-return will append a new child item to the current item.  Tab and shift-tab, as well as shift-right and shift-left, are supposed to indent and outdent items.  Unfortunately, they're not quite working yet and of course they semi-clobber other useful keyboard functions, so I'm still feeling around for a good way to support these.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that I want to unobtrusively drop some CSS and JavaScript into an HTML page with one or more [XOXO-style outlines][xoxo], magically turning them into in-browser outline editors.\r\n\r\nBut, like I said, there's still lots of work to be done here, and I'm pretty sure I've riddled this thing with circular references that will make your [IE/Win combination leak like crazy][leak].  I just wanted to see if I could make something like this work, though.  And, roughly, it seems to do so in Safari and Firefox.\r\n\r\nThe next part of this equation will be coming up soon, I think.  And that is: Okay, now that I've created / edited an outline in my browser--how can I save it?  \r\n\r\n[leak]: http://jibbering.com/faq/faq_notes/closures.html#clMem\r\n[xoxo]: http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/XOXO\r\n[sprout]: http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=1&q=http://sproutliner.com/&e=912\r\n[stroke]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/05/exocortex_stroke\r\n[treemaps]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/css_treemaps\r\n[graphs]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/drag_the_boxes_stretch_the_lines\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=xoxo_outliner_experiment\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084038\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084038\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-12T19:22:24\">2005-07-12T19:22:24</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Damn that is cool!</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084039\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f1d479db750c7e73e6f77a546e71432c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Charlie Wallace</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084039\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-12T21:03:36\">2005-07-12T21:03:36</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Way cool!

Well, I do have to say that I&apos;ve recovered rather well from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/05/exocortex_stroke\">the &quot;stroke&quot;</a> last week.  Things have been pretty busy since then, so I haven&apos;t had much of a chance to blather any more around these parts.</p>\n<p>However, in the spirit of a few <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/drag_the_boxes_stretch_the_lines\">recent</a> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/css_treemaps\">experiments</a>, I have another demo for you.  Here&apos;s the URL of the latest work in progress / proof of concept:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/map-test/tree2.html\">http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/map-test/tree2.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>What is it, you might ask before clicking a strange URL?  It&apos;s an outliner, in Javascript.  Or, rather, a first rough stab at one anyway.  It&apos;s got a long way to go, and there are indeed <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http://sproutliner.com/&amp;e=912\">better options out there already</a>, but I wanted to try making one myself.</p>\n<p>A quick summary of controls:  No mouse drag of items yet, but you can click on them to edit.  Use the up and down cursor keys to navigate through the outline.  Use shift along with the cursor keys to <em>shift</em> items around.  Use the control key along with the cursor keys to <em>control</em> visibility of child items.</p>\n<p><em>Update</em>: There&apos;re a few more things I didn&apos;t mention, as well as a few bug half-fixes.  Hitting return when the editor is on an existing item will insert a new blank item right after it.  Hitting shift-return will append a new child item to the current item.  Tab and shift-tab, as well as shift-right and shift-left, are supposed to indent and outdent items.  Unfortunately, they&apos;re not quite working yet and of course they semi-clobber other useful keyboard functions, so I&apos;m still feeling around for a good way to support these.</p>\n<p>The idea is that I want to unobtrusively drop some CSS and JavaScript into an HTML page with one or more <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/XOXO\">XOXO-style outlines</a>, magically turning them into in-browser outline editors.</p>\n<p>But, like I said, there&apos;s still lots of work to be done here, and I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;ve riddled this thing with circular references that will make your <a href=\"http://jibbering.com/faq/faq_notes/closures.html#clMem\">IE/Win combination leak like crazy</a>.  I just wanted to see if I could make something like this work, though.  And, roughly, it seems to do so in Safari and Firefox.</p>\n<p>The next part of this equation will be coming up soon, I think.  And that is: Okay, now that I&apos;ve created / edited an outline in my browser--how can I save it?  </p>\n"

    "html": "<p>So, this weekend, I suffered a sort of minor stroke in my exocortex.  The girl and I left for a bit to get food on Saturday afternoon and, when we got back, I found my PowerBook making grinding / growling noises from the general vicinity of its hard drive.  A reboot or two later, and the poor thing stopped bothering to spin up the drive and just sat there in blinking confusion looking for a System folder.</p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/17/are_powerbook_hard_drives_supposed_to_sound_like_amiga_floppy_drives\">if you&#39;ve been following along</a>, you might be thinking, &quot;Didn&#39;t he just go through this not too long ago?&quot;  If so, you&#39;d be right.  I&#39;m not sure what I do to these things, since <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/10/17/ooocoi\">I killed an iBook hard drive like this</a>, too.  I&#39;m very hesitant to blame Apple for this since, well, I&#39;m just really <em>not</em> a careful person when it comes to hardware.  I thank my lucky stars, so far, for AppleCare.</p>\n<p>The problem this time, though, is that the failure happened without warning.  The past two times, I had a bit of a gradual slide into failure with an agonizing period of intermittent function just long enough to evacuate some essentials onto another machine.  But this time, boom.  No warning.  And stupid me:  I deleted the backups I&#39;d made back <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/04/30/initial_tiger_thoughts\">when I upgraded to Tiger</a>.</p>\n<p>So, my last decent backup of anything is about a year old, from the last time I had a hard drive crash.  Thus, this feels a bit like a sound blow to the head.  I&#39;ve lost all my recent changes to my feed aggregator subscription list.  I&#39;ve lost all my Tinderbox documents.  I&#39;m still groping around for registration keys for all of my software.  The arrangement of tools I&#39;ve gotten used to being within finger-twitch range is now gone.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s been a long time since I had a serious failure in a machine I depend on where I didn&#39;t have a recovery plan.  Ouch.  The two things that are keeping me from going entirely bonkers are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The girl never sold her old iBook and I turned it into a replacement for our ailing house Linux server, so I have a backup machine until the PowerBook comes back.</li>\n<li>I didn&#39;t lose this weekend&#39;s tinkerings because I shared them here.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, it&#39;s lucky that I&#39;ve turned in all the chapters and artwork for the book, because I&#39;d&#39;ve really been strolling off a cliff if I&#39;d&#39;ve had to recreate any of that work.  Of course, <em>that</em> stuff got zipped up and uploaded to at least 3 locations on a weekly basis, so I was at least smartly paranoid about that.</p>\n<p>I guess this&#39;ll teach me though.  As soon as the PowerBook comes back, and I&#39;ve reconstructed my external headspace on it, I&#39;ll be setting up nightly backups to the basement file server and plan on doing monthly archival to DVD.  I can&#39;t imagine how lost I&#39;d be if I were <em>really</em> living in my laptop.  :)</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=exocortex_stroke</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083290\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://virtuallyshocking.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=066c167d7062108915aa0eb5dd59d8bf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://virtuallyshocking.com\">Brock Tice</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083290\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-05T12:14:10\">2005-07-05T12:14:10</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\"I didn’t lose this weekend’s tinkerings because I shared them here.\"\nVery Linus Torvalds, as in, \n\"Only wimps use tape backup: real men just upload their important stuff on ftp, and let the rest of the world mirror it.\"</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083292\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.glennf.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c6aef8227056393525931c8677077126&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.glennf.com\">Glenn Fleishman</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083292\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-05T12:54:18\">2005-07-05T12:54:18</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Remember DriveSavers: they charge a fortune, but if a year's worth of missing data is worth as much as a few grand to you, they might be able to recover it.

I started copying data from the 15\" to the 12\" left home for a while because it was estimated to take about 3 hours for the copy to happen. I came home and everything was fine, I mounted the 15\" drive onto my 12\" to copy anything I forgot and the drive was like all clunk, grind, clunk, clunk... I was all like huh? and then it died. It was 4 years old. I am thinking that Apple doesn't make machines like they used to. My old pismo is still a rock solid machine...</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "So, this weekend, I suffered a sort of minor stroke in my exocortex.  The girl and I left for a bit to get food on Saturday afternoon and, when we got back, I found my PowerBook making grinding / growling noises from the general vicinity of its hard drive.  A reboot or two later, and the poor thing stopped bothering to spin up the drive and just sat there in blinking confusion looking for a System folder.\r\n\r\nNow, [if you've been following along][lt], you might be thinking, \"Didn't he just go through this not too long ago?\"  If so, you'd be right.  I'm not sure what I do to these things, since [I killed an iBook hard drive like this][ib], too.  I'm very hesitant to blame Apple for this since, well, I'm just really *not* a careful person when it comes to hardware.  I thank my lucky stars, so far, for AppleCare.\r\n\r\nThe problem this time, though, is that the failure happened without warning.  The past two times, I had a bit of a gradual slide into failure with an agonizing period of intermittent function just long enough to evacuate some essentials onto another machine.  But this time, boom.  No warning.  And stupid me:  I deleted the backups I'd made back [when I upgraded to Tiger][tiger].\r\n\r\nSo, my last decent backup of anything is about a year old, from the last time I had a hard drive crash.  Thus, this feels a bit like a sound blow to the head.  I've lost all my recent changes to my feed aggregator subscription list.  I've lost all my Tinderbox documents.  I'm still groping around for registration keys for all of my software.  The arrangement of tools I've gotten used to being within finger-twitch range is now gone.\r\n\r\nIt's been a long time since I had a serious failure in a machine I depend on where I didn't have a recovery plan.  Ouch.  The two things that are keeping me from going entirely bonkers are:\r\n\r\n1. The girl never sold her old iBook and I turned it into a replacement for our ailing house Linux server, so I have a backup machine until the PowerBook comes back.\r\n2. I didn't lose this weekend's tinkerings because I shared them here.  \r\n\r\nAlso, it's lucky that I've turned in all the chapters and artwork for the book, because I'd've really been strolling off a cliff if I'd've had to recreate any of that work.  Of course, *that* stuff got zipped up and uploaded to at least 3 locations on a weekly basis, so I was at least smartly paranoid about that.\r\n\r\nI guess this'll teach me though.  As soon as the PowerBook comes back, and I've reconstructed my external headspace on it, I'll be setting up nightly backups to the basement file server and plan on doing monthly archival to DVD.  I can't imagine how lost I'd be if I were *really* living in my laptop.  :)\r\n\r\n[tiger]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/04/30/initial_tiger_thoughts\r\n[lt]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/17/are_powerbook_hard_drives_supposed_to_sound_like_amiga_floppy_drives\r\n[ib]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/10/17/ooocoi\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=exocortex_stroke\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083290\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://virtuallyshocking.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=066c167d7062108915aa0eb5dd59d8bf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://virtuallyshocking.com\">Brock Tice</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083290\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-05T12:14:10\">2005-07-05T12:14:10</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">\"I didn’t lose this weekend’s tinkerings because I shared them here.\"\r\n\r\nVery Linus Torvalds, as in, \r\n\r\n\"Only wimps use tape backup: real men just upload their important stuff on ftp, and let the rest of the world mirror it.\"</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083292\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.glennf.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c6aef8227056393525931c8677077126&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.glennf.com\">Glenn Fleishman</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083292\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-05T12:54:18\">2005-07-05T12:54:18</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Remember DriveSavers: they charge a fortune, but if a year's worth of missing data is worth as much as a few grand to you, they might be able to recover it.

    "summary": "<p>So, this weekend, I suffered a sort of minor stroke in my exocortex.  The girl and I left for a bit to get food on Saturday afternoon and, when we got back, I found my PowerBook making grinding / growling noises from the general vicinity of its hard drive.  A reboot or two later, and the poor thing stopped bothering to spin up the drive and just sat there in blinking confusion looking for a System folder.</p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/17/are_powerbook_hard_drives_supposed_to_sound_like_amiga_floppy_drives\">if you&apos;ve been following along</a>, you might be thinking, &quot;Didn&apos;t he just go through this not too long ago?&quot;  If so, you&apos;d be right.  I&apos;m not sure what I do to these things, since <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/10/17/ooocoi\">I killed an iBook hard drive like this</a>, too.  I&apos;m very hesitant to blame Apple for this since, well, I&apos;m just really <em>not</em> a careful person when it comes to hardware.  I thank my lucky stars, so far, for AppleCare.</p>\n<p>The problem this time, though, is that the failure happened without warning.  The past two times, I had a bit of a gradual slide into failure with an agonizing period of intermittent function just long enough to evacuate some essentials onto another machine.  But this time, boom.  No warning.  And stupid me:  I deleted the backups I&apos;d made back <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/04/30/initial_tiger_thoughts\">when I upgraded to Tiger</a>.</p>\n<p>So, my last decent backup of anything is about a year old, from the last time I had a hard drive crash.  Thus, this feels a bit like a sound blow to the head.  I&apos;ve lost all my recent changes to my feed aggregator subscription list.  I&apos;ve lost all my Tinderbox documents.  I&apos;m still groping around for registration keys for all of my software.  The arrangement of tools I&apos;ve gotten used to being within finger-twitch range is now gone.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s been a long time since I had a serious failure in a machine I depend on where I didn&apos;t have a recovery plan.  Ouch.  The two things that are keeping me from going entirely bonkers are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The girl never sold her old iBook and I turned it into a replacement for our ailing house Linux server, so I have a backup machine until the PowerBook comes back.</li>\n<li>I didn&apos;t lose this weekend&apos;s tinkerings because I shared them here.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, it&apos;s lucky that I&apos;ve turned in all the chapters and artwork for the book, because I&apos;d&apos;ve really been strolling off a cliff if I&apos;d&apos;ve had to recreate any of that work.  Of course, <em>that</em> stuff got zipped up and uploaded to at least 3 locations on a weekly basis, so I was at least smartly paranoid about that.</p>\n<p>I guess this&apos;ll teach me though.  As soon as the PowerBook comes back, and I&apos;ve reconstructed my external headspace on it, I&apos;ll be setting up nightly backups to the basement file server and plan on doing monthly archival to DVD.  I can&apos;t imagine how lost I&apos;d be if I were <em>really</em> living in my laptop.  :)</p>\n"

(note that this is also one of the more annoying places if you want to support IE since it uses totally different semantics than the W3C standards.  unfortunately, even a vendor as major as my employer needs to cater to our 70% IE userbase, which is REALLY annoying with some of the CSS/DHTML tricks I'm working with right now.)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082858\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://annevankesteren.nl/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=55d00c982dd73dcab2a1d2b0f68f8f9a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://annevankesteren.nl/\">Anne</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082858\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-03T05:48:13\">2005-07-03T05:48:13</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">For the first you can use generated content in combination with _height:1%; for Internet Explorer.
