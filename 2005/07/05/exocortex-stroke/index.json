  "html": "<p>So, this weekend, I suffered a sort of minor stroke in my exocortex.  The girl and I left for a bit to get food on Saturday afternoon and, when we got back, I found my PowerBook making grinding / growling noises from the general vicinity of its hard drive.  A reboot or two later, and the poor thing stopped bothering to spin up the drive and just sat there in blinking confusion looking for a System folder.</p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/17/are_powerbook_hard_drives_supposed_to_sound_like_amiga_floppy_drives\">if you&#39;ve been following along</a>, you might be thinking, &quot;Didn&#39;t he just go through this not too long ago?&quot;  If so, you&#39;d be right.  I&#39;m not sure what I do to these things, since <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/10/17/ooocoi\">I killed an iBook hard drive like this</a>, too.  I&#39;m very hesitant to blame Apple for this since, well, I&#39;m just really <em>not</em> a careful person when it comes to hardware.  I thank my lucky stars, so far, for AppleCare.</p>\n<p>The problem this time, though, is that the failure happened without warning.  The past two times, I had a bit of a gradual slide into failure with an agonizing period of intermittent function just long enough to evacuate some essentials onto another machine.  But this time, boom.  No warning.  And stupid me:  I deleted the backups I&#39;d made back <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/04/30/initial_tiger_thoughts\">when I upgraded to Tiger</a>.</p>\n<p>So, my last decent backup of anything is about a year old, from the last time I had a hard drive crash.  Thus, this feels a bit like a sound blow to the head.  I&#39;ve lost all my recent changes to my feed aggregator subscription list.  I&#39;ve lost all my Tinderbox documents.  I&#39;m still groping around for registration keys for all of my software.  The arrangement of tools I&#39;ve gotten used to being within finger-twitch range is now gone.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s been a long time since I had a serious failure in a machine I depend on where I didn&#39;t have a recovery plan.  Ouch.  The two things that are keeping me from going entirely bonkers are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The girl never sold her old iBook and I turned it into a replacement for our ailing house Linux server, so I have a backup machine until the PowerBook comes back.</li>\n<li>I didn&#39;t lose this weekend&#39;s tinkerings because I shared them here.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, it&#39;s lucky that I&#39;ve turned in all the chapters and artwork for the book, because I&#39;d&#39;ve really been strolling off a cliff if I&#39;d&#39;ve had to recreate any of that work.  Of course, <em>that</em> stuff got zipped up and uploaded to at least 3 locations on a weekly basis, so I was at least smartly paranoid about that.</p>\n<p>I guess this&#39;ll teach me though.  As soon as the PowerBook comes back, and I&#39;ve reconstructed my external headspace on it, I&#39;ll be setting up nightly backups to the basement file server and plan on doing monthly archival to DVD.  I can&#39;t imagine how lost I&#39;d be if I were <em>really</em> living in my laptop.  :)</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=exocortex_stroke</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083290\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://virtuallyshocking.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=066c167d7062108915aa0eb5dd59d8bf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://virtuallyshocking.com\">Brock Tice</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083290\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-05T12:14:10\">2005-07-05T12:14:10</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\"I didn’t lose this weekend’s tinkerings because I shared them here.\"\nVery Linus Torvalds, as in, \n\"Only wimps use tape backup: real men just upload their important stuff on ftp, and let the rest of the world mirror it.\"</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083292\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.glennf.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c6aef8227056393525931c8677077126&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.glennf.com\">Glenn Fleishman</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083292\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-05T12:54:18\">2005-07-05T12:54:18</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Remember DriveSavers: they charge a fortune, but if a year's worth of missing data is worth as much as a few grand to you, they might be able to recover it.

They put a different brand drive in with a little more room than the one that had come with my Powerbook and I've been quite happy since.\nThe point of the story is, the more and more people I talk to the more and more I hear the same story. It seems like there might be an issue with the hard drive's that come from Apple. Those that have used Applecare are invariably writing about recurrent issues. Those who have gone elsewhere for a new drive seem to be doing ok.\nAnd now I'm going to sit here hoping I just didn't jinx myself.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083298\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://trikuare.cx/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7d3d1e46aae8ca19855a6026d404b91d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://trikuare.cx/\">fluffy</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083298\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-06T01:33:11\">2005-07-06T01:33:11</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Ever since my media drive died I've done weekly backups of all my laptop's drives onto an external 300GB firewire drive which I bought specifically for backing up.

I have done this for friendds  about 6 imes and at least have the time one can get it to boot at least once.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083295\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2a278cea1545cf4fe65c3682cd5b290e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Javier</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083295\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-05T13:28:20\">2005-07-05T13:28:20</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Don't kid yourself.

  "summary": "<p>So, this weekend, I suffered a sort of minor stroke in my exocortex.  The girl and I left for a bit to get food on Saturday afternoon and, when we got back, I found my PowerBook making grinding / growling noises from the general vicinity of its hard drive.  A reboot or two later, and the poor thing stopped bothering to spin up the drive and just sat there in blinking confusion looking for a System folder.</p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/17/are_powerbook_hard_drives_supposed_to_sound_like_amiga_floppy_drives\">if you&apos;ve been following along</a>, you might be thinking, &quot;Didn&apos;t he just go through this not too long ago?&quot;  If so, you&apos;d be right.  I&apos;m not sure what I do to these things, since <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/10/17/ooocoi\">I killed an iBook hard drive like this</a>, too.  I&apos;m very hesitant to blame Apple for this since, well, I&apos;m just really <em>not</em> a careful person when it comes to hardware.  I thank my lucky stars, so far, for AppleCare.</p>\n<p>The problem this time, though, is that the failure happened without warning.  The past two times, I had a bit of a gradual slide into failure with an agonizing period of intermittent function just long enough to evacuate some essentials onto another machine.  But this time, boom.  No warning.  And stupid me:  I deleted the backups I&apos;d made back <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/04/30/initial_tiger_thoughts\">when I upgraded to Tiger</a>.</p>\n<p>So, my last decent backup of anything is about a year old, from the last time I had a hard drive crash.  Thus, this feels a bit like a sound blow to the head.  I&apos;ve lost all my recent changes to my feed aggregator subscription list.  I&apos;ve lost all my Tinderbox documents.  I&apos;m still groping around for registration keys for all of my software.  The arrangement of tools I&apos;ve gotten used to being within finger-twitch range is now gone.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s been a long time since I had a serious failure in a machine I depend on where I didn&apos;t have a recovery plan.  Ouch.  The two things that are keeping me from going entirely bonkers are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The girl never sold her old iBook and I turned it into a replacement for our ailing house Linux server, so I have a backup machine until the PowerBook comes back.</li>\n<li>I didn&apos;t lose this weekend&apos;s tinkerings because I shared them here.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, it&apos;s lucky that I&apos;ve turned in all the chapters and artwork for the book, because I&apos;d&apos;ve really been strolling off a cliff if I&apos;d&apos;ve had to recreate any of that work.  Of course, <em>that</em> stuff got zipped up and uploaded to at least 3 locations on a weekly basis, so I was at least smartly paranoid about that.</p>\n<p>I guess this&apos;ll teach me though.  As soon as the PowerBook comes back, and I&apos;ve reconstructed my external headspace on it, I&apos;ll be setting up nightly backups to the basement file server and plan on doing monthly archival to DVD.  I can&apos;t imagine how lost I&apos;d be if I were <em>really</em> living in my laptop.  :)</p>\n"
