They can go as far as removing platters from the drive in a clean room.

Only do it if your not going to send it out for a recovery service.  \n</code></pre><p>   If the drive is not spinning, you can tell by the sound / feel take the hard drive out of the powerbook turn it on it side but not straight up and down but  on a slight tilt  about a foot over a hard wood surface   ( floor works fine )   and bang it once farly hard so that you hit the edge of one long side  with a nice  wack   ( your not trying to dent or break the case just loosen the heads if there stuck put it back in and pray ....      see if it will boot.  if so emediatly back it up! then get a new drive to replace it.   Stuck heads are a comon cause of drive falure when there not spinning. I have done this for friendds  about 6 imes and at least have the time one can get it to boot at least once.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083295&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2a278cea1545cf4fe65c3682cd5b290e&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Javier&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083295&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-07-05T13:28:20&quot;&gt;2005-07-05T13:28:20&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Don&#39;t kid yourself.

They put a different brand drive in with a little more room than the one that had come with my Powerbook and I&#39;ve been quite happy since.\n</code></pre><p>The point of the story is, the more and more people I talk to the more and more I hear the same story. It seems like there might be an issue with the hard drive&#39;s that come from Apple. Those that have used Applecare are invariably writing about recurrent issues. Those who have gone elsewhere for a new drive seem to be doing ok.</p>\n<p>And now I&#39;m going to sit here hoping I just didn&#39;t jinx myself.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083298&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://trikuare.cx/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7d3d1e46aae8ca19855a6026d404b91d&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://trikuare.cx/&quot;&gt;fluffy&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083298&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-07-06T01:33:11&quot;&gt;2005-07-06T01:33:11&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Ever since my media drive died I&#39;ve done weekly backups of all my laptop&#39;s drives onto an external 300GB firewire drive which I bought specifically for backing up.

powerbook just after I purchased a new 12&quot; powerbook. I started copying data from the 15&quot; to the 12&quot; left home for a while because it was estimated to take about 3 hours for the copy to happen. I came home and everything was fine, I mounted the 15&quot; drive onto my 12&quot; to copy anything I forgot and the drive was like all clunk, grind, clunk, clunk... I was all like huh? and then it died. It was 4 years old. I am thinking that Apple doesn&#39;t make machines like they used to. My old pismo is still a rock solid machine...&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
