But this time, I don't have to do anything-- it's timeshifted and cached to begin with.  This is what's different.\nAlso, you could say \"Hey, I put this MP3 up for download,\" but that'd be stupid.  Instead, push that notification in machine readable form into an RSS feed.  \nOn the other end, I have a machine (iTunes 4.9, most recently) that reads your feed and I don't have to pay attention and download anything myself-- it just shows up and I've got it by the time I think to look for it.  This is what's different.\nPut it all together, and you've got something that's actually a new thing.  It's a kind of subscription-based, timeshifted audio tech we didn't have before.

The name podcast came about because the people smart enough to make this all come about, HAPPENED TO OWN IPODS!  Get over it -the system works on others, it's a catchy name, and it's in millions of homes already.  \nIf you are sick of so-called 'stupid' or biased names then 1)Get smart, 2)Create something new, and 3)Call it I'mSoSmartCasting -until then, start enjoying the fruits of other peoples' labors and leave them be when they name it what they want.</div>\n\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085044\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://jackkonblog.blogspot.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=6ee23e2be161988996f69c7a48d10daf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\"></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://jackkonblog.blogspot.com/\">Jack Krupansky</a>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#comment-221085044\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-08-11T17:26:54\">2005-08-11T17:26:54</time></a></p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"content\">Call it what it really is:  Old wine in a new bottle.  Of course, there's nothing wrong with new bottle's per se.  A convenient handle, easy-pour, easy open/close, more appealing packaging, better distribution whatever.\nI agree that podcasting is really nothing intrinsically *new*, other than the packaging and distribution, but in our consumer economy, packaging and distribution are everything.\nNote:  I see a lot of references to podcasts which do *not* involve the use of web feeds, such as \"Click here to download our podcast\", are these misuses of the term \"podcast\"?  In other words, is the concept of a podcast inherently linked to the mechanism for distribution (i.e., via XML web feed)?\n-- Jack Krupansky</div>\n\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085045\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\"></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#comment-221085045\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-08-11T17:48:13\">2005-08-11T17:48:13</time></a></p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"content\">Jack:  Yes, anyone who serves up a page with a link to an MP3 and calls that a podcast doesn't know what the term means.  They're just trying to ride the buzz without a clue.\nFeed subscription and automated download is the not-so-secret sauce of podcasting.  Automation is the key.  Otherwise, you might as well choose long division over using a calculator.</div>\n\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085046\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e0e01aa1d857dad66320e6c060fd5060&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\"></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"\">Mike Prescott</a>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#comment-221085046\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-08-18T18:44:40\">2005-08-18T18:44:40</time></a></p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"content\">Streaming audio = technology\nStreaming audio + rss feed + podcatcher + whatever else I missed = service\nwe're a service oriented society\nI still like ReplayRadio (VCR for internet radio) because it doesn't require RSS which alot of the shows I like on BBC haven't gone to yet.

Of course, there's nothing wrong with new bottle's per se.  A convenient handle, easy-pour, easy open/close, more appealing packaging, better distribution whatever.\r\n\r\nI agree that podcasting is really nothing intrinsically *new*, other than the packaging and distribution, but in our consumer economy, packaging and distribution are everything.\r\n\r\nNote:  I see a lot of references to podcasts which do *not* involve the use of web feeds, such as \"Click here to download our podcast\", are these misuses of the term \"podcast\"?  In other words, is the concept of a podcast inherently linked to the mechanism for distribution (i.e., via XML web feed)?\r\n\r\n-- Jack Krupansky</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085045\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085045\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-08-11T17:48:13\">2005-08-11T17:48:13</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Jack:  Yes, anyone who serves up a page with a link to an MP3 and calls that a podcast doesn't know what the term means.
