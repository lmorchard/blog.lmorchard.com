I comment on your book and you respond to it. That is almost as cool as your book.</p>\n<p>I've started playing around with Python and I can see why you chose it--it's clean-looking and easy to use. I'm going to use your code as is but if you get stuff working in PHP maybe I'll switch over to that. I have my employability to think about and also my ability to recruit people to projects I'm working on, should they take off to any degree. I have made the mistake before of choosing a quality language over a popular one. But doing the opposite has its own problems (productivity and ease of maintenance come to mind).</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm thrilled with your book and the code is a huge jump-start.

Several of the examples, particularly the Atom feed, were out of date.

Frankly, I think you're being a little too sensitive on this issue. You had a choice to make (between perl, python, ruby, and php) and you made it. You chose a mainstream language that is easily readable by anyone conversant in any other mainstream language. I'm sure you could make better use of your time than writing translations to another language - a task that an adept in any of the other languages could do.</p>\n<p>As a practical matter, most of us select a 'vector' of languages for our daily work. In my case the vector consists of c, ruby, perl, and vb. Over the years the specific languages in my vector have changed, but the vector length has remained constant. (and c has always been a member). For other people the vector length might be slightly longer or shorter, but hardly anyone's vector will include every language that an author might choose for his sample code.</p>\n<p>My advice : keep on using the language that is the best fit for you. Focus on the ideas, and develop interesting applications.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084250\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://boston.conman.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bbb1c69b64019a3df907c3545186f907&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://boston.conman.org/\">Sean Conner</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084250\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-02T08:09:42\">2006-01-02T08:09:42</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Be daring!

I think Python is still a good language for the book, because it is typographically pleasing (significant whitespace), doesn't use too much punctuation, and uses normal constructs, like func(args).  Notably when people use pseudocode in books, it usually looks <em>very</em> much like Python.  Except often they use weird mathematic notation and characters, just because they can ;)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084243\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084243\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-31T19:34:18\">2005-12-31T19:34:18</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Ian: I've been considering offering some PHP conversions of a few things from the book.

I'm going to use your code as is but if you get stuff working in PHP maybe I'll switch over to that. I have my employability to think about and also my ability to recruit people to projects I'm working on, should they take off to any degree. I have made the mistake before of choosing a quality language over a popular one.

Frankly, I think you're being a little too sensitive on this issue. You had a choice to make (between perl, python, ruby, and php) and you made it. You chose a mainstream language that is easily readable by anyone conversant in any other mainstream language. I'm sure you could make better use of your time than writing translations to another language - a task that an adept in any of the other languages could do.</p>\n\n<p>As a practical matter, most of us select a 'vector' of languages for our daily work. In my case the vector consists of c, ruby, perl, and vb. Over the years the specific languages in my vector have changed, but the vector length has remained constant. (and c has always been a member). For other people the vector length might be slightly longer or shorter, but hardly anyone's vector will include every language that an author might choose for his sample code.</p>\n\n<p>My advice : keep on using the language that is the best fit for you. Focus on the ideas, and develop interesting applications.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084250\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://boston.conman.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bbb1c69b64019a3df907c3545186f907&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://boston.conman.org/\">Sean Conner</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084250\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-02T08:09:42\">2006-01-02T08:09:42</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Be daring!
