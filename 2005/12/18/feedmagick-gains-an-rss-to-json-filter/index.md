So, I put [some more infrastructure][in] behind [FeedMagick][fm] and lifted [a RSS-to-JSON idea from John Resig][jr] to transform from [MagpieRSS][mr] parsing to JSON output.  

Here's [a spiffy JSON-enriched demo][jd].  It was surprisingly easy, all told.

I'm not sure how much time I'll have to really put into this project, but this is the first decent effort I've put into a URL-line suite in a long time.  I'm trying to throw in some bits to make it easy to build, document, and use these feed processing commands.
