It&#39;s got more crud than I left behind in Perl, but without all the meta-magic that made it worth it.  And, I get a little nervous tic when I think about it in relation to Python and Ruby.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it&#39;s ubiquitous and cheapâ€”and because it&#39;s in the hands of people with all levels of skill, most popular PHP apps have by necessity managed a high standard of easy install and simplicity.  The languages with more meta-magic tend to attract eggheads (myself included) who can forget about keeping things simple.</p>\n<p>And, did I mention PHP is ubiquitous?</p>\n<!-- tags: php webdev perl python ruby -->\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083537\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.whump.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=152a649080e99c313ecae9a34c60d11d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.whump.com/\">Bill Humphries</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083537\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-19T06:38:33\">2005-12-19T06:38:33</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><ol>\n<li>PHP has some future-proofing in that almost everyone doing web development knows it or can pick it up.

WTF?), what I despise about PHP is how hard it is to build and deploy it with a ny extensions to the basic feature set.&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre><p>If you need to do images, you compile in LibGD, if you want to render text, you get the freetype libraries, if you need something that isn&#39;t mysql, you compile that in- and then off you go trying to find the version of libJpeg from 1993, because the ancient version of libGD that&#39;s bundled with PHP doesn&#39;t work with anything more recent.</p>\n\n<p>Plain-vanilla PHP is ubiquitous, but trying to roll your own on an arbitrary box somewhere and do something that doesn&#39;t come with the default PHP that ships with your distribution is a huge and unnecessary pain in the ass. Perl can be annoying, but at least it isn&#39;t a monolithic binary- the library system drastically reduces the cross-component dependencies that PHP suffers from.</p>\n\n<p><p>PHP sucks, and it amazes me that it is so ubiquitous. On the otherhand, so is Microsoft Windows.</p></div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
