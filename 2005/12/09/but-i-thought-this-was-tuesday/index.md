Oh yeah, and the reason for the recent bout of radio silence around here:  Some very cool, but very mentally consuming projects have ramped up at work.  I'm not sure, but maybe I'll get the time and the nod and the motivation to talk about them eventually.  Meanwhile, back in the basement again, I've gotten into the thick of writing a second book.  

More soon, but bed and a sleepy girl beckon.  Have to keep my priorities straight.
