Nice changes on balance: It seems a bit more polished now, and among other things, the thumbnails have some mini-navigation controls.  But, now there&#39;s too much crammed in there for my 12&quot; screen.  </p>\n<p>So, I&#39;ve started hacking my <code>userChrome.css</code> again:</p>\n<pre><code>#sidebar {\n    min-width: 0px !important;\n    max-width: none !important;\n}\n#sidebar-title { display: none !important }\nsidebarheader  { display: none}\n\n.tbs-tabpreviews .tbs-close   { display:none !important; }\n.tbs-tabpreviews .tbs-favicon { display:none !important; }\n.tbs-tabpreviews .tbs-title   { font-size: 0.825em !important; }\n\n.tbs-tabpreview:hover .tbs-canvas, \n.tbs-tabpreview[selected=&quot;true&quot;] .tbs-canvas {\n    opacity: 1 !important;\n}\n.tbs-tabpreview[selected=&quot;false&quot;] .tbs-canvas {\n    opacity: 1 !important;\n}\n</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, that last bit with the opacity doesn&#39;t work.  I want to disable the dimming of unselected tabs, so that all tab previews are 100% opaque at all times and not just when selected.  See, I don&#39;t need the current tab to be fully clearâ€”it&#39;s what I&#39;m looking at right now.  I need all the other tab previews to be as clear as possible.</p>\n"}
