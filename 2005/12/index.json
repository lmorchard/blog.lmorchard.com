Notably when people use pseudocode in books, it usually looks <em>very</em> much like Python.

Frankly, I think you're being a little too sensitive on this issue. You had a choice to make (between perl, python, ruby, and php) and you made it. You chose a mainstream language that is easily readable by anyone conversant in any other mainstream language. I'm sure you could make better use of your time than writing translations to another language - a task that an adept in any of the other languages could do.</p>\n<p>As a practical matter, most of us select a 'vector' of languages for our daily work. In my case the vector consists of c, ruby, perl, and vb. Over the years the specific languages in my vector have changed, but the vector length has remained constant. (and c has always been a member). For other people the vector length might be slightly longer or shorter, but hardly anyone's vector will include every language that an author might choose for his sample code.</p>\n<p>My advice : keep on using the language that is the best fit for you. Focus on the ideas, and develop interesting applications.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084250\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://boston.conman.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bbb1c69b64019a3df907c3545186f907&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://boston.conman.org/\">Sean Conner</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084250\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-02T08:09:42\">2006-01-02T08:09:42</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Be daring!

More thinking to do, but I thought I'd get these thoughts out there at least.\r\n\r\n[nb]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/14/hacking-delicious-is-a-real-book\r\n[perl]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/10/16/seeing-out-opposites\r\n[mp]: http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/\r\n[ufp]: http://feedparser.org\r\n[bo]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1\r\n[php]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/18/not-so-deep-php-thoughts\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084242\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084242\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-31T19:22:56\">2005-12-31T19:22:56</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Some authors provide translations of the code in a book online; you could translate all of your book into PHP, for instance.  I think Python is still a good language for the book, because it is typographically pleasing (significant whitespace), doesn't use too much punctuation, and uses normal constructs, like func(args).  Notably when people use pseudocode in books, it usually looks <em>very</em> much like Python.

Frankly, I think you're being a little too sensitive on this issue. You had a choice to make (between perl, python, ruby, and php) and you made it. You chose a mainstream language that is easily readable by anyone conversant in any other mainstream language. I'm sure you could make better use of your time than writing translations to another language - a task that an adept in any of the other languages could do.</p>\n\n<p>As a practical matter, most of us select a 'vector' of languages for our daily work. In my case the vector consists of c, ruby, perl, and vb. Over the years the specific languages in my vector have changed, but the vector length has remained constant. (and c has always been a member). For other people the vector length might be slightly longer or shorter, but hardly anyone's vector will include every language that an author might choose for his sample code.</p>\n\n<p>My advice : keep on using the language that is the best fit for you. Focus on the ideas, and develop interesting applications.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084250\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://boston.conman.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bbb1c69b64019a3df907c3545186f907&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://boston.conman.org/\">Sean Conner</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084250\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-02T08:09:42\">2006-01-02T08:09:42</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Be daring!

    "html": "<p>Part of the reason this whole <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/10/27/extend.html\">must ignore</a> thing with respect to feeds has me <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/13/feedmagick-the-feed-filter-that-doesnt-know-much-about-feeds\">a bit fired up</a> is because it seems like so few feed processing tools out there embrace this idea.  And because of that, these tools are unfortunately brittle and prone to future shock.</p>\n<p>For example, take <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb\"><code>Syndication.framework</code> on OS X</a>:  Amongst the monkeys and ninjas and pirates and robots, you&#39;ve got your standard <em>title-date-link-description</em> columns with a few other bits for good measure.  But, where&#39;s the data from <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/static/iTunesRSS.html\">iTunes RSS extensions</a>?  Nowhere, gone, lost.  If it was in the feed when <code>Syndication.framework</code> found it, it wasn&#39;t understood and so it wasn&#39;t retained after the parser finished chewing up and spitting the data into that DB table.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/building-a-proper-shared-syndication-feed-foundation\">I&#39;ve written about shared feed processing foundations before</a>, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve totally gotten the idea to gel in my head until now.  Here&#39;s the thing:  If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.  Rather than intrusively breaking apart and recasting feed data into a predetermined data structure, you&#39;ve got to remain hands-off as much as possible.</p>\n<p>This is what I did in <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a>.  This code can subscribe to feeds, poll feed data periodically, and even work out which items in a feed are new—but it punts on everything else by only caring about where a feed starts and ends, and where its individual entries start and end.  <em>The rest is left in its original XML form.</em>  So, if there was data in there for iTunes?  It&#39;s still there, because <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a> didn&#39;t know enough to do anything to it.</p>\n<p>This is the major difference in feed processing model.  <code>Syndication.framework</code> loses information when it encounters things it doesn&#39;t understand.  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a> retains the information, because it leaves things alone when it doesn&#39;t know any better.</p>\n<p>Now, this is not to pick on just <code>Syndication.framework</code>.  Despite the general-sounding name,  this framework is pretty much just around to power <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/\">Safari RSS</a> and not <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/\">iTunes</a> or anything else.  And as I said, pretty much every other feed processing framework and tool works in this manner.  Just about everybody uses a destructive process when they parse and marshal feed data into local-idiom structures.  </p>\n<p>And this destructive process is fine when all you want to do is satisfy a specific purpose—display a few headlines, for example.  But if you&#39;re trying to build general-case feed plumbing, this is unacceptable and untenable.  If most everything in a feed item gets lost as it goes through a pipeline, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/05/the-right-place-for-data-in-your-feed\">we might as well abandon feed extensions entirely in favor of microformats stuffed into the <code>description</code> tag</a>—an idea to which I&#39;m not <em>entirely</em> opposed.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, consider this:  This past summer, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/four-thoughts-on-ms-rss-so-far\">Microsoft released an architectural overview about an OS-wide RSS framework in the upcoming Vista</a>.  Unfortunately, like many RSS and Vista related things from this past summer, all links have evaporated into a redirect to a single developers portal.  I can&#39;t figure out why they didn&#39;t just <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/rss/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/rsssupportinlonghorn.asp\">redirect over to here</a>, which took me a search and a few clicks to rediscover.</p>\n<p>At any rate, there&#39;s one sentence in this overview that gives me hope for RSS as a general service in Windows Vista:  </p>\n<p>&quot;<em>It is also possible to access the item XML for applications that want to perform operations on the XML instead of using the item&#39;s properties.</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>So, dig that.  If it works the way I hope it does, RSS in Vista will take care of the subscriptions for you, poll the feed data, grab new stuff—but then it leaves the data intact for you to process whatever new and unanticipated feed payloads that may arrive.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s how it <em>should</em> work.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084486\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=622a34307765c2f7c1dfdc7345842418&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\">Darren Chamberlain</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-13T15:03:07\">2005-12-13T15:03:07</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n<p>If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.

    "body": "Part of the reason this whole [must ignore][mi] thing with respect to feeds has me [a bit fired up][fir] is because it seems like so few feed processing tools out there embrace this idea.  And because of that, these tools are unfortunately brittle and prone to future shock.\r\n\r\nFor example, take [`Syndication.framework` on OS X][sx]:  Amongst the monkeys and ninjas and pirates and robots, you've got your standard *title-date-link-description* columns with a few other bits for good measure.  But, where's the data from [iTunes RSS extensions][ir]?  Nowhere, gone, lost.  If it was in the feed when `Syndication.framework` found it, it wasn't understood and so it wasn't retained after the parser finished chewing up and spitting the data into that DB table.\r\n\r\n[I've written about shared feed processing foundations before][sf], but I don't think I've totally gotten the idea to gel in my head until now.  Here's the thing:  If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.  Rather than intrusively breaking apart and recasting feed data into a predetermined data structure, you've got to remain hands-off as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThis is what I did in [FeedSpool][fs].  This code can subscribe to feeds, poll feed data periodically, and even work out which items in a feed are new—but it punts on everything else by only caring about where a feed starts and ends, and where its individual entries start and end.  *The rest is left in its original XML form.*  So, if there was data in there for iTunes?  It's still there, because [FeedSpool][fs] didn't know enough to do anything to it.\r\n\r\nThis is the major difference in feed processing model.  `Syndication.framework` loses information when it encounters things it doesn't understand.  [FeedSpool][fs] retains the information, because it leaves things alone when it doesn't know any better.\r\n\r\nNow, this is not to pick on just `Syndication.framework`.  Despite the general-sounding name,  this framework is pretty much just around to power [Safari RSS][sr] and not [iTunes][itp] or anything else.  And as I said, pretty much every other feed processing framework and tool works in this manner.  Just about everybody uses a destructive process when they parse and marshal feed data into local-idiom structures.  \r\n\r\nAnd this destructive process is fine when all you want to do is satisfy a specific purpose—display a few headlines, for example.  But if you're trying to build general-case feed plumbing, this is unacceptable and untenable.  If most everything in a feed item gets lost as it goes through a pipeline, [we might as well abandon feed extensions entirely in favor of microformats stuffed into the `description` tag][fmf]—an idea to which I'm not *entirely* opposed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, consider this:  This past summer, [Microsoft released an architectural overview about an OS-wide RSS framework in the upcoming Vista][ao].  Unfortunately, like many RSS and Vista related things from this past summer, all links have evaporated into a redirect to a single developers portal.  I can't figure out why they didn't just [redirect over to here][he], which took me a search and a few clicks to rediscover.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, there's one sentence in this overview that gives me hope for RSS as a general service in Windows Vista:  \r\n\r\n\"*It is also possible to access the item XML for applications that want to perform operations on the XML instead of using the item's properties.*\"\r\n\r\nSo, dig that.  If it works the way I hope it does, RSS in Vista will take care of the subscriptions for you, poll the feed data, grab new stuff—but then it leaves the data intact for you to process whatever new and unanticipated feed payloads that may arrive.\r\n\r\nThat's how it *should* work.\r\n\r\n[fmf]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/05/the-right-place-for-data-in-your-feed\r\n[itp]: http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/\r\n[fir]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/13/feedmagick-the-feed-filter-that-doesnt-know-much-about-feeds\r\n[sr]: http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/\r\n[he]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/rss/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/rsssupportinlonghorn.asp\r\n[tc]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/integrated/\r\n[ao]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/four-thoughts-on-ms-rss-so-far\r\n[fs]: http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\r\n[ir]: http://phobos.apple.com/static/iTunesRSS.html\r\n[sx]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb\r\n[sf]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/building-a-proper-shared-syndication-feed-foundation\r\n[mi]: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/10/27/extend.html\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084486\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=622a34307765c2f7c1dfdc7345842418&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\">Darren Chamberlain</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-13T15:03:07\">2005-12-13T15:03:07</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n  <p>If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.

So, say, I want to filter a feed for only items containing a certain phrase in the description—or maybe I want items with <code>osx</code> in a <code>dc:subject</code> element.</p>\n<p>And how about some blenders?  That is, I pass in any number of feed URLs and get one merged feed out the other end.  I&#39;ve got a chapter in my book on these, in Python—but it&#39;d be handy to have them in PHP as well.</p>\n<p>Have I just not looked hard enough?  By now, I&#39;d&#39;ve thought this sort of thing would be all tied up in a bow and at the top of the Google charts by now.  It makes me wish I&#39;d used PHP in my book, rather than Python—and only because of PHP&#39;s irresistible ubiquity.  Coding in PHP still makes me gag, just a bit.</p>\n<p>But, if the lazy web doesn&#39;t deliver, I guess I&#39;ll be cobbling it together myself soon.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084449\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.surlysoft.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=815c14d8894ca4b5128c6ab3e30765fb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.surlysoft.com\">Grant Schofield</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084449\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-09T06:33:36\">2005-12-09T06:33:36</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>While I agree with you on the PHP front I had heard of an RSS parser in PHP called <a href=\"http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magpie</a>.

So, say, I want to filter a feed for only items containing a certain phrase in the description—or maybe I want items with `osx` in a `dc:subject` element.\r\n\r\nAnd how about some blenders?  That is, I pass in any number of feed URLs and get one merged feed out the other end.  I've got a chapter in my book on these, in Python—but it'd be handy to have them in PHP as well.\r\n\r\nHave I just not looked hard enough?

    "html": "<p>You know, after spewing out <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/11/gopher-ng/feedroll.html\">that feedroll</a> last night, I came to the realization that I just track way too many people and things to ever really have a sane yet comprehensive blogroll that covers it all.  (And by sane I mean:  Suitable for inclusion in the traditional sidebar position.)</p>\n<p>I could work up a &quot;best of&quot; subset from that list, but then I start remembering this past Spring&#39;s blogroll <em><a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/03/15/steve-levy-dave-sifrey-and-nz-bear-you-are-hurting-us/\">sturm</a> und <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/05/06/lets-keep-the-blogroll-and-throw-away-the-writing/\">drang</a></em> and don&#39;t even want to get into picking cool kids or granting googlejuice favors.  And besides, at that point, the culling would make it miss the whole point of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/11/27/subscriptions-are-attention-but-what-about-blogrolls\">representing my attention</a>, which is what suckered me into this line of tinkering to begin with.</p>\n<p>So, maybe I won&#39;t ever have a blogroll.  Instead, my feedroll will just morph into an old-school &quot;links&quot; or &quot;elsewhere&quot; page.  If I publish and maintain such a page, you&#39;d never have to wait on me to upload or submit any OPML:  Just find or ask me for my site&#39;s URL, visit my site, and scoop up my shared public feedroll.  </p>\n<p><strong>It&#39;s small-s-semantic-web-o-riffic.</strong></p>\n<p>It could be linked into my home page and every blog entry with an autodiscovery method similar to my Atom and RSS feeds.  Parse that, and you&#39;ve got my declarations of attention.  Spider it periodically into the future, and you&#39;ve got constant updates.  If I get ambitious, maybe I&#39;ll look into SSE extensions in an RSS feed behind it.</p>\n<p>Of course, I realize that OPML could be handled this way too—but my microformatted feedroll will be <a href=\"http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75ishimmer.phtml\">a human-browsable dessert topping and machine-parseable floor wax</a>, all in one!</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085496\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8157a5907b244071cda98ba5aa7a9635&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085496\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-01T19:32:44\">2005-12-01T19:32:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I have a tiny unmaintained list on my home page, and link there to my BlogLines subscription list.

    "body": "You know, after spewing out [that feedroll][fr] last night, I came to the realization that I just track way too many people and things to ever really have a sane yet comprehensive blogroll that covers it all.  (And by sane I mean:  Suitable for inclusion in the traditional sidebar position.)\r\n\r\nI could work up a \"best of\" subset from that list, but then I start remembering this past Spring's blogroll *[sturm][br] und [drang][dr]* and don't even want to get into picking cool kids or granting googlejuice favors.  And besides, at that point, the culling would make it miss the whole point of [representing my attention][att], which is what suckered me into this line of tinkering to begin with.\r\n\r\nSo, maybe I won't ever have a blogroll.  Instead, my feedroll will just morph into an old-school \"links\" or \"elsewhere\" page.  If I publish and maintain such a page, you'd never have to wait on me to upload or submit any OPML:  Just find or ask me for my site's URL, visit my site, and scoop up my shared public feedroll.  \r\n\r\n**It's small-s-semantic-web-o-riffic.**\r\n\r\nIt could be linked into my home page and every blog entry with an autodiscovery method similar to my Atom and RSS feeds.  Parse that, and you've got my declarations of attention.  Spider it periodically into the future, and you've got constant updates.  If I get ambitious, maybe I'll look into SSE extensions in an RSS feed behind it.\r\n\r\nOf course, I realize that OPML could be handled this way too—but my microformatted feedroll will be [a human-browsable dessert topping and machine-parseable floor wax][snl], all in one!\r\n\r\n[dr]: http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/05/06/lets-keep-the-blogroll-and-throw-away-the-writing/\r\n[att]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/11/27/subscriptions-are-attention-but-what-about-blogrolls\r\n[del.icio.us]: http://del.icio.us\r\n[br]: http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/03/15/steve-levy-dave-sifrey-and-nz-bear-you-are-hurting-us/\r\n[fr]: http://decafbad.com/2005/11/gopher-ng/feedroll.html\r\n[snl]: http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75ishimmer.phtml\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085496\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8157a5907b244071cda98ba5aa7a9635&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085496\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-01T19:32:44\">2005-12-01T19:32:44</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I have a tiny unmaintained list on my home page, and link there to my BlogLines subscription list.
