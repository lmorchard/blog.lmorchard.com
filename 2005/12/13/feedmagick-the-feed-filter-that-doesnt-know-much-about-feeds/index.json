It wasn&#39;t <em>that</em> bad, and there were a few nice toys to be found so far in PHP—but I think I&#39;ll need some peer-review to tell me how well I&#39;m following the local idiom.  Also, my XML mojo may suffer from some unintentional ignorance.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the main idea behind this feed filtering kit is that I&#39;m not parsing and reconstituting feeds at the format level.   Instead, I&#39;m diving down to the <em>XML level</em> with <a href=\"http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-tipsaxflex.html\">SAX filters</a>.  Having finally realized the meaning of <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/12/03/versioning.html\"><strong>Must Ignore</strong></a>, this was a particularly interesting realization to me—so I hope you&#39;ll bear with me as I tell the story...</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-it-doesnt-do\">What it doesn&#39;t do:</h3>\n<p>See, I&#39;m not using <a href=\"http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/\">MagpieRSS</a> to chew up feeds into PHP structures, and I&#39;m not using PHP structures <a href=\"http://hublog.hubmed.org/archives/000919.html\">to splice together a new feed</a>.  You see, since starting with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a>, I&#39;ve come to believe that ignorance is bliss and <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick\">FeedMagick</a> is a continuation of this notion.  </p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick\">FeedMagick</a>, I&#39;m mostly ignoring feed format specifics.  The only thing this code really cares about are <code>item</code> and <code>entry</code> tags, and the rest gets blindly passed along.  Of course, <em>you</em> can write filter subclasses which <em>do</em> know and care about other feed elements—but the beauty is that neither you nor I need to write code that cares about <em>all possible feed elements ever</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-it-doesnt-do-it\">Why it doesn&#39;t do it:</h3>\n<p>When you write a <a href=\"http://www.feedparser.org/\">general parser for feeds</a>, there are a lot of permutations that need worrying about.

Oh, and what about <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\">calendar events</a>?  What happens to your filter if people start doing interesting things with all of these extensions?  </p>\n<p>Even if the parser author managed to pull off passing along all the information contained in the feed—pretty much reinventing the XML wheel past a certain point—you&#39;ll need to anticipate what all that information might be in order to rebuild the feed basically from scratch on the other end of the filter.
