It’s fun! Try it!<br /><br />The fact that there are weird column names was inspired by sqlite’s (then-)inability to add columns to existing tables. So the last time I had to break the schema to add a new column, I added four more as a reserve.<br /><br />Needless to say, the contents, schema and very existence of that database are subject to change without notice, etc. etc.</blockquote>\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb#comment-3165\">A comment by Jens Alfke</a></small></p>\n<p>Remember <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb\">when I wrote about the SQLite DB backing Safari RSS</a>?

I love hearing about this sort of trivia behind the code!  :)</p>\n<!-- tags: osx monkey pirate ninja robot rss atom syndication -->\n"}
