    "html": "<blockquote>I keep seeing flashes of text, sentence-bursts that I have the impulse to blog and then, inevitably, evaporate in a \"nah, too short.\" I have no doubt that in my case not just the tool (movabletype) but also my weblog's design have influenced me to go for longer, article-like posts rather than the shorter posts we see elsewhere.\n</blockquote>\n<div align=\"right\"><small>Source: <cite><a href=\"http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/003112.html\">d2r - a tool's influence</a></cite></small></div>\nIt suddenly occurred to me that I haven't *actually* written more here [as I thought I would][write], since starting the book.  Well, I suppose that can be excused since almost immediately after making that prediction, I launched into working on a side job that has kept me pretty busy, along with the main day job, and catching up on the book (up to about 1/3 written now!)\n\n<p>However, it also occurred to me that I&#39;ve been holding back on writing anything that runs under 100 words here.  <em>That&#39;s not an essay!  Why go through the trouble of posting that?</em>, I&#39;ve been thinking.  I&#39;m in the same boat with Diego, whom I&#39;ve quoted above, because not only does my Movable Type installation seem pretty much like a freighter when I want to post something, but I&#39;ve built all the templates to be mostly biased toward Entries of Epic Import--which is, well, a little presumptuous and gives me a lot of incentive to just not come back here much.  </p>\n<p>So, a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I think I&#39;m going to try more quick sentence-blogging, but maybe just as a daily dump of quickies in a single post for now.  I&#39;ll just keep an <a href=\"http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/\">ecto</a> window open through the day and mumble into it periodically.</li>\n<li>I&#39;m still planning my annual refresh of this place, so I think when I get time to do that, I&#39;ll make better considerations for short posts, ala <a href=\"http://www.kottke.org/\">Kottke</a> or <a href=\"http://photomatt.net/2004/05/19/asides/\">Photo Matt</a>.</li>\n<li>Also, having just worked with writing Jabber and AIM chatbots for my book, I&#39;m thinking it might be a nifty idea to post via IM.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/12/the_blogosphere_as_a_tuple_space\">Think tiny tuples</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway, I&#39;m still out here, still alive.  Just working my ass off and neglecting just about everything else in my life.

    "body": "<blockquote>I keep seeing flashes of text, sentence-bursts that I have the impulse to blog and then, inevitably, evaporate in a \"nah, too short.\" I have no doubt that in my case not just the tool (movabletype) but also my weblog's design have influenced me to go for longer, article-like posts rather than the shorter posts we see elsewhere.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><small>Source: <cite><a href=\"http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/003112.html\">d2r - a tool's influence</a></cite></small></div>\r\nIt suddenly occurred to me that I haven't *actually* written more here [as I thought I would][write], since starting the book.  Well, I suppose that can be excused since almost immediately after making that prediction, I launched into working on a side job that has kept me pretty busy, along with the main day job, and catching up on the book (up to about 1/3 written now!)\r\n\r\n[write]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/07/belated_happy_new_year\r\n\r\nHowever, it also occurred to me that I've been holding back on writing anything that runs under 100 words here.  *That's not an essay!  Why go through the trouble of posting that?*, I've been thinking.  I'm in the same boat with Diego, whom I've quoted above, because not only does my Movable Type installation seem pretty much like a freighter when I want to post something, but I've built all the templates to be mostly biased toward Entries of Epic Import--which is, well, a little presumptuous and gives me a lot of incentive to just not come back here much.  \r\n\r\nSo, a few things:\r\n\r\n* I think I'm going to try more quick sentence-blogging, but maybe just as a daily dump of quickies in a single post for now.  I'll just keep an [ecto][ecto] window open through the day and mumble into it periodically.\r\n* I'm still planning my annual refresh of this place, so I think when I get time to do that, I'll make better considerations for short posts, ala [Kottke](http://www.kottke.org/) or [Photo Matt](http://photomatt.net/2004/05/19/asides/).\r\n* Also, having just worked with writing Jabber and AIM chatbots for my book, I'm thinking it might be a nifty idea to post via IM.  [Think tiny tuples][tuples].\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm still out here, still alive.  Just working my ass off and neglecting just about everything else in my life.
