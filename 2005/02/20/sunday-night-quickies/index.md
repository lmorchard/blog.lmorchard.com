I want a quickie posting theme like Strongbad's rap about [answerin' the emails][emails].

* Wow.  This a capella cover of TMBG's "Particle Man" I just [heard on Coverville][cover] by [The Bobs][bobs] absolutely rocks.

* And then, I realize that I've heard The Bobs before.  In particular, it was from when I used to listen to the [Dr. Demento Show][demento] and heard their song "[My, I'm Large][large]".  Now, that takes me back.

* Got [a comment from Mark Eichin][markcomment] that reminded me I forgot to link to something I posted a few years ago: [Perceptible interface + laziness threshold = weblog silence][lazy]

* I just helped my friend Erik (aka We3bus) get [The Biofeedback Blog][bfb] up and running for his company with [WordPress 1.5][wp]--I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with it.  It was a gigantic pain in the ass, since we ran into problems with damn near *every* component of the setup, from MySQL to IIS to WordPress itself.  Granted, this is a bit of a non-typical install, but damn...  Anyway, check them out.

* [A comment from Jason Clark][jcc] makes me think a little more about ideas I've had about customized feeds to offer here for the next refresh.  I've gotten on a run posting political links because, well, I've got some very definite opinions about our current situation--but you might not care about that.  Was thinking that I might offer a mix-your-own-feed form where you can pick and choose from kinds of posts and tags I'll be using.  The proper place for this is in the aggregator, but it could be a fun project for the book.

            <div class="content">Les, what kind of problems did you run into with WordPress? There is a login/redirection problem on IIS (due to an IIS bug) that we're aware of. There will be a 1.5.1 release coming out soon with a workaround. Details can be found here:

            <div class="content">Dougal: Actually, that's was the problem we had-- which, now that I think about it again, is much more a bug with IIS than with WordPress.  We hacked WP in a few places, but the dot-release to fix things properly will certainly be more than welcome!</div>
