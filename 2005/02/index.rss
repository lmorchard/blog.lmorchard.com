          <title>1.21 quickiewatts?!  (What the hell is a quickiewatt?!?)</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;The Back to the Future trilogy is, hands down, a work of genius.  And I was overjoyed to watch the whole run on TNT this weekend while I worked on yet another book chapter.


Someone needs to buy me the complete BTTF trilogy.  Or, maybe I need to buy it, once my head bobs above water.


Why is pasting plain old unformatted text in Microsoft Word considered a &quot;special&quot; paste action?

And, if Word helpfully extends my selection range one more time, I&#39;ll shoot it.  I thought I turned that damn feature off.

Have I mentioned that I hate Microsoft Word?  I&#39;m up to about 175 pages across 8 chapters written, and I find myself gazing wistfully at TextEdit.

After wrestling for months with libxml2 for FeedReactor, and all the issues I had getting the Python bindings compiled and working on Mac OS X, just so I could play around with XPath and some decently fast XML handling...  I discover that 4Suite installs like budda on Linux, Windows, and OS X, and seems pretty fast.  I&#39;ve only used it for XPath so far, but I&#39;m curious to try out what it does for XSLT.



Your moment of webcomic zen:&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Tonight&#39;s Items of Little Import</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Here goes nothing--atomic bullet points to power, quickie turbines to speed...

Pyjamarama is my song of the evening.

I&#39;ve gotten hooked on [Vim][vim], having defected from [xemacs][xemacs], because I like keeping more of my user interface in my headspace and [adopting modes as fighting stances][vimstances].

I haven&#39;t been paying attention to my web stats.  Does anyone out there actually read and enjoy my links, since I split them out of the main blog?  (Just curious.)

I&#39;ve been thinking lately that my innate fashion instincts come from the Tom Baker era of Doctor Who.  Thankfully, I have a girlfriend who helps dress me.  The hair&#39;s still getting pretty unruly, though.

Quick News is the NetNewsWire of the Palm OS world.  It can even download podcasts!  And it&#39;s only $15 bucks!

Funny thing about weekends when you’re unemployed.


They don’t quite mean so much,
Except you get to hang out with all your working friends.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description
