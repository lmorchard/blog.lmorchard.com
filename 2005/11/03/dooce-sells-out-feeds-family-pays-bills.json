All of this feedback is valid. You, my readers, have seen me and supported me through some of the roughest times in my life and the last thing I want to do is alienate you. I understand why some of you are upset about the ads.</blockquote>\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/11_01_2005.html\">dooce: Wherein a whole bunch of you just roll your eyes</a></small></p>\n<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I think her new ad-laden design was done in the least obnoxious way possible.  Rather than dumping the ads &quot;above the fold&quot;—right in the middle of the interesting part (ie. the blog post)—hers are like billboards on the side of the road.  </p>\n<p>Where many bloggers would tile an arabesque, she&#39;s got moneymakers.  Either way, my <strike>peril-sensitive</strike> advertising-sensitive sunglasses block them out just the same, but with less scrolling.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083636\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://fatcaterpillar.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b43edc5c93b4a2f069d2eb1b44239af4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://fatcaterpillar.org/\">Stewart Johnson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083636\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-04T13:13:55\">2005-11-04T13:13:55</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I only realised that her site was so ad-laden when she mentioned it in her post. There&#39;s no ads in her atom feeds (and the feed is thankfully complete content).</p>\n\n<p>To be honest, I&#39;m surprised that so many people are still reading actual websites these days. I could care less about how people lay out their content on their website, I just want it to be interesting and in a feed. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, I find it a little frustrating when I have to go to someone&#39;s site to comment on their post -- I would comment a lot more if there was some kind of generic commenting interface available from within bloglines. (Though this way means I probably filter out the lower-quality comments with my visting-site-aversion-threshold).</p>\n\n<p>I wonder how long it will take dooce to <a href=\"http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/09_21_2005.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">put ads back in her feeds</a>?</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083637&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.joegrossberg.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f288a8afe5302a16a366d5e9d34f2fec&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.joegrossberg.com&quot;&gt;Joe Grossberg&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083637&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-11-04T17:48:49&quot;&gt;2005-11-04T17:48:49&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damn ... those are some serious BlogAds rates ... I guess that&#39;s what a huge audience (2,798 subscribers via Bloglines alone) will get you (I have 44 by that same metric).&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Fortunately, you can Adblock the URLs <a href=\"http://images.pheedo.com/\">http://images.pheedo.com/</a><em> and <a href=\"http://images.blogads.com/\">http://images.blogads.com/</a></em> . That doesn&#39;t do much for the text, but it&#39;s less distracting. And, like you said, it&#39;s not in the feed.</p>\n\n<p><p>Incidentally, I&#39;m thinking of adding a (redundant) &quot;comment here&quot; link to the bottom of each RSS entry ...
