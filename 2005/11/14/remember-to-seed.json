But it leaves a hope that at some point some pirate group will take that consideration into account and OCR/republish the release.&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Interesting thing is that released PDFs are mostly of high quality and thus most probably &quot;couriered&quot; right from the publisher&#39;s production facilities or electronic shops. And this allows us to see, how each of the publishers relates to e-books in general.</p>\n\n<p>I.e., big new releases of O&#39;Reilly (e.g <a href=\"http://rapidshared.org/index.php?t=item&amp;id=4176\" rel=\"nofollow\">Project Management</a>) are reworked as fully developed CHM-ebooks with indexes, TOC and hyperlinks, smaller ones are PDF with text (smaller size than full-page renders, copy-able text and possibility to do search for strings).</p>\n\n<p><p>And very rare releases are in scanned PDF format, which usually means that no real electronic version existed before (or it never got to public).</p></div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
