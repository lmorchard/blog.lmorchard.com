It could <em>so</em> become an <em>über</em> Spotlight/Finder replacement.  I just don&#39;t seem to have time or ambition to write it.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t mention <a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox\">Tinderbox</a> very often, but I&#39;ve got a few Tinderbox documents set as Login Items on my PowerBook.  So, this app has become ubiquitous on my machine for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/08/11/quick-thoughts-for-a-thursday\">idea capture, sorting, and exploration</a>.  In fact, I used it to capture, shape, and structure everything I put into <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1\">Hacking RSS and Atom</a>.</p>\n<p>However, I haven&#39;t ever gotten far into some of the more advanced features like agents or export templates.  My most used HTML export templates simply boil an outline of notes down into <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/XOXO\">XOXO</a>, and that&#39;s about it.  I have had <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/css-treemaps\" title=\"Treemaps in CSS\">further</a> <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/drag-the-boxes-stretch-the-lines\" title=\"DHTML map views\">ambitions</a> for richer Tinderbox export / extension, but I haven&#39;t pursued them much lately.  </p>\n<p>Really, my main reason for not delving into Tinderbox&#39;s advanced features is that learning and using them effectively would burrow me further into the app&#39;s own pocket universe of conventions and technology.</p>\n<p>Since Tinderbox saves to XML, I <em>can</em> bridge to a larger information space via <a href=\"http://www.maparent.ca/tinderbox/\">XSLT and XPath based tools</a>.  But, all the conversion and roundtrip can get kludgey and awkward—and I lose the ease of <a href=\"http://www.43folders.com/2005/08/17/life-inside-one-big-text-file/\">life inside text files</a> augmented by grep, awk, sed, vim, perl, python, <a href=\"http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/\">QuickSilver</a>, and <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a>.</p>\n<p>This is the point where I think opportunities presented by Tiger and the advent of Spotlight can come into play—especially with the availability of <a href=\"http://www.fluffy.co.uk/spotmeta/\">SpotMeta</a>.  SpotMeta weds Spotlight with HFS Extended Attributes in order to enable the management of arbitrary user-specified metadata on files in addition to Spotlight Importer metadata.  </p>\n<p>See, the main magic of Tinderbox—at least to me—is visualization and management of relationships between notions and microcontent.  At present, Tinderbox needs to swallow the universe to accomplish everything it wants to accomplish.  It needs to include word processor features and metadata handling and graphics and all.  </p>\n<p>But, what if Tinderbox could surrender all of those functions up to TextEdit and MS Word and other desktop apps?  What if all of the &quot;notes&quot; in a Tinderbox document were just documents and files, and all of the relationships managed by Tinderbox (ie. spatial, links, aliased) were just encoded as extended attributes?</p>\n<p>In this scenario, <em>the file system is the Tinderbox document</em>.  Don&#39;t want to use your whole hard drive?  Make a new disk image and compartmentalize things.  Tinderbox could become the world&#39;s most revolutionary Finder rethink ever invented.  And the thing is, I can see all of this being enabled by Spotlight and extended attributes.</p>\n<!-- tags: tinderbox tiger spotlight xoxo -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088906\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://robertbrook.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=760b4002b07650d4ef654f9fc17e8154&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://robertbrook.com\">Robert Brook</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088906\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-04T13:16:12\">2005-11-04T13:16:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Much as I love Tinderbox, I just can't bring myself to completely trust it.

I like Tinderbox's simplicity and power, but for a while now, I've thought the tool would be easier to implement in Smalltalk http://www.squeak.org/</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm just waiting around for Croquet http://www.opencroquet.org/ , honestly. Once that is released, I think the tool we're looking for would be almost trivial to build. (my ideal version of the tool includes network awareness and collaboration)</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088918\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=96d8316409f72a4bde8cf7ca90fb65e7&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Joe Mazz</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088918\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-20T09:38:28\">2006-03-20T09:38:28</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>What intruiging ideas you are discussing here! \r\nYou have struck a chord with my own hesitation to dive head-first into\r\nTinderbox (TB)--- the need to import (or re-enter) all my key note\r\ncontent into its own \"information repository,\" which even then \r\nwould be only loosly connected to all the rest of the \"notes\" \r\nin thousands of other files on my computer. \r\nAnother big limitation is its inabiliy to link notes \r\nbetween TB documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It appears that Spotlight+SpotMeta provide the\r\nGUI to assign arbitray searchable attributes for file content, \r\nand SmartFolders provide some of the key functionality of TB agents. \r\nAnd I suppose symlinks in the OS effectively duplicate the primary\r\nrole of TB aliases (notes that can appear in any number of other\r\nlocations in the hierarchy).\r\nBut these still cover only portions of the functionality of Tinderbox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What would provide the visualization component of TB that \r\nrepresents files as glyphs (at least like TB map view's \"boxes\", \r\nif not something more flexible and graphically rich),  and that\r\nenables users to interactively create \r\nhyperlinks between files by drawing lines between them? \r\nHas anyone here come across, or perhaps started developing, a tool that\r\ncan simplify (graphically) creating hyperlinks between UNIX files?\r\nUnder the hood, clearly such a GUI would be making and breaking \r\nextended attributes shared in common between selected sets of files\r\nin the HFS+ file system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent post at macrumors.com suggests our creative friends at Apple\r\nare perhaps already onto this idea (for Mac OS 10.5?):\r\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=156291&amp;page=6</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>From the rumors I'm hearing about the next version of Spotlight and \r\n  the possibility of creating linked relationships between objects, \r\n  it should be exciting times.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>How about the assignment of attributes to the hyperlinks between\r\ndocuments (another unique and powerful TB feature)?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what would represent the TB function of templates and agents for\r\nautomated formatting of selected content for HTML or XML documents by \r\ncombining information from various files (\"notes\")? I suppose this could\r\nbe programmed/scripted in any number of ways, using say Python or even\r\nAutomator or AppleScript. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The possibilities truly are endless.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",
