OPML for interchange between aggregators is one thing—but on the web at large, sinking deeper roots into OPML and the whole Rube Goldberg array of machinery following behind it feels like a backward step to me.  \r\n\r\nMaybe [microformats][] are the new XML-geekery, but I don't want a new, \"cleaner\" XML format—I just want to more cleverly use the format that everyone's been using to share outlines and declarations of attention in blogs.\r\n\r\n[qif]: http://web.intuit.com/support/quicken/2002/win/1177.html\r\n[radio]: http://radio.userland.com/\r\n[radioblogroll]: http://radio.outliners.com/blogRollOutliner\r\n[microformats]: http://www.microformats.org/\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082960\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082960\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-27T21:37:59\">2005-11-27T21:37:59</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Check out <a href=\"http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uche Ogbuji</a>'s pertinent posts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-11-14/I_already_\" rel=\"nofollow\">I already said OPML is crap, right?

My hunch is XOXO is the crisp, clean and simple solution.</blockquote>\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://blog.eronj.com/2005/11/25/xoxo-opml-simple-list-extentions/\">Cloudy Thinking by Ron K. Jeffries  » Blog Archive   » XOXO & OPML & Simple List Extentions</a></small>\n\n<p>At the moment, my prediction is that XOXO gets sidelined by OPML, insofar as expressing ideas and data in outline form takes off in general.  This will be because all the buzz and work will be driven by enthusiasm and time devoted, rather than technical merit.  And, at the moment and the foreseeable future, OPML enthusiasts have the loudest and most active voices.</p>\n<p>The only reason I keep bringing up XOXO, though, is that my time is short.  To be honest, I&#39;ve only spent about 8-10 hours in total with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/index.php?s=xoxo\">all the XOXO experiments</a> I&#39;ve shared—including my half-baked in-browser editor.  Trying to do interesting things with OPML has eaten much more of my time, and with fewer results worth sharing.  In my experience, XOXO is so easy as to be almost boring—while OPML has enough sharp edges to seem challenging.</p>\n<p>Your mileage may vary, though.

I’d give a slight edge to OPML, because Winer promotes it a lot. But on technical merit… you tell me. My hunch is XOXO is the crisp, clean and simple solution.</blockquote>\r\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://blog.eronj.com/2005/11/25/xoxo-opml-simple-list-extentions/\">Cloudy Thinking by Ron K. Jeffries  » Blog Archive   » XOXO & OPML & Simple List Extentions</a></small>\r\n\r\nAt the moment, my prediction is that XOXO gets sidelined by OPML, insofar as expressing ideas and data in outline form takes off in general.  This will be because all the buzz and work will be driven by enthusiasm and time devoted, rather than technical merit.  And, at the moment and the foreseeable future, OPML enthusiasts have the loudest and most active voices.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I keep bringing up XOXO, though, is that my time is short.  To be honest, I've only spent about 8-10 hours in total with [all the XOXO experiments][xoxo] I've shared—including my half-baked in-browser editor.  Trying to do interesting things with OPML has eaten much more of my time, and with fewer results worth sharing.  In my experience, XOXO is so easy as to be almost boring—while OPML has enough sharp edges to seem challenging.\r\n\r\nYour mileage may vary, though.  My selfish motive in occasionally promoting XOXO is the hope that it'll take off while I'm busy with other things.  That way, when I have time to devote to this stuff, there'll already be easy-to-hack XOXO things simmering around the LazyWeb and I won't have to deal with even more OPML in the [blogosphere tuple space][ts].  \r\n\r\nAt the moment, though, neither OPML nor XOXO are paying the bills for me.  So, if OPML's paying *your* bills, more power to you!\r\n\r\n[xoxo]: http://decafbad.com/blog/index.php?s=xoxo\r\n[ts]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/12/the-blogosphere-as-a-tuple-space\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: opml xoxo microformats -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084895\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=aff533acf9b173682e713fb1cb290a94&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">scott</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084895\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-26T23:20:48\">2005-11-26T23:20:48</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I'd like to see an interesting and useful <em>outline</em> application done in OPML.

On the other end of things, I think some very cool things could happen if we had a Google or a Technorati start harvesting `<ul>` and `<ol>` tags from the general HTML population in order to give some sort of tangible reward for all those sidebar link lists people have been using in their blog templates for years.\r\n\r\nWe're all still waiting for the full arrival of [Gopher NG][gn].\r\n\r\n[op]: http://dannyayers.com/archives/2005/11/24/tools/\r\n[ag]: http://www.scripting.com/2005/11/24.html#When:1:34:09PM\r\n[xoxo]: http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo\r\n[xout]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo_outliner_experiment\r\n[gn]: http://dannyayers.com/archives/2005/07/14/gopher-ng/\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090788\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.skippy.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1a320ac7f6818504df79fe42fc6b84a9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.skippy.net/\">skippy</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090788\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-25T02:52:12\">2005-11-25T02:52:12</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Isn't <a href=\"http://labs.google.com/sets\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Sets</a> already a working example of Google harvesting &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; tags from the general HTML?</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090789\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090789\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-25T02:58:29\">2005-11-25T02:58:29</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Oh yeah!

But it is interesting that Dave has this stack of (moderately) his own making: XML/RPC, OPML, RSS 2.0, Frontier/Manilla and whatever its scripting language is called. So in a way every one of his new developments is an addition to his <em>own</em> world, before it's an addition to the world at large. I could imagine that being pretty motivational.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dunno, or maybe it's simply the time and enthusiasm bit that makes the difference. Like Les I've got plenty in my in-tray already, and when I've got time of my own making a decent standards-based outliner is low on the list, even though it'd be very nice to have.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

In the end, I usually don't have to ask anyone for help, don't have to wait, and generally I get out of the store faster than anyone.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll grow out of it.\r\n\r\n[twit]: http://thisweekintech.com/28\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: nerd geek dev programming -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084905\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=81717a172b6918071fbea1a52483294b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/\">Dougal Campbell</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084905\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-02T21:13:46\">2005-11-02T21:13:46</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I'd like it a lot more if they'd give you a discount to make up for the fact that they don't have to pay for a cashier and bagger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I use the self-checkout when I only have a few items, and I think it will get me out of the store faster.

People are most productive in an environment they know best.  This is especially true when it comes to operational support.  Any environment is going to get hairy at high loads and under \"normal operating conditions\", so when the poop hits the fan, you're better off in an environment that you're familiar with.  MySql may be a better DB, but if my DBA knows SQL Server inside and out and really knows how to use the tool, then you'll get better results with SQL Server over MySql.\nAnd anyway, according to Joel Spolsky, Google beats MSDN for support in most cases.  Actually, my experience bears out Joel's comment.  All support devolves into Googling, in most cases.  I use the MSDN support only for the real killers - those support incidents cost money, you know.\nGreat work on the book, BTW.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086798\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086798\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-09T00:16:17\">2005-11-09T00:16:17</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Sorry for not getting back before now.</p>\n<p>\"Admittedly, I haven’t used it much since the arrival of CFMX, but I tend to think PHP’s a better deal.

Googling for support is actually quite annoying, but I take a \"you get what you pay for\" approach to these things.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086796\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086796\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-02T20:37:17\">2005-11-02T20:37:17</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Roger: Thanks for responding!  For what it's worth, I actually <em>do</em> want to see comments from people who've had good experiences with proprietary platforms, so as to balance out my leanings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since you mentioned Macromedia, I realize that I wasn't thinking of them in my post.  They're basically semi-open proprietary (not unlike Microsoft), but I <em>do</em> like their stuff.  Well, Flash at least.  But ColdFusion...?  Admittedly, I haven't used it much since the arrival of CFMX, but I tend to think PHP's a better deal.  No offense, though, since I'm willing to blame my own ignorance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's interesting that you say a Win2k3/IIS server is cost comparable to a Linux/Apache server, though.  Do you own your own server?

People are most productive in an environment they know best.  This is especially true when it comes to operational support.  Any environment is going to get hairy at high loads and under \"normal operating conditions\", so when the poop hits the fan, you're better off in an environment that you're familiar with.  MySql may be a better DB, but if my DBA knows SQL Server inside and out and really knows how to use the tool, then you'll get better results with SQL Server over MySql.\r\nAnd anyway, according to Joel Spolsky, Google beats MSDN for support in most cases.  Actually, my experience bears out Joel's comment.  All support devolves into Googling, in most cases.  I use the MSDN support only for the real killers - those support incidents cost money, you know.\r\nGreat work on the book, BTW.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086798\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086798\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-09T00:16:17\">2005-11-09T00:16:17</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Sorry for not getting back before now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Admittedly, I haven’t used it much since the arrival of CFMX, but I tend to think PHP’s a better deal.

Don't worry 'bout it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just love CFMX. I love how the day-to-day stuff is really easy, and the esoteric stuff can be addressed by leveraging Java.  I love that the fundamental language structure makes sense to someone who taught himself to write code on a C-64 and an Atari ST. I love that it (mostly) handles Unicode for me. I love that it allows me to play with a little OOP while primarily sticking to procedural stuff. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Lease a dedicated box?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yup. I could have gone Red Hat or Win2k3 during setup, and to me, it was a no-brainer. If nothing else, my wife has spent the last fifteen years as a network engineer, working mainly with Windows networks... free, in-house, 24/7 tech support cannot be ignored. :D</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086799\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086799\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-09T00:54:35\">2005-11-09T00:54:35</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Roger: Oh yeah!

It could <em>so</em> become an <em>über</em> Spotlight/Finder replacement.  I just don&#39;t seem to have time or ambition to write it.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t mention <a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox\">Tinderbox</a> very often, but I&#39;ve got a few Tinderbox documents set as Login Items on my PowerBook.  So, this app has become ubiquitous on my machine for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/08/11/quick-thoughts-for-a-thursday\">idea capture, sorting, and exploration</a>.  In fact, I used it to capture, shape, and structure everything I put into <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1\">Hacking RSS and Atom</a>.</p>\n<p>However, I haven&#39;t ever gotten far into some of the more advanced features like agents or export templates.  My most used HTML export templates simply boil an outline of notes down into <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/XOXO\">XOXO</a>, and that&#39;s about it.  I have had <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/css-treemaps\" title=\"Treemaps in CSS\">further</a> <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/drag-the-boxes-stretch-the-lines\" title=\"DHTML map views\">ambitions</a> for richer Tinderbox export / extension, but I haven&#39;t pursued them much lately.  </p>\n<p>Really, my main reason for not delving into Tinderbox&#39;s advanced features is that learning and using them effectively would burrow me further into the app&#39;s own pocket universe of conventions and technology.</p>\n<p>Since Tinderbox saves to XML, I <em>can</em> bridge to a larger information space via <a href=\"http://www.maparent.ca/tinderbox/\">XSLT and XPath based tools</a>.  But, all the conversion and roundtrip can get kludgey and awkward—and I lose the ease of <a href=\"http://www.43folders.com/2005/08/17/life-inside-one-big-text-file/\">life inside text files</a> augmented by grep, awk, sed, vim, perl, python, <a href=\"http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/\">QuickSilver</a>, and <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a>.</p>\n<p>This is the point where I think opportunities presented by Tiger and the advent of Spotlight can come into play—especially with the availability of <a href=\"http://www.fluffy.co.uk/spotmeta/\">SpotMeta</a>.  SpotMeta weds Spotlight with HFS Extended Attributes in order to enable the management of arbitrary user-specified metadata on files in addition to Spotlight Importer metadata.  </p>\n<p>See, the main magic of Tinderbox—at least to me—is visualization and management of relationships between notions and microcontent.  At present, Tinderbox needs to swallow the universe to accomplish everything it wants to accomplish.  It needs to include word processor features and metadata handling and graphics and all.  </p>\n<p>But, what if Tinderbox could surrender all of those functions up to TextEdit and MS Word and other desktop apps?  What if all of the &quot;notes&quot; in a Tinderbox document were just documents and files, and all of the relationships managed by Tinderbox (ie. spatial, links, aliased) were just encoded as extended attributes?</p>\n<p>In this scenario, <em>the file system is the Tinderbox document</em>.  Don&#39;t want to use your whole hard drive?  Make a new disk image and compartmentalize things.  Tinderbox could become the world&#39;s most revolutionary Finder rethink ever invented.  And the thing is, I can see all of this being enabled by Spotlight and extended attributes.</p>\n<!-- tags: tinderbox tiger spotlight xoxo -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088906\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://robertbrook.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=760b4002b07650d4ef654f9fc17e8154&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://robertbrook.com\">Robert Brook</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088906\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-04T13:16:12\">2005-11-04T13:16:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Much as I love Tinderbox, I just can't bring myself to completely trust it.

A while back I outlined a little kluge that allows you to use external editors with Tinderbox in a fairly transparent way (click on the note and the editor for that note's type opens up).

All open-source, and portable to any unix-style system. HTML export would almost come free, using one of python's many web frameworks.

I have had [further][tree] [ambitions][drag] for richer Tinderbox export / extension, but I haven't pursued them much lately.  \r\n\r\nReally, my main reason for not delving into Tinderbox's advanced features is that learning and using them effectively would burrow me further into the app's own pocket universe of conventions and technology.\r\n\r\nSince Tinderbox saves to XML, I *can* bridge to a larger information space via [XSLT and XPath based tools][tools].  But, all the conversion and roundtrip can get kludgey and awkward—and I lose the ease of [life inside text files][txt] augmented by grep, awk, sed, vim, perl, python, [QuickSilver][qs], and [Markdown][md].\r\n\r\nThis is the point where I think opportunities presented by Tiger and the advent of Spotlight can come into play—especially with the availability of [SpotMeta][sm].  SpotMeta weds Spotlight with HFS Extended Attributes in order to enable the management of arbitrary user-specified metadata on files in addition to Spotlight Importer metadata.  \r\n\r\nSee, the main magic of Tinderbox—at least to me—is visualization and management of relationships between notions and microcontent.  At present, Tinderbox needs to swallow the universe to accomplish everything it wants to accomplish.  It needs to include word processor features and metadata handling and graphics and all.  \r\n\r\nBut, what if Tinderbox could surrender all of those functions up to TextEdit and MS Word and other desktop apps?  What if all of the \"notes\" in a Tinderbox document were just documents and files, and all of the relationships managed by Tinderbox (ie. spatial, links, aliased) were just encoded as extended attributes?\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, *the file system is the Tinderbox document*.  Don't want to use your whole hard drive?  Make a new disk image and compartmentalize things.  Tinderbox could become the world's most revolutionary Finder rethink ever invented.  And the thing is, I can see all of this being enabled by Spotlight and extended attributes.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: tinderbox tiger spotlight xoxo -->\r\n\r\n[omnigraffle]: http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/\r\n[md]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\r\n[qs]: http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/\r\n[txt]: http://www.43folders.com/2005/08/17/life-inside-one-big-text-file/\r\n[tools]: http://www.maparent.ca/tinderbox/\r\n[book]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1\r\n[id]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/08/11/quick-thoughts-for-a-thursday\r\n[exp]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/01/tiger-and-tinderbox\r\n[tb]: http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox\r\n[sm]: http://www.fluffy.co.uk/spotmeta/\r\n[tree]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/css-treemaps \"Treemaps in CSS\"\r\n[drag]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/drag-the-boxes-stretch-the-lines \"DHTML map views\"\r\n[xoxo]: http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/XOXO\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088906\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://robertbrook.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=760b4002b07650d4ef654f9fc17e8154&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://robertbrook.com\">Robert Brook</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088906\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-04T13:16:12\">2005-11-04T13:16:12</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Much as I love Tinderbox, I just can't bring myself to completely trust it.

All open-source, and portable to any unix-style system. HTML export would almost come free, using one of python's many web frameworks.

We have a few older servers here, maybe a year old or so and the automatic package management is just broken.  Perhaps it's a Fedora Core or Gentoo thing, but even on a moderately old system, the package management stuff just breaks (mainly because it's not OMFG-I-need-to-upgrade-every-minute up to date).</p>\n<p>I don't upgrade just to upgrade.  Things break.  Things change.  For instance, there's a showstopping bug in Apache 2.0 that would keep one of my sites from working properly (although it's such an obscure bug that I suspect it <em>only</em> affects my site) and an automatic upgrade in that instance would be devastating.  So I upgrade only when absolutely required.

We have a few older servers here, maybe a year old or so and the automatic package management is just broken.  Perhaps it's a Fedora Core or Gentoo thing, but even on a moderately old system, the package management stuff just breaks (mainly because it's not OMFG-I-need-to-upgrade-every-minute up to date).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't upgrade just to upgrade.  Things break.  Things change.  For instance, there's a showstopping bug in Apache 2.0 that would keep one of my sites from working properly (although it's such an obscure bug that I suspect it <em>only</em> affects my site) and an automatic upgrade in that instance would be devastating.  So I upgrade only when absolutely required.  Which means &ldquo;not often.&rdquo;  And in the meantime, the maintainers of the package managers (<code>apt-get</code>, <code>emerge</code> and <code>yum</code> to name a few) break older installations.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090950\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090950\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-02T21:54:24\">2005-11-02T21:54:24</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Sean:  This <em>might</em> be a half-benefit from Debian in particular, since they're so slow to release new versions of the distro.
