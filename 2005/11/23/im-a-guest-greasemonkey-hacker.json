So lo and behold, a much-improved version of my code appears in Chapter 4 as Hack #39!  Mark did all the work to update the script and prepare it for the book, and I get a complimentary copyâ€”hooray!</p>\n<p>The rest of the book looks chock full of hot monkey hacks and modern JavaScript trickery, so it&#39;s certainly worth checking out!</p>\n"}
