So, for all these years since I first saw [Star Trek: The Motion Picture][sttmp] at [the Seaway drive-in in Algonac, MI][swd] in footie pajamas with my parents, I've always wondered what made that sound.  You know, that "dwonnnnnng" sound that I've forever associated with spaceships and Star Trek.

I always assumed it was something synthesized.  Turns out, it's a huge metal instrument called a [Blaster Beam][bb], invented by Craig Huxdley.
