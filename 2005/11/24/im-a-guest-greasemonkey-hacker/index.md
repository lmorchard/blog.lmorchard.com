A lovely copy of Mark Pilgrim's [GreaseMonkey Hacks][gmh] from O'Reilly just showed up on my doorstep.  

I'd gotten a request from Mark to use my [Magic Microformat Forms][mmf] hack from this past summer.  So lo and behold, a much-improved version of my code appears in Chapter 4 as Hack #39!  Mark did all the work to update the script and prepare it for the book, and I get a complimentary copyâ€”hooray!

The rest of the book looks chock full of hot monkey hacks and modern JavaScript trickery, so it's certainly worth checking out!
