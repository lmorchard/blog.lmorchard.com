* Today was my last day at my job in downtown Detroit.  Change is afoot.

* I put together a bed today from [Cost Plus World Market][cost] that could have probably crushed me.  This was dumb.

* I still have a reflexive dislike for PHP, for many of the same reasons (and more!) I tend to avoid Perl after having lived in it for over a decade.  

  But, damn, if the developers of WordPress and MediaWiki didn't make things easy to install.  My horror will probably return once I start to look under the hood.

* Methinks that [Sudoku][] puzzles were what Ragle Gumm was working on in [Phillip K. Dick's *Time Out of Joint*][joint].  They're making me all shifty and paranoid.

* Is it just me, or is there some almost obscene irony to have just seen a local TV news program present a story about rising oil and fuel prices--only to see them, with straight faces, immediately follow that up with a report on the upcoming [Woodward Dream Cruise in the Detroit area][cruise]?
