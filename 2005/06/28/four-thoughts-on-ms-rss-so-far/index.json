And, well, I still consider that to be the case.  </p>\n<p>However, I definitely need to dig deeper.  For example, I&#39;d forgotten about <a href=\"http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a257ba40-b9fd-4cba-959a-2bba6ae917f0\">Dare Obasanjo&#39;s &quot;The Netflix Problem&quot;</a>, which offers a clear use case for a list extension in syndication feeds.  Also, having been busy, I&#39;ve been a bit out of touch with goings on at conferences and the quantum foam of daily syndication feed discussions.</p>\n<p>But at any rate, here&#39;s a quick sum up of a handful of MS RSS thoughts I&#39;ve had over the last day or so.</p>\n<h3 id=\"responsive-so-far\">Responsive so far...</h3>\n<p>I&#39;m coming to think that this wasn&#39;t so much a <em>delivery</em> so much as a funky <em>request for comments</em>.  For example, <a href=\"http://philringnalda.com/blog/2005/06/ms_embraces_rss.php\">Phil Ringnalda posts</a> about his issues with the new extension and various community notables respond in comments.  A little later on, though, <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/archive/2005/06/25/432686.aspx\">Sean Lyndersay posts</a> on the Longhorn RSS Team blog with a response and some tweaks to the extension.  Funny, that was unexpected.</p>\n<p>And then, later on in the day yesterday, I actually got a personal email from a senior project manager on IE at Microsoft in response to my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/25/microsoft_rss_godzilla_tiptoes_into_tokyo\">previous post</a>, offering appreciation for my blog and to answer any questions I might have.  Now, I doubt I barely rate as a C-list blogger in the &#39;sphere as a whole, so that anyone bothered to contact little old me seems unexpected as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-familiar-architecture\">A familiar architecture</h3>\n<p>Moving along to the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/understanding/rss/rsslonghorn/#architecture\">Architectural Overview</a> of RSS support on Longhorn, I&#39;m seeing things that look oh-so-familiar.  <em>Oh yeah!</em>  It&#39;s a big chunk of what I had in my head for FeedReactor, if I ever got around to producing a version of it in decent shape for public use.  The biggest difference is that my solution would be cast across the web (both locally and globally) via REST, whereas Microsoft&#39;s will be embedded into Longhorn.</p>\n<p>I wanted to build a reusable base service for consuming syndication feeds, do that right and do that in a shared way, so that more interesting apps could get on with their lives and not start from the ground floor at HTTP polling, parsing, and new entry tracking every time.

I go back to 1995 and the Windows 95 release. What was the most important feature in that release? A built in TCP/IP stack. No more having to buy a book (bummer for publishers!), a shrinkwrapped box with packaged internet connectivity software, or install that disk that came in the mail to get a 3rd party TCP/IP stack for Windows 3.1 to connect to the internet.
