    "html": "<p>While I&#39;m thinking on the subject of common syndication feed frameworks, it occurred to me that it might be instructive to jot down some thoughts on one of the concerns at the root of my ideas for FeedReactor:  Shared feed fetching, caching, and storage.</p>\n<p>I wanted to build something that would intelligently handle all <a href=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2002/10/21/http_conditional_get_for_rss_hackers\">the issues</a> <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/tests/client/http/\">of HTTP</a> and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/25/dynamic_feed_scan_times\">feed</a> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/29/dynamic_polling_freq_too\">polling</a> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/11/26/polling_and_urgency\">schedules</a>, across all my apps, all in one spot--once and for all.  Maybe it wouldn&#39;t have quite that guarantee of finality, but I&#39;d <em>hope</em> to never directly perform an HTTP GET for a feed from one of my apps ever again.</p>\n<p>Toward that end, one of my primary requirements is this:  Once I&#39;ve acquired feed data, I need to store it in some form usable by my other programs and by some method as agnostic as possible toward the actual contents of the feed.  I want to preserve potential extension data, without needing prior knowledge of what that might be.  Extensions are one area where the fun stuff with syndication feeds will be taking off, and I&#39;ve wanted a foundation to support that.</p>\n<p>So, in my tinkering, I&#39;ve explored four main variations of storing feed data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fine-grained relational DB tables</li>\n<li>Triples in an RDF store</li>\n<li>XML database storage</li>\n<li>Coarse-grained persistence</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"feeds-in-relational-db-tables\">Feeds in relational DB tables</h3>\n<p>Mapping feed data to relational database tables seems to be the most common approach I&#39;ve seen in use by aggregators.  Another similar approach involves maintaining a persistent object model.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb\">Syndication.framework</a>, <a href=\"http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2993\">NetNewsWire</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nongnu.org/straw/\">Straw</a>, and <a href=\"http://feedonfeeds.com/\">Feed on Feeds</a> all do something like this, more or less--and I&#39;m sure many others do, as well.   </p>\n<p>The idea is that the raw feed XML comes in, gets parsed, and then methodically dissected to populate columns in a table or properties of an object.  Since the table schema or class definition is planned out ahead of time, only feed data which conforms to this model gets preserved.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, an effort is made to &quot;expose all possible data&quot;, <a href=\"http://www.feedparser.org/docs/namespace-handling.html\">ala the Universal Feed Parser</a>.  But, this is really only practical if your objects are particularly dynamic--and even then <a href=\"http://bitsko.slc.ut.us/blog/rdf-longhorn.html\">you&#39;ll run into issues</a>, depending on just what shows up in a given feed.  But, if you don&#39;t really care much about anything all that exotic in feeds beyond title / link / description, this approach might work out just fine.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feeds-as-rdf-triples\">Feeds as RDF triples</h3>\n<p>But if you do care about extension data, and if you&#39;re going to go through all that trouble of dissecting a feed, you might as well have a sufficiently granular and flexible repository to dump it.  So, how about an RDF triple store?  The underlying model behind RDF can capture anything you can throw at it from syndication feed structures.  In fact, RSS 1.0 and all of its extension modules <em>are</em> serialized RDF data.</p>\n<p>Here, though, the issue isn&#39;t so much a matter of signal loss because pieces don&#39;t fit the model.  Instead, the issue is more akin to an impedance mismatch:  </p>\n<p>Do you try to transliterate pieces of RSS 2.0 and Atom 0.x feeds into RSS 1.0 parts?  Or do you <a href=\"http://semtext.org/atom/\">recast a feed format like Atom as an RDF vocabulary</a>?  Then, what do you do about all the mostly similar yet slightly different feed bits floating around as triples (i.e. RSS 1.0 vs Atom OWL)?  And, don&#39;t even get me started on all the annoyances involved in dismembering and reassembling arrangements of triples--although that&#39;s more a function of a particular RDF toolkit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feeds-in-an-xml-database\">Feeds in an XML database</h3>\n<p>Admittedly, I haven&#39;t done as much as I&#39;d like with feeds in an XML database--such as <a href=\"http://www.sleepycat.com/products/xml.shtml\">Berkeley DB XML</a>.  In part, that&#39;s been because the various packages have either just been too frustratingly dog-slow or nigh-impossible to get built and running on my OS X development machine.  </p>\n<p>One of the main benefits to this approach--on paper, anyway--is that the feed data stays intact in in the original format as XML.  It doesn&#39;t get dismembered, recast, rearranged, or exposed to much of anything that would put any exotic cargo it carries at risk.</p>\n<p>But, I think I&#39;ve got more playing to do with this option.  Although the opportunity to play much more with XSLT, XPath, and XQuery are attractive to me--this seems like potential overkill.  And, whereas the previous two approaches can accommodate a little <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/01/22/dive-into-xml.html\">liberal parsing</a>, this approach requires valid feeds.  So, here I&#39;ll need to pull in some repair kit tools to normalize and tidy any broken / soupy feeds.  Or, if I&#39;m feeling particularly annoyed, I can just <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/01/08/postels-law\">ignore Postel&#39;s Law</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#dt-wfc\">pound my fist on the spec</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feeds-in-coarse-grained-persistence\">Feeds in coarse-grained persistence</h3>\n<p>The notion which brought me to this final approach toward storing feed data  goes something like <a href=\"http://www.tbradford.org/2005/06/advanced-revelation.html\">what this guy wrote</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The biggest design mistake of dbXML was making it an XML database. The problem with XML databases is that they store XML, and the problems with XML are too numerous to go into here. Let&#39;s just say that processing XML in a native fashion in the database engine itself is a fool&#39;s errand, and leads to far too many potential external dependency problems to be worthwhile. If you&#39;re doing anything but the simplest of stripped down document storage, It&#39;s a much wiser approach to simply store the XML text in a BLOB, delegating the work of schema checking and external entity processing to a higher layer of your system. Otherwise, you can bet your ass that at some point in the feature, when you can least afford for it to happen, something is going to break.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, in FeedReactor, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/kwiki/index.cgi?FeedReactorDataModel\">that&#39;s pretty much what I did</a>.

Sticking things in a relational database is pretty quick, but very lossy.  Using RDF seems very flexible, but often not too quick or all that friendly.  Calling in an XML database seems like a &quot;good&quot; idea, but my spider sense is tingling.

Jon Udell (search his blog) has done some interesting work with feed data stored as XML, basically using XPath as the query language. It works, but I would suggest that he's tied to the XML structure too much. A year ago I might have gone for a hybrid RDF/RDBMS approach, with the core RSS material being contained in fixed tables bridged across to an RDF interface (somehow) to allow FOAF etc. But two factors put me off that idea now - the RSS 2.0 extensions that have appeared in recent weeks and SPARQL! Having a SQL-like query language that can be used against an RDF store (with XSLT-able results) really does simplify matters. Performance is likely to be an issue but I'm hoping a bit of filtering & caching will help there. I'm getting feed data into the store currently using XSLT (to RDF/XML), it's ok but the setup I've got could be a lot more modular.\nI think Microsoft have got things partly right in their RSS Longhorn architecture, separating out the \"Sync Engine\". But in the data handling there's heavy use of objects, which I don't think should be needed when you can do things declaratively using SQL or SPARQL. Their object model is limited, I can guarantee that'll turn into a big ball of mud ;-)\nWhat I'm intrigued by is the potential for using multiple stores on different hosts. My immediate target being a fairly big aggregator/store on a remote server and a shiny-GUI client tool with more limited storage that selectively addresses the remote store.

You'd be surprised (or not) how many of them are valid XML. The only issue that comes up regularly is charset brokenness.\nAlso, I've found that most people, if told that their feed is broken, will thank you for the note and proceed to fix it. Those who aren't technically savvy enough to fix their feeds generally don't *have* malformed ones to begin with because they use some ready-made webblogging tool -- and those tend to have correct feed generation by default.\nSo if all your repair kit does is check and fix the feed encoding, then you should almost never see any bogosity.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090390\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8157a5907b244071cda98ba5aa7a9635&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090390\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-23T17:58:08\">2005-09-23T17:58:08</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">If you're going to store chunks as BLOBs, would it just make more sense to store them in the filesystem? Put the meta-data in the SQL db, but just have a filename handle to get to the ultimate content.\nThen you really have recoverability, etc.\nThough it increases the risk that you'll do something tacky and update a file without triggering an update of the meta-data, etc. but you could do the same thing regardless of the infrastructure layer...\n(Probably-not-related, an interview with Hans Reiser I read recently included him saying that BLOBs are a bad thing.

You'd be surprised (or not) how many of them are valid XML. The only issue that comes up regularly is charset brokenness.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've found that most people, if told that their feed is broken, will thank you for the note and proceed to fix it. Those who aren't technically savvy enough to fix their feeds generally don't *have* malformed ones to begin with because they use some ready-made webblogging tool -- and those tend to have correct feed generation by default.\r\n\r\nSo if all your repair kit does is check and fix the feed encoding, then you should almost never see any bogosity.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090390\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8157a5907b244071cda98ba5aa7a9635&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090390\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-23T17:58:08\">2005-09-23T17:58:08</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">If you're going to store chunks as BLOBs, would it just make more sense to store them in the filesystem?

Such an approach, similar to hardware dongles, could theoretically be defeated, although it&#39;s unknown what level of sophistication Apple will employ. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>  The thing is though, really, who cares?  I have to admit, I might spend a weekend day trying to get OS X to run on a random PC, if I&#39;ve got nothing else to do.  (Which doesn&#39;t happen very often, nowadays.)</p>\n<p>  But, that&#39;s just because I&#39;m a nutter unlike most people--and even I&#39;ll be buying a new Intel-based Apple computer eventually, anyway.  As for everyone else, it&#39;ll likely be made just hard enough to be worthless to anyone seriously trying to get anything done.  It&#39;ll be a curiosity, nothing more--and certainly nothing to endanger Apple&#39;s bottom line.</p>\n<p>  It&#39;s the whole package deal, stupid.  And it seems a bell-curve-ish theory of DRM: You won&#39;t get absolute 100% control over what happens to your stuff in the wild, but you&#39;ll get most of it or at least enough to matter. </p>\n<p> It&#39;s also somewhat reminiscent of hidden iPod directories and iTunes FairPlay:  Just make it hard enough to not be worth it to anyone who doesn&#39;t have time to put up with crap.  And, make it just hard enough that anyone who does have an inclination to deal with crap has to continually tweak their hacks to keep up.</p>\n<p>  While I do despise DRM barriers in principle, at least this seems less odious than most.  And, well, there are plenty of other much more tinker-friendly operating systems available for plain vanilla PCs.  </p>\n<p>So, in the end, who cares?  Buy a Mac, or don&#39;t buy a Mac.  Or, enjoy perpetual tinkering for its own sake.  But, don&#39;t expect to get a seriously usable OS X system on anything other than what Apple supports.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088711\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7d1c8d2b1a7643236a4661e9a974dee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\">George Hotelling</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088711\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-24T11:49:06\">2005-06-24T11:49:06</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I think Apple would benefit strongly from not trying too hard to force people onto their hardware.  The IT admins of tomorrow are the kids with more time than money of today.  \nThey'll be happy to buy a mod chip for their Dell that will allow them to dual-boot between Windows and OS X.  Then, in theory, they'll love it so much that when their parents get them a computer for college OS X will be a requirement, and guess who will get that sale?\nAfter college when they're wrangling a bunch of desktop users and are asked what to buy, they'll be familiar with OS X and be able to recommend it where it makes sense.\nOS X on the enterprise desktop in 5-10 years, if kids are able to pirate OS X at home next year.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088712\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=747d53109205f8b601078cb4df5bd75b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">peter</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088712\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-24T22:37:49\">2005-06-24T22:37:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I honestly think if it's possible to patch the installer in such a way that the dongle is totally taken out of the equation, it might hurt Apple's bottom line.  Yes, lots and lots of people pay for Windows when they buy a new machine, but I also know TONS of people who hook up their non-techie friends/family with pirated copies on a beige box.  MS is trying to fight the piracy of Windows in Asia and other markets.  If it wasn't hurting their bottom line, they wouldn't give a shit.\nI was kind of hoping they'd introduce some sort of really funky architecture that would make it impossible for the OS to run on anything else.

    "body": "I just read this post on Think Secret [about the new Intel-based developer Macs][macintel]:\r\n\r\n  > Sources have indicated that Apple will employ an EDID chip on the motherboard of Intel-based Macs that Mac OS X will look for and must handshake with first in order to boot. Such an approach, similar to hardware dongles, could theoretically be defeated, although it's unknown what level of sophistication Apple will employ. \r\n\r\n  The thing is though, really, who cares?  I have to admit, I might spend a weekend day trying to get OS X to run on a random PC, if I've got nothing else to do.  (Which doesn't happen very often, nowadays.)\r\n\r\n  But, that's just because I'm a nutter unlike most people--and even I'll be buying a new Intel-based Apple computer eventually, anyway.  As for everyone else, it'll likely be made just hard enough to be worthless to anyone seriously trying to get anything done.  It'll be a curiosity, nothing more--and certainly nothing to endanger Apple's bottom line.\r\n\r\n  It's the whole package deal, stupid.  And it seems a bell-curve-ish theory of DRM: You won't get absolute 100% control over what happens to your stuff in the wild, but you'll get most of it or at least enough to matter. \r\n\r\n It's also somewhat reminiscent of hidden iPod directories and iTunes FairPlay:  Just make it hard enough to not be worth it to anyone who doesn't have time to put up with crap.  And, make it just hard enough that anyone who does have an inclination to deal with crap has to continually tweak their hacks to keep up.\r\n\r\n  While I do despise DRM barriers in principle, at least this seems less odious than most.  And, well, there are plenty of other much more tinker-friendly operating systems available for plain vanilla PCs.  \r\n\r\nSo, in the end, who cares?  Buy a Mac, or don't buy a Mac.  Or, enjoy perpetual tinkering for its own sake.  But, don't expect to get a seriously usable OS X system on anything other than what Apple supports.\r\n\r\n[macintel]: http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0506intelmac.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088711\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7d1c8d2b1a7643236a4661e9a974dee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\">George Hotelling</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088711\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-24T11:49:06\">2005-06-24T11:49:06</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I think Apple would benefit strongly from not trying too hard to force people onto their hardware.  The IT admins of tomorrow are the kids with more time than money of today.  \r\n\r\nThey'll be happy to buy a mod chip for their Dell that will allow them to dual-boot between Windows and OS X.  Then, in theory, they'll love it so much that when their parents get them a computer for college OS X will be a requirement, and guess who will get that sale?\r\n\r\nAfter college when they're wrangling a bunch of desktop users and are asked what to buy, they'll be familiar with OS X and be able to recommend it where it makes sense.\r\n\r\nOS X on the enterprise desktop in 5-10 years, if kids are able to pirate OS X at home next year.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088712\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=747d53109205f8b601078cb4df5bd75b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">peter</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088712\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-24T22:37:49\">2005-06-24T22:37:49</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I honestly think if it's possible to patch the installer in such a way that the dongle is totally taken out of the equation, it might hurt Apple's bottom line.  Yes, lots and lots of people pay for Windows when they buy a new machine, but I also know TONS of people who hook up their non-techie friends/family with pirated copies on a beige box.  MS is trying to fight the piracy of Windows in Asia and other markets.  If it wasn't hurting their bottom line, they wouldn't give a shit.\r\n\r\nI was kind of hoping they'd introduce some sort of really funky architecture that would make it impossible for the OS to run on anything else.

So, I think I might try to keep this bot running and tinker some more.</p>\n<p>First thing, it looks like the original <a href=\"http://www.infobot.org\">Infobot</a> is abandoned, but there&#39;s a (slightly) more active fork named <a href=\"http://flooterbuck.sourceforge.net/\">Flooterbuck</a>.  I used to be a more active participant in #perl, so I used to be more up on these things, but oh well.

Say hello to <a href=\"aim:goim?Screenname=decafbot&Message=help\">decafbot</a>!  \r\n\r\n  I turned an IRC [Infobot][ib] into an AIM chatbot via [Bitlbee][bb].  It may or may not be online depending on how stable the rig is and how tolerant AIM's flood/spam triggers are.\r\n\r\n  I've always been a fan of `purl` on the `#perl` IRC channel, so maybe I can try turning this little infobot into something useful.  At any rate, it was a quick hack involving two installs via DarwinPorts and a few config file tweaks.  So, send an IM on the AIM network to <a href=\"aim:goim?Screenname=decafbot&Message=help\">`decafbot`</a> and see what happens.\r\n\r\n[ib]: http://infobot.sourceforge.net\r\n[bb]: http://www.bitlbee.org/\r\n\r\n* Today's not-so-fun trick?

Awesome :)\nJust to beat my own geeky chest a bit, back in college I started to write my own BBS system. On my Radio Shack Color Computer (1MHz 6809, 64K of RAM). With floppy disks (2 double-sided 5-1/4\" 80-track drives, no HD). And a manually operated 300baud modem (I hacked auto-answer by running the ring signal to a joystick port). And I was basically writing my own customized file system to implement a fixed-size message queue that would automatically drop out the oldest messages. In BASIC.\nI was probably about 80% done before some other project distracted me from finishing it :)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090902\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=41961d4385a56ed0724cb621b8814125&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090902\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-17T15:18:54\">2005-06-17T15:18:54</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Congratulations Les!

Awesome :)\r\n\r\nJust to beat my own geeky chest a bit, back in college I started to write my own BBS system. On my Radio Shack Color Computer (1MHz 6809, 64K of RAM). With floppy disks (2 double-sided 5-1/4\" 80-track drives, no HD). And a manually operated 300baud modem (I hacked auto-answer by running the ring signal to a joystick port). And I was basically writing my own customized file system to implement a fixed-size message queue that would automatically drop out the oldest messages. In BASIC.\r\n\r\nI was probably about 80% done before some other project distracted me from finishing it :)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090902\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=41961d4385a56ed0724cb621b8814125&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090902\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-17T15:18:54\">2005-06-17T15:18:54</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Congratulations Les!

    "html": "<p>I was just snooping through the installer package for Nathan Yergler&#39;s <a href=\"http://yergler.net/projects/cc-spotlight/\">CC Metadata Importer</a> looking for some clues toward resolving my gripes noted in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/10/blosxom_tiger_and_spotlight\">Blosxom, Tiger, and Spotlight</a>.  In doing so, I just realized that the <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7432157&amp;forum_id=4355\">guts of this importer are written in Python</a>.  That&#39;s really pretty nifty and I need to look into this some more.</p>\n<p>However, more toward the gripes from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/10/blosxom_tiger_and_spotlight\">that previous post</a>, I&#39;m assuming that this <a href=\"http://yergler.net/projects/cc-spotlight/\">CC Metadata Importer</a> will kick out any other importer dealing with MP3 files once it&#39;s installed.  Let&#39;s see what happens...  (<em>runs off to install the importer</em>)</p>\n<p>In fact, after I installed the importer, I noticed metadata missing from my MP3s that had been there pre-install, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>kMDItemMediaTypes              = (Sound)</li>\n<li>kMDItemMusicalGenre            = &quot;Rock&quot;</li>\n<li>kMDItemTitle                   = &quot;Sunday&quot;</li>\n<li>kMDItemTotalBitRate            = 256</li>\n<li>kMDItemAudioBitRate            = 256</li>\n<li>kMDItemAudioChannelCount       = 2</li>\n<li>kMDItemAudioSampleRate         = 44100</li>\n<li>kMDItemAuthors                 = (&quot;David Bowie&quot;)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I looked into <code>Audio.mdimporter</code> under <code>/System/Library/Spotlight</code> and this is what I found in <code>Contents/Info.plist</code>:</p>\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\n    <key>CFBundleDocumentTypes</key>\n    <array>\n        <dict>\n            <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\n            <string>MDImporter</string>\n            <key>LSItemContentTypes</key>\n            <array>\n                <string>public.mp3</string>\n                <string>public.aifc-audio</string>\n                <string>public.aiff-audio</string>\n                <string>com.digidesign.sd2-audio</string>\n                <string>com.microsoft.waveform-audio</string>\n                <string>public.ulaw-audio</string>\n                <string>com.apple.coreaudio-format</string>\n            </array>\n        </dict>\n    </array>\n  </textarea>\n\n<p>  And, what do you know?  This is what I found in <code>Contents/Info.plist</code> for <code>Creative Commons Metadata Importer.mdimporter</code>:</p>\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\n    <key>CFBundleDocumentTypes</key>\n    <array>\n        <dict>\n            <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\n            <string>MDImporter</string>\n            <key>LSItemContentTypes</key>\n            <array>\n                <string>public.mp3</string>\n            </array>\n        </dict>\n    </array>\n  </textarea>\n\n<p>This new importer wants to handle <code>public.mp3</code>, just like Apple&#39;s <code>Audio.mdimporter</code>.  So, from my understanding, the CC importer will replace Apple&#39;s--rather than cooperating with it, as I&#39;d like to see.  (I wonder if there&#39;s any way to hack <em>chaining</em> into these things?)</p>\n<p>When I run <code>mdls</code> on an MP3 I have lying around, this is what I get before installing the importer:</p>\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\n01 Sunday.mp3 -------------\nkMDItemAlbum                   = \"Heathen\"\nkMDItemAttributeChangeDate     = 2005-05-03 20:41:01 -0400\nkMDItemAudioBitRate            = 256\nkMDItemAudioChannelCount       = 2\nkMDItemAudioSampleRate         = 44100\nkMDItemAuthors                 = (\"David Bowie\")\nkMDItemContentCreationDate     = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\nkMDItemContentModificationDate = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\nkMDItemContentType             = \"public.mp3\"\nkMDItemContentTypeTree         = (\n    \"public.mp3\", \n    \"public.audio\", \n    \"public.audiovisual-content\", \n    \"public.data\", \n    \"public.item\", \n    \"public.content\"\n)\nkMDItemDisplayName             = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\nkMDItemDurationSeconds         = 856\nkMDItemFSContentChangeDate     = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\nkMDItemFSCreationDate          = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\nkMDItemFSCreatorCode           = 0\nkMDItemFSFinderFlags           = 0\nkMDItemFSInvisible             = 0\nkMDItemFSLabel                 = 0\nkMDItemFSName                  = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\nkMDItemFSNodeCount             = 0\nkMDItemFSOwnerGroupID          = 501\nkMDItemFSOwnerUserID           = 501\nkMDItemFSSize                  = 9138342\nkMDItemFSTypeCode              = 0\nkMDItemID                      = 820671\nkMDItemKind                    = \"MP3 Audio File\"\nkMDItemLastUsedDate            = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\nkMDItemMediaTypes              = (Sound)\nkMDItemMusicalGenre            = \"Rock\"\nkMDItemTitle                   = \"Sunday\"\nkMDItemTotalBitRate            = 256\nkMDItemUsedDates               = (2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500)\n  </textarea>\n\n<p>So, I installed the CC importer, let it re-index things, and this is what <code>mdls</code> gives me now:</p>\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\n01 Sunday.mp3 -------------\nkMDItemAttributeChangeDate     = 2005-06-15 12:27:57 -0400\nkMDItemContentCreationDate     = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\nkMDItemContentModificationDate = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\nkMDItemContentType             = \"public.mp3\"\nkMDItemContentTypeTree         = (\n    \"public.mp3\", \n    \"public.audio\", \n    \"public.audiovisual-content\", \n    \"public.data\", \n    \"public.item\", \n    \"public.content\"\n)\nkMDItemDisplayName             = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\nkMDItemFSContentChangeDate     = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\nkMDItemFSCreationDate          = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\nkMDItemFSCreatorCode           = 0\nkMDItemFSFinderFlags           = 0\nkMDItemFSInvisible             = 0\nkMDItemFSLabel                 = 0\nkMDItemFSName                  = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\nkMDItemFSNodeCount             = 0\nkMDItemFSOwnerGroupID          = 501\nkMDItemFSOwnerUserID           = 501\nkMDItemFSSize                  = 9138342\nkMDItemFSTypeCode              = 0\nkMDItemID                      = 820671\nkMDItemKind                    = \"MP3 Audio File\"\nkMDItemLastUsedDate            = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\nkMDItemUsedDates               = (2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500)\n  </textarea>\n\n<p>In case those two floods of metadata set your head spinning, the post-install metadata is lacking items from the pre-install metadata.

That's really pretty nifty and I need to look into this some more.\r\n\r\n[bts]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/10/blosxom_tiger_and_spotlight\r\n[guts]: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7432157&forum_id=4355\r\n[cci]: http://yergler.net/projects/cc-spotlight/\r\n\r\nHowever, more toward the gripes from [that previous post][bts], I'm assuming that this [CC Metadata Importer][cci] will kick out any other importer dealing with MP3 files once it's installed.  Let's see what happens...  (*runs off to install the importer*)\r\n\r\nIn fact, after I installed the importer, I noticed metadata missing from my MP3s that had been there pre-install, such as:\r\n\r\n* kMDItemMediaTypes              = (Sound)\r\n* kMDItemMusicalGenre            = \"Rock\"\r\n* kMDItemTitle                   = \"Sunday\"\r\n* kMDItemTotalBitRate            = 256\r\n* kMDItemAudioBitRate            = 256\r\n* kMDItemAudioChannelCount       = 2\r\n* kMDItemAudioSampleRate         = 44100\r\n* kMDItemAuthors                 = (\"David Bowie\")\r\n\r\nI looked into `Audio.mdimporter` under `/System/Library/Spotlight` and this is what I found in `Contents/Info.plist`:\r\n\r\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\r\n    <key>CFBundleDocumentTypes</key>\r\n    <array>\r\n        <dict>\r\n            <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\r\n            <string>MDImporter</string>\r\n            <key>LSItemContentTypes</key>\r\n            <array>\r\n                <string>public.mp3</string>\r\n                <string>public.aifc-audio</string>\r\n                <string>public.aiff-audio</string>\r\n                <string>com.digidesign.sd2-audio</string>\r\n                <string>com.microsoft.waveform-audio</string>\r\n                <string>public.ulaw-audio</string>\r\n                <string>com.apple.coreaudio-format</string>\r\n            </array>\r\n        </dict>\r\n    </array>\r\n  </textarea>\r\n\r\n  And, what do you know?  This is what I found in `Contents/Info.plist` for `Creative Commons Metadata Importer.mdimporter`:\r\n\r\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\r\n    <key>CFBundleDocumentTypes</key>\r\n    <array>\r\n        <dict>\r\n            <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\r\n            <string>MDImporter</string>\r\n            <key>LSItemContentTypes</key>\r\n            <array>\r\n                <string>public.mp3</string>\r\n            </array>\r\n        </dict>\r\n    </array>\r\n  </textarea>\r\n\r\nThis new importer wants to handle `public.mp3`, just like Apple's `Audio.mdimporter`.  So, from my understanding, the CC importer will replace Apple's--rather than cooperating with it, as I'd like to see.  (I wonder if there's any way to hack *chaining* into these things?)\r\n\r\nWhen I run `mdls` on an MP3 I have lying around, this is what I get before installing the importer:\r\n\r\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\r\n01 Sunday.mp3 -------------\r\nkMDItemAlbum                   = \"Heathen\"\r\nkMDItemAttributeChangeDate     = 2005-05-03 20:41:01 -0400\r\nkMDItemAudioBitRate            = 256\r\nkMDItemAudioChannelCount       = 2\r\nkMDItemAudioSampleRate         = 44100\r\nkMDItemAuthors                 = (\"David Bowie\")\r\nkMDItemContentCreationDate     = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\r\nkMDItemContentModificationDate = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\r\nkMDItemContentType             = \"public.mp3\"\r\nkMDItemContentTypeTree         = (\r\n    \"public.mp3\", \r\n    \"public.audio\", \r\n    \"public.audiovisual-content\", \r\n    \"public.data\", \r\n    \"public.item\", \r\n    \"public.content\"\r\n)\r\nkMDItemDisplayName             = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\r\nkMDItemDurationSeconds         = 856\r\nkMDItemFSContentChangeDate     = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\r\nkMDItemFSCreationDate          = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\r\nkMDItemFSCreatorCode           = 0\r\nkMDItemFSFinderFlags           = 0\r\nkMDItemFSInvisible             = 0\r\nkMDItemFSLabel                 = 0\r\nkMDItemFSName                  = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\r\nkMDItemFSNodeCount             = 0\r\nkMDItemFSOwnerGroupID          = 501\r\nkMDItemFSOwnerUserID           = 501\r\nkMDItemFSSize                  = 9138342\r\nkMDItemFSTypeCode              = 0\r\nkMDItemID                      = 820671\r\nkMDItemKind                    = \"MP3 Audio File\"\r\nkMDItemLastUsedDate            = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\r\nkMDItemMediaTypes              = (Sound)\r\nkMDItemMusicalGenre            = \"Rock\"\r\nkMDItemTitle                   = \"Sunday\"\r\nkMDItemTotalBitRate            = 256\r\nkMDItemUsedDates               = (2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500)\r\n  </textarea>\r\n\r\nSo, I installed the CC importer, let it re-index things, and this is what `mdls` gives me now:\r\n\r\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\r\n01 Sunday.mp3 -------------\r\nkMDItemAttributeChangeDate     = 2005-06-15 12:27:57 -0400\r\nkMDItemContentCreationDate     = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\r\nkMDItemContentModificationDate = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\r\nkMDItemContentType             = \"public.mp3\"\r\nkMDItemContentTypeTree         = (\r\n    \"public.mp3\", \r\n    \"public.audio\", \r\n    \"public.audiovisual-content\", \r\n    \"public.data\", \r\n    \"public.item\", \r\n    \"public.content\"\r\n)\r\nkMDItemDisplayName             = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\r\nkMDItemFSContentChangeDate     = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\r\nkMDItemFSCreationDate          = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\r\nkMDItemFSCreatorCode           = 0\r\nkMDItemFSFinderFlags           = 0\r\nkMDItemFSInvisible             = 0\r\nkMDItemFSLabel                 = 0\r\nkMDItemFSName                  = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\r\nkMDItemFSNodeCount             = 0\r\nkMDItemFSOwnerGroupID          = 501\r\nkMDItemFSOwnerUserID           = 501\r\nkMDItemFSSize                  = 9138342\r\nkMDItemFSTypeCode              = 0\r\nkMDItemID                      = 820671\r\nkMDItemKind                    = \"MP3 Audio File\"\r\nkMDItemLastUsedDate            = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\r\nkMDItemUsedDates               = (2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500)\r\n  </textarea>\r\n\r\nIn case those two floods of metadata set your head spinning, the post-install metadata is lacking items from the pre-install metadata.  I need to uninstall this importer and get my other metadata back.  And, this isn't a slight against the importer--it looks like really cool work.  No, this is a bummer of Spotlight.\r\n\r\n*Almost there...*\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088590\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://ulaluma.com/pyx\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9e03aaf8edbe4b2c0d25e30ab9a69ffb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://ulaluma.com/pyx\">Donovan Preston</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088590\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-15T12:55:56\">2005-06-15T12:55:56</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">At WWDC I heard some of the Apple developers complaining about this as well.

Control+Q or Cmd+Q is not mapped to Quit as in Mozilla and Netscape\n2. No site navigation bar\nI truly believe that the site navigation bar with Top, Up, First, Previous, Next, Last buttons and the Document and ubiquitous \"More\" folder that listed alternate links such as different feeds on the page is a breakthrough  in the browser interface (albeit an incremental one) much like the back button. The site navigation bar is much maligned (and was pulled from an early Mozilla release circa 1.3? \"because of its effect on page load performance\" before it was added back after an outcry and those \"performance\" issues were addressed. Still the default setting has it always hidden, you have to go find the \"Show only if needed\" option in the menu. \nI quite like the next and previous buttons that appear on some blogs (and used to appear in Slashdot - although they disabled that because of concerns about link pre-fetching. For those of us in the Long Tail of the blog world that site navigation bar really works well for navigating the site. And it pulls me out of Bloglines for many sites when I want to just lazily surf around.\nIf we could standardize a few more primitives beyond the Top, Up, First, Previous, Next, Last buttons there could be lots of interface innovations and the navigation of web sites could be made easier. In the Atom working group there was talk about standardizing various linking primitives in this manner. The fact that this is all hyperlink mediated is strangly appropriate.\nNow it is only the pull of Monkeyed Grease and inline autocomplete that keep me turning to that foxy thing, otherwise Luddite and late adopter that I am, the Mozilla suite is where I would stay.\nhmm worthy of a blog... lessee http://www.bloglines.com/blog/amaah?id=38</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083441\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb7f2a3ba74af37415ab7df101a86c75&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083441\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-15T11:55:42\">2005-06-15T11:55:42</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Koranteng:  I think I'm a little confused what you mean with #1...

Control+Q or Cmd+Q is not mapped to Quit as in Mozilla and Netscape\r\n\r\n2. No site navigation bar\r\n\r\nI truly believe that the site navigation bar with Top, Up, First, Previous, Next, Last buttons and the Document and ubiquitous \"More\" folder that listed alternate links such as different feeds on the page is a breakthrough  in the browser interface (albeit an incremental one) much like the back button. The site navigation bar is much maligned (and was pulled from an early Mozilla release circa 1.3? \"because of its effect on page load performance\" before it was added back after an outcry and those \"performance\" issues were addressed. Still the default setting has it always hidden, you have to go find the \"Show only if needed\" option in the menu. \r\n\r\nI quite like the next and previous buttons that appear on some blogs (and used to appear in Slashdot - although they disabled that because of concerns about link pre-fetching. For those of us in the Long Tail of the blog world that site navigation bar really works well for navigating the site. And it pulls me out of Bloglines for many sites when I want to just lazily surf around.\r\n\r\nIf we could standardize a few more primitives beyond the Top, Up, First, Previous, Next, Last buttons there could be lots of interface innovations and the navigation of web sites could be made easier. In the Atom working group there was talk about standardizing various linking primitives in this manner. The fact that this is all hyperlink mediated is strangly appropriate.\r\n\r\nNow it is only the pull of Monkeyed Grease and inline autocomplete that keep me turning to that foxy thing, otherwise Luddite and late adopter that I am, the Mozilla suite is where I would stay.\r\n\r\nhmm worthy of a blog... lessee http://www.bloglines.com/blog/amaah?id=38</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083441\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb7f2a3ba74af37415ab7df101a86c75&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083441\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-15T11:55:42\">2005-06-15T11:55:42</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Koranteng:  I think I'm a little confused what you mean with #1...

    "html": "<p>I&#39;m feeling a bit retro in terms of gadgets right now.  And I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a matter of reduced expectations or what, but I&#39;m finding myself strangely happier with this situation.  </p>\n<p>The screen on my <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo 600</a> suffered a crack, and although it was still limping along as a phone, it just wasn&#39;t worth it.  And besides, the thing has disappointed me overall--crappy phone, crappy camera, crappy screen, outmoded OS, badly thought-out headset/headphone situation.  </p>\n<p>After having looked forward to getting one so much, I&#39;m happy to be done with it now.  I just hope I can find my receipts to call in the replacement policy and maybe eBay an unopened <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo</a> to recoup some costs.  Oh, and not be tempted to buy a new camera just to use the spare 512MB SD card I have sitting around now.</p>\n<p>So, the <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo</a> has been replaced by my old <a href=\"http://product.samsung.com/cgi-bin/nabc/prod/hhcommerce/telecommunications/sph_a500_features.jsp\">Samsung A500</a> phone and a first-gen <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Handspring Visor Deluxe</a>, both of which I dug out of old junk boxes in the basement.  </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://product.samsung.com/cgi-bin/nabc/prod/hhcommerce/telecommunications/sph_a500_features.jsp\">Samsung A500</a> phone works well, makes calls, fits comfortably in the same pocket as my wallet.  And, over the years, it&#39;s taken a great share of knocks and drops and has barely flinched.  I&#39;ve downgraded my phone service a bit and abandoned most of the data features, which will save me some money for awhile.  I kind of wish I had a camera on this phone, but I won&#39;t cry over the savings from the missing data plan, nor will I pine for carrying <a href=\"http://www.steves-digicams.com/2002_reviews/pcs_vision.html\">the external camera attachment</a> Sprint offered for the phone.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Handspring Visor</a> has also taken a number of knocks, but keeps going.  The only glitchy bit is that I have to jam a few post-it notes in the cradle with it to ensure a connection, because some of the copper has rubbed off the contacts on the bottom of the PDA.  (I think I might invest in a conductive ink pen.)  Oh, and it doesn&#39;t have a rechargeable battery pack--I&#39;ll have to seek out some decent solution with rechargeable AAA&#39;s (do they even make those anymore?)  But, I remember Graffiti and can probably write that as fast or faster than I could thumb-type on the <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo</a>.</p>\n<p>The really odd thing is that, although the OS on the <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Visor</a> is even further behind than what I had on the <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo</a>, I&#39;m not too sad with it.  Like I said, maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m just not expecting that much.  Hell, I was happy to remember that this model has a backlight!  I miss the internet connectivity a bit, but I never used it much on the <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo</a> because the lack of multitasking and quasi-dialup experience always just pissed me off.  </p>\n<p>But, the address book and date book work on the <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Visor</a>, though I only wish I hadn&#39;t lost my regcode for <a href=\"http://www.pimlicosoftware.com/\">DateBk5</a>.  It syncs with my PowerBook.  I can get text files back and forth with <a href=\"http://mac-huwis.lut.ac.uk/~wis/programs/NoteTaker/NoteTaker.html\">NoteTaker</a>, which ties into all <em>sorts</em> of things.  And, best of all, <a href=\"http://frobnitz.sourceforge.net/\">Frobnitz</a> and <a href=\"http://roguelike-palm.sourceforge.net/\">Rogue</a> both work.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m slowly rediscovering a few of the tools I used to use on this thing, and telling myself that it&#39;s just slightly better than a stack of 3x5 cards.  Because you know, although I love my Moleskine, I just never could quite get into the <a href=\"http://www.hipsterpda.com/\">Hipster PDA</a> thing.  This is unplugged enough for me, thanks.  </p>\n<p>Anyway...  anyone have any cool tricks or tips for my <a href=\"http://product.samsung.com/cgi-bin/nabc/prod/hhcommerce/telecommunications/sph_a500_features.jsp\">Samsung A500</a> phone or this <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Handspring Visor</a>?</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085050\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085050\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T15:58:12\">2005-06-14T15:58:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Man, I'm glad I skipped the Treo 600!

(I think this should tell me something.)\nOne of the things I really hated on my 600 is the multitasking and the not-always-connected internet connectivity.  Especially when I wanted to jump between email, IM, and web, and it would completely disconnect and redial between programs.  Sometimes it would stay connected, but the IM client would need to reconnect.\nAnd as for media... ugh.  The 600 screen was only 160x160, if I recall, which killed a lot of opportunities.  And the headphone / headset duality sucked:  You had a headset to make calls with, and headphones to listen to music.  But even though the two shared the same port, they weren't the same thing.  And a 2-in-1 rig seemed to go for around US$40\nFrom the few opportunities I've had to play with a 650 (all of two), it seems like the much better machine.  But, I *would* be surprised if they had addressed enough of my gripes for me to like it.\nI think the problem now is that, after having used a Palm III with a Novatel Minstrel wireless cradle like 7 years ago, I expect flying cars by now :)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085052\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.darkglass.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3da2ed23539be35727b2844e4a6a9b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.darkglass.org/\">tamaracks</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085052\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T22:11:52\">2005-06-14T22:11:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Huh, I had some flaky contact problems with my old Visor Deluxe too.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085053\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085053\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T23:42:39\">2005-06-14T23:42:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">tamaracks:  Yeah, if you happen to still have it and play with your Visor again, take a look at the contacts on the bottom.

I bought the Sanyo 5300 because it was the first Sprint camphone available in my area. And after an ongoing survey of online examples, I think I can safely say that the 5300 has the *worst*, *slowest* camera ever grafted on to a clamshell. I grew to loathe the thing... early-adopterism can bite ya sometimes.\n\"One of the things I really hated on my 600 is the multitasking and the not-always-connected internet connectivity.\"\nMultitasking is obviously still an issue with the 650, although I find that I'm not missing it as much as I would have thought. I always admired the way my Axim could be playing an MP3, tracking the car's movements via GPS, and surfing the web simultaneously... but in practice, I just don't do much app switching. I tend to jump into the PDA, do X for a while, and then jump out.\nThe off-and-on connectivity issue, OTOH, may be minimized a bit with the 650. It virtually never happens when moving from built-in app to built-in app... it's the third-party stuff that seems to default to zapping the connection every time I exit.

    "body": "I'm feeling a bit retro in terms of gadgets right now.  And I don't know if it's a matter of reduced expectations or what, but I'm finding myself strangely happier with this situation.  \r\n\r\nThe screen on my [Treo 600][treo] suffered a crack, and although it was still limping along as a phone, it just wasn't worth it.  And besides, the thing has disappointed me overall--crappy phone, crappy camera, crappy screen, outmoded OS, badly thought-out headset/headphone situation.  \r\n\r\nAfter having looked forward to getting one so much, I'm happy to be done with it now.  I just hope I can find my receipts to call in the replacement policy and maybe eBay an unopened [Treo][treo] to recoup some costs.  Oh, and not be tempted to buy a new camera just to use the spare 512MB SD card I have sitting around now.\r\n\r\nSo, the [Treo][] has been replaced by my old [Samsung A500][a500] phone and a first-gen [Handspring Visor Deluxe][visor], both of which I dug out of old junk boxes in the basement.  \r\n\r\nThe [Samsung A500][a500] phone works well, makes calls, fits comfortably in the same pocket as my wallet.  And, over the years, it's taken a great share of knocks and drops and has barely flinched.  I've downgraded my phone service a bit and abandoned most of the data features, which will save me some money for awhile.  I kind of wish I had a camera on this phone, but I won't cry over the savings from the missing data plan, nor will I pine for carrying [the external camera attachment][cam] Sprint offered for the phone.\r\n\r\nThe [Handspring Visor][visor] has also taken a number of knocks, but keeps going.  The only glitchy bit is that I have to jam a few post-it notes in the cradle with it to ensure a connection, because some of the copper has rubbed off the contacts on the bottom of the PDA.  (I think I might invest in a conductive ink pen.)  Oh, and it doesn't have a rechargeable battery pack--I'll have to seek out some decent solution with rechargeable AAA's (do they even make those anymore?)  But, I remember Graffiti and can probably write that as fast or faster than I could thumb-type on the [Treo][].\r\n\r\nThe really odd thing is that, although the OS on the [Visor][] is even further behind than what I had on the [Treo][], I'm not too sad with it.  Like I said, maybe it's because I'm just not expecting that much.  Hell, I was happy to remember that this model has a backlight!  I miss the internet connectivity a bit, but I never used it much on the [Treo][] because the lack of multitasking and quasi-dialup experience always just pissed me off.  \r\n\r\nBut, the address book and date book work on the [Visor][], though I only wish I hadn't lost my regcode for [DateBk5][dtb].  It syncs with my PowerBook.  I can get text files back and forth with [NoteTaker][mnt], which ties into all *sorts* of things.  And, best of all, [Frobnitz][frob] and [Rogue][rogue] both work.\r\n  \r\nI'm slowly rediscovering a few of the tools I used to use on this thing, and telling myself that it's just slightly better than a stack of 3x5 cards.  Because you know, although I love my Moleskine, I just never could quite get into the [Hipster PDA][pda] thing.  This is unplugged enough for me, thanks.  \r\n\r\nAnyway...  anyone have any cool tricks or tips for my [Samsung A500][a500] phone or this [Handspring Visor][visor]?\r\n\r\n[Treo]: http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\r\n[visor]: http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\r\n[a500]: http://product.samsung.com/cgi-bin/nabc/prod/hhcommerce/telecommunications/sph_a500_features.jsp\r\n[pda]: http://www.hipsterpda.com/\r\n[cam]: http://www.steves-digicams.com/2002_reviews/pcs_vision.html\r\n[dtb]: http://www.pimlicosoftware.com/\r\n[rogue]: http://roguelike-palm.sourceforge.net/\r\n[frob]: http://frobnitz.sourceforge.net/\r\n[mnt]: http://mac-huwis.lut.ac.uk/~wis/programs/NoteTaker/NoteTaker.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085050\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085050\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T15:58:12\">2005-06-14T15:58:12</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Man, I'm glad I skipped the Treo 600! I waited for the 650, and while it hasn't converted me into a PalmOS fan (I've always been a Pocket PC person), it's still a solid little unit. The browser is a step up from Pocket IE, and the camera is miles better than the one on my Sanyo phone. \r\n\r\nAnd while it *was* expensive, it completely killed my desire to buy a PSP for portable video. I can fit hours-n-hours of 320x320 video on 1GB SD card... I can watch a rip of the Battlestar Galactica DVD in the car while my wife is clothes shopping.

(I think this should tell me something.)\r\n\r\nOne of the things I really hated on my 600 is the multitasking and the not-always-connected internet connectivity.  Especially when I wanted to jump between email, IM, and web, and it would completely disconnect and redial between programs.  Sometimes it would stay connected, but the IM client would need to reconnect.\r\n\r\nAnd as for media... ugh.  The 600 screen was only 160x160, if I recall, which killed a lot of opportunities.  And the headphone / headset duality sucked:  You had a headset to make calls with, and headphones to listen to music.  But even though the two shared the same port, they weren't the same thing.  And a 2-in-1 rig seemed to go for around US$40\r\n\r\nFrom the few opportunities I've had to play with a 650 (all of two), it seems like the much better machine.  But, I *would* be surprised if they had addressed enough of my gripes for me to like it.\r\n\r\nI think the problem now is that, after having used a Palm III with a Novatel Minstrel wireless cradle like 7 years ago, I expect flying cars by now :)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085052\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.darkglass.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3da2ed23539be35727b2844e4a6a9b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.darkglass.org/\">tamaracks</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085052\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T22:11:52\">2005-06-14T22:11:52</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Huh, I had some flaky contact problems with my old Visor Deluxe too.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085053\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085053\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T23:42:39\">2005-06-14T23:42:39</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">tamaracks:  Yeah, if you happen to still have it and play with your Visor again, take a look at the contacts on the bottom.

I bought the Sanyo 5300 because it was the first Sprint camphone available in my area. And after an ongoing survey of online examples, I think I can safely say that the 5300 has the *worst*, *slowest* camera ever grafted on to a clamshell.

I always admired the way my Axim could be playing an MP3, tracking the car's movements via GPS, and surfing the web simultaneously... but in practice, I just don't do much app switching. I tend to jump into the PDA, do X for a while, and then jump out.\r\n\r\nThe off-and-on connectivity issue, OTOH, may be minimized a bit with the 650. It virtually never happens when moving from built-in app to built-in app... it's the third-party stuff that seems to default to zapping the connection every time I exit.

But, it really peeves me when people assume Moore&#39;s Law alone will get us there--the idea that, if we just had a Pentium chip with enough mega/giga/tera/petahertz, an assemblage of hardware will magically come to approximate our own brains enough to spontaneously gain consciousness or at least enable it to host one of our own existing cells of awareness.</p>\n<p>The problem is that consciousness and cognition aren&#39;t a matter of brute force processing, and even an infinite array of CPUs won&#39;t necessarily <a href=\"http://www.aihorizon.com/essays/goai/\">play a good game of Go</a> or cause a mind to emerge.  Sure, incomprehensible resources of computational power helps, but it&#39;s about the clever algorithms.  </p>\n<p>Look, here&#39;s an analogy:  Consider dynamite.  It blows things up.  Make better dynamite, blow bigger things up.  Make infinitely powerful dynamite, and you can blow up anything in the universe.  But, you&#39;re still just blowing things up--you&#39;re not making <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/moru/\">Mount Rushmore</a>.</p>\n<p>Another analogy:  Consider a sports car.  It goes fast.  Make a better sports car, it goes faster.  Make an infinitely fast sports car, and it goes as fast as you can imagine.  But, it&#39;s not a boat or a plane.  Drive that car into the ocean and, barring any quirks or inertia that allow insanely-fast tires to grip water or skip over it altogether--I&#39;ll bet that the car sinks to the bottom rather than getting you from New York to London.</p>\n<p>You can have all the power promised by Moore&#39;s Law projected out into infinity, but you&#39;ll never build a brain until you figure out what real tricks it has up its sleeves.  </p>\n<p>In the meantime, I think efforts like <a href=\"http://www.bootstrap.org/\">Doug Engelbart&#39;s Bootstrap Institute</a> are where it&#39;s really at.  I think that human brains won&#39;t get replaced for a few hundred or thousand years yet, but in the meantime we&#39;ll wrap ourselves in layer upon layer of cognitive amplification.  Hopefully, medicine will come to a point where the little magic meat in the middle can be sustained indefinitely, so we can all become our own versions of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=vger+%22star+trek%22\">VGER</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087520\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=41961d4385a56ed0724cb621b8814125&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087520\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-10T13:53:41\">2005-06-10T13:53:41</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Les, one thing I've noticed about the computer-as-a-brain idea is that computers do a lousy job at forgetting.

That said, though, I believe we're quite likely to create consciousness (or things that look conscious) without really understanding the mechanisms of consciousness. I imagine that at some point we'll build a model of a human brain -- which might model operations at the neuron level or at the molecular level -- and it will act as if it's conscious.

    "body": "And while I'm on a roll trying to dump pent-up writing thoughts:  Last month, I read this [article in the Guardian][ag] presenting claims that we'll be downloading our brains in 2050.\r\n\r\nWell, it's no secret that I'm a [Ray Kurzweil fan][rk] and a [Singularitarian geek][sing] who's certainly eagerly working toward achieving [The Rapture][rapture].  But, it really peeves me when people assume Moore's Law alone will get us there--the idea that, if we just had a Pentium chip with enough mega/giga/tera/petahertz, an assemblage of hardware will magically come to approximate our own brains enough to spontaneously gain consciousness or at least enable it to host one of our own existing cells of awareness.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that consciousness and cognition aren't a matter of brute force processing, and even an infinite array of CPUs won't necessarily [play a good game of Go][go] or cause a mind to emerge.  Sure, incomprehensible resources of computational power helps, but it's about the clever algorithms.  \r\n\r\nLook, here's an analogy:  Consider dynamite.  It blows things up.  Make better dynamite, blow bigger things up.  Make infinitely powerful dynamite, and you can blow up anything in the universe.  But, you're still just blowing things up--you're not making [Mount Rushmore][mr].\r\n\r\nAnother analogy:  Consider a sports car.  It goes fast.  Make a better sports car, it goes faster.  Make an infinitely fast sports car, and it goes as fast as you can imagine.  But, it's not a boat or a plane.  Drive that car into the ocean and, barring any quirks or inertia that allow insanely-fast tires to grip water or skip over it altogether--I'll bet that the car sinks to the bottom rather than getting you from New York to London.\r\n\r\nYou can have all the power promised by Moore's Law projected out into infinity, but you'll never build a brain until you figure out what real tricks it has up its sleeves.  \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I think efforts like [Doug Engelbart's Bootstrap Institute][bi] are where it's really at.  I think that human brains won't get replaced for a few hundred or thousand years yet, but in the meantime we'll wrap ourselves in layer upon layer of cognitive amplification.  Hopefully, medicine will come to a point where the little magic meat in the middle can be sustained indefinitely, so we can all become our own versions of [VGER][vger].\r\n\r\n[go]: http://www.aihorizon.com/essays/goai/\r\n[vger]: http://www.google.com/search?q=vger+%22star+trek%22\r\n[bi]: http://www.bootstrap.org/\r\n[rk]: http://www.kurzweilai.net/index.html?flash=0\r\n[ag]: http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/science/story/0,12996,1489699,00.html\r\n[rapture]: http://www.antipope.org/charlie/toughguide.html\r\n[sing]: http://www.wholeearthmag.com/ArticleBin/111-6.pdf\r\n[mr]: http://www.nps.gov/moru/\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087520\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=41961d4385a56ed0724cb621b8814125&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087520\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-10T13:53:41\">2005-06-10T13:53:41</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Les, one thing I've noticed about the computer-as-a-brain idea is that computers do a lousy job at forgetting.

It&#39;s worth noting, however, that WordPress uses textareas too.  So does LiveJournal.  So do most comment posting forms.

Don't know why ... but it just doesn't seem to work.  I hope their's a simple explanation .. like Operator Error! - that can easily get the [hcal] up and running. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks .. </p>\n\n<p>les</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

    "summary": "<p><i><strong>Update</strong> (6/9): One quick note-- I&apos;ve noticed that this little hack of mine has been called a &quot;hack for Movable Type&quot;.  However, while I personally use Movable Type, this is a hack for <strong><em>textareas in FireFox</em></strong>. </i></p><i>\n</i><p><i>Movable Type just happens to use textareas.  It&apos;s worth noting, however, that WordPress uses textareas too.  So does LiveJournal.  So do most comment posting forms.  This is bigger than a single blog package plugin-- that&apos;s the point.</i></p>\n<p>Whew.  So it looks like <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0764597582.html\">the book</a> is out of my hands now, having finished the final reviews.  I have some more to say about that, but first I want to post the results of the last day or so of hacking I&apos;ve done.</p>\n<p>I&apos;ve been working on the stuff for the book so long that I just had to do something else (ie. <em>not RSS or Atom</em>) to help clear my head.  But, I&apos;m addicted to learning and building stuff.  So, although I did relax a bit since the main effort of the book passed--that is, relax as normal people define it--I just can&apos;t stop making things.  </p>\n<p>So, I had a beer, cracked open <a href=\"http://diveintogreasemonkey.org/\">Dive Into GreaseMonkey</a>, and decided to make good on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/17/magic_microformat_forms\">that idea I wrote about last month</a>.  Not only that, but I had a little free time over lunch today, so I downloaded a trial of <a href=\"http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/\">Snapz Pro X 2</a> to try my hand at a little screencasting, ala <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/05/11/20OPstrategic_1.html\">Jon Udell</a>.</p>\n<p>I&apos;ve got more things to say about all this, and my new found excitement for GreaseMonkey, but first I&apos;ll share the goods.</p>\n<p>If you want to risk running my horribly premature code on your machine, here&apos;s the script:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/06/magic_hcalendar.user.js\">magic_hcalendar.user.js</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&apos;d like a preview of what it does, here&apos;s a movie:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/06/magic_hcalendar.mov\">magic_hcalendar.mov</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And, just for the sake of completeness, here&apos;s a quick screen grab:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/06/magic_hcalendar.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/06/magic_hcalendar.jpg\" width=\"315\" height=\"258\"></a></p>\n"
