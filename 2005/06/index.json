    "summary": "iTunes podcasting support... I want it all, and I want it now, because it has so much potential in and of itself, and so much potential for driving podcast tuner UI into the future.  \nThe subscriptions are listed alphabetically?  Come on, let me sort them in last-updated order.  And what, no OPML import / export?  \nNot many podcast-related additions to the AppleScript scripting dictionary for iTunes.  I see a subscribe method, but I was hoping I could at least hack in some support for subscription list import / export.  Not having access to the subscription list puts a crimp in that. \nUpdate: Hooray for people who know what they're talking about.  Turns out there are a few more additions to iTunes' AppleScript support I missed, but I'm still not finding my way down to accessing the list of podcast subscriptions.\nUpdate 2: Looks like someone's already worked on the import side of things: OPML2iTunes : AppleScript to import OPML podcast subscriptions into iTunes\n\n\n\nAnd in the Bizzarro-Verse, Microsoft is more community-oriented than Apple when it comes to RSS extension creation.  Pretty odd.  I can see a few spots where the iTunes tags are defensible, but couldn't most or all of these have been established using Dublin Core or other prior work?\n\n\nBummer.  It seems like the new podcasting support in iTunes doesn't use Syndication.framework, or at least the feeds subscribed in iTunes don't show up in the Sources table in the database I was snooping around in.\nAnd here I was hoping for Tiger to have already quietly included a shared syndication feed architecture similar to what's proposed for Longhorn. \nOtherwise, podcasting in iTunes seems interesting so far.  Now, if it used BitTorrent out of the box...\n\n\n\nCan I just say I hate the new binary plists in OS X Tiger?  I got so used to futzing with them using vim and shell-side friends that it's jarring to get a face full of garbage now when I poke at them.\nAnd yeah, I know about /usr/bin/plutil--but, yuck.",

    "summary": "Now for some quick GreaseMonkey spew, recorded without any effort to actually see what's up in the community or reading any FAQs:\n\nI want to separate script code into reusable modules.\nThat said, am I an Architecture Astronaut when I can't get more than 10 minutes into a quick project without already starting to digress into building a reusable framework?\nIs it wrong that I felt like I was working in Perl again when I wrote that script?\nThat said, I wish JavaScript had either multi-line quotes ala Python or Perl heredoc syntax.\nDoing some twisty regex search-and-replace in Vi lets you do a lot of refactoring / recoding damage to source code in no time flat.\nCan I just say how nice it is to not worry about other browsers when coding?\n\nI've also got a few ideas I'd like to record and pursue for future GreaseMonkey endeavors:\n\nRecord the URL of all form submissions via XMLHTTPRequest to a remote server, with blog comment forms in mind.  Track changes on those URLs.  Notify me via Atom feed when new comments arrive in places where I posted comments.\nClean up and abstract that magic form thing I did into a more general way to make all kinds of magic textarea forms.  (More microformats?  .sig files for LiveJournal responses?  /usr/bin/banner for annoying blog comments?)\nRevive Third Voice in GreaseMonkey style.  Subscribe to arbitrary REST API'ed annotation servers, fetch & aggregate annotations for current URL via XMLHTTPRequest, build cute floating stickies with rude comments from friends.\nAuto-ROT13 en/decoder ring, because there's a need for that.\nScript which redirects all links to books on Amazon.com to point at my new book.  I will install this on all computers at CompUSA and the Apple Store.\n\nI've suddenly realized that a lot of the things I wanted to do with Agent Frank are possible with GreaseMonkey.  Also, I wonder how long it'll be before I get sucked into further FireFox extension hacking.",

    "summary": "Update (6/9): One quick note-- I've noticed that this little hack of mine has been called a \"hack for Movable Type\".  However, while I personally use Movable Type, this is a hack for textareas in FireFox. \nMovable Type just happens to use textareas.  It's worth noting, however, that WordPress uses textareas too.  So does LiveJournal.  So do most comment posting forms.  This is bigger than a single blog package plugin-- that's the point.\nWhew.  So it looks like the book is out of my hands now, having finished the final reviews.  I have some more to say about that, but first I want to post the results of the last day or so of hacking I've done.\nI've been working on the stuff for the book so long that I just had to do something else (ie. not RSS or Atom) to help clear my head.  But, I'm addicted to learning and building stuff.  So, although I did relax a bit since the main effort of the book passed--that is, relax as normal people define it--I just can't stop making things.  \nSo, I had a beer, cracked open Dive Into GreaseMonkey, and decided to make good on that idea I wrote about last month.  Not only that, but I had a little free time over lunch today, so I downloaded a trial of Snapz Pro X 2 to try my hand at a little screencasting, ala Jon Udell.\nI've got more things to say about all this, and my new found excitement for GreaseMonkey, but first I'll share the goods.\nIf you want to risk running my horribly premature code on your machine, here's the script:\n\nmagic_hcalendar.user.js\n\nIf you'd like a preview of what it does, here's a movie:\n\nmagic_hcalendar.mov\n\nAnd, just for the sake of completeness, here's a quick screen grab:",
