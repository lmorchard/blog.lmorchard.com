Think <code>vi</code> versus MS Word.  Maybe Doug Engelbart versus Jabob Nielsen?  More to think about this.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>So, in a collision between my speed reading digestion of <a href=\"http://www.accelerando.org/\">Charles Stross&#39; new Accelerando</a> and remembering <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-2-1571664,00.html\">this race between thumb-typing and Morse code</a>--I&#39;ve got a notion to explore morse code as a human/computer serial interface for wearables.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=%22morse+code%22+wearables\">I&#39;m sure this just <em>can&#39;t</em> be a new idea</a>, except to me.</p>\n<p>I would like to use two fingers to tap out dots-and-dits on a thigh, or my other palm.  Either that, or I want a Bluetooth version of <a href=\"http://www.morsex.com/palm/\">this Palm Radio Mini-Paddle</a>.</p>\n<p>And, I want a buzzer worn somewhere--like a shoulder or a collarbone--so I can use a little <a href=\"http://www.seeingwithsound.com/voice.htm\">neural plasticity</a> to train myself for morse code input.  And, it would be very nice if I could manage all this with a minimum of attention, say while walking around and not colliding with walls.</p>\n<p>In the end, I want something akin to <a href=\"http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/\">Quicksilver</a>, only invisible, fairly attention light, and with me everywhere.  This is just a start, but eventually I want a wearable exocortex like <a href=\"http://www.accelerando.org/\">Manfred&#39;s</a>--the ultimate GTD accessory.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086361\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.burningchrome.com/~cdent/mt/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ff6c614a0d001e4a94498813d47b47b0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.burningchrome.com/~cdent/mt/\">Chris Dent</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086361\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-24T01:24:38\">2005-06-24T01:24:38</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">&quot;Thereâ€™s a difference between â€œease of useâ€ and â€œease of adoptionâ€, isnâ€™t there? Think vi versus MS Word. Maybe Doug Engelbart versus Jabob Nielsen? More to think about this.&quot;\n\nAbsolutely. By ease adoption do you mean the ease with which it is possible to use something the first time around. That&#39;s more traditionally called ease of learning. Adoption is usually saved in the literature for uptake of the technology in whatever the audience happens to be.\n\nThere&#39;s a mythical sweet spot where ease of use and ease of learning are nicely balanced.  I haven&#39;t seen it yet.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221086363&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8157a5907b244071cda98ba5aa7a9635&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki&quot;&gt;Bill Seitz&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221086363&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-06-24T09:13:04&quot;&gt;2005-06-24T09:13:04&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;When I hear about Morse code as I/O I think of Cryptonomicon where Randy enters some case by hitting his space bar in Morse, and gets back his final decrypted message by having it output to his laptop near-keyboard LEDs.\n</code></pre><p><a href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/CryptoNomicon\">http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/CryptoNomicon</a></div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
