<div class="content">Regarding reusable framework.. Dood, think shell scripts for the web.
Also, if you want dependency management, you&#39;re likely to have better luck creating an extension, like jslib (<a href="http://jslib.mozdev.org/">http://jslib.mozdev.org/</a> ).
On Third Voice bit, Simon Willison and Aaron Boodman are both tinkering in this area.
On decoder ring, you mean where 2 users would share a key, or do u mean persisting encoded values?<br>On book redirect... too evil. ;)</div>

<div class="content">Jeremy: Hey, I&#39;ve been known to amass large libraries of functions for shell scripts too.  :)  But that&#39;s not so much a framework as a module, which is what I was really doing.  But I suspect I will start getting sucked into actual extension development.
As for the decoder ring, I was really just thinking of something silly with ROT13 for spoilers to movies &amp; etc... but a shared key secret spy ring would be nifty.</div>

That is <em>big</em> stuff right there. I&#39;ve seen a few other posts by other people since that one was written which indicate that there&#39;s motion. Not much of it seems visible yet though.</div>

<div class="content">&quot;Can I just say how nice it is to not worry about other browsers when coding?&quot;
It&#39;s like the <em>moral</em> way to experience that thrill.
Plus, it&#39;s simpler than an Extension (never underestimate the major impact of making something slightly easier) and you get to apply it to someone else&#39;s site.</div>

<div class="content">Unfortunately, you only really get to enjoy one-browser coding if you are doing a script for yourself; otherwise, you&#39;ll have that nagging feeling that you should be careful to keep it usable as an Opera 8 User JavaScript, and as a Trixie  script, and as a Turnabout  script, and ...
Extensions, though, you&#39;re really single browser (or slightly more, if you support Seamonkey too), and with chrome privileges you can do whatever you want.</div>

</div>
<div class="content">I&#39;ve said it before, and I&#39;ll say again: I think single-browser user scripts are not the evil that single-browser sites are.  The browser user is in control of their browser and their user scripts.  They can port a script meant for another browser if they like.  The script author does not owe that consideration.
Of course, do it where it makes sense and isn&#39;t painful...</div>
