<li><p>It&#39;s hot--I love it, and I love that I get to leave the basement to enjoy it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>One of my next projects will hopefully be revamping this place and cleaning out some of the rot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>So, yeah: <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html">Apple on Intel</a>.  I say, rock on.  Write apps in Cocoa, check the box, and let the fat binaries sing.  </p>
<p>And I welcome the arrival of faster Virtual PC / WINE--resistance is futile, Windows will be assimilated.  But, please, shut up about the damn dual booting--that&#39;s like modding a Lexus with a spoiler made from 2x4&#39;s.  (Something I seem to recall seeing in a Target parking lot recently, only with a Ford Focus.)</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> plan on hopefully getting another pre-Intel PowerBook before 2007, depending on how our budget works out.  My little first-gen 12&quot; AlBook needs an upgrade and the initial generation or two of MacIntel machines will likely be a sucktastic experience overall.  Some price reductions to move &quot;old world&quot; machines off the shelves would certainly help.</p>
<p>Seriously, does anyone really think the usefulness of the existing lineup of Apple hardware will evaporate completely over the next year or two?  Quite a few of the programs I rely on from day to day have poor or nonexistent counterparts in the Windows world.  These apps are not going away, and most of them are written using Cocoa--I will not be switching back.  </p>
<p>My following upgrade should be timed just about right, in 2009 or so, for the Intel transition to have reached a bit of maturity with the release of OS X 10.6 Liger.</p>
