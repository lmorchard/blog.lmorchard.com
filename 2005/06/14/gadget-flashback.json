And I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a matter of reduced expectations or what, but I&#39;m finding myself strangely happier with this situation.  </p>\n<p>The screen on my <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo 600</a> suffered a crack, and although it was still limping along as a phone, it just wasn&#39;t worth it.  And besides, the thing has disappointed me overall--crappy phone, crappy camera, crappy screen, outmoded OS, badly thought-out headset/headphone situation.  </p>\n<p>After having looked forward to getting one so much, I&#39;m happy to be done with it now.  I just hope I can find my receipts to call in the replacement policy and maybe eBay an unopened <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo</a> to recoup some costs.  Oh, and not be tempted to buy a new camera just to use the spare 512MB SD card I have sitting around now.</p>\n<p>So, the <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo</a> has been replaced by my old <a href=\"http://product.samsung.com/cgi-bin/nabc/prod/hhcommerce/telecommunications/sph_a500_features.jsp\">Samsung A500</a> phone and a first-gen <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Handspring Visor Deluxe</a>, both of which I dug out of old junk boxes in the basement.  </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://product.samsung.com/cgi-bin/nabc/prod/hhcommerce/telecommunications/sph_a500_features.jsp\">Samsung A500</a> phone works well, makes calls, fits comfortably in the same pocket as my wallet.  And, over the years, it&#39;s taken a great share of knocks and drops and has barely flinched.  I&#39;ve downgraded my phone service a bit and abandoned most of the data features, which will save me some money for awhile.  I kind of wish I had a camera on this phone, but I won&#39;t cry over the savings from the missing data plan, nor will I pine for carrying <a href=\"http://www.steves-digicams.com/2002_reviews/pcs_vision.html\">the external camera attachment</a> Sprint offered for the phone.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Handspring Visor</a> has also taken a number of knocks, but keeps going.  The only glitchy bit is that I have to jam a few post-it notes in the cradle with it to ensure a connection, because some of the copper has rubbed off the contacts on the bottom of the PDA.  (I think I might invest in a conductive ink pen.)  Oh, and it doesn&#39;t have a rechargeable battery pack--I&#39;ll have to seek out some decent solution with rechargeable AAA&#39;s (do they even make those anymore?)  But, I remember Graffiti and can probably write that as fast or faster than I could thumb-type on the <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo</a>.</p>\n<p>The really odd thing is that, although the OS on the <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Visor</a> is even further behind than what I had on the <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo</a>, I&#39;m not too sad with it.  Like I said, maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m just not expecting that much.  Hell, I was happy to remember that this model has a backlight!  I miss the internet connectivity a bit, but I never used it much on the <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo</a> because the lack of multitasking and quasi-dialup experience always just pissed me off.  </p>\n<p>But, the address book and date book work on the <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Visor</a>, though I only wish I hadn&#39;t lost my regcode for <a href=\"http://www.pimlicosoftware.com/\">DateBk5</a>.  It syncs with my PowerBook.  I can get text files back and forth with <a href=\"http://mac-huwis.lut.ac.uk/~wis/programs/NoteTaker/NoteTaker.html\">NoteTaker</a>, which ties into all <em>sorts</em> of things.  And, best of all, <a href=\"http://frobnitz.sourceforge.net/\">Frobnitz</a> and <a href=\"http://roguelike-palm.sourceforge.net/\">Rogue</a> both work.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m slowly rediscovering a few of the tools I used to use on this thing, and telling myself that it&#39;s just slightly better than a stack of 3x5 cards.  Because you know, although I love my Moleskine, I just never could quite get into the <a href=\"http://www.hipsterpda.com/\">Hipster PDA</a> thing.  This is unplugged enough for me, thanks.  </p>\n<p>Anyway...  anyone have any cool tricks or tips for my <a href=\"http://product.samsung.com/cgi-bin/nabc/prod/hhcommerce/telecommunications/sph_a500_features.jsp\">Samsung A500</a> phone or this <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Handspring Visor</a>?</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085050\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085050\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T15:58:12\">2005-06-14T15:58:12</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Man, I&#39;m glad I skipped the Treo 600! I waited for the 650, and while it hasn&#39;t converted me into a PalmOS fan (I&#39;ve always been a Pocket PC person), it&#39;s still a solid little unit. The browser is a step up from Pocket IE, and the camera is miles better than the one on my Sanyo phone. \n\nAnd while it <em>was</em> expensive, it completely killed my desire to buy a PSP for portable video. I can fit hours-n-hours of 320x320 video on 1GB SD card... I can watch a rip of the Battlestar Galactica DVD in the car while my wife is clothes shopping. All without the hassle of hauling around extra devices.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085051&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb7f2a3ba74af37415ab7df101a86c75&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;l.m. orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085051&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-06-14T18:40:15&quot;&gt;2005-06-14T18:40:15&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Bah!  :)  I wanted to get the Treo 650, but the 600 is all that was out at the time my 300 died and I called in on yet another replacement plan.  (I think this should tell me something.)\n</code></pre><p>One of the things I really hated on my 600 is the multitasking and the not-always-connected internet connectivity.  Especially when I wanted to jump between email, IM, and web, and it would completely disconnect and redial between programs.  Sometimes it would stay connected, but the IM client would need to reconnect.</p>\n<p>And as for media... ugh.  The 600 screen was only 160x160, if I recall, which killed a lot of opportunities.  And the headphone / headset duality sucked:  You had a headset to make calls with, and headphones to listen to music.  But even though the two shared the same port, they weren&#39;t the same thing.  And a 2-in-1 rig seemed to go for around US$40</p>\n<p>From the few opportunities I&#39;ve had to play with a 650 (all of two), it seems like the much better machine.  But, I <em>would</em> be surprised if they had addressed enough of my gripes for me to like it.</p>\n<p>I think the problem now is that, after having used a Palm III with a Novatel Minstrel wireless cradle like 7 years ago, I expect flying cars by now :)</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085052&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.darkglass.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3da2ed23539be35727b2844e4a6a9b14&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.darkglass.org/&quot;&gt;tamaracks&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085052&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-06-14T22:11:52&quot;&gt;2005-06-14T22:11:52&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Huh, I had some flaky contact problems with my old Visor Deluxe too.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085053&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;l.m. orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085053&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-06-14T23:42:39&quot;&gt;2005-06-14T23:42:39&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;tamaracks:  Yeah, if you happen to still have it and play with your Visor again, take a look at the contacts on the bottom.

I bought the Sanyo 5300 because it was the first Sprint camphone available in my area. And after an ongoing survey of online examples, I think I can safely say that the 5300 has the <em>worst</em>, <em>slowest</em> camera ever grafted on to a clamshell. I grew to loathe the thing... early-adopterism can bite ya sometimes.</p>\n<p>&quot;One of the things I really hated on my 600 is the multitasking and the not-always-connected internet connectivity.&quot;</p>\n<p>Multitasking is obviously still an issue with the 650, although I find that I&#39;m not missing it as much as I would have thought. I always admired the way my Axim could be playing an MP3, tracking the car&#39;s movements via GPS, and surfing the web simultaneously... but in practice, I just don&#39;t do much app switching. I tend to jump into the PDA, do X for a while, and then jump out.</p>\n<p>The off-and-on connectivity issue, OTOH, may be minimized a bit with the 650. It virtually never happens when moving from built-in app to built-in app... it&#39;s the third-party stuff that seems to default to zapping the connection every time I exit. And in one case, I was able to change the default.</p>\n<p>&quot;And the headphone / headset duality sucked...&quot;</p>\n<p>This is probably another area where my expectations are just lower. I don&#39;t listen to music on the Treo, and when watching movies, I&#39;m quite content with the mono audio I get from the headset.</p>\n<p>I just wish I could get mono audio on a Bluetooth headset. That&#39;s the only reason I&#39;m sticking to a wired headset.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
