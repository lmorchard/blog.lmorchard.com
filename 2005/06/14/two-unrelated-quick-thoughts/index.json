Also, I hacked together <a href=\"http://www.swcp.com/~hudson/pilot/minstrel.html\">a gnarly cable</a> to use the Minstrel with my Sony Vaio 505TR laptop running Mandrake Linux so I could work/play in coffee shops in the pre-wifi days.</p>\n<p>Back then, I really wanted to get deeper into wireless and mobile tech--but I never got the big bucks to buy many toys to do it on my own, nor managed to meet anyone in the know.
