And besides, the thing has disappointed me overall--crappy phone, crappy camera, crappy screen, outmoded OS, badly thought-out headset/headphone situation.  </p>\n<p>After having looked forward to getting one so much, I&#39;m happy to be done with it now.

And, over the years, it&#39;s taken a great share of knocks and drops and has barely flinched.  I&#39;ve downgraded my phone service a bit and abandoned most of the data features, which will save me some money for awhile.  I kind of wish I had a camera on this phone, but I won&#39;t cry over the savings from the missing data plan, nor will I pine for carrying <a href=\"http://www.steves-digicams.com/2002_reviews/pcs_vision.html\">the external camera attachment</a> Sprint offered for the phone.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Handspring Visor</a> has also taken a number of knocks, but keeps going.  The only glitchy bit is that I have to jam a few post-it notes in the cradle with it to ensure a connection, because some of the copper has rubbed off the contacts on the bottom of the PDA.  (I think I might invest in a conductive ink pen.)  Oh, and it doesn&#39;t have a rechargeable battery pack--I&#39;ll have to seek out some decent solution with rechargeable AAA&#39;s (do they even make those anymore?)

Like I said, maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m just not expecting that much.  Hell, I was happy to remember that this model has a backlight!

(I think this should tell me something.)\nOne of the things I really hated on my 600 is the multitasking and the not-always-connected internet connectivity.  Especially when I wanted to jump between email, IM, and web, and it would completely disconnect and redial between programs.  Sometimes it would stay connected, but the IM client would need to reconnect.\nAnd as for media... ugh.  The 600 screen was only 160x160, if I recall, which killed a lot of opportunities.  And the headphone / headset duality sucked:  You had a headset to make calls with, and headphones to listen to music.  But even though the two shared the same port, they weren't the same thing.  And a 2-in-1 rig seemed to go for around US$40\nFrom the few opportunities I've had to play with a 650 (all of two), it seems like the much better machine.  But, I *would* be surprised if they had addressed enough of my gripes for me to like it.\nI think the problem now is that, after having used a Palm III with a Novatel Minstrel wireless cradle like 7 years ago, I expect flying cars by now :)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085052\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.darkglass.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3da2ed23539be35727b2844e4a6a9b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.darkglass.org/\">tamaracks</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085052\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T22:11:52\">2005-06-14T22:11:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Huh, I had some flaky contact problems with my old Visor Deluxe too.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085053\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085053\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T23:42:39\">2005-06-14T23:42:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">tamaracks:  Yeah, if you happen to still have it and play with your Visor again, take a look at the contacts on the bottom.

Also available via OWA on the web which is accessible almost anywhere these days.\nMy phone contacts are all in my cell phone..\nI generally have a digital camera in my truck or closer, so I really don't need or want a camera on my phone .. \nI'm so close to a computer so much of the time, why do I need to carry one on my hip when I go to the grocery store?

I bought the Sanyo 5300 because it was the first Sprint camphone available in my area. And after an ongoing survey of online examples, I think I can safely say that the 5300 has the *worst*, *slowest* camera ever grafted on to a clamshell. I grew to loathe the thing... early-adopterism can bite ya sometimes.\n\"One of the things I really hated on my 600 is the multitasking and the not-always-connected internet connectivity.\"\nMultitasking is obviously still an issue with the 650, although I find that I'm not missing it as much as I would have thought. I always admired the way my Axim could be playing an MP3, tracking the car's movements via GPS, and surfing the web simultaneously... but in practice, I just don't do much app switching. I tend to jump into the PDA, do X for a while, and then jump out.\nThe off-and-on connectivity issue, OTOH, may be minimized a bit with the 650. It virtually never happens when moving from built-in app to built-in app... it's the third-party stuff that seems to default to zapping the connection every time I exit. And in one case, I was able to change the default.\n\"And the headphone / headset duality sucked...\"\nThis is probably another area where my expectations are just lower. I don't listen to music on the Treo, and when watching movies, I'm quite content with the mono audio I get from the headset.\nI just wish I could get mono audio on a Bluetooth headset. That's the only reason I'm sticking to a wired headset.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

But, I *would* be surprised if they had addressed enough of my gripes for me to like it.\r\n\r\nI think the problem now is that, after having used a Palm III with a Novatel Minstrel wireless cradle like 7 years ago, I expect flying cars by now :)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085052\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.darkglass.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3da2ed23539be35727b2844e4a6a9b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.darkglass.org/\">tamaracks</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085052\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T22:11:52\">2005-06-14T22:11:52</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Huh, I had some flaky contact problems with my old Visor Deluxe too.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085053\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085053\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T23:42:39\">2005-06-14T23:42:39</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">tamaracks:  Yeah, if you happen to still have it and play with your Visor again, take a look at the contacts on the bottom.

I bought the Sanyo 5300 because it was the first Sprint camphone available in my area. And after an ongoing survey of online examples, I think I can safely say that the 5300 has the *worst*, *slowest* camera ever grafted on to a clamshell. I grew to loathe the thing... early-adopterism can bite ya sometimes.\r\n\r\n\"One of the things I really hated on my 600 is the multitasking and the not-always-connected internet connectivity.\"\r\n\r\nMultitasking is obviously still an issue with the 650, although I find that I'm not missing it as much as I would have thought. I always admired the way my Axim could be playing an MP3, tracking the car's movements via GPS, and surfing the web simultaneously... but in practice, I just don't do much app switching. I tend to jump into the PDA, do X for a while, and then jump out.\r\n\r\nThe off-and-on connectivity issue, OTOH, may be minimized a bit with the 650. It virtually never happens when moving from built-in app to built-in app... it's the third-party stuff that seems to default to zapping the connection every time I exit. And in one case, I was able to change the default.\r\n\r\n\"And the headphone / headset duality sucked...\"\r\n\r\nThis is probably another area where my expectations are just lower. I don't listen to music on the Treo, and when watching movies, I'm quite content with the mono audio I get from the headset.\r\n\r\nI just wish I could get mono audio on a Bluetooth headset. That's the only reason I'm sticking to a wired headset.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",
