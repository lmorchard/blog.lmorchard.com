But I have to give props where they&#39;re due:  </p>\n<p>It was Radio UserLand and your evangelism that finally got me into RSS and pushed me down a lot of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/15/ooooio\">threads of inquiry</a> into programming in general.  And <a href=\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/04/16#le9d6d43af8d7346730bbcbfab8a3a466\">a link from you</a> back in 2002 gave me one of my first floods of inbound traffic and links, accompanied by a rush of new people saying hello.  That did me in right there, and I&#39;ve been hooked on this stuff since.</p>\n<p>And, without your work, I most likely wouldn&#39;t be writing <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764597582/0xdecafbad-20\">this book</a> right now.  Which, regardless of how well it does (very well, I hope!), is something I&#39;ve wanted to do for a very long time.</p>\n<p>So, thank you--and <a href=\"http://archive.scripting.com/2005/05/01#aBirthdayRequest\">happy (belated) birthday, Dave!</a></p>\n"}
