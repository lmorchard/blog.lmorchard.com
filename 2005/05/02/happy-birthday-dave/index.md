I know lots of people have had their differences and disagreements with you, me included.  But I have to give props where they're due:  

It was Radio UserLand and your evangelism that finally got me into RSS and pushed me down a lot of [threads of inquiry][ti] into programming in general.  And [a link from you][al] back in 2002 gave me one of my first floods of inbound traffic and links, accompanied by a rush of new people saying hello.  That did me in right there, and I've been hooked on this stuff since.

And, without your work, I most likely wouldn't be writing [this book][tb] right now.  Which, regardless of how well it does (very well, I hope!), is something I've wanted to do for a very long time.

So, thank you--and [happy (belated) birthday, Dave!][bd]
