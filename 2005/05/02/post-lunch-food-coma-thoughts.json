It&#39;s kinda like videos we tried making in high school, only with a budget.  I can&#39;t breathe, and coffee keeps shooting out my nose.  I can only hope that this condition isn&#39;t permanent.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Considering the <code>mdls</code> and <code>mdfind</code> commands on Tiger gives me an idea toward making an über-Blosxom.  (I&#39;m really abusing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber\">über</a> lately.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I hope someone works out a way to tie Spotlight to indexing arbitrary HFS extended attributes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Times like these, I wish I was developing software for Mac :)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Under Tiger, it seems like CPU and memory consumption are markedly reduced.  Although I did a backup-slash-and-burn installation of Tiger, I&#39;m back to running pretty much the same set of apps as I had on Panther.  </p>\n<p>Usually, I&#39;d be running at around a 25% baseline CPU consumption all the time and there&#39;d be no free physical memory.  But now, even with a NetNewsWire refresh in progress, I&#39;m barely up to 5% CPU, and I&#39;ve still got a sliver of my 1GB free.  So, it might just be an artifact of a fresh, clean install--or I might be nuts--but it seems like they&#39;ve done some good things.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088378\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3c61cf7e50ce6eecb34ba49cc71db6ef&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">hotentote</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088378\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-02T15:09:37\">2005-05-02T15:09:37</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">FYI, another good term for &quot;food coma&quot; is &quot;gut bomb&quot;.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
