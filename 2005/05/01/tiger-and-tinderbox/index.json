Once you've created a Tinderbox file with whatever you wnat in there (Mine is a catchall called \"Laptop Tinderbox #1\") create a folder wherever you want and call it something like \"Tinderbox Explosion.\" This works best if you assign the HTML export file \"struct.html\" to every note, and make sure that all the children are exported from every note that has them. These assignments can be made in various ways, including the Value stamp.\nWhen you are ready, do \"Export as HTML\" from the File menu, or Command-Shift-H if you prefer. Export to your designated folder, which will fill up with HTML files, hierarchical hypertext with all the links intact (make sure you have checked all the llink export boxes in the Preferences before you export.)\nEach HTML file is searchable with Spotlight, and can be opened in your browser by clicking in the Spotlight window. Essentially, it is a formatted individual note. If you don't like what's in the folder, drag the contents to the Trash and tweak the Tinderbox file before doing it again.
