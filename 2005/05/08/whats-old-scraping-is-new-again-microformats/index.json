If an html author can at least use CSS nicely, its trivial to create an RSS with tidy + XSL (or any other way).  Thats useful if their content management system is some sort of lame html editing system that inserts the authors text into a template (i.e. only one page can be created from a single source) rather than generating markup for several pages (html, rss) from a content source.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",
