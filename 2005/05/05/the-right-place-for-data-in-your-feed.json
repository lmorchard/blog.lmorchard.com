This seems so obvious to me that it&#39;s either got to have been covered by someone else already, or it&#39;s so wrong that I just haven&#39;t seen it yet.</p>\n<p>For one thing, extending the format limits your extension to that format, unless you craft it in such a way that makes it compatible with other feed formats.  This is not impossible or even hard in some cases, but it&#39;s more of a problem of adoption and buy-in than a technical issue.  <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> is an RSS 1.0 extension; how many RSS 2.0 or Atom 0.3 feeds have you seen using some adaptation of <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a>?  (Though, to be fair, how many RSS 1.0 feeds have you seen using <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> in the first place?)</p>\n<p>Just what do calendar events have to do with syndication feeds, other than that feeds are a convenient carrier wave?  Why should we try to shoehorn calendar data into the fabric of a feed itself?</p>\n<p>All the feed formats I care about can carry (X)HTML content, and these <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats\">microformats</a> are just XHTML content constructed along a certain set of conventions.  So, any feed supporting XHTML content can carry microformat-enriched content--without, necessarily, any feed format alterations, convincing of feed format authors, or buy-in from aggregator developers.  (Of course, you might need those developers to actually <em>do</em> something with the microcontent when it arrives, but that&#39;s another story.)</p>\n<p>Leave the feed to manage the business of facilitating push-via-poll with aggregators and decouple the markup and structure of rich microcontent items from feed formats altogether.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this helps address the question of &quot;<a href=\"http://bitsko.slc.ut.us/blog/feed-data.html\">Is a feed the right place for your data?</a>&quot;  My tentative answer to this is, &quot;No, but it doesn&#39;t hurt if it&#39;s in there, too.&quot;  </p>\n<p>Think of the feed as just a mechanism to facilitate content delivery--and not as the embodiment of the content itself.  Mind you, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/17/use_atom_for_a_universal_blog_transfer_protocol\">feed entries do make nice representations of content</a>, covering many common attributes.  But, keep feeds themselves constructed in terms of metadata about content.  Although items of content might also be carried in full in feed entries, the &quot;<em>real</em>&quot; content should exist somewhere else as well.</p>\n<p>Things like <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> should be used to provide <em>hints</em> to aggregators whose authors, for instance, might not care to bundle in and maintain a full-blown <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats\">microformat</a> parser.  </p>\n<p>Think of a MySQL table:  You can define columns in a table, and then you can define zero or more indexes on those columns.  The data&#39;s still there if you don&#39;t define any indexes, and queries are still possible--it&#39;s just that queries are more laborious.  And, your indexes don&#39;t need to be matched up one-to-one with your columns--they can be concatenations of columns, or just about whatever else you want.  </p>\n<p>Consider <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> like an index for aggregators on <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/hCalendar\">hCalendar</a> content--<a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/hCalendar\">hCalendar</a> defines the columns, <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> facilitates better routing/filtering.  Although getting buy-in from feed format authors and feed aggregator developers helps get indexes created, you don&#39;t necessarily need that to get the content into the feed in the first place.</p>\n<p>Okay... I think all that made sense.  I had to get that spewed out of my head before I lost it.  :)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085746\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085746\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-05T14:05:54\">2005-05-05T14:05:54</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">I&#39;m a fan of microformats, but this seems so wrong.  microformats are a &quot;worse is better&quot; solution for getting rich data onto the web for people without better tools then a simple CMS.  their useful to large scale aggregators (e.g. pubsub or technorati) who are already maintaining crawlers. (though I think the really promise doesn&#39;t lie with generalist, but domain specific aggregators developed by small affinity groups)\n\nIf you do have good enough tools to provide the data in a more structured way then by all means <em>do</em> it, more elegant, easier to consume, more meaningful, less ambiguous, easier to grok, etc. \n\nmod_event is <em>much</em> more useful then hCalendar in the context of feeds, but perhaps its non-obvious because you&#39;re thinking of it from the context of S-to-P (site to person) syndication, but where it comes in very useful is S-to-S (site to site) syndication, the original RSS design goal.\n\nadditionally the joy of XML means you can mix in other namespaces to enrich mod_event&#39;s intentionally limited expressiveness.  in particular we&#39;ve played with mixing in vCard and geo namespaces to get more specific\n\nas for your last question, i&#39;ve seen several hundred feeds with mod_event, but i&#39;m kind of odd like that :)</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085747&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=475a543984769e9890f8dc0091f602c3&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/&quot;&gt;Phillip Pearson&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085747&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-05-05T20:17:32&quot;&gt;2005-05-05T20:17:32&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Exactly -- from the perspective of trying to maximize usefulness, it&#39;s great to put your &quot;semantic markup&quot; in both the feed and the data.\n</code></pre><p>It depends on your target market, of course... if nobody will ever scrape your site but you have an aggregator of calendar events watching your feed like a hawk, then the feed is most important.</p>\n<p>But if you&#39;re just kicking off a new market, you might as well do it in a way that makes the most sense for the future...which is what this seems to be.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085748&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://tantek.com/log/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02cd45622e90350cc061aaaa02229195&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://tantek.com/log/&quot;&gt;Tantek&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085748&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-05-08T12:42:02&quot;&gt;2005-05-08T12:42:02&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;You&#39;ve made an excellent observation.\n</code></pre><p>Does one have to request permission from the envelope makers before one writes a letter in a different way? </p>\n<p>Does it make sense to ask everyone to write envelopes differently just because you&#39;ve figured out a new way to write letters or new things to put in your letters?</p>\n<p>Does it make sense to feel obligated to duplicate the information in your letter on the envelope as well?</p>\n<p>Of course not.</p>\n<p>In many ways, feeds are nothing more than another medium for passing messages, and just as there was no need to change nor extend TCP/IP to handle HTTP or HTML for that matter, there is no need to change RSS/Atom to handle new types of content which are well described by portable microformats.</p>\n<p>Tantek</p>\n<p>P.S.
