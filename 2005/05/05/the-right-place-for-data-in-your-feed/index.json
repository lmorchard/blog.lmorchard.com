  "html": "<p>I&#39;ve suddenly gotten very interested in <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats\">microformats</a>, especially since it struck me very soundly that they belong in this final chapter of my book about extending feeds.  </p>\n<p>I started off writing a bit about <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> and <a href=\"http://www.pmbrowser.info/wiki.pl?RVW\">RVW</a> with respect to extending feed formats with additional metadata, but then the <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats\">microformat</a> thing hit me:  Why extend the feed format metadata when you can extend the feed content?  This seems so obvious to me that it&#39;s either got to have been covered by someone else already, or it&#39;s so wrong that I just haven&#39;t seen it yet.</p>\n<p>For one thing, extending the format limits your extension to that format, unless you craft it in such a way that makes it compatible with other feed formats.  This is not impossible or even hard in some cases, but it&#39;s more of a problem of adoption and buy-in than a technical issue.  <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> is an RSS 1.0 extension; how many RSS 2.0 or Atom 0.3 feeds have you seen using some adaptation of <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a>?  (Though, to be fair, how many RSS 1.0 feeds have you seen using <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> in the first place?)</p>\n<p>Just what do calendar events have to do with syndication feeds, other than that feeds are a convenient carrier wave?  Why should we try to shoehorn calendar data into the fabric of a feed itself?</p>\n<p>All the feed formats I care about can carry (X)HTML content, and these <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats\">microformats</a> are just XHTML content constructed along a certain set of conventions.  So, any feed supporting XHTML content can carry microformat-enriched content--without, necessarily, any feed format alterations, convincing of feed format authors, or buy-in from aggregator developers.  (Of course, you might need those developers to actually <em>do</em> something with the microcontent when it arrives, but that&#39;s another story.)</p>\n<p>Leave the feed to manage the business of facilitating push-via-poll with aggregators and decouple the markup and structure of rich microcontent items from feed formats altogether.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this helps address the question of &quot;<a href=\"http://bitsko.slc.ut.us/blog/feed-data.html\">Is a feed the right place for your data?</a>&quot;  My tentative answer to this is, &quot;No, but it doesn&#39;t hurt if it&#39;s in there, too.&quot;  </p>\n<p>Think of the feed as just a mechanism to facilitate content delivery--and not as the embodiment of the content itself.  Mind you, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/17/use_atom_for_a_universal_blog_transfer_protocol\">feed entries do make nice representations of content</a>, covering many common attributes.  But, keep feeds themselves constructed in terms of metadata about content.  Although items of content might also be carried in full in feed entries, the &quot;<em>real</em>&quot; content should exist somewhere else as well.</p>\n<p>Things like <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> should be used to provide <em>hints</em> to aggregators whose authors, for instance, might not care to bundle in and maintain a full-blown <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats\">microformat</a> parser.  </p>\n<p>Think of a MySQL table:  You can define columns in a table, and then you can define zero or more indexes on those columns.  The data&#39;s still there if you don&#39;t define any indexes, and queries are still possible--it&#39;s just that queries are more laborious.  And, your indexes don&#39;t need to be matched up one-to-one with your columns--they can be concatenations of columns, or just about whatever else you want.  </p>\n<p>Consider <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> like an index for aggregators on <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/hCalendar\">hCalendar</a> content--<a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/hCalendar\">hCalendar</a> defines the columns, <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> facilitates better routing/filtering.  Although getting buy-in from feed format authors and feed aggregator developers helps get indexes created, you don&#39;t necessarily need that to get the content into the feed in the first place.</p>\n<p>Okay... I think all that made sense.  I had to get that spewed out of my head before I lost it.  :)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085746\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085746\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-05T14:05:54\">2005-05-05T14:05:54</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I'm a fan of microformats, but this seems so wrong.  microformats are a \"worse is better\" solution for getting rich data onto the web for people without better tools then a simple CMS.  their useful to large scale aggregators (e.g. pubsub or technorati) who are already maintaining crawlers.
