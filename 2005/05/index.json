    "html": "<p>You know, I think I fully realized why microformats seem so appealing and familiar to me:</p>\n<p>The appealing part stems from that fact that I&#39;ve been working on building web scrapers for years now, using a slew of languages (Perl, Java, Python, XSL, JavaScript, bash scripts) and approaches (HTML parsing, regexes, XSL, tidy-and-XPath).  Anything to make that easier strikes a nice chord with me.</p>\n<p>But, I just remembered that a few summers ago, I wrote a bit for <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/spiderhks/toc.html\">the O&#39;Reilly book Spidering Hacks</a> that anticipates the notion of a microformat.  </p>\n<p>If you happen to have the book (which I highly recommend), or can read it on <a href=\"http://safari.oreilly.com/\">Safari</a> (which I also highly recommend), take a look at <strong>Hack #96: Making Your Resources Scrapable with Regular Expressions</strong>.</p>\n<p>Granted, my proto-solution published there suggested using regexes and consistenly named HTML <em>id</em> attributes.  So, I&#39;m much more pleased with the microformat approach using CSS classes.  And, I&#39;m currently trying to write a general microformat parser using Python&#39;s HTMLParser class, which beats using regexes.</p>\n<p>Just thought I&#39;d share the revelation, and toot my own fledgling writing horn. :)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084967\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084967\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-08T22:25:31\">2005-05-08T22:25:31</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I dunno...

    "body": "You know, I think I fully realized why microformats seem so appealing and familiar to me:\r\n\r\nThe appealing part stems from that fact that I've been working on building web scrapers for years now, using a slew of languages (Perl, Java, Python, XSL, JavaScript, bash scripts) and approaches (HTML parsing, regexes, XSL, tidy-and-XPath).  Anything to make that easier strikes a nice chord with me.\r\n\r\nBut, I just remembered that a few summers ago, I wrote a bit for [the O'Reilly book Spidering Hacks][sh] that anticipates the notion of a microformat.  \r\n\r\nIf you happen to have the book (which I highly recommend), or can read it on [Safari][sa] (which I also highly recommend), take a look at **Hack #96: Making Your Resources Scrapable with Regular Expressions**.\r\n\r\nGranted, my proto-solution published there suggested using regexes and consistenly named HTML *id* attributes.  So, I'm much more pleased with the microformat approach using CSS classes.  And, I'm currently trying to write a general microformat parser using Python's HTMLParser class, which beats using regexes.\r\n\r\nJust thought I'd share the revelation, and toot my own fledgling writing horn. :)\r\n\r\n[sa]: http://safari.oreilly.com/\r\n[sh]: http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/spiderhks/toc.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084967\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084967\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-08T22:25:31\">2005-05-08T22:25:31</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I dunno...

    "html": "<p>I&#39;ve suddenly gotten very interested in <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats\">microformats</a>, especially since it struck me very soundly that they belong in this final chapter of my book about extending feeds.  </p>\n<p>I started off writing a bit about <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> and <a href=\"http://www.pmbrowser.info/wiki.pl?RVW\">RVW</a> with respect to extending feed formats with additional metadata, but then the <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats\">microformat</a> thing hit me:  Why extend the feed format metadata when you can extend the feed content?  This seems so obvious to me that it&#39;s either got to have been covered by someone else already, or it&#39;s so wrong that I just haven&#39;t seen it yet.</p>\n<p>For one thing, extending the format limits your extension to that format, unless you craft it in such a way that makes it compatible with other feed formats.  This is not impossible or even hard in some cases, but it&#39;s more of a problem of adoption and buy-in than a technical issue.  <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> is an RSS 1.0 extension; how many RSS 2.0 or Atom 0.3 feeds have you seen using some adaptation of <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a>?  (Though, to be fair, how many RSS 1.0 feeds have you seen using <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> in the first place?)</p>\n<p>Just what do calendar events have to do with syndication feeds, other than that feeds are a convenient carrier wave?  Why should we try to shoehorn calendar data into the fabric of a feed itself?</p>\n<p>All the feed formats I care about can carry (X)HTML content, and these <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats\">microformats</a> are just XHTML content constructed along a certain set of conventions.  So, any feed supporting XHTML content can carry microformat-enriched content--without, necessarily, any feed format alterations, convincing of feed format authors, or buy-in from aggregator developers.  (Of course, you might need those developers to actually <em>do</em> something with the microcontent when it arrives, but that&#39;s another story.)</p>\n<p>Leave the feed to manage the business of facilitating push-via-poll with aggregators and decouple the markup and structure of rich microcontent items from feed formats altogether.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this helps address the question of &quot;<a href=\"http://bitsko.slc.ut.us/blog/feed-data.html\">Is a feed the right place for your data?</a>&quot;  My tentative answer to this is, &quot;No, but it doesn&#39;t hurt if it&#39;s in there, too.&quot;  </p>\n<p>Think of the feed as just a mechanism to facilitate content delivery--and not as the embodiment of the content itself.  Mind you, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/17/use_atom_for_a_universal_blog_transfer_protocol\">feed entries do make nice representations of content</a>, covering many common attributes.  But, keep feeds themselves constructed in terms of metadata about content.  Although items of content might also be carried in full in feed entries, the &quot;<em>real</em>&quot; content should exist somewhere else as well.</p>\n<p>Things like <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> should be used to provide <em>hints</em> to aggregators whose authors, for instance, might not care to bundle in and maintain a full-blown <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats\">microformat</a> parser.  </p>\n<p>Think of a MySQL table:  You can define columns in a table, and then you can define zero or more indexes on those columns.  The data&#39;s still there if you don&#39;t define any indexes, and queries are still possible--it&#39;s just that queries are more laborious.  And, your indexes don&#39;t need to be matched up one-to-one with your columns--they can be concatenations of columns, or just about whatever else you want.  </p>\n<p>Consider <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> like an index for aggregators on <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/hCalendar\">hCalendar</a> content--<a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/hCalendar\">hCalendar</a> defines the columns, <a href=\"http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\"><code>mod_event</code></a> facilitates better routing/filtering.  Although getting buy-in from feed format authors and feed aggregator developers helps get indexes created, you don&#39;t necessarily need that to get the content into the feed in the first place.</p>\n<p>Okay...

    "body": "I've suddenly gotten very interested in [microformats][mf], especially since it struck me very soundly that they belong in this final chapter of my book about extending feeds.  \r\n\r\nI started off writing a bit about [`mod_event`][me] and [RVW][rvw] with respect to extending feed formats with additional metadata, but then the [microformat][mf] thing hit me:  Why extend the feed format metadata when you can extend the feed content?  This seems so obvious to me that it's either got to have been covered by someone else already, or it's so wrong that I just haven't seen it yet.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, extending the format limits your extension to that format, unless you craft it in such a way that makes it compatible with other feed formats.  This is not impossible or even hard in some cases, but it's more of a problem of adoption and buy-in than a technical issue.  [`mod_event`][me] is an RSS 1.0 extension; how many RSS 2.0 or Atom 0.3 feeds have you seen using some adaptation of [`mod_event`][me]?  (Though, to be fair, how many RSS 1.0 feeds have you seen using [`mod_event`][me] in the first place?)\r\n\r\nJust what do calendar events have to do with syndication feeds, other than that feeds are a convenient carrier wave?  Why should we try to shoehorn calendar data into the fabric of a feed itself?\r\n\r\nAll the feed formats I care about can carry (X)HTML content, and these [microformats][mf] are just XHTML content constructed along a certain set of conventions.  So, any feed supporting XHTML content can carry microformat-enriched content--without, necessarily, any feed format alterations, convincing of feed format authors, or buy-in from aggregator developers.  (Of course, you might need those developers to actually *do* something with the microcontent when it arrives, but that's another story.)\r\n\r\nLeave the feed to manage the business of facilitating push-via-poll with aggregators and decouple the markup and structure of rich microcontent items from feed formats altogether.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this helps address the question of \"[Is a feed the right place for your data?][fd]\"  My tentative answer to this is, \"No, but it doesn't hurt if it's in there, too.\"  \r\n\r\nThink of the feed as just a mechanism to facilitate content delivery--and not as the embodiment of the content itself.  Mind you, [feed entries do make nice representations of content][au], covering many common attributes.  But, keep feeds themselves constructed in terms of metadata about content.  Although items of content might also be carried in full in feed entries, the \"*real*\" content should exist somewhere else as well.\r\n\r\nThings like [`mod_event`][me] should be used to provide *hints* to aggregators whose authors, for instance, might not care to bundle in and maintain a full-blown [microformat][mf] parser.  \r\n\r\nThink of a MySQL table:  You can define columns in a table, and then you can define zero or more indexes on those columns.  The data's still there if you don't define any indexes, and queries are still possible--it's just that queries are more laborious.  And, your indexes don't need to be matched up one-to-one with your columns--they can be concatenations of columns, or just about whatever else you want.  \r\n\r\nConsider [`mod_event`][me] like an index for aggregators on [hCalendar][hc] content--[hCalendar][hc] defines the columns, [`mod_event`][me] facilitates better routing/filtering.  Although getting buy-in from feed format authors and feed aggregator developers helps get indexes created, you don't necessarily need that to get the content into the feed in the first place.\r\n\r\nOkay... I think all that made sense.  I had to get that spewed out of my head before I lost it.  :)\r\n\r\n[au]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/17/use_atom_for_a_universal_blog_transfer_protocol\r\n[hc]: http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/hCalendar\r\n[fd]: http://bitsko.slc.ut.us/blog/feed-data.html\r\n[me]: http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/\r\n[rvw]: http://www.pmbrowser.info/wiki.pl?RVW\r\n[mf]: http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085746\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085746\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-05T14:05:54\">2005-05-05T14:05:54</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I'm a fan of microformats, but this seems so wrong.  microformats are a \"worse is better\" solution for getting rich data onto the web for people without better tools then a simple CMS.  their useful to large scale aggregators (e.g. pubsub or technorati) who are already maintaining crawlers.

That is, it makes a window alternately fill the screen (except the dock) or shrink back to the size before I hit the button.\r\n\r\n[Path Finder]: http://www.cocoatech.com/\r\n[do]: http://www.gpsoft.com.au/amiga/AmigaIndex.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090076\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=89242476196334aff51840e7c4dadad2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\">George Hotelling</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090076\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-05T13:22:19\">2005-05-05T13:22:19</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">One thing that kills me about the zoom button (technically not a maximize button as shown by iTunes) is that when you click it in iChat on 10.3 it changes the width to fit names and pictures, while on 10.4 it resizes iChat to fit names, pictures and status.\r\n\r\nThe default \"I am currently away from my computer\" away message now causes my window to expand to fill half the screen, and there's always someone who puts up an epic poem as their away message which causes iChat to go fullscreen.\r\n\r\nI prefer the 10.3 way of shrinking to the smallest window that can fit the information.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090078\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.projectbongos.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b5bf0cd9f949af1de855a14c5d1ca30e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.projectbongos.org\">Tim Schwartz</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090078\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-05T22:18:21\">2005-05-05T22:18:21</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I use Desktop Manager for os X which lets you have multiple desktop, its pretty well done.
