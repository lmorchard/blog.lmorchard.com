  "html": "<p>Hmm, so the video-playing iPod has arrived.  And <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/itunes/videos/\" title=\"Such a tiny screen!\">they&#39;re selling current episodes of ABC TV shows at $1.99 a pop</a>.  Let me lay down some quick thoughts here:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>We subscribe to basic analog cable at about $50 a month.  If we instead put all that money into iTMS, that&#39;d be 25 episodes a month.</li>\n<li>Weekly shows only manage around 4 episodes per month, so that&#39;d be about 6 shows we could keep up with.</li>\n<li>Come to think of it, that&#39;s probably about the maximum number of on-air shows we care about anyway—everything else comes from Netflix.</li>\n<li>A season of a show seems to run about 24 episodes, which would cost about $48 through iTMS.  The first season of Lost on DVD retails for $59.99, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JNOG/0xdecafbad01-20\">sells for $38.99 on Amazon</a>, as of this writing.</li>\n<li>The price difference here comes out much more favorably than I thought it would.  This would obviously trade immediacy for quality—but that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing with music through iTMS versus CDs, anyway.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Forgetting for the moment about the tiny screen and low resolutions even on the desktop, it seems somewhat crazy and counter-intuitive to give up several dozen channels of cable television for less than a couple-dozen hours of programming.  But I&#39;d bet we give a crap about less than a couple-dozen hours of content on cable anyway.</p>\n<p>But, I&#39;ve gotten more and more convinced that being given just what I want is more valuable than being given large quantities in the hopes that I&#39;ll like <em>something</em> in the pile.  It&#39;s all about intentionality in my media consumption.</p>\n<p>Of course, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/10/urban-birdsong-copyright-and-cores-of-culture\">along the lines of what I wrote this week</a>, I&#39;m hoping to see lots of amateur content flowing into this gadget.  Of course, 90% will be crud, but there&#39;s still the chance for 10% good that wasn&#39;t there before.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090538\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.screwtheman.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=52c00253a2327f7d1d351fdd259405c1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.screwtheman.com\">Paul</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090538\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-12T20:30:06\">2005-10-12T20:30:06</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>\"Forgetting for the moment about the tiny screen and low resolutions even on the desktop\"</p>\n<p>The new iPod, from what I understand has video out built in.

The cultural version of metropolitan suburbs. You can't possibly be exposed to anything you don't like (unless it's \"promoted\" by someone you trust).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You already see the effects of this trend on political discourse, where the various factions polarise, building their radical, well-guarded communities, agreeing on nothing and unable to understand the other's point of view. \"Conservative\" values thrive in this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Mainstream\" cultural opportunities are less and less, like they were 30 or 40 years ago; then the cause was economical, now it's cultural: people don't want to know more that they already do. Is this just a case of long-run information overload?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BTW, anything with DRM on it is not going to have my money :)</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090549\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090549\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-13T16:24:50\">2005-10-13T16:24:50</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@Giacomo:  Eh, I don't have high expectations for anything other than crap (at worst) and tuned echo chambers (at best) from television anyway.
