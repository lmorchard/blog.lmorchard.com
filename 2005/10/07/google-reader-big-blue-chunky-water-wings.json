We&#39;ll see how fast it is once they&#39;ve had a chance to actually get it stabilized.  On the bright side, it accepted my metric ton of feeds in an OPML export from NetNewsWire without complaint.</p>\n<p>Seems pretty neat and whizbang so far—ooh, ahh—but it&#39;s just too  clunky, chunky, and cute for me.  It&#39;s got big, fat, blue toy borders around everything.  And, despite having nice keyboard accellerators, it spends an awful lot of time animating the scrolling strip under the &quot;book magnifier&quot;.  </p>\n<p>(You know, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000AOZ8B2/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1\" title=\"I&#39;m *so* going to need one of these someday.\">those things</a> they sell to people who want the Large Print edition of Readers&#39; Digest?  I&#39;ll probably need one someday.)</p>\n<p>But, then again, I never caught the Gmail buzz either.  Too much AJAX, not enough IMAP.  To be fair to this lens thing, though, I&#39;m an admitted info freako outlier who&#39;ll probably be approaching 1K feeds before the year&#39;s out.  That said, I suspect I&#39;m just ahead of my time and more people will be where I am, eventually.</p>\n<p>Anyway, what I look for in a feed reader is how well it enables speed skimming:  I&#39;m going to ignore 70-90% of what I see in feeds, so I don&#39;t want an aggregator which helps me carefully and methodically pick my way across the headlines.  </p>\n<p>No, I want something which lets me scream through feeds as fast as my eyes can move and a finger can slap the space bar.  I&#39;ll queue up what I really want to read in browser tabs or some other temporary storage, but I&#39;m not going to want to spend more than a split second on a headline.</p>\n<p>The other thing I want is more machine intelligence.  For example, for my book (which <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1\" title=\"You know you want a shiny copy of Hacking RSS and Atom!\">you should buy</a>), I built <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/hacking_rss_and_atom/ch15_popular_links.py\" title=\"Like the script?  Buy the book.\">a popular links feed generator</a> which skims links out of all the entries from all my feed and ranks them by number of mentions.  This is the first feed I read each day, because it&#39;s the most valuable.  </p>\n<p>From there, I read feeds produced by sites like Technorati and Feedster, followed by feeds on topics I&#39;ve currently prioritized.  If I have time, I eventually wade deeper into my feed list and even reach the end some days.  If I had more machine intelligence helping, I might never actually have to make it through the whole list to catch what I really want to catch.</p>\n<p>Basically, what I look for in aggregators is assistance in <a href=\"http://interconnected.org/home/2005/10/02/attenuation_is\" title=\"Have I mentioned lately how much I appreciate Matt Webb&#39;s site and the fact that he takes the time to annotate each link?\">attenuation</a>.  I want to push as much as possible out of my front-and-center attention, let other processes deal with things, and discard with wild abandon.  This is not email, where every postcard that falls through the slot could be a message addressed directly to me.  I don&#39;t want to manage these pieces of information in onesies and twosies.</p>\n<p>No, my subscriptions are the rapids in the <a href=\"http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/riverOfNews\" title=\"WHOOOOSH!\">river of news</a> and these water-wings don&#39;t help me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.poolmart.com/swimmies.htm\" title=\"No, that's not me.
