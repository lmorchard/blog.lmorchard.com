Yes, <a href=\"http://archive.scripting.com/2005/09/20#whenRssIsntVeryGreat\">I&#39;m looking at <em>you</em> too, Boing Boing</a>.  </p>\n<p>The one upside to the ads in Boing Boing&#39;s feed, so far anyway, is that at least they don&#39;t change from poll-to-poll.  So, although I get a face full of the ads repeated down my aggregator page, at least I only see them each once.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"http://slate.msn.com/rss/\">Slate&#39;s feed</a>, on the other hand, entries I&#39;ve already fetched change on every poll to the feed because they randomly rotate through and generate new ads every time I request the feed.  So, in effect, nearly every entry in the feed ends up being &quot;updated&quot; when I request it.</p>\n<p><strong>This sucks.  Please stop.  Stop now.  Feed entries are not the same as web pages.</strong></p>\n<p>Of course, part of this has to do with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a>&#39;s approach to tracking whether an entry is new or has changed.  That is, it takes an MD5 hash of the entry&#39;s XML source and uses that as a unique ID.  Yes, this is lazy.

Which, thankfully, they are in Slate&#39;s feed.
