I mean, obviously, there&#39;s evidence of hard work put into this thing.  And although I haven&#39;t bothered to view source yet, I imagine there&#39;s some cool AJAX-style magic going on under there.  And, for some (most?) users, this way of viewing feeds is nice and pleasant to use.</p>\n<p>But, man... all that hard work, and I just can&#39;t shake my impression of how <em>slow</em> this thing is.  And I don&#39;t mean how slow it is to load from the server, but the whole UI experience once it&#39;s loaded: That is, how slow all the scrolling and the clicking and the navigating is.  Wasn&#39;t this AJAX thing supposed to be all about quick, slick, and snappy web apps?</p>\n<p>I guess I feel a bit let downâ€”with all the time it took Google to make a move in the feed aggregator space, and with those PhD&#39;s they have laying around, I expected they&#39;d finally have something revolutionary.  Not this, not a cute toy <em>I</em> could&#39;ve cobbled together <em>myself</em> in short order with Flash or AJAX.  (But I haven&#39;t, because it&#39;d be useless to me.)</p>\n<p>For example, take the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/apis/maps/\">Google Maps API</a>.  I just happened to be working with it for a project this week, and I have to say that that&#39;s some nice stuff there.  That&#39;s a platform that feels like some magic.  I don&#39;t think I could&#39;ve built <em>that</em> from scratch, though it sure is fun building things atop it.</p>\n<!-- tags: google rss syndication rants googlemaps -->\n"}
