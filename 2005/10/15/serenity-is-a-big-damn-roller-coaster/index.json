  "html": "<p>I&#39;ve just finally seen <a href=\"http://www.serenitymovie.com/\">Serenity</a>.  So, if you&#39;re concerned about spoilers, bugger off now—if you cared about spoilers, you should&#39;ve already seen the big damn movie.  </p>\n<p>Some quick, fully spoiled thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I&#39;m fairly certain it was the best science fiction movie I&#39;ve seen in about 10-15 years.  I&#39;m only just about to turn 30 this month, so I&#39;m not old by any stretch—but I&#39;ve watched a lot of sci-fi in my time.  Probably too much sci-fi.  </p>\n<p>In any case, this was the first movie I&#39;ve seen in at least a decade that had me wanting to walk out, go straight to get another ticket, and watch it over again.  Like I remember doing a few times with roller coasters when I was little.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Many classic snips of Whedonesque dialog.  If they aren&#39;t coming out now via geeks with recorders in theaters, they&#39;ll be out in soundboards by December when the DVD arrives.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>&quot;Dozens of planets, hundreds of moons&quot;?  Well, I guess a single solar system alleviates the need for any sort of faster-than-light travel loopholes—but damn, that makes our solar system look <em>sparse</em>. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>River as a psychic, having mentally scooped up state secrets from visiting politicians gave a very nice and sensible motivation to everyone after her.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I missed the men with blue gloves.  They were <em>creepy</em>.  The operative seemed like part 2 of the last one they&#39;d left drifting in space, only maybe more finely honed.  He was rather fearsome, but didn&#39;t give me the willies.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The operative&#39;s total psychological conversion to <em>the mission</em> as a &quot;believer&quot; was a great concept, though.  I could imagine some future tech being used to tickle the &quot;God spot&quot; or something in a Pavlovian/Skinnerian approach to bind a person to an objective.  </p>\n<p>I <em>am</em> surprised that the truth managed to snap him out of it, though.  Religious zealots seem very rarely turned by the facts.  It was a good admission at the end though, having failed the mission, when he said &quot;there&#39;s nothing left to see&quot;.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>When the Shepherd died, I wasn&#39;t <em>too</em> choked up.  I mean, he was a good character, had a crapload of mysteries worth exploring, but he was ultimately an outsider and a passenger on the ship—maybe <em>because</em> of all those mysteries.  </p>\n<p>And, of course, in the movie as independent from the series, the Shepherd wasn&#39;t given much story to become a central concern.  But, he got his dying scene and a fairly closure-rich exit.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The landing on Miranda and the subsequent explanation of the Reavers struck me as a bit of classic Star Trek <em>done right</em>—done <em>better*.  And, having demystified the Reavers—from victims of *spaaaaace madness</em> down to better living through government chemistry—did nothing to make them any less scary.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Does anyone out there remember when they used to play 3-D movies on TV?  They&#39;d have a signal at a certain point, when you were meant to don the glasses.  </p>\n<p>When that spike nailed Wash and he died without a few minutes&#39; scene of melodramatic, coughing last words—that was the signal for, &quot;In this next fight?  They&#39;re all fair game.  <em>Start worrying</em>.&quot;  </p>\n<p>He was just <em>gone</em>, like people really go when they&#39;re not characters in a story enjoying the benefits of <em>deus ex machina</em>.  It&#39;s a very rare story where the author&#39;s gutsy enough to do permanent damage to the fictional universe itself in order to raise the stakes.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;m sad and pissed, but this was a hell of a lot better than <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/26/let-there-be-no-serenity-1701b\">wrecking the Enterprise</a>.  Hell, they did wreck the ship, but Serenity already got rebuilt by the end of the movie.  There will be no Wash 1701B.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- tags: serenity entertainment movies scifi whedon -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087613\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087613\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-16T05:59:32\">2005-10-16T05:59:32</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>My wife and I were both deeply disappointed by Serenity... and part of it is was the treatment of Wolver-- I mean, River.
