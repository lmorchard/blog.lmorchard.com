And as these things usually do, it started out from a very cool idea: You can build a web directory as an outline of links, with some nodes \"farmed out\" to outlines hosted elsewhere—all through the magic of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion\">transclusion</a>.  </p>\n<p>For example, say you want to host a directory of resources on web development.  But, you might like to let me maintain the section on web syndication feeds.  Well, I can toss you a URL to my outline of RSS and Atom links, and you can just pull it into a branch of your \"superset\" outline—kind of like an RSS subscription, really.  Whenever I change my outline, yours will automatically get updated with my work.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine this going off into infinity in both directions:  Outlines including outlines including outlines.  Outlines included by outlines included by outlines.  It's a world-wide outline.</p>\n<p>So, anyway, <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/29/opml-an-awesome-experiment/\">TechCrunch's brainstorm</a> lead to <a href=\"http://archive.scripting.com/2005/09/29#When:7:36:29AM\">Dave Winer's kudos</a> and <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/29.html#a11295\">Scoble's OPML evangelism and an implementation challenge</a>.

And, though I do agree with her, the problem is that the usual suspects involved in these sorts of kerfluffles fall on two sides:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We want to see good, well-specified agreements before we code something useful.</li>\n<li>We want working, useful code that we'll agree is good when we see it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While group <a href=\"/tag/1\">#1</a> is willing to talk/shout things out and reach consensus ahead of time, group <a href=\"/tag/2\">#2</a> wants to forge ahead with machines in motion and reach consensus through popular implementation.  So, members of group <a href=\"/tag/2\">#2</a> will <em>never</em> take group <a href=\"/tag/1\">#1</a> seriously until they've \"put up\", because that's <em>their</em> process.</p>\n<p>Personally, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/12/13/oooced\">I sympathize with the dirty ways of group </a><a href=\"/tag/2\">#2</a>.  But, I've become convinced that what group <a href=\"/tag/1\">#1</a> does is best over the long term, as some of the early successes of group <a href=\"/tag/2\">#2</a> may become tottering unbalanced stacks of plates later on.</p>\n<p>So...

Instead, things like wikis and <a href=\"http://www.jotlive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JotSpotLive</a> and <a href=\"http://www.backpackit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backpack</a> and <a href=\"http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SubEthaEdit</a> have been capturing the users.</p>\n<p>And now, this latest push doesn't look so much like shared outlining <em>per se</em>, but more like a new attempt at <a href=\"http://dmoz.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DMOZ</a>.  And since Google's pretty much <a href=\"http://www.webworkshop.net/dmoz-2005.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">driven a stake into DMOZ</a>, my further interest in Gopher NG is really just a sometimes-interesting problem.  </p>\n<p>I could see some people joining Dave's World Outline effort to get some buzz in their interest niches—trying to be first to get their constituent URLs placed in the new, distributed OPML DMOZ-killer.  And it might be nifty for awhile, but I doubt it'll take hold.</p>\n<p>But as for real world examples of shared outlining, in the particular form Dave's pushing right now... Look at just about anyone's blogroll.  They're almost all in XOXO form <em>right now</em>.  That's the thing:  XOXO is just an HTML list.  It's so unexciting as to be unremarkable—<em>but they're everywhere, right now</em>.  Hell, even OPML has to get converted to XOXO to be used with web browsers—unless you're falling back to some ugly form of tables-as-list.</p>\n<p>XOXO is actually the simplest thing that can possibly work, <em>and people are using and have been using it all along</em>.  I think that's the right thing to bet on, versus OPML.  It doesn't need any evangelism or adoption efforts, other than maybe to remind people of that what they're already using is itself a viable format.  <strong>That's the only reason XOXO has a name.</strong></p>\n<p>I've <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo-outliner-experiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">already shown an in-browser XOXO editor prototype</a>—and believe me, that was easier to implement reliably than anything I've tried with OPML.  I could turn that into a full flown app given sustained free time and interest.  I plan to do that eventually, with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/Micronian\" rel=\"nofollow\">a project I've got simmering</a>.  </p>\n<p>Will I do it?  Who knows—I'm a busy nerd, and I certainly don't have the constant ebulience, time, and money that Dave Winer has.  All I can do is call <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenanigan\" rel=\"nofollow\">shenanigans</a> and preach to the choir.</p></div>\n\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n",

As I see it, \"worse is better\" is the golden rule of computer history, in the long as well as short term.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084232\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084232\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-10T11:34:30\">2005-10-10T11:34:30</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Phil:  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/03/27/oooofc\" rel=\"nofollow\">I've watched Dave's push for shared outlining</a> for awhile now, and certainly he's been working towards it for much longer than I've been watching.  </p>\n\n<p>And, though it's gotten some mileage through Dave's sheer exuberance and people infected by his cool ideas, it's never quite caught on.  Instead, things like wikis and <a href=\"http://www.jotlive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JotSpotLive</a> and <a href=\"http://www.backpackit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backpack</a> and <a href=\"http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SubEthaEdit</a> have been capturing the users.</p>\n\n<p>And now, this latest push doesn't look so much like shared outlining <em>per se</em>, but more like a new attempt at <a href=\"http://dmoz.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DMOZ</a>.  And since Google's pretty much <a href=\"http://www.webworkshop.net/dmoz-2005.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">driven a stake into DMOZ</a>, my further interest in Gopher NG is really just a sometimes-interesting problem.  </p>\n\n<p>I could see some people joining Dave's World Outline effort to get some buzz in their interest niches—trying to be first to get their constituent URLs placed in the new, distributed OPML DMOZ-killer.  And it might be nifty for awhile, but I doubt it'll take hold.</p>\n\n<p>But as for real world examples of shared outlining, in the particular form Dave's pushing right now... Look at just about anyone's blogroll.  They're almost all in XOXO form <em>right now</em>.  That's the thing:  XOXO is just an HTML list.  It's so unexciting as to be unremarkable—<em>but they're everywhere, right now</em>.  Hell, even OPML has to get converted to XOXO to be used with web browsers—unless you're falling back to some ugly form of tables-as-list.</p>\n\n<p>XOXO is actually the simplest thing that can possibly work, <em>and people are using and have been using it all along</em>.  I think that's the right thing to bet on, versus OPML.  It doesn't need any evangelism or adoption efforts, other than maybe to remind people of that what they're already using is itself a viable format.  <strong>That's the only reason XOXO has a name.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo-outliner-experiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">already shown an in-browser XOXO editor prototype</a>—and believe me, that was easier to implement reliably than anything I've tried with OPML.  I could turn that into a full flown app given sustained free time and interest.  I plan to do that eventually, with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/Micronian\" rel=\"nofollow\">a project I've got simmering</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Will I do it?  Who knows—I'm a busy nerd, and I certainly don't have the constant ebulience, time, and money that Dave Winer has.  All I can do is call <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenanigan\" rel=\"nofollow\">shenanigans</a> and preach to the choir.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",
