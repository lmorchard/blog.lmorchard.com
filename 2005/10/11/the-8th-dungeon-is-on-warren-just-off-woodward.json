I&#39;m cagey about it, but I&#39;d really like to link to it once it&#39;s live.  It&#39;s an integration of Flash and DHTML that seems to be working out well so far.</p>\n<p>The thing that I&#39;m wondering now, though, is this:  I wonder how hard it would be to code up some form of MMORPG or Legend of Zelda derivative using Google Maps as the overworld?</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082736\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.tapetenageln.de/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7d175cf371bae2e3ac193ef180310143&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.tapetenageln.de/\">g.</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082736\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-11T22:19:56\">2005-10-11T22:19:56</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Imagine part of your Quest was going to Jefferson Parish to find some giant swamp rats and suddenly there&#39;s only water....\nMakes an interesting game mechanic for sure and some nice headaches ;-)</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
