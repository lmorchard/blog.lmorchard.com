          <p>The <a href="http://www.project-daemon.net/">Ancestor</a> podcast, like its predecessor <a href="http://www.scottsigler.net/earthcore/">EarthCore</a>, is a fairly formulaic sci-fi slasher tale.  But, it sure as hell beats anything on the <a href="http://scifi.com/onair/movies/">SciFi Channel&#39;s Saturday</a> nights.  And, as I&#39;ve started to get sucked into <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Surface/">NBC&#39;s Surface</a>, I keep finding myself comparing it to <a href="http://www.scottsigler.net/">Scott Sigler</a>&#39;s work.  So far, he&#39;s better by a hair in my opinion—but that might as well be better by a mile, since NBC&#39;s the one with all the money and presumed talent at their disposal.</p>

<div class="content"><p>Fairly formulaic sci-fi slasher? Is that what you think of Ancestor? Well, you're dead-nuts right. I love the formula, and I love SciFi Channel's Saturday Nights (sure, some of those films are stinkers, but I don't have the money sitting around to pay someone to create a monstrous version of 'Snakehead Terror' so I'll take what I can get).</p>
<p>Thanks for the compliments! I'm glad you liked the story. I consider my work "Popcorn Fiction," named for the summer blockbuster popcorn movies that pack the theaters every weekend while some higher-brow work plays on a dozen isolated screens across the country. </p>
<p>But, trust me, Ancestor is not completely formulaic. The primary focus of Ancestor is to let you see the monster grow from a single cell to man-eating proportions. That's a really tough thing to do as a writer -- and through this experiment, I've learned why almost every monster story begins with a hapless victim being eaten, but the reader can't quite see what did the eating. You have to bait the hook to get the reader intersted, and without a full-grown monster that's a challenge. Hopefully, I pulled it off, and you're hooked.</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>Well, hey, look!  It's the author himself!  :)</p>
<p>Yeah, though I guess calling your stuff "formulaic" sounds like a slight, it's not necessarily bad if the formula's a good one done right.  (I mean, there's a reason there's a formula in the first place.)  "Popcorn fiction" sounds about just about right.  </p>
<p>I'm certainly liking your stuff better than SciFi's typical "giant snake versus giant snake III", "pterodactyls in the jungle", "chupacabra on a boat", or "vampires on a spaceship" crap.  Now that's a formula that feels a lot more like someone filling out a Mad Libs sheet for a plot.</p>
<p>The other thing I appreciate is that your scenarios are not totally dumbed down, and actually have some thought &amp; research behind the more technical parts.  It all comes off to me as a much more solid story and even with the creative license taken, it still tickles my nerd brain.</p>
<p>Thanks for dropping, man!  Oh, and I have to say that I dug the mentions of Detroit in EarthCore—since I used to work in the Renaissance Center and was working a block or two away in Comerica Tower when I was in the thick of listening to EarthCore.  Hello from Michigan!  :)</p></div>
