  "html": "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.project-daemon.net/\">Ancestor</a> podcast, like its predecessor <a href=\"http://www.scottsigler.net/earthcore/\">EarthCore</a>, is a fairly formulaic sci-fi slasher tale.  But, it sure as hell beats anything on the <a href=\"http://scifi.com/onair/movies/\">SciFi Channel&#39;s Saturday</a> nights.  And, as I&#39;ve started to get sucked into <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Surface/\">NBC&#39;s Surface</a>, I keep finding myself comparing it to <a href=\"http://www.scottsigler.net/\">Scott Sigler</a>&#39;s work.  So far, he&#39;s better by a hair in my opinion—but that might as well be better by a mile, since NBC&#39;s the one with all the money and presumed talent at their disposal.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087669\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scottsigler.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=40267a2ef2b56c42fbb808662a6b3332&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scottsigler.net\">Scott Sigler</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087669\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-07T06:00:39\">2005-10-07T06:00:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Fairly formulaic sci-fi slasher?

That's a really tough thing to do as a writer -- and through this experiment, I've learned why almost every monster story begins with a hapless victim being eaten, but the reader can't quite see what did the eating. You have to bait the hook to get the reader intersted, and without a full-grown monster that's a challenge.
