But, it sure as hell beats anything on the <a href=\"http://scifi.com/onair/movies/\">SciFi Channel&#39;s Saturday</a> nights.  And, as I&#39;ve started to get sucked into <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Surface/\">NBC&#39;s Surface</a>, I keep finding myself comparing it to <a href=\"http://www.scottsigler.net/\">Scott Sigler</a>&#39;s work.  So far, he&#39;s better by a hair in my opinion—but that might as well be better by a mile, since NBC&#39;s the one with all the money and presumed talent at their disposal.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087669\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.scottsigler.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=40267a2ef2b56c42fbb808662a6b3332&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.scottsigler.net\">Scott Sigler</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087669\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-07T06:00:39\">2005-10-07T06:00:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Fairly formulaic sci-fi slasher? Is that what you think of Ancestor? Well, you&#39;re dead-nuts right. I love the formula, and I love SciFi Channel&#39;s Saturday Nights (sure, some of those films are stinkers, but I don&#39;t have the money sitting around to pay someone to create a monstrous version of &#39;Snakehead Terror&#39; so I&#39;ll take what I can get).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the compliments! I&#39;m glad you liked the story. I consider my work &quot;Popcorn Fiction,&quot; named for the summer blockbuster popcorn movies that pack the theaters every weekend while some higher-brow work plays on a dozen isolated screens across the country. </p>\n\n<p>But, trust me, Ancestor is not completely formulaic. The primary focus of Ancestor is to let you see the monster grow from a single cell to man-eating proportions. That&#39;s a really tough thing to do as a writer -- and through this experiment, I&#39;ve learned why almost every monster story begins with a hapless victim being eaten, but the reader can&#39;t quite see what did the eating. You have to bait the hook to get the reader intersted, and without a full-grown monster that&#39;s a challenge. Hopefully, I pulled it off, and you&#39;re hooked.</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221087670&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221087670&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-10-07T11:10:06&quot;&gt;2005-10-07T11:10:06&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, hey, look!  It&#39;s the author himself!  :)&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Yeah, though I guess calling your stuff &quot;formulaic&quot; sounds like a slight, it&#39;s not necessarily bad if the formula&#39;s a good one done right.  (I mean, there&#39;s a reason there&#39;s a formula in the first place.)  &quot;Popcorn fiction&quot; sounds about just about right.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m certainly liking your stuff better than SciFi&#39;s typical &quot;giant snake versus giant snake III&quot;, &quot;pterodactyls in the jungle&quot;, &quot;chupacabra on a boat&quot;, or &quot;vampires on a spaceship&quot; crap.  Now that&#39;s a formula that feels a lot more like someone filling out a Mad Libs sheet for a plot.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing I appreciate is that your scenarios are not totally dumbed down, and actually have some thought &amp; research behind the more technical parts.  It all comes off to me as a much more solid story and even with the creative license taken, it still tickles my nerd brain.</p>\n\n<p><p>Thanks for dropping, man!  Oh, and I have to say that I dug the mentions of Detroit in EarthCore—since I used to work in the Renaissance Center and was working a block or two away in Comerica Tower when I was in the thick of listening to EarthCore.  Hello from Michigan!  :)</p></div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
