This is one thing I'd worried about with [my book][book], but on the other hand [I always wanted to write for The Transactor][trans].  And what I wanted to write was a book <i>I</i> would've wanted to buy, if I hadn't written it.

By the sounds of it, [DOM Scripting][dom] has turned out brilliantly.  I'm looking forward to checking it out!  It's described as a book targeted at designers versus coders—but a lot of times, it's easier to show-don't-tell with code than with prose. 

<blockquote cite="http://domscripting.com/blog/display.php/21">Apart from those minor quibbles, I’m pleased as punch. I still can’t quite believe that I wrote an honest-to-goodness book. Some form of celebration is called for.</blockquote>

This is exactly how I felt, too.  Congratulations, Jeremy!  I'm going to have to pick up [a copy of this book][dom] for myself!
