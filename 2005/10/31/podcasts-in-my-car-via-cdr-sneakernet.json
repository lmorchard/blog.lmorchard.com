Hopefully, the little thing will be returned good-as-new from AppleCare-land within the next few days.  But until then, I&#39;m left with what I can do using the Blaupunkt MP3 CD player in my 2004 Ford Focus.</p>\n<p>The closest I&#39;ve come to anything usable is burning MP3 CD&#39;s from iTunes playlists, in combination with <a href=\"http://www.dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/scripts11.php?page=1#playlisttopapercdcase\">some applescript</a> to make <a href=\"http://www.papercdcase.com/about.php\">paper CD cases</a> that list all the podcasts on the disc.  </p>\n<p>Not <em>too</em> shabby, other than the fact that this approach would eventually leave me with a large pile of paper-encased CDR&#39;s to either archive or toss.  But, even considering archival, it&#39;s a bit wasteful since I never really have 650MB worth of new podcasts accumulated at convenient times—and even if I did, that&#39;d be quite a lot to listen to.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve tried burning multi-session CDs so as to use up all the space before moving onto the next blank.  However, that just results in the MP3 CD player recognizing only the first session.  I really would like to reuse a handful of CDRW&#39;s for a temporary sneakernet.  But alas, it seems my Blaupunkt MP3 CD unit won&#39;t read from CDRW&#39;s—at least, not the ones I have on hand.</p>\n<p>But, I do have to say that these MP3 CD&#39;s sound a hell of a lot better than my old Griffin iTrip FM transmitter sounded.  :)</p>\n<!-- tags: audio podcasts ford focus auto car radio -->\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086868\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.tapetenageln.de/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7d175cf371bae2e3ac193ef180310143&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.tapetenageln.de/\">g.</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086868\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-01T11:19:19\">2005-11-01T11:19:19</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I have a friend who had success in improving the quality of the itrip transmission by <a href=\"http://www.i-hacked.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=200&amp;Itemid=94\" rel=\"nofollow\">enhancing the antenna</a>.\njust a tip ;-)</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
