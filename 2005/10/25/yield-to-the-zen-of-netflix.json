But, when we get a DVD that maybe only I want to see, or maybe neither of us ends up in a mood to see, we end up keeping it for a few days—sometimes for a whole week.  We&#39;ve yet to &quot;declare defeat&quot; on many choices and just send them back unwatched.  </p>\n<p>This is weird, when I think about it: It actually costs more money to hang onto the DVD—in a rentals-per-month sense—versus sending it right back and possibly requesting it again in the future when we&#39;re in a mood to see it.  Of course, lots of back and forth with unwatched videos costs postage, but that&#39;s not our problem.</p>\n<p>This seems like a sort of Zen of Netflix thing I should wrap my head around.  And, if Netflix <em>really</em> wanted to save some money and exploit this bug of mine, they should recommend things that I kinda-but-don&#39;t-really want to see—so that I hang onto them longer and don&#39;t squeeze so much value out of my flat monthly rate.</p>\n<!-- tags: netflix dvd video zen -->\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082369\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.netwhatever.com/randomdev/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9024274111f82ec3f12591475bc2a2d5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.netwhatever.com/randomdev/\">Wilson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082369\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-26T03:40:43\">2005-10-26T03:40:43</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>That would be easy.
