Seems like network TV goes through sci-fi cycles, and this must be the latest.  This particular show looks like it might shape up to be combination sci-fi slasher and forensic drama.  But, still, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/05/ancestor-rocks-like-a-creepy-rocking-thing\">I find myself comparing it to a podcast</a>.</p>\n<p>Also, what&#39;s up with &quot;triple-helix DNA&quot;?  Is this a concept that&#39;s popped up somewhere—other than <a href=\"http://osulibrary.orst.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/narrative/page19.html\">being an early guess at our own DNA&#39;s structure</a>—like, on UFO conspiracy boards and whatnot?  Or is it just double-helix-plus-one so as to be extra spooky alien?  (<a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/content/node/33930\">Kinda like a 5-bladed razor</a>?)  </p>\n<p>Double helix DNA, I <em>think</em> I understand:  It&#39;s very convenient in copying.  Unzip it, dunk it in a soup of free-floating spare parts, agitate, and you end up with two self-assembled copies.  But how the hell would a triple-helix work?</p>\n<p>On the upside, I do really like the <a href=\"http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/blit.htm\">Blit-like concept</a> involved in the &quot;bioforming sound signal&quot; which mentally and genetically alters those who hear it.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I think about this crap too much sometimes.  Whenever I get around to writing the stories I keep meaning to write, I want to avoid these things.</p>\n<!-- tags: scifi television entertainment writing -->\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090552\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://sporkmonger.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=56ee28134dd0776825445e3551979b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://sporkmonger.com\">Bob Aman</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090552\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-07T16:55:05\">2005-10-07T16:55:05</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>In a particularly bad episode of &quot;Walker: Texas Ranger&quot;, Chuck Norris had to do battle to the death with a genetically-enhanced thug who had triple-helix DNA.  He was all bullet-proof and big and stuff, so Chuck tossed him out a window into like a pile of welding tanks and then he blew him up!  Or something like that.  I wasn&#39;t paying attention.</p>\n\n<p>Then Walker went back to kicking normal unenhanced thugs in the head like usual.</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221090554&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221090554&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-10-07T17:22:25&quot;&gt;2005-10-07T17:22:25&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;That almost sounds like Walker had Real Ultimate Power, though last I knew, he wasn&#39;t a Ninja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
