Very few people have this luxury, even in the \"civilized,\" \"modern\" world.\nPS.: I was going to ask you to enable at least some rudimentary markup such as italics, blockquotes and the like, since you moderate your comments anyway.

Very few people have this luxury, even in the \"civilized,\" \"modern\" world.\r\n\r\nPS.: I was going to ask you to enable at least some rudimentary markup such as italics, blockquotes and the like, since you moderate your comments anyway.
