There&#39;ve been notions here and there I wish I&#39;d captured and posted--<em>OmniWeb&#39;s been treating me nice; been tapping my foot for Tiger; Greasemonkey seems damn cool; I want to learn Lisp again; gee my site needs a refresh</em>--but, I&#39;m trying to maintain focus here.</p>\n<p>Hoping to get these last few chapters wrapped up quick, then take a run through revisions and reworking bits that seemed to makes sense weeks and months ago but now seem a bit wonky in the light of later developments.</p>\n<p>But, as you can see, the book has a cover now, as well as its <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0764597582.html\">own page on the Wiley site</a>.  That, and it&#39;s been <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764597582/0xdecafbad-20\">available on Amazon</a> for awhile, as well.  Since this is my first time through this whole process, I&#39;m just a tad bedazzled by it, and seeing this thing ready for pre-order (and with a really keen cover!) just cements some reality for me.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m a bit leery of posting too many details--not because anyone&#39;s told me not to, but just because I haven&#39;t asked whether I can.  But, I&#39;m hoping at some point to throw an outline out there to give a bit of a peek at where my hacking energies have been going lately.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve got this sort of pride/anxiety complex going on, alternating between thinking I&#39;ve got a few really nifty tricks in there and thinking that anyone who&#39;s worth their salt will be able to see just how mediocre it all is.  But, I suspect this all ties back to my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/07/beginners_mind_versus_teachers_mind\">Beginner&#39;s Mind</a> complex.  I did get some unexpectedly nice words from one of my editors after a submission this past weekend, so that bolstered me quite a bit.</p>\n<p>In the meantime...  hello world.  Still here, almost there, and see you soon.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088668\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088668\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-04-25T16:18:48\">2005-04-25T16:18:48</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Thanks for the progress report...</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221088669&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8f8ff21a67437febebc70afd19364e95&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tony Flores&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221088669&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2006-02-03T04:33:15&quot;&gt;2006-02-03T04:33:15&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I browsed your book at Borders and it looks very good I will be buying it tomorrow, I hope it does well for you.
