Man, I haven&#39;t felt like that about a job--<em>just doing my time</em>--since I worked as a bagger / cashier for Farmer Jack.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve alternated between states of so thoroughly enjoying what I was doing, and feeling stuck for the long haul until I managed to finish what I was doing.  In either case, whatever hour it happened to be never figured into it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Hot damn--one chapter left to write for the first draft.  Hoping to have that done by Monday or mid-week, then I want to take a tour through the whole beast and ruthlessly slice and dice all the crap code I&#39;ve left here and there and improve things in general.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s strange, but it took me awhile to realize that most everything I&#39;m doing for this book are things I wanted to eventually do for FeedReactor.  That realization hit me like a miniature paradigm shift that made me really want to rework some of the chapters I&#39;d written months ago and attempt to pull things together in a more coherent toolkit / narrative.

I&#39;m really hoping I&#39;ve overcome my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/07/beginners_mind_versus_teachers_mind\">Beginner&#39;s Mind</a> worries in this book by the end, and have produced something worthwhile.  It&#39;s occurred to me, finally, that what I want this thing to be is a possible baseline starting point for anyone wanting to hack feeds.  </p>\n<p>I see so many projects starting from ground zero, reinventing so many wheels.  If they&#39;re lucky, a given tinkerer has least delegated parsing to something like Mark Pilgrim&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.feedparser.org/\">feedparser</a>.  But--and this is a big goal--I&#39;d like this book to have done for other areas of feed consumption and production a bit of what <a href=\"http://www.feedparser.org/\">feedparser</a> has done for the ground floor of feed hacking.  (Albeit lacking about <a href=\"http://www.feedparser.org/tests/\">2000 tests</a>.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  That is, providing a practical and usable swiss-army knife array for use in all your syndication feed experiments.
