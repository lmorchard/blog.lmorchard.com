    <section class="post-content"><ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/podcasts/">Geek News Central</a>, a podcast whose torrent feed I&#39;ve been using to iron out the wrinkles in my book&#39;s BitTorrent integration, just dropped a word about the book toward the end of today&#39;s edition.  That was nifty to hear, for sure!  Thanks for the mention, the link, and the compliment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It&#39;s not the first, but I just got an unsolicited email trying to entice me to promote a new TV-on-DVD release for a show I actually like.  I&#39;ve gotten these for games and movies before, too--and, I can&#39;t have been the only blogger to see something like this.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t come right out and say that I&#39;ll get any freebies, but there&#39;re promises of helping me with reviews or giveaways on my site.  They&#39;ve even included a link to a zipped up media kit and permission to use it.</p>
<p>Anyway, for whatever it&#39;s worth, I have to admit I&#39;m almost tempted to pitch in with a post here.  <em>Almost.</em>  If this pitch had been just a bit closer on target with my enthusiasms, I might have given in.</p>
<p>I wonder how bad that would be?  Call me a sellout, but if it was for something I <em>really</em> liked, accompanied by the right freebie, I might go along with it.  I&#39;d be entirely explicit that I was being bought off--but I might bet that people reading my blog just happen to like some of what I like, too, and not be entirely annoyed.</p>
<p>But, it&#39;d have to be something <em>really</em> good.  Like, good enough that I&#39;d&#39;ve written about it on my own, had I known about it already and felt a whim toward it.  It would be the bribe that made me think and write about it, rather than something else.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Saw <a href="http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2005/04/26">this post by Dave Winer</a>, after I&#39;d written all the above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><blockquote>I don&#39;t care for ads in RSS, because, with the right info, I am willing to subscribe to ads that are RSS. ... No need to intrude on my space and time, if you provide me with information I want, I&#39;ll welcome you in. Advertisers get a clue. Try seduction, don&#39;t break into my life, romance your way in.

<div class="content">I think you hit the nail on the head. I&#39;ll happily blog for money. Please! But there&#39;s just one catch. I&#39;ve got to like your product and be impressed by it. Either that or really hate your product in which case I&#39;ll flame it unmercifully. What I won&#39;t do is write something about a product I have no opinion about purely for financial gain. And the real reason is that I can&#39;t be bothered and don&#39;t have the time.</div>

<div class="content">It&#8217;s not selling out, so long as you believe in it and can put yourself behind it. Getting paid != selling out. To sell out means to lend your voice to whatever will give you money, regardless of what you think about it.</div>
