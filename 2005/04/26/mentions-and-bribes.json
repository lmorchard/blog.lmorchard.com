That was nifty to hear, for sure!  Thanks for the mention, the link, and the compliment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It&#39;s not the first, but I just got an unsolicited email trying to entice me to promote a new TV-on-DVD release for a show I actually like.  I&#39;ve gotten these for games and movies before, too--and, I can&#39;t have been the only blogger to see something like this.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#39;t come right out and say that I&#39;ll get any freebies, but there&#39;re promises of helping me with reviews or giveaways on my site.  They&#39;ve even included a link to a zipped up media kit and permission to use it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, for whatever it&#39;s worth, I have to admit I&#39;m almost tempted to pitch in with a post here.  <em>Almost.</em>  If this pitch had been just a bit closer on target with my enthusiasms, I might have given in.</p>\n<p>I wonder how bad that would be?  Call me a sellout, but if it was for something I <em>really</em> liked, accompanied by the right freebie, I might go along with it.  I&#39;d be entirely explicit that I was being bought off--but I might bet that people reading my blog just happen to like some of what I like, too, and not be entirely annoyed.</p>\n<p>But, it&#39;d have to be something <em>really</em> good.  Like, good enough that I&#39;d&#39;ve written about it on my own, had I known about it already and felt a whim toward it.  It would be the bribe that made me think and write about it, rather than something else.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Saw <a href=\"http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2005/04/26\">this post by Dave Winer</a>, after I&#39;d written all the above.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><blockquote>I don&#39;t care for ads in RSS, because, with the right info, I am willing to subscribe to ads that are RSS. ... No need to intrude on my space and time, if you provide me with information I want, I&#39;ll welcome you in. Advertisers get a clue. Try seduction, don&#39;t break into my life, romance your way in.\n</blockquote></p>\n<div align=\"right\"><small>Source: <cite><a href=\"http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2005/04/26\">I want a little romance!</a></cite></small></div>\n\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091034\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=547a40fc1027d9388ce5ba52c888a2f8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">julian.bond</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221091034\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-04-27T03:39:04\">2005-04-27T03:39:04</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">I think you hit the nail on the head. I&#39;ll happily blog for money. Please! But there&#39;s just one catch. I&#39;ve got to like your product and be impressed by it. Either that or really hate your product in which case I&#39;ll flame it unmercifully. What I won&#39;t do is write something about a product I have no opinion about purely for financial gain. And the real reason is that I can&#39;t be bothered and don&#39;t have the time.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221091036&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://plasmasturm.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://plasmasturm.org/&quot;&gt;Aristotle Pagaltzis&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221091036&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-04-27T11:22:42&quot;&gt;2005-04-27T11:22:42&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not selling out, so long as you believe in it and can put yourself behind it.
