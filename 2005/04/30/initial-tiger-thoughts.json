Everything seems about 1/3 faster, and it&#39;s worth every penny.  I only grouse throughout the rest of this entry because these are the things that keep it mere inches from perfection.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Scrap the damn finder.  <a href=\"http://www.cocoatech.com/\">Hire this guy, refine Path Finder a bit, rename it Finder Pro.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><p>For Exposé and Dashboard, I wish the row of F&#39;Keys at the top of the keyboard were actually at the bottom.  </p>\n<p>It sounds pitiful, but after getting used to slamming fingers down on CMD-Space for Quicksilver (and now Spotlight), reaching <em>all the way up there</em> seems like a waste--especially when I have to get my <em>arm</em> involved to move my hand, versus just some fingers.  And, no, moving a mouse pointer <em>way over</em> into a corner doesn&#39;t help.  Nor does tapping a corner of the trackpad, ala <a href=\"http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/sidetrack/\">SideTrack</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I&#39;d almost rather go back to pinstripes everywhere, rather than put up with the virulent spread of metal UI and now this new seemingly random tweak to things.</p>\n<p>So, yeah, Mail 2.0 in Tiger is <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars/3\">a bit like ass</a> now.  Any chance we can get this reverted?  I like the new split-pane, versus the drawer, but I want my old toolbar and window style back.  </p>\n<p>And I <em>definitely</em> don&#39;t want third-party developers getting the idea that this is the keen new thing and changing <em>their</em> toolbars to this style.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I&#39;m reading about things like <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars/9\">file system metadata in Tiger</a>--<em>BeFS über alles!</em>--and seeing the author express suspicions and point to signs of various decisions divined from hints half-buried in semi-obscure documentation.  </p>\n<p>It makes me wonder what it&#39;d be like reading this as an in-house Apple developer, or as someone behind the wall of an NDA.  That is, having been <em>in</em> the real group huddles and meetings, writing code and committing changes, seeing the actual whiteboards at work.</p>\n<p>I think about when I see someone report on something I&#39;ve been involved in.  Sometimes I&#39;m amazed at the differences--or similarities--between my reality over here and the reality pieced together by the person reporting things.</p>\n<p>Seems kinda like a weird game of charades where I&#39;m not necessarily trying to help you figure out what I&#39;m thinking.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087337\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9b71d738d26738a90411501ac572ceaf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Scott</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087337\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-04T06:41:10\">2005-05-04T06:41:10</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Tiger link at the top is borked.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
