Today, there&#39;s lots of support for it, and it&#39;s even found its way into browsers.  But, well, it still doesn&#39;t solve the problem of people clicking on those darn candy-like <img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/images/xml.gif\" /> buttons.</p>\n<p>So, then some folks came up with <a href=\"http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/06/feeddemon_and_t.html\">a new feed:// protocol for feed URLs</a>.  It seems there&#39;s just too much <a href=\"http://pirate.typepad.com/blog/2003/09/problems_with_m.html\">gone wrong with MIME types</a> and the like.  When I first heard of feed://, I thought it was a weird and ugly hack, but I never piped up because I was too busy at the time, didn&#39;t know much of the details, and was too busy to be bothered to catch up.  Besides, other people were <a href=\"http://alpha-geek.com/2004/09/20/inelegant\">grousing about it</a> already.  And, later, I saw that a slew of aggregators were supporting it, so I figured it must not have been that bad, although I still thought it was odd to kludge around a new URL &quot;protocol&quot; just to pass a feed URL to an aggregator.</p>\n<p>But, in the comment above, Phil makes a suggestion that seems ideal to me.  Don&#39;t link to feeds directly, don&#39;t use a funky protocol, link to a &quot;playlist&quot; of feeds.  URLs linking to MP3 playlists (ie. the <a href=\"http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=65772\">informally specified</a> M3U and PLS files) seem to get tossed and handled just fine by your preferred media player.  I don&#39;t even know how the MIME-type situation is handled with M3U or PLS links, but it seems to work just fine nonetheless.</p>\n<p>And, wasn&#39;t there this <a href=\"http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/rsd\">Really Simple Discovery</a> thing published a long time ago?  Point a weblog management tool at your site, it looks for <code>rsd.xml</code>, and it gets all the funky URLs it needs for web services from there?</p>\n<p>What if we circled back around with <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery\">autodiscovery</a> and published a file like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;feeds xmlns=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2005/01/feeds&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; title=&quot;Full RSS&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/index.rdf&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot; title=&quot;Full Atom&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/atom.xml&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; title=&quot;Blog-only RSS&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/index.rdf&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot; title=&quot;Blog-only Atom&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/atom.xml&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; title=&quot;Links-only RSS&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/links/index.rdf&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot; title=&quot;Links-only Atom&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/links/atom.xml&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/feeds&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Name it something like <code>feeds.fss</code>, link your candy-like buttons to it, and register applications to handle that extension.  Give it a MIME-type, and handle that too.  Sounds just like M3U and PLS files, to me.  Someone tell me why this is a dumb idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>:  Just to clarify, <a href=\"http://jaeger.blogmatrix.com/weblog/archives/2005_01.shtml#003186\">before anyone thinks</a> I&#39;m just railing against Dave Winer personally--I made a comment below about not liking OPML.  Well, I don&#39;t, at least not for this particular purpose.  But, my preferences aside, it&#39;s undeniable that most aggregators support OPML import/export in one form or another, so the above example could probably be expressed as OPML with all the same data.</p>\n<p>Just one thing, though (and this is part of why I don&#39;t like OPML for this):  On my machine, OPML outlines and files with an &quot;.opml&quot; extension open with OmniOutliner.  OPML means &quot;outline&quot; to me, not just &quot;list of feed URLs&quot;.  I don&#39;t want URLs ending in &quot;.opml&quot; to open in an aggregator.  Can we at least use a different extension and/or MIME type?</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090354\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://robbertbroersma.nl/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0709ff27506546c0fd3cd2b2202a0c67&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://robbertbroersma.nl/\">Robbert Broersma</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090354\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-13T13:25:02\">2005-01-13T13:25:02</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">But how does one autodiscover these feed playlists? ;-)\nlink rel=\"feed-playlist\"?

Personally, I'd rather avoid OPML and re-use what we have for autodiscovery headers.  I wouldn't necessarily want to see this file used *literally* like a playlist or an OPML subscription list.  \nUsually OPML is used for wholesale import/export of your subscriptions, whereas autodiscovery headers tend to be used to provide a choice.  \nNot that OPML couldn't be used this way, too, but I do have to admit I don't like OPML much.

I certainly see a trivial \"pop up those titles in a list, when the user selects one, throw it at the configured reader\" app, if that format is nailed down I might toss one together...\nThe key is to have a well-known-extension *and* a mime type, so that both lame tools and Proper ones can do the right thing. (The extension can't be OPML of course, because it is the *verb*, but I don't care what syntax is used as long as it has a human readable label...)  Oh, and that extension should replace XML on the candy buttons - because the word XML has \"always\" been wrong, in that it made about much sense as saying \"ASCII\" or \"UTF-8\" there - but it *did* make the value of candy-like buttons really really clear, and it deserves credit for that...\nFSS will do, I don't see it in my local (aggressively updated debian) mime.types at least -- there's some artistic value in having it be \".feed\" instead though...</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090364\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090364\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-13T18:43:02\">2005-01-13T18:43:02</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Jim: A browser plugin - who'd install that? :)\nDid you have to install a browser plugin the last time you clicked on the URL to a streaming station to make it startup in WinAmp or iTunes?

It would be a bit like having a greeting card printing program register itself as the handler for all JPEGs.\nFunny thing about this idea, though: after I mentioned Atom being able to do mime-type handling, with a link rel=\"start\" included in the feed, I looked at the current version of the format spec, and it seems to not do that, but instead has a link to a separate introspection file, which is basically an Atom playlist.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090366\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=769084f2da2ebbc1e483af3f0e72adaa&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jim</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090366\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-13T22:59:38\">2005-01-13T22:59:38</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">> A browser plugin - who’d install that?\nThe aggregator installer.\nThe only trouble I can imagine with the plugin idea is if different aggregators all wanted to install their own plugin.

Since there is no path, the server typically returns a home page as some prespecified page or by redirection.\nTo find the feed playlist, the browser could do a default GET on the URL with an accept MIME type of \"application/atom+xml\" (which is already registered). The browser does not need to know the name of the file or its extension - it just needs to know the server and the MIME type.\nThe file returned by a default GET with an accept type of application/atom+xml would be the \"feed list\" for the site.

Point a weblog management tool at your site, it looks for `rsd.xml`, and it gets all the funky URLs it needs for web services from there?\r\n\r\nWhat if we circled back around with [autodiscovery][autodiscovery] and published a file like this:\r\n\r\n    <feeds xmlns=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/01/feeds\">\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" title=\"Full RSS\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/index.rdf\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/atom+xml\" title=\"Full Atom\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/atom.xml\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" title=\"Blog-only RSS\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/index.rdf\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/atom+xml\" title=\"Blog-only Atom\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/atom.xml\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" title=\"Links-only RSS\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/links/index.rdf\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/atom+xml\" title=\"Links-only Atom\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/links/atom.xml\" />\r\n    </feeds>\r\n    \r\nName it something like `feeds.fss`, link your candy-like buttons to it, and register applications to handle that extension.  Give it a MIME-type, and handle that too.  Sounds just like M3U and PLS files, to me.  Someone tell me why this is a dumb idea.\r\n\r\n**Update**:  Just to clarify, [before anyone thinks][anyone] I'm just railing against Dave Winer personally--I made a comment below about not liking OPML.  Well, I don't, at least not for this particular purpose.  But, my preferences aside, it's undeniable that most aggregators support OPML import/export in one form or another, so the above example could probably be expressed as OPML with all the same data.\r\n\r\nJust one thing, though (and this is part of why I don't like OPML for this):  On my machine, OPML outlines and files with an \".opml\" extension open with OmniOutliner.  OPML means \"outline\" to me, not just \"list of feed URLs\".  I don't want URLs ending in \".opml\" to open in an aggregator.  Can we at least use a different extension and/or MIME type?\r\n\r\n[anyone]: http://jaeger.blogmatrix.com/weblog/archives/2005_01.shtml#003186\r\n[rsd]: http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/rsd\r\n[winamp]: http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=65772\r\n[mimewrong]: http://pirate.typepad.com/blog/2003/09/problems_with_m.html\r\n[grouse]: http://alpha-geek.com/2004/09/20/inelegant\r\n[autodiscovery]: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery\r\n[feed]: http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/06/feeddemon_and_t.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090354\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://robbertbroersma.nl/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0709ff27506546c0fd3cd2b2202a0c67&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://robbertbroersma.nl/\">Robbert Broersma</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090354\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-13T13:25:02\">2005-01-13T13:25:02</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">But how does one autodiscover these feed playlists? ;-)\r\n\r\nlink rel=\"feed-playlist\"?

Personally, I'd rather avoid OPML and re-use what we have for autodiscovery headers.  I wouldn't necessarily want to see this file used *literally* like a playlist or an OPML subscription list.  \r\n\r\nUsually OPML is used for wholesale import/export of your subscriptions, whereas autodiscovery headers tend to be used to provide a choice.  \r\n\r\nNot that OPML couldn't be used this way, too, but I do have to admit I don't like OPML much.

I certainly see a trivial \"pop up those titles in a list, when the user selects one, throw it at the configured reader\" app, if that format is nailed down I might toss one together...\r\n\r\nThe key is to have a well-known-extension *and* a mime type, so that both lame tools and Proper ones can do the right thing.

Oh, and that extension should replace XML on the candy buttons - because the word XML has \"always\" been wrong, in that it made about much sense as saying \"ASCII\" or \"UTF-8\" there - but it *did* make the value of candy-like buttons really really clear, and it deserves credit for that...\r\n\r\nFSS will do, I don't see it in my local (aggressively updated debian) mime.types at least -- there's some artistic value in having it be \".feed\" instead though...</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090364\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090364\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-13T18:43:02\">2005-01-13T18:43:02</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Jim: A browser plugin - who'd install that? :)\r\n\r\nDid you have to install a browser plugin the last time you clicked on the URL to a streaming station to make it startup in WinAmp or iTunes?

The browser does not need to know the name of the file or its extension - it just needs to know the server and the MIME type.\r\n\r\nThe file returned by a default GET with an accept type of application/atom+xml would be the \"feed list\" for the site. These are really the \"atom endpoints\" and is nothing more than an Atom feed with links pointing to the feeds and services on the site.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090370\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb7f2a3ba74af37415ab7df101a86c75&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090370\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-17T11:51:40\">2005-01-17T11:51:40</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Well, the thing about a \"playlist\" versus autodiscovery is this: \r\n\r\nWith autodiscovery, you give your aggregator the human-readable entry point ot a page and the aggregator uses various methods to find the feed.\r\n\r\nWith a \"playlist\" or feed:// or MIME types, you've already done the discovery work for the aggregator.  You're looking at the page, mouse hovering over a link to the feed, and you want to click on it, hoping it'll do the right thing.\r\n\r\nSo, really, you wouldn't ever need to autodiscover a \"playlist\".

Or rather, each person&#39;s light cone in the blogosphere, made up of the feeds and blogs you track and what you publish, is a <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TupleSpace\">Tuple Space</a>--and the blogosphere itself is the union of every personal <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TupleSpace\">Tuple Space</a> in existence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-a-tuple-space\">What&#39;s a Tuple Space?</h2>\n<p>In case you&#39;re not at all familiar with <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TupleSpace\">Tuple Spaces</a>, this is how I understand them:  </p>\n<p>There&#39;s a magic bag full of marbles.  The marbles have all sorts of different properties, like color, roundness, size, and material.  You can put in marbles of any sort, and so can everyone else.  When you want to take marbles out, you tell the bag what you want.  </p>\n<p>For instance, &quot;Bag, I want blue marbles made of glass,&quot; and you&#39;ll get a pile of marbles that are blue and made of glass, but come in all sizes and degrees of roundness.  Someone else asks for 1cm-wide egg-shaped marbles made of high-bounce rubber, they get egg-shaped bouncing marbles in all kinds of colors.</p>\n<p>Now, real <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TupleSpace\">Tuple Spaces</a> are even more abstract than this.  Python has tuples; they look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>(&quot;foo&quot;, 1, 2, &quot;baz&quot;, 23.2)\n(4, 5, 6)\n(&quot;foo&quot;, 7, 2, &quot;xyzzy&quot;, 89)\n(&quot;foo&quot;, 9, 2, &quot;xyzzy&quot;, 100.3)\n(ExampleObject(&quot;wheee&quot;), 123, None)\n(23,)</code></pre>\n<p>Imagine the magic bag is a heap of these tuples.  You ask for tuples by <em>pattern</em>, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>(&quot;foo&quot;, ?int, 2, ?str, ?float)</code></pre>\n<p>And the bag would give you the tuples which match the pattern:</p>\n<pre><code>(&quot;foo&quot;, 1, 2, &quot;baz&quot;, 23.2)\n(&quot;foo&quot;, 9, 2, &quot;xyzzy&quot;, 100.3)</code></pre>\n<p>The thing that makes this even more abstract than a bag of marbles is that these tuples are just ordered collections of data items.  They&#39;re not labeled as properties like &quot;color&quot;, &quot;size&quot;, &quot;shape&quot;, or &quot;material&quot;.  Where the data items within tuples pick up meaning is through agreement amongst users of the tuple space.  </p>\n<p>Tuple spaces get really interesting, though, because different collectives of users of the tuple space can each agree upon different sets of meanings for tuples--and the agreements exist outside of tuple space, so the space doesn&#39;t need reconfiguration for any particular new use.  Meanwhile, the infrastructure supporting the sharing of the tuple space remains simple, and the interface remains the same.  Because they don&#39;t know any better, tuple spaces can allow for all kinds of sharing and coordination that no one necessarily has to plan for ahead of time.</p>\n<p>For example, want to send instant messages?  Fill space with tuples like this:</p>\n<pre><code>(&quot;TIM-Msg&quot;, &quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;Frank&quot;, &quot;2004-01-12T15:49:00&quot;, &quot;Hi there, Joe.&quot;)\n(&quot;TIM-Msg&quot;, &quot;Frank&quot;, &quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;2004-01-12T15:52:00&quot;, &quot;Hey Frank, how&#39;s it going?&quot;)\n(&quot;TIM-Msg&quot;, &quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;Frank&quot;, &quot;2004-01-12T16:01:00&quot;, &quot;Good, good.&quot;)\n(&quot;TIM-Msg&quot;, &quot;Frank&quot;, &quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;2004-01-12T16:12:00&quot;, &quot;Glad to hear it!&quot;)</code></pre>\n<p>You can probably figure out what meanings the &quot;TupleIM&quot; client would assign to tuple elements.  If you were Joe, your client might leave a running query in space for tuples like <code>(&quot;TIM-Msg&quot;, &quot;Joe&quot;, ?, ?, ?)</code>, where as Frank would subscribe to a query like <code>(&quot;TIM-Msg&quot;, &quot;Frank&quot;, ?, ?, ?)</code> .  </p>\n<h2 id=\"what-do-tuples-have-to-do-with-blogs\">What Do Tuples Have to Do with Blogs?</h2>\n<p>Well, we&#39;re not really there yet, but the parallels between blogs, the web, REST APIs, and tuple spaces are many.  The web sounds an awful lot like a potential tuple space to me, although it needs a lot of work to become one.  Resources accessible by URL are kind of like tuples, though Google doesn&#39;t make quite as universal a tuple-finder as we&#39;d like.  Syndication feeds, however, and the metadata they carry causes the data items to be better exposed to a potential tuple-finder.</p>\n<p>But, think about the <a href=\"http://www.lazyweb.org/\">Lazyweb</a>.  Want something made?  Post a description of it on your blog and trackback to the <a href=\"http://www.lazyweb.org/\">Lazyweb</a>.  (Put a marble in the bag, insert a tuple into space.)  Bored and want to make something?  Subscribe to the <a href=\"http://www.lazyweb.org/\">Lazyweb</a> feed and watch for interesting projects to roll by.  (Ask the bag for fun marbles, search for special tuples.)  The person who posted the project might have never met the person who eventually implements the project, but the blogosphere enabled the interaction.  The people involved took on at least half of the duty in finding tuples, but there seem to be tuple-space-esque things going on here.</p>\n<p>Ever post something to your blog with no specific set of people in mind?  Maybe just a vague notion of what <em>sort</em> of people might want to read it or respond to you?  Ever get surprised by who responds to your postings?  </p>\n<p>That feels like a tuple space to me.  </p>\n<p>These tuple spaces seem pretty nifty.  I wonder how we can make the web more like a tuple space?</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085211\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://talideon.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=16a1717a880cce3bfefce65049d7120d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://talideon.com/\">Keith Gaughan</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085211\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-12T19:40:05\">2005-01-12T19:40:05</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I remember somebody remarking online, somebody well known, that blogs look like Lifestreams.

The word \"Joe\" should be replaced by a link to the node for the whole person, Joe. (If you wanted to know that person's name, it the node for the person Joe would have an attribute \"first name\" that linked to \"Joe.\") The destination, in turn, links to the node for Frank. The *time* links to a temporal node, which may be a virtual node on a continuum. Finally, the message is an attribute that links to the particular string.\nThis is a MUCH more powerful model, because you can look at the graph, and say, \"Show me everything that happened from time t1 to time t2,\" and it will mesh with the entire system.\nIn fact, you can say, \"Let me know whenever a message is posted between time t3-t4 where the target is Frank.\"</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085217\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://creativekarma.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b581950de350ed6ad83f09ec48a6be3f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://creativekarma.com/\">Doug</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085217\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-14T01:09:55\">2005-01-14T01:09:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Since I don't understand either concept in detail, I'll ignorantly ask, \"Is this somehow different from the Semantic Web?\" They sound the same to me.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085219\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jamesbritt.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ff9e18f0699bf079f1fc91c8d4506438&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jamesbritt.com\">James Britt</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085219\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-18T10:29:22\">2005-01-18T10:29:22</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\"Since I don't understand either concept in detail, I'll ignorantly ask, 'Is this somehow different from the Semantic Web?' They sound the same to me\"\nGood question.  The description of tuples as a vector of attributes looks just like del.icio.us.  Bookmarks (i.e., resources) are the marbles.  You can ask for resources by some tag vector:\n[ 'Ruby', 'XML', 'Rinda' ]\nand see what comes back.\nOne interesting difference is that the tags do not (currently, that I know of) have types.  The Python example shows the use of type selectors (e.g., include as a criteria any Integer).  Tags on del.icio.us (and probably all folksonomy sites) are unclassified.  You cannot, for example, ask for all resource with tags related to database programming; something has to know that this request set includes more than just those resources explicitly tagged 'database-programming'.  You would likely also want resource tagged 'mysql-programming', and so on.  (And this is the harder part: the metadata itself needs metadata to define such higher-level groupings. To get a richer navigation scheme, it would be good if tags/topics were assigned to facets. )\nBut even without such sophistication the use of tagged resources is very much like tuple spaces.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085220\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://thefourthplace.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b96fe040c899286ba7ec28e05aab6e5f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://thefourthplace.net/\">Simon Gibbs</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085220\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-20T07:57:40\">2005-01-20T07:57:40</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">You are talking about the Semantic Web, RDF in particular, though you can indirectly derive tuples from X/HTML too. blockquote, used with cite, is a great example, and link, meta etc as well.\n\"this is the harder part: the metadata itself needs metadata to define such higher-level groupings\"\nThis is what OWL does.

You ask for tuples by *pattern*, like this:\r\n\r\n    (\"foo\", ?int, 2, ?str, ?float)\r\n    \r\nAnd the bag would give you the tuples which match the pattern:\r\n\r\n    (\"foo\", 1, 2, \"baz\", 23.2)\r\n    (\"foo\", 9, 2, \"xyzzy\", 100.3)\r\n\r\nThe thing that makes this even more abstract than a bag of marbles is that these tuples are just ordered collections of data items.  They're not labeled as properties like \"color\", \"size\", \"shape\", or \"material\".  Where the data items within tuples pick up meaning is through agreement amongst users of the tuple space.  \r\n\r\nTuple spaces get really interesting, though, because different collectives of users of the tuple space can each agree upon different sets of meanings for tuples--and the agreements exist outside of tuple space, so the space doesn't need reconfiguration for any particular new use.  Meanwhile, the infrastructure supporting the sharing of the tuple space remains simple, and the interface remains the same.  Because they don't know any better, tuple spaces can allow for all kinds of sharing and coordination that no one necessarily has to plan for ahead of time.\r\n\r\nFor example, want to send instant messages?  Fill space with tuples like this:\r\n\r\n    (\"TIM-Msg\", \"Joe\", \"Frank\", \"2004-01-12T15:49:00\", \"Hi there, Joe.\")\r\n    (\"TIM-Msg\", \"Frank\", \"Joe\", \"2004-01-12T15:52:00\", \"Hey Frank, how's it going?\")\r\n    (\"TIM-Msg\", \"Joe\", \"Frank\", \"2004-01-12T16:01:00\", \"Good, good.\")\r\n    (\"TIM-Msg\", \"Frank\", \"Joe\", \"2004-01-12T16:12:00\", \"Glad to hear it!\")\r\n    \r\nYou can probably figure out what meanings the \"TupleIM\" client would assign to tuple elements.  If you were Joe, your client might leave a running query in space for tuples like `(\"TIM-Msg\", \"Joe\", ?, ?, ?)`, where as Frank would subscribe to a query like `(\"TIM-Msg\", \"Frank\", ?, ?, ?)` .  \r\n\r\n## What Do Tuples Have to Do with Blogs?\r\n\r\nWell, we're not really there yet, but the parallels between blogs, the web, REST APIs, and tuple spaces are many.  The web sounds an awful lot like a potential tuple space to me, although it needs a lot of work to become one.  Resources accessible by URL are kind of like tuples, though Google doesn't make quite as universal a tuple-finder as we'd like.  Syndication feeds, however, and the metadata they carry causes the data items to be better exposed to a potential tuple-finder.\r\n\r\nBut, think about the [Lazyweb][lazyweb].  Want something made?  Post a description of it on your blog and trackback to the [Lazyweb][lazyweb].  (Put a marble in the bag, insert a tuple into space.)  Bored and want to make something?  Subscribe to the [Lazyweb][lazyweb] feed and watch for interesting projects to roll by.  (Ask the bag for fun marbles, search for special tuples.)  The person who posted the project might have never met the person who eventually implements the project, but the blogosphere enabled the interaction.  The people involved took on at least half of the duty in finding tuples, but there seem to be tuple-space-esque things going on here.\r\n\r\nEver post something to your blog with no specific set of people in mind?  Maybe just a vague notion of what *sort* of people might want to read it or respond to you?  Ever get surprised by who responds to your postings?  \r\n\r\nThat feels like a tuple space to me.  \r\n\r\nThese tuple spaces seem pretty nifty.  I wonder how we can make the web more like a tuple space?\r\n\r\n[lazyweb]: http://www.lazyweb.org/\r\n[tuples]: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TupleSpace\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085211\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://talideon.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=16a1717a880cce3bfefce65049d7120d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://talideon.com/\">Keith Gaughan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085211\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-12T19:40:05\">2005-01-12T19:40:05</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I remember somebody remarking online, somebody well known, that blogs look like Lifestreams.

The word \"Joe\" should be replaced by a link to the node for the whole person, Joe. (If you wanted to know that person's name, it the node for the person Joe would have an attribute \"first name\" that linked to \"Joe.\") The destination, in turn, links to the node for Frank. The *time* links to a temporal node, which may be a virtual node on a continuum. Finally, the message is an attribute that links to the particular string.\r\n\r\nThis is a MUCH more powerful model, because you can look at the graph, and say, \"Show me everything that happened from time t1 to time t2,\" and it will mesh with the entire system.\r\n\r\nIn fact, you can say, \"Let me know whenever a message is posted between time t3-t4 where the target is Frank.\"</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085217\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://creativekarma.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b581950de350ed6ad83f09ec48a6be3f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://creativekarma.com/\">Doug</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085217\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-14T01:09:55\">2005-01-14T01:09:55</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Since I don't understand either concept in detail, I'll ignorantly ask, \"Is this somehow different from the Semantic Web?\" They sound the same to me.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085219\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.jamesbritt.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ff9e18f0699bf079f1fc91c8d4506438&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.jamesbritt.com\">James Britt</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085219\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-18T10:29:22\">2005-01-18T10:29:22</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">\"Since I don't understand either concept in detail, I'll ignorantly ask, 'Is this somehow different from the Semantic Web?' They sound the same to me\"\r\n\r\nGood question.  The description of tuples as a vector of attributes looks just like del.icio.us.  Bookmarks (i.e., resources) are the marbles.  You can ask for resources by some tag vector:\r\n[ 'Ruby', 'XML', 'Rinda' ]\r\nand see what comes back.\r\n\r\nOne interesting difference is that the tags do not (currently, that I know of) have types.  The Python example shows the use of type selectors (e.g., include as a criteria any Integer).  Tags on del.icio.us (and probably all folksonomy sites) are unclassified.  You cannot, for example, ask for all resource with tags related to database programming; something has to know that this request set includes more than just those resources explicitly tagged 'database-programming'.  You would likely also want resource tagged 'mysql-programming', and so on.  (And this is the harder part: the metadata itself needs metadata to define such higher-level groupings. To get a richer navigation scheme, it would be good if tags/topics were assigned to facets. )\r\n\r\nBut even without such sophistication the use of tagged resources is very much like tuple spaces.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085220\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://thefourthplace.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b96fe040c899286ba7ec28e05aab6e5f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://thefourthplace.net/\">Simon Gibbs</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085220\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-20T07:57:40\">2005-01-20T07:57:40</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">You are talking about the Semantic Web, RDF in particular, though you can indirectly derive tuples from X/HTML too. blockquote, used with cite, is a great example, and link, meta etc as well.\r\n\r\n\"this is the harder part: the metadata itself needs metadata to define such higher-level groupings\"\r\n\r\nThis is what OWL does.

This thing launched this past Wednesday, apparently.</p>\n<p>First off, a small thing that impresses me: in <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/money/tech/mwendland8e_20050108.htm\">Mike Wendland&#39;s Detroit Free Press column on freep.com</a>, the link to <a href=\"http://fastlane.gmblogs.com\">http://fastlane.gmblogs.com</a> is an <em>actual hyperlink</em>.  On a newspaper&#39;s site.  Now, I&#39;m sure this is happening more and more, but I wish I had a nickle for every story I&#39;ve read over the years on a newspaper&#39;s website that referred to resources elsewhere on the web yet failed to ever include any hyperlinks-- and if they did, it was an unlinked URL pasted into the story.  </p>\n<p>So, <a href=\"http://fastlane.gmblogs.com\">http://fastlane.gmblogs.com</a>, for however much a PR front it might be, is by all appearances a <em>real blog</em>.  In fact, it looks like it&#39;s running on Movable Type or TypePad, from the TypePad favicon and the TypeKey login on <a href=\"http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2005/01/great_comments_1.html#comments\">the comments form</a>.  There are even <a href=\"http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/index.rdf\">RSS</a> and <a href=\"http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/atom.xml\">Atom</a> feeds available.</p>\n<p>Er, wait-- did I just see an <a href=\"http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2005/01/great_comments_1.html#comments\">open comments form</a>?  And <em>Trackbacks</em>?  On a potentially high profile corporate site?  </p>\n<p>Now, I&#39;ve been working in the Detroit area for almost eight years now, mostly doing promotions and advertising for the auto companies.  That&#39;s not a long time in auto industry years, but it&#39;s like an eon in Internet Time-- and I remember the first few times I was on a project where we tried opening up some sort of discussion forum or a guestbook or any channel of any sort where the public could cause content of their own to appear on an automotive-company-related website.  </p>\n<p>People screamed, yelled, and wet themselves.  Lawyers flew in and circled over head.  Project Managers and Programmers were drafted into being around-the-clock intensive hands-on moderators, intercepting and/or deleting anything that wasn&#39;t absolutely and completely safe to appear on the site.  Open text areas were whittled down to text fields, then reduced to a choice from canned messages by radio button.  Someone might swear, be rude, post nasty jokes-- or more even more obscene, someone might say that the other guy made better cars.</p>\n<p>And now, I&#39;m looking at an automotive-company site that displays a <a href=\"http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/about.html\">Blogger Code of Ethics</a> on its About page.  </p>\n<p>Who are these people?  </p>\n<p>And how many inches of snow have fallen in Hell so far?</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089734\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.influxinsights.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fe128502efdc78e2de50c5e787630fcb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.influxinsights.com\">Edward Cotton</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089734\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-09T09:54:24\">2005-01-09T09:54:24</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Agree.

This kind of thing blows me away, and I&#8217;m starting to understand why some people are so excited about blogging.</blockquote>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><small>Source: <cite><a href=\"http://wasabi.dynu.com:8080/blog/index.php?p=43\">alexh's weblog &#187; On Design Interiors</a></cite></small></div>\r\n\r\nBoy, do I feel behind.  This thing launched this past Wednesday, apparently.\r\n\r\nFirst off, a small thing that impresses me: in [Mike Wendland's Detroit Free Press column on freep.com][column], the link to <a href=\"http://fastlane.gmblogs.com\">http://fastlane.gmblogs.com</a> is an *actual hyperlink*.  On a newspaper's site.  Now, I'm sure this is happening more and more, but I wish I had a nickle for every story I've read over the years on a newspaper's website that referred to resources elsewhere on the web yet failed to ever include any hyperlinks-- and if they did, it was an unlinked URL pasted into the story.  \r\n\r\nSo, <a href=\"http://fastlane.gmblogs.com\">http://fastlane.gmblogs.com</a>, for however much a PR front it might be, is by all appearances a *real blog*.  In fact, it looks like it's running on Movable Type or TypePad, from the TypePad favicon and the TypeKey login on [the comments form][comments].  There are even [RSS][rss] and [Atom][atom] feeds available.\r\n\r\n[rss]: http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/index.rdf\r\n[atom]: http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/atom.xml\r\n[comments]: http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2005/01/great_comments_1.html#comments\r\n\r\nEr, wait-- did I just see an [open comments form][comments]?  And *Trackbacks*?  On a potentially high profile corporate site?  \r\n\r\nNow, I've been working in the Detroit area for almost eight years now, mostly doing promotions and advertising for the auto companies.  That's not a long time in auto industry years, but it's like an eon in Internet Time-- and I remember the first few times I was on a project where we tried opening up some sort of discussion forum or a guestbook or any channel of any sort where the public could cause content of their own to appear on an automotive-company-related website.  \r\n\r\nPeople screamed, yelled, and wet themselves.  Lawyers flew in and circled over head.  Project Managers and Programmers were drafted into being around-the-clock intensive hands-on moderators, intercepting and/or deleting anything that wasn't absolutely and completely safe to appear on the site.  Open text areas were whittled down to text fields, then reduced to a choice from canned messages by radio button.  Someone might swear, be rude, post nasty jokes-- or more even more obscene, someone might say that the other guy made better cars.\r\n\r\nAnd now, I'm looking at an automotive-company site that displays a [Blogger Code of Ethics][ethics] on its About page.  \r\n\r\nWho are these people?  \r\n\r\nAnd how many inches of snow have fallen in Hell so far?\r\n\r\n[ethics]: http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/about.html\r\n[column]: http://www.freep.com/money/tech/mwendland8e_20050108.htm\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089734\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.influxinsights.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fe128502efdc78e2de50c5e787630fcb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.influxinsights.com\">Edward Cotton</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089734\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-09T09:54:24\">2005-01-09T09:54:24</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Agree. It's an amazing step forward from a cultural perspective. Just looking at the comments on the Lutz's piece, it seems to have tapped into a deep well of consumer interest. \r\n\r\nIt could become a great tool for GM, if they have the discipline to do it right and not get scared or overwhelmed. \r\n\r\nSo far, it seems like they are doing it right.\r\n\r\nThe PR agency behind this probably deserves some of the credit for making the blog happen.\r\n\r\nEd</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089739\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://msittig.wubi.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a233a0b9bf67e939e7575b36e626744d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://msittig.wubi.org/\">Micah</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089739\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-09T14:06:04\">2005-01-09T14:06:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">You can thank the MPAA and their fight against DeCSS for your lack of nickels.  The disappearance of hyperlinks from online newspapers is due to a court case[1] in which the judge ruled that hyperlinks to copyrighted material were illegal.  Although this was a ruling against the 2600 website, other online newspapers have interpreted this to mean that they too could be held accountable for links to questionable sites.  But note that \"the judgment did not specifically prohibit 2600 from providing non-hyperlinked URLs of web sites that provide DeCSS\", which is why you'll find non-hyperlinked URLs at the end of, for example, some New York Times articles.\r\n\r\n[1] http://gsulaw.gsu.edu/lawand/papers/fa00/weiland/</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089741\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.DetroitWonk.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fffd82dd155e2315ef424947df052e21&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.DetroitWonk.com\">Ray</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089741\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-12T04:58:49\">2006-01-12T04:58:49</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Umm...Lutz has been blogging on FastLane for like...I dunno...half a year now?

One of the roles I&#39;ve always wanted to grow into is that of an expert and a teacher, and part of that has been wanting to write more tutorial-style pieces for this place.  Having just gotten <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/07/belated_happy_new_year\">the opportunity to write a book</a> certainly makes me feel like I&#39;m making big progress toward this.  However, due to habits of thought I&#39;ve developed in adopting this &quot;beginner&#39;s mind&quot;, I&#39;ve been having trouble figuring out what&#39;s worth writing about and about what I&#39;m worthy of writing.</p>\n<p>In learning, I&#39;ve tried to keep an open and unassuming mind about things.  And even after I have learned quite a bit about something, and I can demonstrate obvious expertise with something to anyone who&#39;s watching, I still consider myself a beginner.

It&#39;s not so much a rational issue--it&#39;s more an issue of emotion and habits of thought.  Rationally, I think it&#39;s safe to say that as I learn about something, I climb up a ladder of experts&#39; shoulders.  And below me, still down the ladder, are other beginners doing the climb.  But where I run into trouble is in trying to figure out where I am on the ladder, and where and how I should make myself available as a rung.  Because, there are so many others at and above my level already providing their shoulders, and the climb still has so much farther yet to go above me.  </p>\n<p>Now this metaphor has its problems, since it&#39;s neither charitable nor useful to me to think of others as above or below me in any competitive or evaluative sense.

After you have finished that set it down for a week or so and then pick it up and read it with a fresh mind. You will catch alot of assumentions you left out, fill them in. Once again set it down for a week, then read it word for word with a beginner’s mind and see if it makes sense. What ends up happening is that the book shows a process of learning and shows that while you may be ahead of the person your teaching , you still have quite a bit mnore to learn. And by teaching them you are bring them up to your level so both of you can learn the next level together.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083459\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=da828f7f73d835410ab83894eee2db42&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">William Pietri</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083459\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-24T17:01:51\">2005-01-24T17:01:51</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">You seem to think being a beginner and being a teacher are opposed. But good teachers are always learning more about their subject. I don't think beginner's mind requires you to deny what you know or to unfairly slight yourself in comparison with others. What it requires is to be humble in the face of how much more you have yet to learn.\nPerhaps the way to apply beginner's mind here is in constantly making fresh appraisals of yourself and others, in always being open to opportunities to teach as well as to learn.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

After you have finished that set it down for a week or so and then pick it up and read it with a fresh mind. You will catch alot of assumentions you left out, fill them in. Once again set it down for a week, then read it word for word with a beginner’s mind and see if it makes sense. What ends up happening is that the book shows a process of learning and shows that while you may be ahead of the person your teaching , you still have quite a bit mnore to learn. And by teaching them you are bring them up to your level so both of you can learn the next level together.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083459\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=da828f7f73d835410ab83894eee2db42&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">William Pietri</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083459\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-24T17:01:51\">2005-01-24T17:01:51</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">You seem to think being a beginner and being a teacher are opposed. But good teachers are always learning more about their subject. I don't think beginner's mind requires you to deny what you know or to unfairly slight yourself in comparison with others. What it requires is to be humble in the face of how much more you have yet to learn.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the way to apply beginner's mind here is in constantly making fresh appraisals of yourself and others, in always being open to opportunities to teach as well as to learn.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",
