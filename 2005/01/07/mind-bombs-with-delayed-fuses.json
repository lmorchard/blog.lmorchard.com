Also, I&#39;ve been meaning to update the XmlRpcFilteringPipe in a more REST-ian bent, using both POSTed data pushed through the filter and GET queries supplied with URLs in query parameters to pull data through the filter.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090043\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.emacswiki.org/alex/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=73d2617de46d85c306dbdf533b72fded&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.emacswiki.org/alex/\">Alex Schroeder</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090043\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-08T05:46:48\">2005-01-08T05:46:48</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">The other day I wrote a ChangeLog-to-RSS thing in Perl for my project which is hosted on savannah.gnu.org (sf.net already has it).  I added a link pattern that allows you to include links to the original source files, too (since Savannah uses viewcvs, the files are available online).  Wanted to add a comment to your very old ChangeLog-to-RSS article, but it was no longer possible.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
