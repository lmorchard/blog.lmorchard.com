And it also surprises me when someone else gets some of the same [enthusiasm I had][bomb] for one of my ideas.

This looks like it might be interesting.  Also, I've been meaning to update the XmlRpcFilteringPipe in a more REST-ian bent, using both POSTed data pushed through the filter and GET queries supplied with URLs in query parameters to pull data through the filter.

            <div class="content">The other day I wrote a ChangeLog-to-RSS thing in Perl for my project which is hosted on savannah.gnu.org (sf.net already has it).  I added a link pattern that allows you to include links to the original source files, too (since Savannah uses viewcvs, the files are available online).  Wanted to add a comment to your very old ChangeLog-to-RSS article, but it was no longer possible.</div>
