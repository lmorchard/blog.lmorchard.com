This thing launched this past Wednesday, apparently.</p>\n<p>First off, a small thing that impresses me: in <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/money/tech/mwendland8e_20050108.htm\">Mike Wendland&#39;s Detroit Free Press column on freep.com</a>, the link to <a href=\"http://fastlane.gmblogs.com\">http://fastlane.gmblogs.com</a> is an <em>actual hyperlink</em>.  On a newspaper&#39;s site.  Now, I&#39;m sure this is happening more and more, but I wish I had a nickle for every story I&#39;ve read over the years on a newspaper&#39;s website that referred to resources elsewhere on the web yet failed to ever include any hyperlinks-- and if they did, it was an unlinked URL pasted into the story.  </p>\n<p>So, <a href=\"http://fastlane.gmblogs.com\">http://fastlane.gmblogs.com</a>, for however much a PR front it might be, is by all appearances a <em>real blog</em>.  In fact, it looks like it&#39;s running on Movable Type or TypePad, from the TypePad favicon and the TypeKey login on <a href=\"http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2005/01/great_comments_1.html#comments\">the comments form</a>.

And <em>Trackbacks</em>?  On a potentially high profile corporate site?  </p>\n<p>Now, I&#39;ve been working in the Detroit area for almost eight years now, mostly doing promotions and advertising for the auto companies.  That&#39;s not a long time in auto industry years, but it&#39;s like an eon in Internet Time-- and I remember the first few times I was on a project where we tried opening up some sort of discussion forum or a guestbook or any channel of any sort where the public could cause content of their own to appear on an automotive-company-related website.  </p>\n<p>People screamed, yelled, and wet themselves.  Lawyers flew in and circled over head.  Project Managers and Programmers were drafted into being around-the-clock intensive hands-on moderators, intercepting and/or deleting anything that wasn&#39;t absolutely and completely safe to appear on the site.  Open text areas were whittled down to text fields, then reduced to a choice from canned messages by radio button.  Someone might swear, be rude, post nasty jokes-- or more even more obscene, someone might say that the other guy made better cars.</p>\n<p>And now, I&#39;m looking at an automotive-company site that displays a <a href=\"http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/about.html\">Blogger Code of Ethics</a> on its About page.  </p>\n<p>Who are these people?  </p>\n<p>And how many inches of snow have fallen in Hell so far?</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089734\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.influxinsights.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fe128502efdc78e2de50c5e787630fcb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.influxinsights.com\">Edward Cotton</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221089734\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-09T09:54:24\">2005-01-09T09:54:24</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Agree.
