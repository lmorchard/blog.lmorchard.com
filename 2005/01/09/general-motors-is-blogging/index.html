        <blockquote>The automaker that once epitomized the Type A business world of suits and white shirts has decided to join the trend toward keeping Internet blogs, the online personal diaries that have become a huge hit with Web users. This week, GM quietly introduced Fastlane (<a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com">http://fastlane.gmblogs.com</a>), a blog written by top management of the world's largest corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This kind of thing just hasn’t happened before. Anyone in the world can voice their opinion, the only barrier they have is net access, which is becoming very close to accessible to anyone. This kind of thing blows me away, and I’m starting to understand why some people are so excited about blogging.</blockquote>

<p>Boy, do I feel behind.  This thing launched this past Wednesday, apparently.</p>
<p>First off, a small thing that impresses me: in <a href="http://www.freep.com/money/tech/mwendland8e_20050108.htm">Mike Wendland's Detroit Free Press column on freep.com</a>, the link to <a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com">http://fastlane.gmblogs.com</a> is an <em>actual hyperlink</em>.  On a newspaper's site.  Now, I'm sure this is happening more and more, but I wish I had a nickle for every story I've read over the years on a newspaper's website that referred to resources elsewhere on the web yet failed to ever include any hyperlinks-- and if they did, it was an unlinked URL pasted into the story.  </p>
<p>So, <a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com">http://fastlane.gmblogs.com</a>, for however much a PR front it might be, is by all appearances a <em>real blog</em>.  In fact, it looks like it's running on Movable Type or TypePad, from the TypePad favicon and the TypeKey login on <a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2005/01/great_comments_1.html#comments">the comments form</a>.  There are even <a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/index.rdf">RSS</a> and <a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/atom.xml">Atom</a> feeds available.</p>
<p>Er, wait-- did I just see an <a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2005/01/great_comments_1.html#comments">open comments form</a>?  And <em>Trackbacks</em>?  On a potentially high profile corporate site?  </p>
<p>Now, I've been working in the Detroit area for almost eight years now, mostly doing promotions and advertising for the auto companies.  That's not a long time in auto industry years, but it's like an eon in Internet Time-- and I remember the first few times I was on a project where we tried opening up some sort of discussion forum or a guestbook or any channel of any sort where the public could cause content of their own to appear on an automotive-company-related website.  </p>
<p>People screamed, yelled, and wet themselves.  Lawyers flew in and circled over head.  Project Managers and Programmers were drafted into being around-the-clock intensive hands-on moderators, intercepting and/or deleting anything that wasn't absolutely and completely safe to appear on the site.  Open text areas were whittled down to text fields, then reduced to a choice from canned messages by radio button.  Someone might swear, be rude, post nasty jokes-- or more even more obscene, someone might say that the other guy made better cars.</p>
<p>And now, I'm looking at an automotive-company site that displays a <a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/about.html">Blogger Code of Ethics</a> on its About page.  </p>
<p>Who are these people?  </p>
<p>And how many inches of snow have fallen in Hell so far?</p>

<div class="content">Agree. It's an amazing step forward from a cultural perspective. Just looking at the comments on the Lutz's piece, it seems to have tapped into a deep well of consumer interest. 
It could become a great tool for GM, if they have the discipline to do it right and not get scared or overwhelmed. 
So far, it seems like they are doing it right.
The PR agency behind this probably deserves some of the credit for making the blog happen.

<div class="content">You can thank the MPAA and their fight against DeCSS for your lack of nickels.  The disappearance of hyperlinks from online newspapers is due to a court case[1] in which the judge ruled that hyperlinks to copyrighted material were illegal.  Although this was a ruling against the 2600 website, other online newspapers have interpreted this to mean that they too could be held accountable for links to questionable sites.  But note that "the judgment did not specifically prohibit 2600 from providing non-hyperlinked URLs of web sites that provide DeCSS", which is why you'll find non-hyperlinked URLs at the end of, for example, some New York Times articles.

<div class="content"><p>Umm...Lutz has been blogging on FastLane for like...I dunno...half a year now?  It took Wendland THIS long to figure this out??  PC Mike...maybe needs to be spending more time in the blogosphere!</p>
<p>Actually,the only reason it hit the mainstream is that autoblog actually covered it because he had a Video Podcast this week to talk about and show off the Camaro...mmm...pretty moving pictures and lights... :)</p></div>
