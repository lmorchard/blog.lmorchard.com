    "summary": "Okay, so lately I've switched to using \"addressbarlets\" for my del.icio.us posting needs.  In particular, I've been using the Super-Fast variety.  I cannot stress how much better these are than clicking links in the bookmark toolbar.  My del.icio.us posting has converged that much closer to command-line / QuickSilver perfection.  \nBut, I just noticed that in my del.icio.us RSS feed, the title \"del.icio.us warning: non-utf8 string! (sorry)\" has been popping up--especially on Hot Links, which includes my links on a regular basis.  \nWell, although I'm not really all that hip to unicode and non-ASCII characters, it appears that things like SmartyPants and the use of chevrons in page titles are throwing the monkey wrench for me when the addressbarlet picks up the document.title.  So, I decided to do a little sloppy butchery in my bookmarklet code to wrestle these titles into something acceptable.\nAfter you've had a chance to try out / comprehend the original versions, take a look at this revised addressbarlet:\n\nPost to del.icio.us and close\n\nIn case, for some reason, that doesn't come through in this entry, here's the code which should appear in the HREF:\n    javascript:u=%22CHANGEME%22;us=[['\\u201C','%22'],['\\u201D','%22'],['\\u2019',%22'%22],['\\u2018',%22'%22],['\\u2026',%22...%22],['\\u00BB','-']];function es(p){for(var i=0;i<us .length;i++){p=p.replace(us[i][0],us[i][1])};p=p.replace(/[\\u0080-\\uFFFF]/g,'');return encodeURIComponent(p);};q=location.href;e=%22%22+(window.getSelection?window.getSelection():document.getSelection?document.getSelection():document.selection.createRange().text);p=document.title;window.location.href=%22http://del.icio.us/%22+u+%22?jump=doclose&tags=%22+es(%22%s%22)+%22&url=%22+es(q)+%22&description=%22+es(p)+%22&extended=%22+es('%22'+e+'%22').replace(/ /g,%22+%22);\nI'm sure I have a few nasty bugs lurking in there, but basically I'm trying to reverse SmartyPants--DummyPants, if you will--and crudely hack out everything that's not the usual ASCII.\nIf you happen to be having this problem, let me know if this code works for you.",

    "summary": "Testing, testing--is this thing on?  Well, I do have to say that I've recovered rather well from the \"stroke\" last week.  Things have been pretty busy since then, so I haven't had much of a chance to blather any more around these parts.\nHowever, in the spirit of a few recent experiments, I have another demo for you.  Here's the URL of the latest work in progress / proof of concept:\n\nhttp://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/map-test/tree2.html\n\nWhat is it, you might ask before clicking a strange URL?  It's an outliner, in Javascript.  Or, rather, a first rough stab at one anyway.  It's got a long way to go, and there are indeed better options out there already, but I wanted to try making one myself.\nA quick summary of controls:  No mouse drag of items yet, but you can click on them to edit.  Use the up and down cursor keys to navigate through the outline.  Use shift along with the cursor keys to shift items around.  Use the control key along with the cursor keys to control visibility of child items.\nUpdate: There're a few more things I didn't mention, as well as a few bug half-fixes.  Hitting return when the editor is on an existing item will insert a new blank item right after it.  Hitting shift-return will append a new child item to the current item.  Tab and shift-tab, as well as shift-right and shift-left, are supposed to indent and outdent items.  Unfortunately, they're not quite working yet and of course they semi-clobber other useful keyboard functions, so I'm still feeling around for a good way to support these.\nThe idea is that I want to unobtrusively drop some CSS and JavaScript into an HTML page with one or more XOXO-style outlines, magically turning them into in-browser outline editors.\nBut, like I said, there's still lots of work to be done here, and I'm pretty sure I've riddled this thing with circular references that will make your IE/Win combination leak like crazy.  I just wanted to see if I could make something like this work, though.  And, roughly, it seems to do so in Safari and Firefox.\nThe next part of this equation will be coming up soon, I think.  And that is: Okay, now that I've created / edited an outline in my browser--how can I save it?",

    "summary": "So, this weekend, I suffered a sort of minor stroke in my exocortex.  The girl and I left for a bit to get food on Saturday afternoon and, when we got back, I found my PowerBook making grinding / growling noises from the general vicinity of its hard drive.  A reboot or two later, and the poor thing stopped bothering to spin up the drive and just sat there in blinking confusion looking for a System folder.\nNow, if you've been following along, you might be thinking, \"Didn't he just go through this not too long ago?\"  If so, you'd be right.  I'm not sure what I do to these things, since I killed an iBook hard drive like this, too.  I'm very hesitant to blame Apple for this since, well, I'm just really not a careful person when it comes to hardware.  I thank my lucky stars, so far, for AppleCare.\nThe problem this time, though, is that the failure happened without warning.  The past two times, I had a bit of a gradual slide into failure with an agonizing period of intermittent function just long enough to evacuate some essentials onto another machine.  But this time, boom.  No warning.  And stupid me:  I deleted the backups I'd made back when I upgraded to Tiger.\nSo, my last decent backup of anything is about a year old, from the last time I had a hard drive crash.  Thus, this feels a bit like a sound blow to the head.  I've lost all my recent changes to my feed aggregator subscription list.  I've lost all my Tinderbox documents.  I'm still groping around for registration keys for all of my software.  The arrangement of tools I've gotten used to being within finger-twitch range is now gone.\nIt's been a long time since I had a serious failure in a machine I depend on where I didn't have a recovery plan.  Ouch.  The two things that are keeping me from going entirely bonkers are:\n\nThe girl never sold her old iBook and I turned it into a replacement for our ailing house Linux server, so I have a backup machine until the PowerBook comes back.\nI didn't lose this weekend's tinkerings because I shared them here.\n\nAlso, it's lucky that I've turned in all the chapters and artwork for the book, because I'd've really been strolling off a cliff if I'd've had to recreate any of that work.  Of course, that stuff got zipped up and uploaded to at least 3 locations on a weekly basis, so I was at least smartly paranoid about that.\nI guess this'll teach me though.  As soon as the PowerBook comes back, and I've reconstructed my external headspace on it, I'll be setting up nightly backups to the basement file server and plan on doing monthly archival to DVD.  I can't imagine how lost I'd be if I were really living in my laptop.  :)",

    "summary": "iTunes podcasting support... I want it all, and I want it now, because it has so much potential in and of itself, and so much potential for driving podcast tuner UI into the future.  \nThe subscriptions are listed alphabetically?  Come on, let me sort them in last-updated order.  And what, no OPML import / export?  \nNot many podcast-related additions to the AppleScript scripting dictionary for iTunes.  I see a subscribe method, but I was hoping I could at least hack in some support for subscription list import / export.  Not having access to the subscription list puts a crimp in that. \nUpdate: Hooray for people who know what they're talking about.  Turns out there are a few more additions to iTunes' AppleScript support I missed, but I'm still not finding my way down to accessing the list of podcast subscriptions.\nUpdate 2: Looks like someone's already worked on the import side of things: OPML2iTunes : AppleScript to import OPML podcast subscriptions into iTunes\n\n\n\nAnd in the Bizzarro-Verse, Microsoft is more community-oriented than Apple when it comes to RSS extension creation.  Pretty odd.  I can see a few spots where the iTunes tags are defensible, but couldn't most or all of these have been established using Dublin Core or other prior work?\n\n\nBummer.  It seems like the new podcasting support in iTunes doesn't use Syndication.framework, or at least the feeds subscribed in iTunes don't show up in the Sources table in the database I was snooping around in.\nAnd here I was hoping for Tiger to have already quietly included a shared syndication feed architecture similar to what's proposed for Longhorn. \nOtherwise, podcasting in iTunes seems interesting so far.  Now, if it used BitTorrent out of the box...\n\n\n\nCan I just say I hate the new binary plists in OS X Tiger?  I got so used to futzing with them using vim and shell-side friends that it's jarring to get a face full of garbage now when I poke at them.\nAnd yeah, I know about /usr/bin/plutil--but, yuck.",

Track changes on those URLs.  Notify me via Atom feed when new comments arrive in places where I posted comments.\nClean up and abstract that magic form thing I did into a more general way to make all kinds of magic textarea forms.  (More microformats?  .sig files for LiveJournal responses?  /usr/bin/banner for annoying blog comments?)\nRevive Third Voice in GreaseMonkey style.  Subscribe to arbitrary REST API'ed annotation servers, fetch & aggregate annotations for current URL via XMLHTTPRequest, build cute floating stickies with rude comments from friends.\nAuto-ROT13 en/decoder ring, because there's a need for that.\nScript which redirects all links to books on Amazon.com to point at my new book.  I will install this on all computers at CompUSA and the Apple Store.\n\nI've suddenly realized that a lot of the things I wanted to do with Agent Frank are possible with GreaseMonkey.  Also, I wonder how long it'll be before I get sucked into further FireFox extension hacking.",

However, while I personally use Movable Type, this is a hack for textareas in FireFox. \nMovable Type just happens to use textareas.  It's worth noting, however, that WordPress uses textareas too.  So does LiveJournal.  So do most comment posting forms.  This is bigger than a single blog package plugin-- that's the point.\nWhew.  So it looks like the book is out of my hands now, having finished the final reviews.  I have some more to say about that, but first I want to post the results of the last day or so of hacking I've done.\nI've been working on the stuff for the book so long that I just had to do something else (ie. not RSS or Atom) to help clear my head.  But, I'm addicted to learning and building stuff.  So, although I did relax a bit since the main effort of the book passed--that is, relax as normal people define it--I just can't stop making things.  \nSo, I had a beer, cracked open Dive Into GreaseMonkey, and decided to make good on that idea I wrote about last month.  Not only that, but I had a little free time over lunch today, so I downloaded a trial of Snapz Pro X 2 to try my hand at a little screencasting, ala Jon Udell.\nI've got more things to say about all this, and my new found excitement for GreaseMonkey, but first I'll share the goods.\nIf you want to risk running my horribly premature code on your machine, here's the script:\n\nmagic_hcalendar.user.js\n\nIf you'd like a preview of what it does, here's a movie:\n\nmagic_hcalendar.mov\n\nAnd, just for the sake of completeness, here's a quick screen grab:",

    "summary": "Implementors should be aware that the software represents the user in  their interactions over the Internet, and should be careful to allow  the user to be aware of any actions they might take which may have an  unexpected significance to themselves or others.\n\nIn particular, the convention has been established that the GET and  HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action  other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered \"safe\".  This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT  and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the  fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.\nNaturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not  generate side-effects as a result of performing a GET request; in  fact, some dynamic resources consider that a feature. The important  distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects,  so therefore cannot be held accountable for them.\n\nSource: HTTP/1.1: Method Definitions\n\nSo, like... uh...  Did Google build their accelerator that way just to provide a dramatic example of why explanations of REST focus repeatedly (to the annoyance of some) on the fact that the HTTP GET method is specified as and should be implemented as idempotent?\nSeriously.  Did they?  Well, at any rate, I guess they didn't read this PDF:\n\nAssertion: Prefetching With GET is Not Good.\n\nBut, eh, I hadn't read that PDF until a few minutes ago anyway.  Though, it is kind of funny that I found it as the first hit on Google for the terms \"rest get idempotent prefetch problem\".  (Which, snarkily, is really the only reason I mention it.)\nYes, one could argue that only \"badly designed\" web applications that don't follow the rules of GET and POST will be affected, but I'm not sure this is an argument that Google (or anyone else who actually builds or uses web apps in the wild) would care to make in this situation.\n\nSource: O'Reilly Radar: Google Web Accelerator considered overzealous\n\nEr, oh yeah...  I guess I can't be too smug about GET and idempotency, now that I look at a few of the web apps with which I've been involved.  Yeah, that smarts.  \nAlthough, I do have to say that most of the nonidempotent-(read: broken)-GET-driven things I've put together tend to be behind href=\"javascript: do_foo()\" function call links which, while hated by some, would have protected you from this--at least until Google's prefetch learned JavaScript.\nBah, I say.  Maybe it's time to start actually, really paying attention to this?",

Other than the lack of a long coat, big hair, and scarf, this guy is him.  (Though, I don't think I'll be shaving my head to continue my fashion tutelage.)\n  It's like things picked up right where they left off--cheesy plot, goofy incidental music, sonic screwdriver, and all.  Most important of all: I'm so glad that it didn't get a revival by way of an American studio, although I do wish it'd gotten picked up by the SciFi Channel.\n  Just as soon as there's a DVD for sale, I'll be ordering it.

Or, maybe I need to buy it, once my head bobs above water.\n\n\nWhy is pasting plain old unformatted text in Microsoft Word considered a \"special\" paste action?\n\nAnd, if Word helpfully extends my selection range one more time, I'll shoot it.  I thought I turned that damn feature off.\n\nHave I mentioned that I hate Microsoft Word?  I'm up to about 175 pages across 8 chapters written, and I find myself gazing wistfully at TextEdit.\n\nAfter wrestling for months with libxml2 for FeedReactor, and all the issues I had getting the Python bindings compiled and working on Mac OS X, just so I could play around with XPath and some decently fast XML handling...  I discover that 4Suite installs like budda on Linux, Windows, and OS X, and seems pretty fast.  I've only used it for XPath so far, but I'm curious to try out what it does for XSLT.\n\n\n\nYour moment of webcomic zen:",
