Notably when people use pseudocode in books, it usually looks <em>very</em> much like Python.

Frankly, I think you're being a little too sensitive on this issue. You had a choice to make (between perl, python, ruby, and php) and you made it. You chose a mainstream language that is easily readable by anyone conversant in any other mainstream language. I'm sure you could make better use of your time than writing translations to another language - a task that an adept in any of the other languages could do.</p>\n<p>As a practical matter, most of us select a 'vector' of languages for our daily work. In my case the vector consists of c, ruby, perl, and vb. Over the years the specific languages in my vector have changed, but the vector length has remained constant. (and c has always been a member). For other people the vector length might be slightly longer or shorter, but hardly anyone's vector will include every language that an author might choose for his sample code.</p>\n<p>My advice : keep on using the language that is the best fit for you. Focus on the ideas, and develop interesting applications.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084250\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://boston.conman.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bbb1c69b64019a3df907c3545186f907&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://boston.conman.org/\">Sean Conner</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084250\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-02T08:09:42\">2006-01-02T08:09:42</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Be daring!

More thinking to do, but I thought I'd get these thoughts out there at least.\r\n\r\n[nb]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/14/hacking-delicious-is-a-real-book\r\n[perl]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/10/16/seeing-out-opposites\r\n[mp]: http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/\r\n[ufp]: http://feedparser.org\r\n[bo]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1\r\n[php]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/18/not-so-deep-php-thoughts\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084242\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084242\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-31T19:22:56\">2005-12-31T19:22:56</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Some authors provide translations of the code in a book online; you could translate all of your book into PHP, for instance.  I think Python is still a good language for the book, because it is typographically pleasing (significant whitespace), doesn't use too much punctuation, and uses normal constructs, like func(args).  Notably when people use pseudocode in books, it usually looks <em>very</em> much like Python.

Frankly, I think you're being a little too sensitive on this issue. You had a choice to make (between perl, python, ruby, and php) and you made it. You chose a mainstream language that is easily readable by anyone conversant in any other mainstream language. I'm sure you could make better use of your time than writing translations to another language - a task that an adept in any of the other languages could do.</p>\n\n<p>As a practical matter, most of us select a 'vector' of languages for our daily work. In my case the vector consists of c, ruby, perl, and vb. Over the years the specific languages in my vector have changed, but the vector length has remained constant. (and c has always been a member). For other people the vector length might be slightly longer or shorter, but hardly anyone's vector will include every language that an author might choose for his sample code.</p>\n\n<p>My advice : keep on using the language that is the best fit for you. Focus on the ideas, and develop interesting applications.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084250\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://boston.conman.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bbb1c69b64019a3df907c3545186f907&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://boston.conman.org/\">Sean Conner</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084250\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-02T08:09:42\">2006-01-02T08:09:42</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Be daring!

    "html": "<p>Part of the reason this whole <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/10/27/extend.html\">must ignore</a> thing with respect to feeds has me <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/13/feedmagick-the-feed-filter-that-doesnt-know-much-about-feeds\">a bit fired up</a> is because it seems like so few feed processing tools out there embrace this idea.  And because of that, these tools are unfortunately brittle and prone to future shock.</p>\n<p>For example, take <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb\"><code>Syndication.framework</code> on OS X</a>:  Amongst the monkeys and ninjas and pirates and robots, you&#39;ve got your standard <em>title-date-link-description</em> columns with a few other bits for good measure.  But, where&#39;s the data from <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/static/iTunesRSS.html\">iTunes RSS extensions</a>?  Nowhere, gone, lost.  If it was in the feed when <code>Syndication.framework</code> found it, it wasn&#39;t understood and so it wasn&#39;t retained after the parser finished chewing up and spitting the data into that DB table.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/building-a-proper-shared-syndication-feed-foundation\">I&#39;ve written about shared feed processing foundations before</a>, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve totally gotten the idea to gel in my head until now.  Here&#39;s the thing:  If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.  Rather than intrusively breaking apart and recasting feed data into a predetermined data structure, you&#39;ve got to remain hands-off as much as possible.</p>\n<p>This is what I did in <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a>.  This code can subscribe to feeds, poll feed data periodically, and even work out which items in a feed are new—but it punts on everything else by only caring about where a feed starts and ends, and where its individual entries start and end.  <em>The rest is left in its original XML form.</em>  So, if there was data in there for iTunes?  It&#39;s still there, because <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a> didn&#39;t know enough to do anything to it.</p>\n<p>This is the major difference in feed processing model.  <code>Syndication.framework</code> loses information when it encounters things it doesn&#39;t understand.  <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a> retains the information, because it leaves things alone when it doesn&#39;t know any better.</p>\n<p>Now, this is not to pick on just <code>Syndication.framework</code>.  Despite the general-sounding name,  this framework is pretty much just around to power <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/\">Safari RSS</a> and not <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/\">iTunes</a> or anything else.  And as I said, pretty much every other feed processing framework and tool works in this manner.  Just about everybody uses a destructive process when they parse and marshal feed data into local-idiom structures.  </p>\n<p>And this destructive process is fine when all you want to do is satisfy a specific purpose—display a few headlines, for example.  But if you&#39;re trying to build general-case feed plumbing, this is unacceptable and untenable.  If most everything in a feed item gets lost as it goes through a pipeline, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/05/the-right-place-for-data-in-your-feed\">we might as well abandon feed extensions entirely in favor of microformats stuffed into the <code>description</code> tag</a>—an idea to which I&#39;m not <em>entirely</em> opposed.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, consider this:  This past summer, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/four-thoughts-on-ms-rss-so-far\">Microsoft released an architectural overview about an OS-wide RSS framework in the upcoming Vista</a>.  Unfortunately, like many RSS and Vista related things from this past summer, all links have evaporated into a redirect to a single developers portal.  I can&#39;t figure out why they didn&#39;t just <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/rss/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/rsssupportinlonghorn.asp\">redirect over to here</a>, which took me a search and a few clicks to rediscover.</p>\n<p>At any rate, there&#39;s one sentence in this overview that gives me hope for RSS as a general service in Windows Vista:  </p>\n<p>&quot;<em>It is also possible to access the item XML for applications that want to perform operations on the XML instead of using the item&#39;s properties.</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>So, dig that.  If it works the way I hope it does, RSS in Vista will take care of the subscriptions for you, poll the feed data, grab new stuff—but then it leaves the data intact for you to process whatever new and unanticipated feed payloads that may arrive.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s how it <em>should</em> work.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084486\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=622a34307765c2f7c1dfdc7345842418&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\">Darren Chamberlain</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-13T15:03:07\">2005-12-13T15:03:07</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n<p>If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.

    "body": "Part of the reason this whole [must ignore][mi] thing with respect to feeds has me [a bit fired up][fir] is because it seems like so few feed processing tools out there embrace this idea.  And because of that, these tools are unfortunately brittle and prone to future shock.\r\n\r\nFor example, take [`Syndication.framework` on OS X][sx]:  Amongst the monkeys and ninjas and pirates and robots, you've got your standard *title-date-link-description* columns with a few other bits for good measure.  But, where's the data from [iTunes RSS extensions][ir]?  Nowhere, gone, lost.  If it was in the feed when `Syndication.framework` found it, it wasn't understood and so it wasn't retained after the parser finished chewing up and spitting the data into that DB table.\r\n\r\n[I've written about shared feed processing foundations before][sf], but I don't think I've totally gotten the idea to gel in my head until now.  Here's the thing:  If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.  Rather than intrusively breaking apart and recasting feed data into a predetermined data structure, you've got to remain hands-off as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThis is what I did in [FeedSpool][fs].  This code can subscribe to feeds, poll feed data periodically, and even work out which items in a feed are new—but it punts on everything else by only caring about where a feed starts and ends, and where its individual entries start and end.  *The rest is left in its original XML form.*  So, if there was data in there for iTunes?  It's still there, because [FeedSpool][fs] didn't know enough to do anything to it.\r\n\r\nThis is the major difference in feed processing model.  `Syndication.framework` loses information when it encounters things it doesn't understand.  [FeedSpool][fs] retains the information, because it leaves things alone when it doesn't know any better.\r\n\r\nNow, this is not to pick on just `Syndication.framework`.  Despite the general-sounding name,  this framework is pretty much just around to power [Safari RSS][sr] and not [iTunes][itp] or anything else.  And as I said, pretty much every other feed processing framework and tool works in this manner.  Just about everybody uses a destructive process when they parse and marshal feed data into local-idiom structures.  \r\n\r\nAnd this destructive process is fine when all you want to do is satisfy a specific purpose—display a few headlines, for example.  But if you're trying to build general-case feed plumbing, this is unacceptable and untenable.  If most everything in a feed item gets lost as it goes through a pipeline, [we might as well abandon feed extensions entirely in favor of microformats stuffed into the `description` tag][fmf]—an idea to which I'm not *entirely* opposed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, consider this:  This past summer, [Microsoft released an architectural overview about an OS-wide RSS framework in the upcoming Vista][ao].  Unfortunately, like many RSS and Vista related things from this past summer, all links have evaporated into a redirect to a single developers portal.  I can't figure out why they didn't just [redirect over to here][he], which took me a search and a few clicks to rediscover.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, there's one sentence in this overview that gives me hope for RSS as a general service in Windows Vista:  \r\n\r\n\"*It is also possible to access the item XML for applications that want to perform operations on the XML instead of using the item's properties.*\"\r\n\r\nSo, dig that.  If it works the way I hope it does, RSS in Vista will take care of the subscriptions for you, poll the feed data, grab new stuff—but then it leaves the data intact for you to process whatever new and unanticipated feed payloads that may arrive.\r\n\r\nThat's how it *should* work.\r\n\r\n[fmf]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/05/the-right-place-for-data-in-your-feed\r\n[itp]: http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/\r\n[fir]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/13/feedmagick-the-feed-filter-that-doesnt-know-much-about-feeds\r\n[sr]: http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/\r\n[he]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/rss/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/rsssupportinlonghorn.asp\r\n[tc]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/integrated/\r\n[ao]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/four-thoughts-on-ms-rss-so-far\r\n[fs]: http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\r\n[ir]: http://phobos.apple.com/static/iTunesRSS.html\r\n[sx]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb\r\n[sf]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/building-a-proper-shared-syndication-feed-foundation\r\n[mi]: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/10/27/extend.html\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084486\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=622a34307765c2f7c1dfdc7345842418&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://sevenroot.org/dlc/\">Darren Chamberlain</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-13T15:03:07\">2005-12-13T15:03:07</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>\n  <p>If you want feed processing tools that are useful for the general case, they have to be tolerant of things not understood.

So, say, I want to filter a feed for only items containing a certain phrase in the description—or maybe I want items with <code>osx</code> in a <code>dc:subject</code> element.</p>\n<p>And how about some blenders?  That is, I pass in any number of feed URLs and get one merged feed out the other end.  I&#39;ve got a chapter in my book on these, in Python—but it&#39;d be handy to have them in PHP as well.</p>\n<p>Have I just not looked hard enough?  By now, I&#39;d&#39;ve thought this sort of thing would be all tied up in a bow and at the top of the Google charts by now.  It makes me wish I&#39;d used PHP in my book, rather than Python—and only because of PHP&#39;s irresistible ubiquity.  Coding in PHP still makes me gag, just a bit.</p>\n<p>But, if the lazy web doesn&#39;t deliver, I guess I&#39;ll be cobbling it together myself soon.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084449\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.surlysoft.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=815c14d8894ca4b5128c6ab3e30765fb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.surlysoft.com\">Grant Schofield</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084449\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-09T06:33:36\">2005-12-09T06:33:36</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>While I agree with you on the PHP front I had heard of an RSS parser in PHP called <a href=\"http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magpie</a>.

So, say, I want to filter a feed for only items containing a certain phrase in the description—or maybe I want items with `osx` in a `dc:subject` element.\r\n\r\nAnd how about some blenders?  That is, I pass in any number of feed URLs and get one merged feed out the other end.  I've got a chapter in my book on these, in Python—but it'd be handy to have them in PHP as well.\r\n\r\nHave I just not looked hard enough?

    "html": "<p>You know, after spewing out <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/11/gopher-ng/feedroll.html\">that feedroll</a> last night, I came to the realization that I just track way too many people and things to ever really have a sane yet comprehensive blogroll that covers it all.  (And by sane I mean:  Suitable for inclusion in the traditional sidebar position.)</p>\n<p>I could work up a &quot;best of&quot; subset from that list, but then I start remembering this past Spring&#39;s blogroll <em><a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/03/15/steve-levy-dave-sifrey-and-nz-bear-you-are-hurting-us/\">sturm</a> und <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/05/06/lets-keep-the-blogroll-and-throw-away-the-writing/\">drang</a></em> and don&#39;t even want to get into picking cool kids or granting googlejuice favors.  And besides, at that point, the culling would make it miss the whole point of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/11/27/subscriptions-are-attention-but-what-about-blogrolls\">representing my attention</a>, which is what suckered me into this line of tinkering to begin with.</p>\n<p>So, maybe I won&#39;t ever have a blogroll.  Instead, my feedroll will just morph into an old-school &quot;links&quot; or &quot;elsewhere&quot; page.  If I publish and maintain such a page, you&#39;d never have to wait on me to upload or submit any OPML:  Just find or ask me for my site&#39;s URL, visit my site, and scoop up my shared public feedroll.  </p>\n<p><strong>It&#39;s small-s-semantic-web-o-riffic.</strong></p>\n<p>It could be linked into my home page and every blog entry with an autodiscovery method similar to my Atom and RSS feeds.  Parse that, and you&#39;ve got my declarations of attention.  Spider it periodically into the future, and you&#39;ve got constant updates.  If I get ambitious, maybe I&#39;ll look into SSE extensions in an RSS feed behind it.</p>\n<p>Of course, I realize that OPML could be handled this way too—but my microformatted feedroll will be <a href=\"http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75ishimmer.phtml\">a human-browsable dessert topping and machine-parseable floor wax</a>, all in one!</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085496\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8157a5907b244071cda98ba5aa7a9635&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085496\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-01T19:32:44\">2005-12-01T19:32:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I have a tiny unmaintained list on my home page, and link there to my BlogLines subscription list.

    "body": "You know, after spewing out [that feedroll][fr] last night, I came to the realization that I just track way too many people and things to ever really have a sane yet comprehensive blogroll that covers it all.  (And by sane I mean:  Suitable for inclusion in the traditional sidebar position.)\r\n\r\nI could work up a \"best of\" subset from that list, but then I start remembering this past Spring's blogroll *[sturm][br] und [drang][dr]* and don't even want to get into picking cool kids or granting googlejuice favors.  And besides, at that point, the culling would make it miss the whole point of [representing my attention][att], which is what suckered me into this line of tinkering to begin with.\r\n\r\nSo, maybe I won't ever have a blogroll.  Instead, my feedroll will just morph into an old-school \"links\" or \"elsewhere\" page.  If I publish and maintain such a page, you'd never have to wait on me to upload or submit any OPML:  Just find or ask me for my site's URL, visit my site, and scoop up my shared public feedroll.  \r\n\r\n**It's small-s-semantic-web-o-riffic.**\r\n\r\nIt could be linked into my home page and every blog entry with an autodiscovery method similar to my Atom and RSS feeds.  Parse that, and you've got my declarations of attention.  Spider it periodically into the future, and you've got constant updates.  If I get ambitious, maybe I'll look into SSE extensions in an RSS feed behind it.\r\n\r\nOf course, I realize that OPML could be handled this way too—but my microformatted feedroll will be [a human-browsable dessert topping and machine-parseable floor wax][snl], all in one!\r\n\r\n[dr]: http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/05/06/lets-keep-the-blogroll-and-throw-away-the-writing/\r\n[att]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/11/27/subscriptions-are-attention-but-what-about-blogrolls\r\n[del.icio.us]: http://del.icio.us\r\n[br]: http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/03/15/steve-levy-dave-sifrey-and-nz-bear-you-are-hurting-us/\r\n[fr]: http://decafbad.com/2005/11/gopher-ng/feedroll.html\r\n[snl]: http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75ishimmer.phtml\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085496\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8157a5907b244071cda98ba5aa7a9635&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085496\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-01T19:32:44\">2005-12-01T19:32:44</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I have a tiny unmaintained list on my home page, and link there to my BlogLines subscription list.

This will be because all the buzz and work will be driven by enthusiasm and time devoted, rather than technical merit.  And, at the moment and the foreseeable future, OPML enthusiasts have the loudest and most active voices.</p>\n<p>The only reason I keep bringing up XOXO, though, is that my time is short.  To be honest, I&#39;ve only spent about 8-10 hours in total with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/index.php?s=xoxo\">all the XOXO experiments</a> I&#39;ve shared—including my half-baked in-browser editor.  Trying to do interesting things with OPML has eaten much more of my time, and with fewer results worth sharing.  In my experience, XOXO is so easy as to be almost boring—while OPML has enough sharp edges to seem challenging.</p>\n<p>Your mileage may vary, though.  My selfish motive in occasionally promoting XOXO is the hope that it&#39;ll take off while I&#39;m busy with other things.  That way, when I have time to devote to this stuff, there&#39;ll already be easy-to-hack XOXO things simmering around the LazyWeb and I won&#39;t have to deal with even more OPML in the <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/12/the-blogosphere-as-a-tuple-space\">blogosphere tuple space</a>.  </p>\n<p>At the moment, though, neither OPML nor XOXO are paying the bills for me.

I’d give a slight edge to OPML, because Winer promotes it a lot. But on technical merit… you tell me. My hunch is XOXO is the crisp, clean and simple solution.</blockquote>\r\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://blog.eronj.com/2005/11/25/xoxo-opml-simple-list-extentions/\">Cloudy Thinking by Ron K. Jeffries  » Blog Archive   » XOXO & OPML & Simple List Extentions</a></small>\r\n\r\nAt the moment, my prediction is that XOXO gets sidelined by OPML, insofar as expressing ideas and data in outline form takes off in general.  This will be because all the buzz and work will be driven by enthusiasm and time devoted, rather than technical merit.  And, at the moment and the foreseeable future, OPML enthusiasts have the loudest and most active voices.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I keep bringing up XOXO, though, is that my time is short.  To be honest, I've only spent about 8-10 hours in total with [all the XOXO experiments][xoxo] I've shared—including my half-baked in-browser editor.  Trying to do interesting things with OPML has eaten much more of my time, and with fewer results worth sharing.  In my experience, XOXO is so easy as to be almost boring—while OPML has enough sharp edges to seem challenging.\r\n\r\nYour mileage may vary, though.  My selfish motive in occasionally promoting XOXO is the hope that it'll take off while I'm busy with other things.  That way, when I have time to devote to this stuff, there'll already be easy-to-hack XOXO things simmering around the LazyWeb and I won't have to deal with even more OPML in the [blogosphere tuple space][ts].  \r\n\r\nAt the moment, though, neither OPML nor XOXO are paying the bills for me.  So, if OPML's paying *your* bills, more power to you!\r\n\r\n[xoxo]: http://decafbad.com/blog/index.php?s=xoxo\r\n[ts]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/12/the-blogosphere-as-a-tuple-space\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: opml xoxo microformats -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084895\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=aff533acf9b173682e713fb1cb290a94&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">scott</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084895\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-26T23:20:48\">2005-11-26T23:20:48</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I'd like to see an interesting and useful <em>outline</em> application done in OPML.

On the other end of things, I think some very cool things could happen if we had a Google or a Technorati start harvesting `<ul>` and `<ol>` tags from the general HTML population in order to give some sort of tangible reward for all those sidebar link lists people have been using in their blog templates for years.\r\n\r\nWe're all still waiting for the full arrival of [Gopher NG][gn].\r\n\r\n[op]: http://dannyayers.com/archives/2005/11/24/tools/\r\n[ag]: http://www.scripting.com/2005/11/24.html#When:1:34:09PM\r\n[xoxo]: http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo\r\n[xout]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo_outliner_experiment\r\n[gn]: http://dannyayers.com/archives/2005/07/14/gopher-ng/\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090788\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.skippy.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1a320ac7f6818504df79fe42fc6b84a9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.skippy.net/\">skippy</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090788\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-25T02:52:12\">2005-11-25T02:52:12</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Isn't <a href=\"http://labs.google.com/sets\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Sets</a> already a working example of Google harvesting &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; tags from the general HTML?</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090789\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090789\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-25T02:58:29\">2005-11-25T02:58:29</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Oh yeah!

But it is interesting that Dave has this stack of (moderately) his own making: XML/RPC, OPML, RSS 2.0, Frontier/Manilla and whatever its scripting language is called. So in a way every one of his new developments is an addition to his <em>own</em> world, before it's an addition to the world at large. I could imagine that being pretty motivational.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dunno, or maybe it's simply the time and enthusiasm bit that makes the difference. Like Les I've got plenty in my in-tray already, and when I've got time of my own making a decent standards-based outliner is low on the list, even though it'd be very nice to have.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

In the end, I usually don't have to ask anyone for help, don't have to wait, and generally I get out of the store faster than anyone.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll grow out of it.\r\n\r\n[twit]: http://thisweekintech.com/28\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: nerd geek dev programming -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084905\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=81717a172b6918071fbea1a52483294b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/\">Dougal Campbell</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084905\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-02T21:13:46\">2005-11-02T21:13:46</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I'd like it a lot more if they'd give you a discount to make up for the fact that they don't have to pay for a cashier and bagger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I use the self-checkout when I only have a few items, and I think it will get me out of the store faster.

People are most productive in an environment they know best.  This is especially true when it comes to operational support.  Any environment is going to get hairy at high loads and under \"normal operating conditions\", so when the poop hits the fan, you're better off in an environment that you're familiar with.  MySql may be a better DB, but if my DBA knows SQL Server inside and out and really knows how to use the tool, then you'll get better results with SQL Server over MySql.\nAnd anyway, according to Joel Spolsky, Google beats MSDN for support in most cases.  Actually, my experience bears out Joel's comment.  All support devolves into Googling, in most cases.  I use the MSDN support only for the real killers - those support incidents cost money, you know.\nGreat work on the book, BTW.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086798\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086798\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-09T00:16:17\">2005-11-09T00:16:17</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Sorry for not getting back before now.</p>\n<p>\"Admittedly, I haven’t used it much since the arrival of CFMX, but I tend to think PHP’s a better deal.

Googling for support is actually quite annoying, but I take a \"you get what you pay for\" approach to these things.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086796\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086796\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-02T20:37:17\">2005-11-02T20:37:17</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Roger: Thanks for responding!  For what it's worth, I actually <em>do</em> want to see comments from people who've had good experiences with proprietary platforms, so as to balance out my leanings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since you mentioned Macromedia, I realize that I wasn't thinking of them in my post.  They're basically semi-open proprietary (not unlike Microsoft), but I <em>do</em> like their stuff.  Well, Flash at least.  But ColdFusion...?  Admittedly, I haven't used it much since the arrival of CFMX, but I tend to think PHP's a better deal.  No offense, though, since I'm willing to blame my own ignorance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's interesting that you say a Win2k3/IIS server is cost comparable to a Linux/Apache server, though.  Do you own your own server?

People are most productive in an environment they know best.  This is especially true when it comes to operational support.  Any environment is going to get hairy at high loads and under \"normal operating conditions\", so when the poop hits the fan, you're better off in an environment that you're familiar with.  MySql may be a better DB, but if my DBA knows SQL Server inside and out and really knows how to use the tool, then you'll get better results with SQL Server over MySql.\r\nAnd anyway, according to Joel Spolsky, Google beats MSDN for support in most cases.  Actually, my experience bears out Joel's comment.  All support devolves into Googling, in most cases.  I use the MSDN support only for the real killers - those support incidents cost money, you know.\r\nGreat work on the book, BTW.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086798\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086798\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-09T00:16:17\">2005-11-09T00:16:17</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Sorry for not getting back before now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Admittedly, I haven’t used it much since the arrival of CFMX, but I tend to think PHP’s a better deal.

Don't worry 'bout it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just love CFMX. I love how the day-to-day stuff is really easy, and the esoteric stuff can be addressed by leveraging Java.  I love that the fundamental language structure makes sense to someone who taught himself to write code on a C-64 and an Atari ST. I love that it (mostly) handles Unicode for me. I love that it allows me to play with a little OOP while primarily sticking to procedural stuff. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Lease a dedicated box?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yup. I could have gone Red Hat or Win2k3 during setup, and to me, it was a no-brainer. If nothing else, my wife has spent the last fifteen years as a network engineer, working mainly with Windows networks... free, in-house, 24/7 tech support cannot be ignored. :D</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086799\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086799\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-09T00:54:35\">2005-11-09T00:54:35</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Roger: Oh yeah!

It could <em>so</em> become an <em>über</em> Spotlight/Finder replacement.  I just don&#39;t seem to have time or ambition to write it.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t mention <a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox\">Tinderbox</a> very often, but I&#39;ve got a few Tinderbox documents set as Login Items on my PowerBook.  So, this app has become ubiquitous on my machine for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/08/11/quick-thoughts-for-a-thursday\">idea capture, sorting, and exploration</a>.  In fact, I used it to capture, shape, and structure everything I put into <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1\">Hacking RSS and Atom</a>.</p>\n<p>However, I haven&#39;t ever gotten far into some of the more advanced features like agents or export templates.  My most used HTML export templates simply boil an outline of notes down into <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/XOXO\">XOXO</a>, and that&#39;s about it.  I have had <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/css-treemaps\" title=\"Treemaps in CSS\">further</a> <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/drag-the-boxes-stretch-the-lines\" title=\"DHTML map views\">ambitions</a> for richer Tinderbox export / extension, but I haven&#39;t pursued them much lately.  </p>\n<p>Really, my main reason for not delving into Tinderbox&#39;s advanced features is that learning and using them effectively would burrow me further into the app&#39;s own pocket universe of conventions and technology.</p>\n<p>Since Tinderbox saves to XML, I <em>can</em> bridge to a larger information space via <a href=\"http://www.maparent.ca/tinderbox/\">XSLT and XPath based tools</a>.  But, all the conversion and roundtrip can get kludgey and awkward—and I lose the ease of <a href=\"http://www.43folders.com/2005/08/17/life-inside-one-big-text-file/\">life inside text files</a> augmented by grep, awk, sed, vim, perl, python, <a href=\"http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/\">QuickSilver</a>, and <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a>.</p>\n<p>This is the point where I think opportunities presented by Tiger and the advent of Spotlight can come into play—especially with the availability of <a href=\"http://www.fluffy.co.uk/spotmeta/\">SpotMeta</a>.  SpotMeta weds Spotlight with HFS Extended Attributes in order to enable the management of arbitrary user-specified metadata on files in addition to Spotlight Importer metadata.  </p>\n<p>See, the main magic of Tinderbox—at least to me—is visualization and management of relationships between notions and microcontent.  At present, Tinderbox needs to swallow the universe to accomplish everything it wants to accomplish.  It needs to include word processor features and metadata handling and graphics and all.  </p>\n<p>But, what if Tinderbox could surrender all of those functions up to TextEdit and MS Word and other desktop apps?  What if all of the &quot;notes&quot; in a Tinderbox document were just documents and files, and all of the relationships managed by Tinderbox (ie. spatial, links, aliased) were just encoded as extended attributes?</p>\n<p>In this scenario, <em>the file system is the Tinderbox document</em>.  Don&#39;t want to use your whole hard drive?  Make a new disk image and compartmentalize things.  Tinderbox could become the world&#39;s most revolutionary Finder rethink ever invented.  And the thing is, I can see all of this being enabled by Spotlight and extended attributes.</p>\n<!-- tags: tinderbox tiger spotlight xoxo -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088906\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://robertbrook.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=760b4002b07650d4ef654f9fc17e8154&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://robertbrook.com\">Robert Brook</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088906\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-04T13:16:12\">2005-11-04T13:16:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Much as I love Tinderbox, I just can't bring myself to completely trust it.

A while back I outlined a little kluge that allows you to use external editors with Tinderbox in a fairly transparent way (click on the note and the editor for that note's type opens up).

All open-source, and portable to any unix-style system. HTML export would almost come free, using one of python's many web frameworks.

I have had [further][tree] [ambitions][drag] for richer Tinderbox export / extension, but I haven't pursued them much lately.  \r\n\r\nReally, my main reason for not delving into Tinderbox's advanced features is that learning and using them effectively would burrow me further into the app's own pocket universe of conventions and technology.\r\n\r\nSince Tinderbox saves to XML, I *can* bridge to a larger information space via [XSLT and XPath based tools][tools].  But, all the conversion and roundtrip can get kludgey and awkward—and I lose the ease of [life inside text files][txt] augmented by grep, awk, sed, vim, perl, python, [QuickSilver][qs], and [Markdown][md].\r\n\r\nThis is the point where I think opportunities presented by Tiger and the advent of Spotlight can come into play—especially with the availability of [SpotMeta][sm].  SpotMeta weds Spotlight with HFS Extended Attributes in order to enable the management of arbitrary user-specified metadata on files in addition to Spotlight Importer metadata.  \r\n\r\nSee, the main magic of Tinderbox—at least to me—is visualization and management of relationships between notions and microcontent.  At present, Tinderbox needs to swallow the universe to accomplish everything it wants to accomplish.  It needs to include word processor features and metadata handling and graphics and all.  \r\n\r\nBut, what if Tinderbox could surrender all of those functions up to TextEdit and MS Word and other desktop apps?  What if all of the \"notes\" in a Tinderbox document were just documents and files, and all of the relationships managed by Tinderbox (ie. spatial, links, aliased) were just encoded as extended attributes?\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, *the file system is the Tinderbox document*.  Don't want to use your whole hard drive?  Make a new disk image and compartmentalize things.  Tinderbox could become the world's most revolutionary Finder rethink ever invented.  And the thing is, I can see all of this being enabled by Spotlight and extended attributes.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: tinderbox tiger spotlight xoxo -->\r\n\r\n[omnigraffle]: http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/\r\n[md]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\r\n[qs]: http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/\r\n[txt]: http://www.43folders.com/2005/08/17/life-inside-one-big-text-file/\r\n[tools]: http://www.maparent.ca/tinderbox/\r\n[book]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1\r\n[id]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/08/11/quick-thoughts-for-a-thursday\r\n[exp]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/01/tiger-and-tinderbox\r\n[tb]: http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox\r\n[sm]: http://www.fluffy.co.uk/spotmeta/\r\n[tree]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/css-treemaps \"Treemaps in CSS\"\r\n[drag]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/drag-the-boxes-stretch-the-lines \"DHTML map views\"\r\n[xoxo]: http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/XOXO\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088906\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://robertbrook.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=760b4002b07650d4ef654f9fc17e8154&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://robertbrook.com\">Robert Brook</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088906\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-04T13:16:12\">2005-11-04T13:16:12</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Much as I love Tinderbox, I just can't bring myself to completely trust it.

All open-source, and portable to any unix-style system. HTML export would almost come free, using one of python's many web frameworks.

We have a few older servers here, maybe a year old or so and the automatic package management is just broken.  Perhaps it's a Fedora Core or Gentoo thing, but even on a moderately old system, the package management stuff just breaks (mainly because it's not OMFG-I-need-to-upgrade-every-minute up to date).</p>\n<p>I don't upgrade just to upgrade.  Things break.  Things change.  For instance, there's a showstopping bug in Apache 2.0 that would keep one of my sites from working properly (although it's such an obscure bug that I suspect it <em>only</em> affects my site) and an automatic upgrade in that instance would be devastating.  So I upgrade only when absolutely required.

We have a few older servers here, maybe a year old or so and the automatic package management is just broken.  Perhaps it's a Fedora Core or Gentoo thing, but even on a moderately old system, the package management stuff just breaks (mainly because it's not OMFG-I-need-to-upgrade-every-minute up to date).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't upgrade just to upgrade.  Things break.  Things change.  For instance, there's a showstopping bug in Apache 2.0 that would keep one of my sites from working properly (although it's such an obscure bug that I suspect it <em>only</em> affects my site) and an automatic upgrade in that instance would be devastating.  So I upgrade only when absolutely required.  Which means &ldquo;not often.&rdquo;  And in the meantime, the maintainers of the package managers (<code>apt-get</code>, <code>emerge</code> and <code>yum</code> to name a few) break older installations.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090950\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090950\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-02T21:54:24\">2005-11-02T21:54:24</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Sean:  This <em>might</em> be a half-benefit from Debian in particular, since they're so slow to release new versions of the distro.

But alas, it seems my Blaupunkt MP3 CD unit won't read from CDRW's—at least, not the ones I have on hand.\r\n\r\nBut, I do have to say that these MP3 CD's sound a hell of a lot better than my old Griffin iTrip FM transmitter sounded.  :)\r\n\r\n[ded]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/25/ipod-go-thud-then-click-click-click\r\n[script]: http://www.dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/scripts11.php?page=1#playlisttopapercdcase\r\n[pcdc]: http://www.papercdcase.com/about.php\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: audio podcasts ford focus auto car radio -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086868\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.tapetenageln.de/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7d175cf371bae2e3ac193ef180310143&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.tapetenageln.de/\">g.</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086868\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-11-01T11:19:19\">2005-11-01T11:19:19</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I have a friend who had success in improving the quality of the itrip transmission by <a href=\"http://www.i-hacked.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=200&amp;Itemid=94\" rel=\"nofollow\">enhancing the antenna</a>.\r\njust a tip ;-)</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

In particular, a privately-messaged automaton loses all of the shared context built up in a public chatroom.

You send it an IM with a request; you're asked, in turn, to answer another request; eventually you receive an answer after a period of Oracular ponderance.\r\n\r\nNow, I've already found [one impedance mismatch for chatbots][bot], in converting an IRC-based bot to an IM-based bot.  In particular, a privately-messaged automaton loses all of the shared context built up in a public chatroom.  For infobots on IRC, often the users manual is found in watching how everyone else interacts with it.  You lose that in 1-to-1 IM.  \r\n\r\nI'd imagine going from an email interface to IM would narrow the amount of context available, but would it still be a fun hack?  Waste of time?\r\n\r\n[bot]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/24/decafbot-update-faqs\r\n[ora]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/26/tell-me-oh-oracle\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: jabber oracle chatbots -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083190\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=81717a172b6918071fbea1a52483294b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/\">Dougal Campbell</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083190\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-28T15:42:51\">2005-10-28T15:42:51</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Well, Jabber has chatrooms.

Angling anxiously for advice? The Internet Oracle can help! Like all famous oracles, the Internet Oracle is omniscient, and will provide some answer to your question. In return, the Oracle may require that you perform a small service ...</blockquote>\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://cgi.cs.indiana.edu/~oracle/index.cgi\">Internet Oracle</a></small>\n\n<p>Does anyone out there remember / still participate in the Internet Oracle?</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>:  I see the rest of what I&#39;d tried writing here didn&#39;t make it into the post.  Anyway, what I meant to say was that the Internet Oracle was one of my first brushes with the fact that there were <em>people</em> out there on that Internet.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;d been dealing with FTP servers and Archie and reading Usenet archives, but I&#39;d not yet logged on to IRC for the first time.  I&#39;d already had experience with chatting and message bases via dial-up BBSes, but this Internet thing was something altogether more.  So, the Oracle was the first experience I had of sending something out into the void, and getting not an automated response but a wittily-crafted response from an obviously real person.</p>\n<!-- tags: metablogging oracle internet retro -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087074\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.lostfocus.de/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9e1f36d2a869f4ab38f107ea8aa94899&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.lostfocus.de/\">Dominik</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087074\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-26T06:03:34\">2005-10-26T06:03:34</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I do remember, but it has been ages..</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087075\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fa15e41d4cf102273b0e8f209c52c288&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\">Dorothea Salo</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087075\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-26T11:10:05\">2005-10-26T11:10:05</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>The Internet Oracle got me through many, many (okay, about fifteen) nights on the Very Late Shift at the computer helpdesk, back when I was a wee undergrad...</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087077\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.flashesofpanic.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=389cfea59d2aef782293c210a5d96bb2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.flashesofpanic.com\">pjm</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087077\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-26T13:00:52\">2005-10-26T13:00:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I'm actually still on the Oracle's mailing list.

Angling anxiously for advice? The Internet Oracle can help! Like all famous oracles, the Internet Oracle is omniscient, and will provide some answer to your question. In return, the Oracle may require that you perform a small service ...</blockquote>\r\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://cgi.cs.indiana.edu/~oracle/index.cgi\">Internet Oracle</a></small>\r\n\r\nDoes anyone out there remember / still participate in the Internet Oracle?\r\n\r\n**Update**:  I see the rest of what I'd tried writing here didn't make it into the post.  Anyway, what I meant to say was that the Internet Oracle was one of my first brushes with the fact that there were *people* out there on that Internet.  \r\n\r\nI'd been dealing with FTP servers and Archie and reading Usenet archives, but I'd not yet logged on to IRC for the first time.  I'd already had experience with chatting and message bases via dial-up BBSes, but this Internet thing was something altogether more.  So, the Oracle was the first experience I had of sending something out into the void, and getting not an automated response but a wittily-crafted response from an obviously real person.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: metablogging oracle internet retro -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087074\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.lostfocus.de/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9e1f36d2a869f4ab38f107ea8aa94899&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.lostfocus.de/\">Dominik</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087074\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-26T06:03:34\">2005-10-26T06:03:34</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I do remember, but it has been ages..</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087075\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fa15e41d4cf102273b0e8f209c52c288&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\">Dorothea Salo</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087075\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-26T11:10:05\">2005-10-26T11:10:05</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>The Internet Oracle got me through many, many (okay, about fifteen) nights on the Very Late Shift at the computer helpdesk, back when I was a wee undergrad...</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087077\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.flashesofpanic.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=389cfea59d2aef782293c210a5d96bb2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.flashesofpanic.com\">pjm</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087077\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-26T13:00:52\">2005-10-26T13:00:52</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I'm actually still on the Oracle's mailing list.

Now that there is a way to view video the same way ... that’s going to accelerate that new type of user generated content as well. I’m positive. It’s a no brainer.</blockquote>\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008657.html\">Russell Beattie Notebook » My New iPod: Video Podcasting Is Going to Be BIG</a></small>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been gradually easing into subscribing to vidcast feeds, starting to find some early greats out there like <a href=\"http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/\">RocketBoom</a>, <a href=\"http://www.commandn.net/\">Command-N</a>, and <a href=\"http://openalpha.tv\">OpenAlpha</a>.  I&#39;ve also started hacking together feeds for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/13/internet-tv-wheres-the-feed\">great online video shows which lack feeds</a>.  And then, there&#39;s the occasional private hack I&#39;ve done to record shows with a capture card or help catch up on TV shows I find on Usenet.  </p>\n<p>To watch all of these things in the living room, I use <a href=\"http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/\">Xbox Media Center</a> on my modded Xbox, networked to a file server in the basement.  However, there are probably very few other people on the planet who&#39;d bother setting up a rig like mine.  So the combination of iTunes loading feed-delivered video enclosures onto an iPod equipped with an AV cable and a remote sounds like a genius combination for really jump starting the next phase of the vidcasting rise.</p>\n<!-- tags: apple ipod video syndication rss atom podcasting vidcasting hacks xbox -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086753\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086753\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-21T19:27:21\">2005-10-21T19:27:21</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I really wish I had a enough spare parts of bucks lying around to build a MythTV box, because I could create quite a freaking videoblog aggregating machine out of it, and view it all on the big screen TV...

I've also started hacking together feeds for [great online video shows which lack feeds][shows].

However, there are probably very few other people on the planet who'd bother setting up a rig like mine.

You could even subscribe via WINKsite and get it all on your mobile phone…</blockquote>\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.surfarama.com/index.php?p=242\">Surfarama » RSS for serialized content</a></small>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been toying around with a few ideas for something like this for a few years, but have never bothered to finish any of them.  <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008220.html\">Russell Beattie</a> had an interesting implementation of this too.</p>\n<p>But, just in case I never actually <em>do</em> anything with this notion, here&#39;s a free idea—I wonder how many aggregators actually obey a <code>301 Moved Permanently</code> HTTP status code?  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/09/01/track\">Simon Willison wrote about this notion</a>: A reader subscribes using a clean and simple feed URL, but the aggregator receives a <code>301</code> redirect upon the first <code>GET</code>.  This redirect shifts the subscription over to a new feed URL with a unique ID for the reader, thereby uniquely tagging every new subscription to the feed.  The aggregator should then continue to use this tagged URL for all future requests.</p>\n<p>However, tagging a subscriber with an RSS radio collar implies that you&#39;ll have a database on the server maintaining notes tied to those IDs.  That might be cool if I&#39;m trying to gather some metrics, but for simple time-release syndication I don&#39;t really care about tracking a <em>person*.  I want to track a *start time</em>.  </p>\n<p>What if this post-redirect feed URL had the time of initial redirect in it, and the time release was just a function of the duration since that initial redirect?  Anonymous and no need for a database.  My notion is that I&#39;ll just need a PHP script and a fully-formed &quot;master feed&quot; on which the time-release feed will be a time-bounded &quot;viewport&quot; informed by a little date math.  </p>\n<p>Or, maybe I&#39;ll have a pile of pre-prepared content in a folder and munge that into a feed.  Imagine a podcast like <a href=\"http://www.project-daemon.net/\">Scott Sigler&#39;s Ancestor</a>, all queued up and ready on the server, but doled out automatically on a weekly basis from the beginning from the point you subscribed.  I&#39;ll leave as exercises for the reader issues of &quot;obfuscating&quot; URLs so that people can&#39;t easily skip ahead through the story.</p>\n<!-- tags: rss atom syndication rest http podcasting -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086694\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086694\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-21T04:16:34\">2005-10-21T04:16:34</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>My favorite example of this is Matt Webb's service which offers <a href=\"http://interconnected.org/home/more/lightcone/\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS feed of your personal light cone</a></p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086695\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a0b347907bfaf05694805210ec595d6c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Martin Atkins</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086695\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-21T07:06:00\">2005-10-21T07:06:00</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>This scheme falls down in two ways.

You could even subscribe via WINKsite and get it all on your mobile phone…</blockquote>\r\n<small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.surfarama.com/index.php?p=242\">Surfarama » RSS for serialized content</a></small>\r\n\r\nI've been toying around with a few ideas for something like this for a few years, but have never bothered to finish any of them.  [Russell Beattie][rb] had an interesting implementation of this too.\r\n\r\nBut, just in case I never actually *do* anything with this notion, here's a free idea—I wonder how many aggregators actually obey a `301 Moved Permanently` HTTP status code?  \r\n\r\n[Simon Willison wrote about this notion][sw]: A reader subscribes using a clean and simple feed URL, but the aggregator receives a `301` redirect upon the first `GET`.  This redirect shifts the subscription over to a new feed URL with a unique ID for the reader, thereby uniquely tagging every new subscription to the feed.  The aggregator should then continue to use this tagged URL for all future requests.\r\n\r\nHowever, tagging a subscriber with an RSS radio collar implies that you'll have a database on the server maintaining notes tied to those IDs.  That might be cool if I'm trying to gather some metrics, but for simple time-release syndication I don't really care about tracking a *person*.  I want to track a *start time*.  \r\n\r\nWhat if this post-redirect feed URL had the time of initial redirect in it, and the time release was just a function of the duration since that initial redirect?  Anonymous and no need for a database.  My notion is that I'll just need a PHP script and a fully-formed \"master feed\" on which the time-release feed will be a time-bounded \"viewport\" informed by a little date math.  \r\n\r\nOr, maybe I'll have a pile of pre-prepared content in a folder and munge that into a feed.  Imagine a podcast like [Scott Sigler's Ancestor][anc], all queued up and ready on the server, but doled out automatically on a weekly basis from the beginning from the point you subscribed.  I'll leave as exercises for the reader issues of \"obfuscating\" URLs so that people can't easily skip ahead through the story.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: rss atom syndication rest http podcasting -->\r\n\r\n[anc]: http://www.project-daemon.net/\r\n[sw]: http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/09/01/track\r\n[rb]: http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008220.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086694\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086694\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-21T04:16:34\">2005-10-21T04:16:34</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>My favorite example of this is Matt Webb's service which offers <a href=\"http://interconnected.org/home/more/lightcone/\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS feed of your personal light cone</a></p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086695\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a0b347907bfaf05694805210ec595d6c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Martin Atkins</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086695\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-21T07:06:00\">2005-10-21T07:06:00</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>This scheme falls down in two ways.

    "html": "<p>I&#39;ve just finally seen <a href=\"http://www.serenitymovie.com/\">Serenity</a>.  So, if you&#39;re concerned about spoilers, bugger off now—if you cared about spoilers, you should&#39;ve already seen the big damn movie.  </p>\n<p>Some quick, fully spoiled thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I&#39;m fairly certain it was the best science fiction movie I&#39;ve seen in about 10-15 years.  I&#39;m only just about to turn 30 this month, so I&#39;m not old by any stretch—but I&#39;ve watched a lot of sci-fi in my time.  Probably too much sci-fi.  </p>\n<p>In any case, this was the first movie I&#39;ve seen in at least a decade that had me wanting to walk out, go straight to get another ticket, and watch it over again.  Like I remember doing a few times with roller coasters when I was little.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Many classic snips of Whedonesque dialog.  If they aren&#39;t coming out now via geeks with recorders in theaters, they&#39;ll be out in soundboards by December when the DVD arrives.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>&quot;Dozens of planets, hundreds of moons&quot;?  Well, I guess a single solar system alleviates the need for any sort of faster-than-light travel loopholes—but damn, that makes our solar system look <em>sparse</em>. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>River as a psychic, having mentally scooped up state secrets from visiting politicians gave a very nice and sensible motivation to everyone after her.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I missed the men with blue gloves.  They were <em>creepy</em>.  The operative seemed like part 2 of the last one they&#39;d left drifting in space, only maybe more finely honed.  He was rather fearsome, but didn&#39;t give me the willies.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The operative&#39;s total psychological conversion to <em>the mission</em> as a &quot;believer&quot; was a great concept, though.  I could imagine some future tech being used to tickle the &quot;God spot&quot; or something in a Pavlovian/Skinnerian approach to bind a person to an objective.  </p>\n<p>I <em>am</em> surprised that the truth managed to snap him out of it, though.  Religious zealots seem very rarely turned by the facts.  It was a good admission at the end though, having failed the mission, when he said &quot;there&#39;s nothing left to see&quot;.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>When the Shepherd died, I wasn&#39;t <em>too</em> choked up.  I mean, he was a good character, had a crapload of mysteries worth exploring, but he was ultimately an outsider and a passenger on the ship—maybe <em>because</em> of all those mysteries.  </p>\n<p>And, of course, in the movie as independent from the series, the Shepherd wasn&#39;t given much story to become a central concern.  But, he got his dying scene and a fairly closure-rich exit.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The landing on Miranda and the subsequent explanation of the Reavers struck me as a bit of classic Star Trek <em>done right</em>—done <em>better*.  And, having demystified the Reavers—from victims of *spaaaaace madness</em> down to better living through government chemistry—did nothing to make them any less scary.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Does anyone out there remember when they used to play 3-D movies on TV?  They&#39;d have a signal at a certain point, when you were meant to don the glasses.  </p>\n<p>When that spike nailed Wash and he died without a few minutes&#39; scene of melodramatic, coughing last words—that was the signal for, &quot;In this next fight?  They&#39;re all fair game.  <em>Start worrying</em>.&quot;  </p>\n<p>He was just <em>gone</em>, like people really go when they&#39;re not characters in a story enjoying the benefits of <em>deus ex machina</em>.  It&#39;s a very rare story where the author&#39;s gutsy enough to do permanent damage to the fictional universe itself in order to raise the stakes.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;m sad and pissed, but this was a hell of a lot better than <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/26/let-there-be-no-serenity-1701b\">wrecking the Enterprise</a>.  Hell, they did wreck the ship, but Serenity already got rebuilt by the end of the movie.  There will be no Wash 1701B.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- tags: serenity entertainment movies scifi whedon -->\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087613\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087613\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-16T05:59:32\">2005-10-16T05:59:32</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>My wife and I were both deeply disappointed by Serenity... and part of it is was the treatment of Wolver-- I mean, River.

    "body": "I've just finally seen [Serenity][ser].  So, if you're concerned about spoilers, bugger off now—if you cared about spoilers, you should've already seen the big damn movie.  \r\n\r\nSome quick, fully spoiled thoughts:\r\n\r\n  * I'm fairly certain it was the best science fiction movie I've seen in about 10-15 years.  I'm only just about to turn 30 this month, so I'm not old by any stretch—but I've watched a lot of sci-fi in my time.  Probably too much sci-fi.  \r\n\r\n  In any case, this was the first movie I've seen in at least a decade that had me wanting to walk out, go straight to get another ticket, and watch it over again.  Like I remember doing a few times with roller coasters when I was little.\r\n\r\n  * Many classic snips of Whedonesque dialog.  If they aren't coming out now via geeks with recorders in theaters, they'll be out in soundboards by December when the DVD arrives.\r\n  \r\n  * \"Dozens of planets, hundreds of moons\"?  Well, I guess a single solar system alleviates the need for any sort of faster-than-light travel loopholes—but damn, that makes our solar system look *sparse*. \r\n  \r\n  * River as a psychic, having mentally scooped up state secrets from visiting politicians gave a very nice and sensible motivation to everyone after her.\r\n  \r\n  * I missed the men with blue gloves.  They were *creepy*.  The operative seemed like part 2 of the last one they'd left drifting in space, only maybe more finely honed.  He was rather fearsome, but didn't give me the willies.\r\n\r\n  *  The operative's total psychological conversion to *the mission* as a \"believer\" was a great concept, though.  I could imagine some future tech being used to tickle the \"God spot\" or something in a Pavlovian/Skinnerian approach to bind a person to an objective.  \r\n  \r\n  I *am* surprised that the truth managed to snap him out of it, though.  Religious zealots seem very rarely turned by the facts.  It was a good admission at the end though, having failed the mission, when he said \"there's nothing left to see\".\r\n  \r\n  * When the Shepherd died, I wasn't *too* choked up.  I mean, he was a good character, had a crapload of mysteries worth exploring, but he was ultimately an outsider and a passenger on the ship—maybe *because* of all those mysteries.  \r\n  \r\n  And, of course, in the movie as independent from the series, the Shepherd wasn't given much story to become a central concern.  But, he got his dying scene and a fairly closure-rich exit.\r\n    \r\n  * The landing on Miranda and the subsequent explanation of the Reavers struck me as a bit of classic Star Trek *done right*—done *better*.  And, having demystified the Reavers—from victims of *spaaaaace madness* down to better living through government chemistry—did nothing to make them any less scary.\r\n\r\n  * Does anyone out there remember when they used to play 3-D movies on TV?  They'd have a signal at a certain point, when you were meant to don the glasses.  \r\n  \r\n    When that spike nailed Wash and he died without a few minutes' scene of melodramatic, coughing last words—that was the signal for, \"In this next fight?  They're all fair game.  *Start worrying*.\"  \r\n    \r\n    He was just *gone*, like people really go when they're not characters in a story enjoying the benefits of *deus ex machina*.  It's a very rare story where the author's gutsy enough to do permanent damage to the fictional universe itself in order to raise the stakes.  \r\n    \r\n    I'm sad and pissed, but this was a hell of a lot better than [wrecking the Enterprise][enter].  Hell, they did wreck the ship, but Serenity already got rebuilt by the end of the movie.  There will be no Wash 1701B.\r\n\r\n<!-- tags: serenity entertainment movies scifi whedon -->\r\n\r\n[ser]: http://www.serenitymovie.com/\r\n[enter]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/26/let-there-be-no-serenity-1701b\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087613\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087613\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-16T05:59:32\">2005-10-16T05:59:32</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>My wife and I were both deeply disappointed by Serenity... and part of it is was the treatment of Wolver-- I mean, River.

That way, I&#39;d recognize that that message came from some source with which I&#39;d shared that code or mark, and that it wasn&#39;t a spoofed mass-mailing from an outside phisher.  It&#39;d be like them authenticating with my brain.</p>\n<p>For example, say that my bank included the phrase &quot;Oh, and say hello to Francis for me&quot; in every email I received.  Or maybe they chose from a set of 10 literary quotes pre-selected by me.</p>\n<p>Now, assuming that financial sites didn&#39;t regularly expose their counter-password database, this might just work.  Too complicated?  Also, I don&#39;t think counter-password is <em>quite</em> the right phrase.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086760\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086760\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-13T17:23:20\">2005-10-13T17:23:20</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>How about \"lightweight credentials\"?</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086761\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fa15e41d4cf102273b0e8f209c52c288&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\">Dorothea</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086761\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-13T17:53:41\">2005-10-13T17:53:41</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>The credit union I used in Madison (uwcu.org) does this.

For example, many banks and credit card companies will start the messages with something like \"This message is in regard to your account ending with 9876\".

    "body": "I just had a nutty idea to use against phishing scams:\r\n\r\nWhen I visit a financial site, it generally requires me to enter a username and a password or PIN number in order to recognize me.  \r\n\r\nWhat if the sites I deal with included some personalized passphrase or shibboleth in every communication sent to me?  That way, I'd recognize that that message came from some source with which I'd shared that code or mark, and that it wasn't a spoofed mass-mailing from an outside phisher.  It'd be like them authenticating with my brain.\r\n\r\nFor example, say that my bank included the phrase \"Oh, and say hello to Francis for me\" in every email I received.  Or maybe they chose from a set of 10 literary quotes pre-selected by me.\r\n\r\nNow, assuming that financial sites didn't regularly expose their counter-password database, this might just work.  Too complicated?  Also, I don't think counter-password is *quite* the right phrase.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086760\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086760\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-13T17:23:20\">2005-10-13T17:23:20</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>How about \"lightweight credentials\"?</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086761\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fa15e41d4cf102273b0e8f209c52c288&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/\">Dorothea</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086761\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-13T17:53:41\">2005-10-13T17:53:41</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>The credit union I used in Madison (uwcu.org) does this.

    "html": "<p>Damn you, Slate.  I&#39;m really starting to get annoyed with various sites&#39; implementation of advertising in feeds.  Yes, <a href=\"http://archive.scripting.com/2005/09/20#whenRssIsntVeryGreat\">I&#39;m looking at <em>you</em> too, Boing Boing</a>.  </p>\n<p>The one upside to the ads in Boing Boing&#39;s feed, so far anyway, is that at least they don&#39;t change from poll-to-poll.  So, although I get a face full of the ads repeated down my aggregator page, at least I only see them each once.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"http://slate.msn.com/rss/\">Slate&#39;s feed</a>, on the other hand, entries I&#39;ve already fetched change on every poll to the feed because they randomly rotate through and generate new ads every time I request the feed.  So, in effect, nearly every entry in the feed ends up being &quot;updated&quot; when I request it.</p>\n<p><strong>This sucks.  Please stop.  Stop now.  Feed entries are not the same as web pages.</strong></p>\n<p>Of course, part of this has to do with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\">FeedSpool</a>&#39;s approach to tracking whether an entry is new or has changed.  That is, it takes an MD5 hash of the entry&#39;s XML source and uses that as a unique ID.  Yes, this is lazy.  But it&#39;s worked for me for a few years now in my other aggregators.</p>\n<p>What I really should be doing in <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/feedspool/plugins/miniagg\">miniagg</a> is watching the unique IDs on entries to determine freshness, when they&#39;re available.

    "body": "Damn you, Slate.  I'm really starting to get annoyed with various sites' implementation of advertising in feeds.  Yes, [I'm looking at *you* too, Boing Boing][bb].  \r\n\r\nThe one upside to the ads in Boing Boing's feed, so far anyway, is that at least they don't change from poll-to-poll.  So, although I get a face full of the ads repeated down my aggregator page, at least I only see them each once.\r\n\r\nWith [Slate's feed][sl], on the other hand, entries I've already fetched change on every poll to the feed because they randomly rotate through and generate new ads every time I request the feed.  So, in effect, nearly every entry in the feed ends up being \"updated\" when I request it.\r\n\r\n**This sucks.  Please stop.  Stop now.  Feed entries are not the same as web pages.**\r\n\r\nOf course, part of this has to do with [FeedSpool][fs]'s approach to tracking whether an entry is new or has changed.  That is, it takes an MD5 hash of the entry's XML source and uses that as a unique ID.  Yes, this is lazy.  But it's worked for me for a few years now in my other aggregators.\r\n\r\nWhat I really should be doing in [miniagg][ma] is watching the unique IDs on entries to determine freshness, when they're available.  Which, thankfully, they are in Slate's feed.  In other feeds, well, I'm not always so lucky, which is how the MD5 technique came about in the first place.\r\n\r\nNothing's ever nice & easy, is it?  :)\r\n\r\n[bb]: http://archive.scripting.com/2005/09/20#whenRssIsntVeryGreat\r\n[fs]: http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool\r\n[ma]: http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/feedspool/plugins/miniagg\r\n[sl]: http://slate.msn.com/rss/\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090418\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090418\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-07T15:07:23\">2005-10-07T15:07:23</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>As I'm sure you know, the hashing the content is <em>the</em> industry standard approach to tracking changes in feeds, because a huge percentage of feeds don't deliver valid unique ids and updated times.

Now that's a formula that feels a lot more like someone filling out a Mad Libs sheet for a plot.</p>\n<p>The other thing I appreciate is that your scenarios are not totally dumbed down, and actually have some thought &amp; research behind the more technical parts.  It all comes off to me as a much more solid story and even with the creative license taken, it still tickles my nerd brain.</p>\n<p>Thanks for dropping, man!

Hopefully, I pulled it off, and you're hooked.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087670\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087670\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-07T11:10:06\">2005-10-07T11:10:06</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Well, hey, look!  It's the author himself!  :)</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, though I guess calling your stuff \"formulaic\" sounds like a slight, it's not necessarily bad if the formula's a good one done right.  (I mean, there's a reason there's a formula in the first place.)  \"Popcorn fiction\" sounds about just about right.  </p>\n\n<p>I'm certainly liking your stuff better than SciFi's typical \"giant snake versus giant snake III\", \"pterodactyls in the jungle\", \"chupacabra on a boat\", or \"vampires on a spaceship\" crap.  Now that's a formula that feels a lot more like someone filling out a Mad Libs sheet for a plot.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing I appreciate is that your scenarios are not totally dumbed down, and actually have some thought &amp; research behind the more technical parts.  It all comes off to me as a much more solid story and even with the creative license taken, it still tickles my nerd brain.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for dropping, man!  Oh, and I have to say that I dug the mentions of Detroit in EarthCore—since I used to work in the Renaissance Center and was working a block or two away in Comerica Tower when I was in the thick of listening to EarthCore.

    "html": "<p>Now, in my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/02/a-kerfluffle-of-opml-and-web-directories\">previous post</a>, I&#39;d mentioned that I might have some ideas to &quot;put up&quot; in response to this recent OPML and web directories kerfluffle.  Here&#39;s my general idea:</p>\n<p>How about trying <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo\">XOXO</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html#h-12.2\">the <code>rel</code> attribute on HTML links</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-links\">the <code>subsection</code> link type</a>—all with a bit of XSL to make it work?</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s some working data and code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/xsltproc?xslAddr=xoxo-transclude.xsl&amp;docAddr=ex1.html\">Here&#39;s the end result</a>, a simple web directory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some clues as to what the above does:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This directory started with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/ex1.html\">this top-level outline</a>.  View source on this page, notice the &quot;Syndication Feeds&quot; link with the <code>rel=&quot;subsection&quot;</code>.</li>\n<li>Applying <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/xoxo-transclude.xsl\">this XSL</a> using <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/xsltproc\">this web service</a> is where the work gets done.  This consists of dereferencing each link with a <code>rel=&quot;subsection&quot;</code> and transcluding the innards of the page at the end of the URL.</li>\n<li>Notice that <a href=\"http://hackingfeeds.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/ex2.html\">the URL of &quot;Syndication Feeds&quot;</a> comes from a domain other than <code>decafbad.com</code>.  If I wanted to, the <a href=\"http://hackingfeeds.com/2005/10/xoxo-transclude/ex3.html\">third level of transclusion</a> could&#39;ve come from yet another domain, too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think this solution is better than using OPML for web directories.

    "body": "Now, in my [previous post][prev], I'd mentioned that I might have some ideas to \"put up\" in response to this recent OPML and web directories kerfluffle.  Here's my general idea:\r\n\r\nHow about trying [XOXO][], [the `rel` attribute on HTML links][rel], and [the `subsection` link type][subsection]—all with a bit of XSL to make it work?\r\n\r\nHere's some working data and code:\r\n\r\n  * [Here's the end result][end], a simple web directory.\r\n  \r\nHere are some clues as to what the above does:\r\n\r\n  * This directory started with [this top-level outline][master].  View source on this page, notice the \"Syndication Feeds\" link with the `rel=\"subsection\"`.\r\n  * Applying [this XSL][xsl] using [this web service][xsltproc] is where the work gets done.  This consists of dereferencing each link with a `rel=\"subsection\"` and transcluding the innards of the page at the end of the URL.\r\n  * Notice that [the URL of \"Syndication Feeds\"][ex2] comes from a domain other than `decafbad.com`.  If I wanted to, the [third level of transclusion][ex3] could've come from yet another domain, too.\r\n  \r\nI think this solution is better than using OPML for web directories.  Although it could use some refinement—using a bit of `<iframe>` or AJAX magic to include in a page, perhaps—it's not only *already supported* by more applications than OPML, it *also* leverages a lot of prior art and consensus work.  \r\n\r\nSo, am I wrong here?

    "html": "<p>So, I guess there was a bit of an extended kerfluffle over the weekend.  And as these things usually do, it started out from a very cool idea: You can build a web directory as an outline of links, with some nodes &quot;farmed out&quot; to outlines hosted elsewhere—all through the magic of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion\">transclusion</a>.  </p>\n<p>For example, say you want to host a directory of resources on web development.  But, you might like to let me maintain the section on web syndication feeds.  Well, I can toss you a URL to my outline of RSS and Atom links, and you can just pull it into a branch of your &quot;superset&quot; outline—kind of like an RSS subscription, really.  Whenever I change my outline, yours will automatically get updated with my work.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine this going off into infinity in both directions:  Outlines including outlines including outlines.  Outlines included by outlines included by outlines.  It&#39;s a world-wide outline.</p>\n<p>So, anyway, <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/29/opml-an-awesome-experiment/\">TechCrunch&#39;s brainstorm</a> lead to <a href=\"http://archive.scripting.com/2005/09/29#When:7:36:29AM\">Dave Winer&#39;s kudos</a> and <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/29.html#a11295\">Scoble&#39;s OPML evangelism and an implementation challenge</a>.    But, to this, <a href=\"http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&amp;entry=3305486922\">James Robertson responded by calling OPML a &quot;really, really crappy format&quot;</a>.</p>\n<p>From this ensued a splattering of posts in various places chiming in on both sides:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://brainwagon.org/archives/2005/09/30/1610/\">OPML is a sucky and under-specified format, with implementations subject to approval by one guy</a>.</li>\n<li>OPML is a working format already in use by lots of code, <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/30.html#a11296\">so offer something better or shut up</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/10/01/put-up-or-shut-up/\">Shelley Powers of Burningbird says</a> that the &quot;put up or shut up&quot; attitude is wrong, that it&#39;s &quot;bad technology&quot;.  And, though I do agree with her, the problem is that the usual suspects involved in these sorts of kerfluffles fall on two sides:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We want to see good, well-specified agreements before we code something useful.</li>\n<li>We want working, useful code that we&#39;ll agree is good when we see it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While group #1 is willing to talk/shout things out and reach consensus ahead of time, group #2 wants to forge ahead with machines in motion and reach consensus through popular implementation.  So, members of group #2 will <em>never</em> take group #1 seriously until they&#39;ve &quot;put up&quot;, because that&#39;s <em>their</em> process.</p>\n<p>Personally, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/12/13/oooced\">I sympathize with the dirty ways of group #2</a>.  But, I&#39;ve become convinced that what group #1 does is best over the long term, as some of the early successes of group #2 may become tottering unbalanced stacks of plates later on.</p>\n<p>So...

And since Google's pretty much <a href=\"http://www.webworkshop.net/dmoz-2005.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">driven a stake into DMOZ</a>, my further interest in Gopher NG is really just a sometimes-interesting problem.  </p>\n<p>I could see some people joining Dave's World Outline effort to get some buzz in their interest niches—trying to be first to get their constituent URLs placed in the new, distributed OPML DMOZ-killer.

Look at just about anyone's blogroll.  They're almost all in XOXO form <em>right now</em>.  That's the thing:  XOXO is just an HTML list.  It's so unexciting as to be unremarkable—<em>but they're everywhere, right now</em>.

I think that's the right thing to bet on, versus OPML.

    "body": "So, I guess there was a bit of an extended kerfluffle over the weekend.  And as these things usually do, it started out from a very cool idea: You can build a web directory as an outline of links, with some nodes \"farmed out\" to outlines hosted elsewhere—all through the magic of [transclusion][trans].  \r\n\r\nFor example, say you want to host a directory of resources on web development.  But, you might like to let me maintain the section on web syndication feeds.  Well, I can toss you a URL to my outline of RSS and Atom links, and you can just pull it into a branch of your \"superset\" outline—kind of like an RSS subscription, really.  Whenever I change my outline, yours will automatically get updated with my work.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine this going off into infinity in both directions:  Outlines including outlines including outlines.  Outlines included by outlines included by outlines.  It's a world-wide outline.\r\n\r\nSo, anyway, [TechCrunch's brainstorm][tech] lead to [Dave Winer's kudos][dwk] and [Scoble's OPML evangelism and an implementation challenge][scoble].    But, to this, [James Robertson responded by calling OPML a \"really, really crappy format\"][jr].\r\n\r\nFrom this ensued a splattering of posts in various places chiming in on both sides:\r\n\r\n  1. [OPML is a sucky and under-specified format, with implementations subject to approval by one guy][bw].\r\n  2. OPML is a working format already in use by lots of code, [so offer something better or shut up][scob2].\r\n\r\nNow, [Shelley Powers of Burningbird says][sh] that the \"put up or shut up\" attitude is wrong, that it's \"bad technology\".  And, though I do agree with her, the problem is that the usual suspects involved in these sorts of kerfluffles fall on two sides:\r\n\r\n  1. We want to see good, well-specified agreements before we code something useful.\r\n  1. We want working, useful code that we'll agree is good when we see it.\r\n\r\nWhile group #1 is willing to talk/shout things out and reach consensus ahead of time, group #2 wants to forge ahead with machines in motion and reach consensus through popular implementation.  So, members of group #2 will *never* take group #1 seriously until they've \"put up\", because that's *their* process.\r\n\r\nPersonally, [I sympathize with the dirty ways of group #2][dirt].  But, I've become convinced that what group #1 does is best over the long term, as some of the early successes of group #2 may become tottering unbalanced stacks of plates later on.\r\n\r\nSo...  What to do?  Bah, I don't know.  But, against my better judgement, I feel like [I have an idea or two to \"put up\"][idea].  \r\n\r\nIn the meantime: Members of group #1, stop arguing with members of group #2—you're not speaking in quite the same languages, and you're not going to convert anyone.  Just nod & smile, walk away and come up with a better idea, come back and show why it's better.\r\n\r\n(Oh yeah, and whatever happened to [OML replacing OPML][oml]?)\r\n\r\n[idea]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/02/web-directories-with-xoxo-and-xsl\r\n[oml]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/04/16/opml-vs-oml\r\n[dirt]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/12/13/oooced\r\n[sh]: http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/10/01/put-up-or-shut-up/\r\n[bw]: http://brainwagon.org/archives/2005/09/30/1610/\r\n[trans]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion\r\n[scob2]: http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/30.html#a11296\r\n[jr]: http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&entry=3305486922\r\n[dwk]: http://archive.scripting.com/2005/09/29#When:7:36:29AM\r\n[tech]: http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/29/opml-an-awesome-experiment/\r\n[scoble]: http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/29.html#a11295\r\n[xoxo]: http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084228\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.voidstar.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ce83a8e239c0cfce3488d3fec4d5d8de&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.voidstar.com\">Julian Bond</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084228\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-03T07:50:53\">2005-10-03T07:50:53</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Both groups are right.

Well, I eventually got snared back into the clutches of Firefox—I blame the <a href=\"http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/\">monkey</a>—and have since wandered away from the drawer of tabs.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=436\">SessionSaver</a> gave me what I needed to weather the occasional crash with my reading queue in open tabs intact.  And a month or so after that, I discovered a hack to <a href=\"http://kb.mozillazine.org/Move_the_tabbar_(Firefox)\">switch Firefox tabs to vertical</a>.  Now, all I need is for someone (maybe me?) to get <a href=\"http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/archives/2005/05/rendering_web_p.html\">thumbnails of pages</a> drawing in this vertical tab strip, and I&#39;ll be golden.</p>\n<p>What does all this have to do with the above quote?

It only works well to connect individuals, not collectives. It's very much like meatspace in these respects.

Quite like the typical computer club / writer's workshop / keyboard school in meatspace, where the locality of people is a bigger constraint to the makeup of the membership than the intensity of their interest. On LJ, I think the key factor is that it's so easy to find dedicated topical online communities, which offer a far more satisfactory experience, that only those who cannot be bothered to look for them are compelled to look for corresponding communities on LJ.</p>\n<p>On a different note, another case of succesful social networking just occured to me---Flickr. There too the networking it is a very successful component, cherished by many, but again only a component that compounds the experience, not an end in itself. And arguably that's why it's so successful.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083715\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sporkmonger.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=56ee28134dd0776825445e3551979b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sporkmonger.com\">Bob Aman</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083715\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-20T19:16:52\">2005-10-20T19:16:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>After some careful consideration, I decided to rename SporkID to something more generic sounding (Sporklet) and pull the identity stuff right out of the application.</p>\n<p>But to answer your question, absolutely, yes.  I am definately planning on building on top of OpenID, and possibly Sxip (though not definately).  I'm working on a modular reputation-based authorization system of identity, which I'm planning on setting up under a non-profit org in order to allay any fears people might have of, say, having my company get acquired by another larger company and then finding themselves having lost control of their identity.</p>\n<p>The general idea is, \"Great, we've got a decent, easy to implement system of authenticating via OpenID, but the decentralized model doesn't work quite as well for authorization systems because systems can lie.\"  So what I'm working on is a method of bringing different trust metrics under a single roof that's easy to access via a REST web services API.  And then Sporklet (the stuff I described in my earlier comment) just makes use of the reputation/identity stuff in the background.</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

It props up the other features of the site, instead being the end that the other features are merely the means to. Just as in life, the networking just happens as you go about the things you <em>actually</em> wanted to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, I've found that <abbr title=\"Livejournal\">LJ</abbr> is lousy place to find topical communities (unless you're into typical teenage popularity contests). It only works well to connect individuals, not collectives. It's very much like meatspace in these respects. (I'm not entirely sure where I'm going with this point, but it has some relevance to the other one that I can't quite grasp.

Quite like the typical computer club / writer's workshop / keyboard school in meatspace, where the locality of people is a bigger constraint to the makeup of the membership than the intensity of their interest. On LJ, I think the key factor is that it's so easy to find dedicated topical online communities, which offer a far more satisfactory experience, that only those who cannot be bothered to look for them are compelled to look for corresponding communities on LJ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a different note, another case of succesful social networking just occured to me---Flickr. There too the networking it is a very successful component, cherished by many, but again only a component that compounds the experience, not an end in itself.

I am definately planning on building on top of OpenID, and possibly Sxip (though not definately).  I'm working on a modular reputation-based authorization system of identity, which I'm planning on setting up under a non-profit org in order to allay any fears people might have of, say, having my company get acquired by another larger company and then finding themselves having lost control of their identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The general idea is, \"Great, we've got a decent, easy to implement system of authenticating via OpenID, but the decentralized model doesn't work quite as well for authorization systems because systems can lie.\"  So what I'm working on is a method of bringing different trust metrics under a single roof that's easy to access via a REST web services API.  And then Sporklet (the stuff I described in my earlier comment) just makes use of the reputation/identity stuff in the background.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

I dislike the usual category technology, am hooked on del.icio.us tagging, so here we are.\r\n\r\n* [WordPress Administration Design: Tiger](http://orderedlist.com/articles/wordpress-administration-design-tiger/ \"WordPress Administration Design: Tiger // Ordered List by Steve Smith\") -- Because WordPress' default admin style kinda looks like butt.\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\n**2002**: [It looked like this.](http://web.archive.org/web/20020525024010/http://www.decafbad.com/) I launched this site on a lark, liking the name `oxDECAFBAD`.  It's a 32-bit hexadecimal number, as well as an expression of distaste for things not containing caffeine.   Initially, the software was [Movable Type][mt2], which I quickly overwhelmed with hacks and plugins and all manner of crap.\r\n\r\n**2003**: [It looked like this.](http://web.archive.org/web/20030603165048/www.decafbad.com/blog/)  Tired of the crud I'd accumulated with my Movable Type exploits, I rebooted things and reworked everything to use [Blosxom][blosxom].  I also started taking a turn away from blogging \"proper\" and mostly posted lists of links for awhile.\r\n\r\n**2004**: [It looked like this.](http://web.archive.org/web/20040618092324/www.decafbad.com/blog/)  I stole some ideas from [Mark Pilgrim's accessibility series](http://diveintoaccessibility.org/) (whether it showed or not), and planned to switch to a more verbose and article-oriented style of blogging.  I also tried to integrate my wiki and link-blogging activities into a more unified navigation on the site.  Unfortunately, the net result was that the only thing that really every got updated was my linkblog.\r\n\r\n**2005**: Wanting to switch back to a more free and lightweight style of blogging, I ditched Movable Type and my article-length-biased templates.  (For some reason, I always end up making MT move like a battleship.)  This is another reboot, and as such, many of my site's previous features (ie. the wiki and linkblog) have gone away until I've had a chance to reevaluate them.\r\n\r\n**@@ More soon.**\r\n\r\n[mt2]: http://www.movabletype.org\r\n[blosxom]: http://blosxom.com\n",

Combine your above example with <a href=\"http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/posts/show/763\" rel=\"nofollow\">these directions for creating VIPs</a> and you can set up a pretty functional VPN. I create VIPs for the hosts that are most interesting at work and have a custom hosts file map the work hostnames to the local IPs. Then when I open the tunnel with ssh I bind to the VIP IPs. It takes a little while to set everything up but the result is very nice. </p>\n<p>I'm in the process of building up a simple config file syntax for specifying which hosts/ports should be tunneled and a little script that does all the dirty work of creating the VIPs and opening the ssh connection.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086056\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086056\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-27T14:38:59\">2005-09-27T14:38:59</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Hmm...

Basically I can make it look like a small subset of the work LAN with just VIPs, hosts file modification, and ssh tunnels.</p>\n<p>So say I have two boxes at work - <code>work-box-1</code> and <code>work-box-2</code>, running SMB and a web server, respectively. I create a host file that points the host names to IPs on my home lan: </p>\n<p><code>/etc/hosts.ssh-vip-vpn</code>:</p>\n<pre><code> 192.168.1.130  work-box-1\n192.168.1.131  work-box-2\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, I have a little script that ups the VIPs using ifconfig, symlinks the hosts file, and opens the tunnels:</p>\n<p><code>~/bin/open-vpn</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>#!/bin/bash\nifconfig en1 inet 192.168.1.130 netmask 255.255.255.255 alias\nifconfig en1 inet 192.168.1.131 netmask 255.255.255.255 alias\nln -s /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.ssh-vip-vpn\nssh -L192.168.1.130:445:real-work-ip1:445 \\\n-L192.168.1.130:137:real-work-ip1:137 \\\n-L192.168.1.131:80:real-work-ip2:80 external-work-hostname\n</code></pre>\n<p>The cool thing is that everything pretty much looks exactly as it does at work.

I close it up, leave home, open it up on a new network.  Repeat at least twice a day.</p>\n<p>What autossh does is start an SSH connection and monitor it continuously to be sure it's up.  If the connection ever goes down, autossh starts it up again.</p>\n<p>So, instead of the usually SSH command to connect to a server at home, I use autossh.  When I open my PowerBook in a new location, autossh sees that it's lost the connection to home and automatically reconnects.  This way, I always have a terminal window to home—along with a handful of forwarded ports—even after travelling between networks.  And, since I'm running <code>screen</code> at home, everything I was doing before travelling is all in the same state I left it.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086074\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://enduringvoices.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5d833a456f8dc70c9a48f7f242880212&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://enduringvoices.com\">Nathan Nutter</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086074\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-29T03:27:56\">2005-09-29T03:27:56</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>OK, Thank you.

    "body": "I've just recently put some pieces together in my head, and have found this to be a very useful invocation to run in a Terminal window on my PowerBook:\r\n\r\n`while [ 1 ]; do ssh -t home '/usr/sbin/screen -R work'; done`\r\n\r\n*(**Update:** Thanks to a [comment by Leland Johnson](http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/27/ssh-and-screen-better-together#comment-2052), I've realized that the above just poorly reinvents [autossh](http://www.harding.motd.ca/autossh/).  Use it instead.)*\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, here's what's up:\r\n\r\n* `home` is a host defined in my `~/.ssh/config`;\r\n* `work` is a persistent [`screen`](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) session I have running there;\r\n* The `-t` option for `ssh` is key for making `screen` work;\r\n* I have several forwarded ports set up to enable things like IRC and sometimes HTTP proxied through a home machine;\r\n* I have ssh-agent running in order to ensure I never have to enter a password; \r\n* The `while` loop runs forever, so that whenever my `ssh` connection drops—say when I go from home to work or vice versa—it gets reestablished as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe end result is that I always have a window with a few shells open on a machine at home, as well as a slew of ports tunneled to machines back home to provide a rough sort of VPN.  The connection is usually reestablished and waiting by the time I've gotten settled and get around to visiting that window.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086054\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=abfc88b96ae18c85ba7aac3bded2ec5e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/\">Ryan Tomayko</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086054\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-27T14:28:36\">2005-09-27T14:28:36</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>A great tip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of this, I was messing around the other day and found that it's really easy to create VIPs in OS X. Combine your above example with <a href=\"http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/posts/show/763\" rel=\"nofollow\">these directions for creating VIPs</a> and you can set up a pretty functional VPN. I create VIPs for the hosts that are most interesting at work and have a custom hosts file map the work hostnames to the local IPs. Then when I open the tunnel with ssh I bind to the VIP IPs. It takes a little while to set everything up but the result is very nice. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm in the process of building up a simple config file syntax for specifying which hosts/ports should be tunneled and a little script that does all the dirty work of creating the VIPs and opening the ssh connection.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086056\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086056\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-27T14:38:59\">2005-09-27T14:38:59</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hmm...

Basically I can make it look like a small subset of the work LAN with just VIPs, hosts file modification, and ssh tunnels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So say I have two boxes at work - <code>work-box-1</code> and <code>work-box-2</code>, running SMB and a web server, respectively. I create a host file that points the host names to IPs on my home lan: </p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>/etc/hosts.ssh-vip-vpn</code>:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code> 192.168.1.130  work-box-1\r\n 192.168.1.131  work-box-2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, I have a little script that ups the VIPs using ifconfig, symlinks the hosts file, and opens the tunnels:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>~/bin/open-vpn</code>:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>#!/bin/bash\r\nifconfig en1 inet 192.168.1.130 netmask 255.255.255.255 alias\r\nifconfig en1 inet 192.168.1.131 netmask 255.255.255.255 alias\r\nln -s /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.ssh-vip-vpn\r\nssh -L192.168.1.130:445:real-work-ip1:445 \\\r\n      -L192.168.1.130:137:real-work-ip1:137 \\\r\n      -L192.168.1.131:80:real-work-ip2:80 external-work-hostname\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The cool thing is that everything pretty much looks exactly as it does at work.

If the connection ever goes down, autossh starts it up again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, instead of the usually SSH command to connect to a server at home, I use autossh.  When I open my PowerBook in a new location, autossh sees that it's lost the connection to home and automatically reconnects.  This way, I always have a terminal window to home—along with a handful of forwarded ports—even after travelling between networks.  And, since I'm running <code>screen</code> at home, everything I was doing before travelling is all in the same state I left it.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086074\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://enduringvoices.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5d833a456f8dc70c9a48f7f242880212&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://enduringvoices.com\">Nathan Nutter</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086074\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-29T03:27:56\">2005-09-29T03:27:56</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>OK, Thank you.

I have been trying to figure out how to use it because my school has a server that us students are allowed to use to compile things and what not. But it also stores all our files on it so I have been trying to setup [AlmostVPN][2] to forward the Apple File Share that has our home directories on it. Unfortunately, I have not gotten it to work yet, but that is mostly because I have very limited knowledge of SSH. I use it in place of telnet but that is all I know how to do right now.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

As a self-confessed Star Wars dweeb, I've read alot of extended universe and some writers have good explanations.   For instance, Jabba the Hutt is a sexual deviant in his culture, and is really frowned upon.  In fact Hutts are asexual and become \"female\"  after they have a baby.  Jabba was a real freak who made a point to avoid that, but he's considered young.  Ive never read about a Wookie who liked human women though.  Everyone seems to like Twi'leks though.</p>\n<p>It's sad that I know that much about sexuality in a fictional universe.</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

As a self-confessed Star Wars dweeb, I've read alot of extended universe and some writers have good explanations.   For instance, Jabba the Hutt is a sexual deviant in his culture, and is really frowned upon.  In fact Hutts are asexual and become \"female\"  after they have a baby.  Jabba was a real freak who made a point to avoid that, but he's considered young.  Ive never read about a Wookie who liked human women though.  Everyone seems to like Twi'leks though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's sad that I know that much about sexuality in a fictional universe.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

On the one hand, producing something like XML using &quot;proper&quot; DOM invocations and handwavings seems like the &quot;correct&quot; thing to do.  Yet, on the other hand, using a templating system lets me get down to business much more quickly and with much more clarity and succinct code.  </p>\n<p>Yeah, templates provide a range of flexibility sufficient to aim the barrel at your own toes, while an API like the XML DOM keeps everything on the rails--but sometimes you know where you&#39;re going and don&#39;t need the rails to get you there.  Furthermore, isn&#39;t it possible to make a template system that Does The Right Thing?</p>\n<p>Anyway, it&#39;s rather apparent that I&#39;m solidly in favor of templates:  After all, a book of mine just hit the shelves which is just rife with template-based generation of RSS and Atom feeds.  </p>\n<p>My only issue, really, is that I feel vaguely guilty about it.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084924\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=821395fe70906c8290df7f18ac4ac6cf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">rick</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084924\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T02:27:37\">2005-09-26T02:27:37</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Ruby has the nice Builder module for this (http://builder.rubyforge.org/).

Don&#8217;t do that.\nCheck <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henri Sivonen</a>&#8217;s suggestions just published in his <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/producing-xml/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HOWTO Avoid Being Called a Bozo When Producing XML</a>. Instead of building a DOM, generate SAX events, using the program structure to ensure proper nesting &#8211; or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.\nThe emission of synthesised SAX events can be generalised by writing a datastructure-to-SAX serialiser, so that you can build your data within your language&#8217;s native datastructures prior to outputting it, for maximum comfort. (Of course you serialise piecemeal too, f.ex. by outputting the head of a feed manually, then for each item, building the data structure and immediately serialising it, then emitting the final events to complete the document.)\nDepending on the complexity of the output, you could directly emit the otuput format or feed the events into to an XSLT transform that generates the full-blown thing from an easy to generate document structure. In both cases this can be done with or without the involvement of a serialiser as middle man.\nThere are plenty of ways to make sure that the entire toolchain from one end to the other consists only of steps that conserve well-formedness, and they need not be any less convenient than using templates.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084926\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084926\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:16:35\">2005-09-26T04:16:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.</blockquote>\nAristotle:  Now here's where I think certain templating technologies get interesting, and may Do the Right Thing.  My so-far-favorite templating kit, ZPT, wants well-formed XML as templates--although I think that restriction is unfortunately relaxed as a nod to HTML.  On the other hand, my possibly-new-favorite templating kit, Kid, [demands well-formed XML as templates](http://lesscode.org/projects/kid/wiki/KidFaq#must-templates-be-well-formed-xml).\nIn case you haven't played with them, these two template languages center around the idea that certain attributes on elements define where content provided in a data structure should be inserted / swapped in by the template engine.  The engine handles character encodings and such to ensure that the well-formed template results in a well-formed document.\nDoes this match up with what you say up there?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084928\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084928\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:28:49\">2005-09-26T04:28:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I guess the other thing that bugs me about constructing documents via DOM or via generating SAX events—which I'd first discovered in <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/12/py-xml.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this XML.com article by Uche Ogbuji</a>—is how awkward and removed it is from the view-source XML I've gotten used to hacking around with.

I confess I actually kind of liked <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI.pm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CGI.pm</a> &#8211; because nesting is automatically taken care of without so much typing of end tags, and you can seamlessly weave <code>map</code>s into the code for output loops.\nI have to note though that I used it as a sort of template language in its own right &#8211; I never littered <code>print</code>s all over my code, I kept all the calls in a single place, in fact, usually a single expression. That is also why I find it strange that people create template languages for PHP, which was itself born as a template language. What matters is that the output generation is separate from the processing logic, whether or not the template and the code are in different languages.\nAnyway, I digress.\nWhat I wanted to say is, no, I hadn&#8217;t seen either ZPT or Kid. I had put off reading the lesscode.org article you quoted and went back to it after responding here. Now that I&#8217;ve read it, I admit I&#8217;m intrigued.

Logic and presentation in separate blocks / files / etc.  And then, my take is that if you're going to have your presentation/view separate from the logic/controller, you may as well code the presentation in a form as close to the goal as possible (ie. in XML or HTML, not in s-expressions or the logic implementation idiom)—especially since oftimes you've got separate people or teams working primarily on each.\nI suspect, however, that a templating system like Kid goes quite a ways toward solving the problem of \"gluing strings together\".

Somehow that strikes me as natural and easy, but many of my users seem to disagree, preferring to learn a templating system instead of learning to write Perl code.  I'm still undecided about the issue.

Problem is, I haven't gotten much closer now, but I figured I'd at least post a few thoughts and conjure up a vague sketch of the issue.\r\n\r\nYou see, I think it all goes back to [thoughts about which I posted almost three years ago][lazy].  On the one hand, producing something like XML using \"proper\" DOM invocations and handwavings seems like the \"correct\" thing to do.  Yet, on the other hand, using a templating system lets me get down to business much more quickly and with much more clarity and succinct code.  \r\n\r\nYeah, templates provide a range of flexibility sufficient to aim the barrel at your own toes, while an API like the XML DOM keeps everything on the rails--but sometimes you know where you're going and don't need the rails to get you there.  Furthermore, isn't it possible to make a template system that Does The Right Thing?\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's rather apparent that I'm solidly in favor of templates:  After all, a book of mine just hit the shelves which is just rife with template-based generation of RSS and Atom feeds.  \r\n\r\nMy only issue, really, is that I feel vaguely guilty about it.\r\n\r\n[lazy]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/12/13/oooced\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084924\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=821395fe70906c8290df7f18ac4ac6cf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">rick</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084924\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T02:27:37\">2005-09-26T02:27:37</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Ruby has the nice Builder module for this (http://builder.rubyforge.org/).

Don&#8217;t do that.\n\nCheck <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henri Sivonen</a>&#8217;s suggestions just published in his <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/producing-xml/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HOWTO Avoid Being Called a Bozo When Producing XML</a>. Instead of building a DOM, generate SAX events, using the program structure to ensure proper nesting &#8211; or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.\n\nThe emission of synthesised SAX events can be generalised by writing a datastructure-to-SAX serialiser, so that you can build your data within your language&#8217;s native datastructures prior to outputting it, for maximum comfort. (Of course you serialise piecemeal too, f.ex. by outputting the head of a feed manually, then for each item, building the data structure and immediately serialising it, then emitting the final events to complete the document.)\n\nDepending on the complexity of the output, you could directly emit the otuput format or feed the events into to an XSLT transform that generates the full-blown thing from an easy to generate document structure. In both cases this can be done with or without the involvement of a serialiser as middle man.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to make sure that the entire toolchain from one end to the other consists only of steps that conserve well-formedness, and they need not be any less convenient than using templates.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084926\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084926\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:16:35\">2005-09-26T04:16:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.</blockquote>\nAristotle:  Now here's where I think certain templating technologies get interesting, and may Do the Right Thing.  My so-far-favorite templating kit, ZPT, wants well-formed XML as templates--although I think that restriction is unfortunately relaxed as a nod to HTML.  On the other hand, my possibly-new-favorite templating kit, Kid, [demands well-formed XML as templates](http://lesscode.org/projects/kid/wiki/KidFaq#must-templates-be-well-formed-xml).\n\nIn case you haven't played with them, these two template languages center around the idea that certain attributes on elements define where content provided in a data structure should be inserted / swapped in by the template engine.  The engine handles character encodings and such to ensure that the well-formed template results in a well-formed document.\n\nDoes this match up with what you say up there?</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084928\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084928\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:28:49\">2005-09-26T04:28:49</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">I guess the other thing that bugs me about constructing documents via DOM or via generating SAX events—which I'd first discovered in <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/12/py-xml.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this XML.com article by Uche Ogbuji</a>—is how awkward and removed it is from the view-source XML I've gotten used to hacking around with.

I confess I actually kind of liked <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI.pm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CGI.pm</a> &#8211; because nesting is automatically taken care of without so much typing of end tags, and you can seamlessly weave <code>map</code>s into the code for output loops.\n\nI have to note though that I used it as a sort of template language in its own right &#8211; I never littered <code>print</code>s all over my code, I kept all the calls in a single place, in fact, usually a single expression. That is also why I find it strange that people create template languages for PHP, which was itself born as a template language. What matters is that the output generation is separate from the processing logic, whether or not the template and the code are in different languages.\n\nAnyway, I digress.\n\nWhat I wanted to say is, no, I hadn&#8217;t seen either ZPT or Kid.

Logic and presentation in separate blocks / files / etc.  And then, my take is that if you're going to have your presentation/view separate from the logic/controller, you may as well code the presentation in a form as close to the goal as possible (ie. in XML or HTML, not in s-expressions or the logic implementation idiom)—especially since oftimes you've got separate people or teams working primarily on each.\n\nI suspect, however, that a templating system like Kid goes quite a ways toward solving the problem of \"gluing strings together\".

Your MT installation permitted Markdown but no literal tags, which caught me off guard once or twice until I noticed. But thankfully it had a preview button, so I could figure it out. I <strong><em>hate</em></strong> how WordPress does not ship with preview button available and enabled by default, and the default configuration doesn't even mention the expected formatting anywhere either.\n\nI just suspected that your WordPress was vanilla and used HTML on that hunch &#8211; and it worked.

Often people want me to switch to templates.  At the moment, when you want to radically change the HTML for the stuff that is not the wiki content, ie. headers and footers, you need to override the Perl subs that I provide.  Somehow that strikes me as natural and easy, but many of my users seem to disagree, preferring to learn a templating system instead of learning to write Perl code.  I'm still undecided about the issue.  At the moment I'm still sticking to the \"write Perl code instead of templating\" because being able to write Perl code will make so many other task easy.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084938\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084938\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-27T11:31:23\">2005-09-27T11:31:23</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Alex:  Well, from my perspective, I've worked on a lot of teams where you've essentially got two roles—software engineer (SE) and interface engineer (IE).

There's usually overlap, of course, but these are the roles on paper at least.</p>\n\n<p>When you're trying to come up with an overarching framework which accomodates collaboration between these two sorts of people and their respective skill sets, it helps to have a bridge between the logic and the presentation which can keep the Perl out of the HTML and the HTML out of the Perl.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand...

In a nutshell:  It polls feeds and downloads the data.  New entries are split out into individual files, like an email or usenet spool.  That&#39;s it.  Other programs are expected to do the clever bits.</p>\n<p>And, to go along with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/feedspool/\">FeedSpool</a>, I&#39;ve been toying with building a Spotlight importer for OS X Tiger which indexes RSS and Atom feeds and entries.  Not in Subversion yet, and not nearly ready for public consumption, but it&#39;s been pretty fun to play with.

I've also continued working a bit with some feed hacks since finishing the book.  \r\n\r\n[FeedSpool][feedspool] is one of these: I've revived some of FeedReactor's old code--this time aiming for a much higher degree of simplicity, trying to stick with standard Python modules, and dumping the database altogether.  \r\n\r\nI've been meaning to make a more formal announcement about this thing, once it's a bit more in usable shape.  In a nutshell:  It polls feeds and downloads the data.  New entries are split out into individual files, like an email or usenet spool.  That's it.  Other programs are expected to do the clever bits.\r\n\r\nAnd, to go along with [FeedSpool][feedspool], I've been toying with building a Spotlight importer for OS X Tiger which indexes RSS and Atom feeds and entries.  Not in Subversion yet, and not nearly ready for public consumption, but it's been pretty fun to play with.  (And I totally forgot just how many feeds I have lying around on my hard drive!)\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's enough for now.  Time to post this and get to thinking about what I want to post next!\r\n\r\n[feedspool]: http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/feedspool/\r\n[quick]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/08/12/quick-and-random-thoughts\r\n[noticed]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/12/redesigninprogress#comment-1850\r\n[kottke]: http://www.kottke.org/03/11/kottke-redesign\r\n[asides]: http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Asides\r\n[hackingfeeds]: http://www.hackingfeeds.com/blog/\r\n[book]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/13/hacking-rss-and-atom-is-out \"Hacking RSS and Atom is out! » Archive » Blog » 0xDECAFBAD\"\r\n[redesign]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/12/redesigninprogress \"Redesign in progress (or, no need to adjust your set) » Archive » Blog » 0xDECAFBAD\"\r\n[yak]: http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html \"yak shaving\"\r\n[hulk]: http://www.hulkgames.com/us/ \"THE INCREDIBLE HULK: ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION\"\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083237\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083237\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-23T02:03:28\">2005-09-23T02:03:28</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Just a quick note that as of this writing, neither the feeds (ironic!) nor commenting works at hackingfeeds.com.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083238\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083238\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-23T02:18:02\">2005-09-23T02:18:02</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Aristotle:  Thanks for the note!

I intended to read my feeds with tin or slrn (I'd use thunderbird now) and call it a day.  I didn't get very far with it, though, because I couldn't find an NNTP server package that I was happy with, and then something shinier came along.  I think there is a lot of merit to this idea, though, and I'm going to be taking a look at FeedSpool.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

And [you should buy it!][buy]  Lookee, lookee:  It's already got a 5-star review from someone I don't even know!\r\n\r\nFor the moment, I'm going to wrap up this post, finish my dinner, and go for a walk with the girl--but, when we get back, I think I might post a few more details on what you'll find in my book debut. \r\n\r\n[buy]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1\r\n[announce]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/07/belated-happy-new-year\r\n[quick]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/02/19/writing-no-things-of-epic-import\r\n[dec04]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/12/\r\n[book]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/04/25/hacking-rss-and-atom-is-a-real-book\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082500\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://monkey.org/~jose/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d74863ca9c7785cd396379766095036c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://monkey.org/~jose/\">jose</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082500\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-14T01:03:36\">2005-09-14T01:03:36</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">congrats, les, if anyone should have written that book it's you. i'm glad to see it's hit the shelves .. now to go find a copy and look it over :)</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082501\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://stingthebee.nu\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0c6c4240507baf594a95fd3b25b975d2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://stingthebee.nu\">Jim Renaud</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082501\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-14T01:54:39\">2005-09-14T01:54:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Congrats Les.

To keep these reminders in my face throughout the day, I've got [Dasher][dasher] set to bring the Dashboard up whenever I walk away for more than 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nAs for plain old ideas, I've got a `00-random.txt` file I maintain between the PowerBook and [MacNoteTaker][notetaker].  This is in [Markdown][markdown] format, and I occasionally view it via a filter CGI in my browser.  I'm considering plastering it up on my Dashboard via a browser-refresh widget also.  Eventually, these ideas migrate into [Tinderbox][tinderbox] or a personal wiki.\r\n\r\nFor my next productivity micro-project, I'm thinking of setting up an email gateway to let my fianc&#233;e email me honey-do lists that'll get merged in with my reminders...\r\n\r\n[tinderbox]: http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/\r\n[dasher]: http://www.splasm.com/products/productdasher.html\r\n[remind]: http://www.roaringpenguin.com/penguin/open_source_remind.php\r\n[shellwatcher]: http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/developer/shellwatcher.html\r\n[remind_widget]: http://www.43folders.com/2005/06/dashboard_widge.html\r\n[down]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/14/gadget_flashback\r\n[notetaker]: http://homepage.mac.com/wis/Personal/programs/NoteTaker/NoteTaker.html\r\n[hipster]: http://www.hipsterpda.com/\r\n[zire]: http://www.palm.com/us/products/zire/\r\n[markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\r\n[crash]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/05/exocortex_stroke\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082876\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8157a5907b244071cda98ba5aa7a9635&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki\">Bill Seitz</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082876\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-08-09T13:50:46\">2005-08-09T13:50:46</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">So the focus in this posting is on the unstructured-note area, not on Address Books, Calendar, etc., right?\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure there's a little wiki that runs on Palm, just layering name-clickability on top of notes.\r\n\r\nI just got PikiPiki running on my Zaurus.

It&#39;s password protected (which works in iTunes, by the way), probably short-lived, certainly not condoned by anyone empowered to condone this sort of thing--and no, I&#39;m not sharing.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>By similar means, I&#39;ve acquired a slew of <a href=\"http://members.aol.com/jimfnshr/radio/x_minus_one.html\">X Minus One</a> and <a href=\"http://otrsite.com/logs/logd1013.htm\">Dimension X</a> episodes as MP3s.  I&#39;m tempted to make a BitTorrent-based podcast from those.  I&#39;m not at all certain about the legality, but I do know that I was thoroughly enjoying an &quot;old time radio&quot; audio stream of these shows all last Winter.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You know, I never knew that <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0132257/\">Bruce Campbell</a> had been in a remake of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119571/\">The Love Bug</a>.  It came up in an interview during <a href=\"http://www.sliceofscifi.com/archives/slice_of_sci-fi_015.html\">Slice of Scifi #15</a>, where they were grousing about all the recent remakes and he said something to the effect of &quot;That one&#39;s so old, even <em>I&#39;ve</em> done a remake of it...&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>So far, <a href=\"http://www.goodwordsrightorder.com/\">The Seanachai</a> has been brilliant.  I keep thinking I&#39;d really like to do a podcast like this, producing 5-15 minute weekly fiction segments.  Check out <a href=\"http://goodwordsrightorder.com/index.php?blog=2&#38;p=47&#38;more=1&#38;c=1&#38;tb=1&#38;pb=1#more47\">How to Succeed at Evil</a>...  It&#39;s like side stories from <a href=\"http://www.cs.rose-hulman.edu/~stinerkt/Tick.html\">The Tick</a>.

It's just streaming audio for god's sakes! It's not some strictly iPod-related technology, it's not *new* technology by any stretch of the imagination, and it's not a new compression scheme either.

My car doesn't get audio streams, nor do I when I'm out walking.  I also don't have to sit down and listen when the show happens to be on.\nYes, in the past, I've timeshifted / downloaded audio streams using some ripper tool and taken the cached stream with me.  But this time, I don't have to do anything-- it's timeshifted and cached to begin with.  This is what's different.\nAlso, you could say \"Hey, I put this MP3 up for download,\" but that'd be stupid.  Instead, push that notification in machine readable form into an RSS feed.  \nOn the other end, I have a machine (iTunes 4.9, most recently) that reads your feed and I don't have to pay attention and download anything myself-- it just shows up and I've got it by the time I think to look for it.  This is what's different.\nPut it all together, and you've got something that's actually a new thing.  It's a kind of subscription-based, timeshifted audio tech we didn't have before.  (At least, not for free.)\nIt's different enough that it needs a new word to hang the concept from-- thus, podcasting.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085038\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=665b78d0565078210ae9f72ed147a804&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Dan</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085038\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-28T01:16:18\">2005-07-28T01:16:18</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I do something similar to turn public radio RealAudio streams (All Things Considered, This American Life) into daily podcasts for ITunes 4.9.\ncron -> mplayer (with RealAudio DLLs) -> lame gives me the .mp3 file.\ncron -> wget (NPR website for show data) -> custom shell script builds the RSS file with description text\nScripts are quick and dirty but surprisingly reliable.

Of course, there's nothing wrong with new bottle's per se.  A convenient handle, easy-pour, easy open/close, more appealing packaging, better distribution whatever.\nI agree that podcasting is really nothing intrinsically *new*, other than the packaging and distribution, but in our consumer economy, packaging and distribution are everything.\nNote:  I see a lot of references to podcasts which do *not* involve the use of web feeds, such as \"Click here to download our podcast\", are these misuses of the term \"podcast\"?

    "body": "Listened to a few really good podcasts today...\r\n\r\n* [I've written about wanting this][before], but today I cobbled together an experimental podcast of the [Dr. Demento Show][demento] for myself using [cron][cron], [brag][brag], and [dirCaster][dircaster] on an old iBook-turned-server at home.  It's password protected (which works in iTunes, by the way), probably short-lived, certainly not condoned by anyone empowered to condone this sort of thing--and no, I'm not sharing.\r\n\r\n[cron]: http://www.unixgeeks.org/security/newbie/unix/cron-1.html2\r\n[demento]: http://www.drdemento.com/\r\n[brag]: http://brag.sourceforge.net/jindex.html\r\n[dircaster]: http://www.shadydentist.com/wordpress/software/dircaster\r\n[before]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/03/08/doctor_demento_as_podcast\r\n\r\n* By similar means, I've acquired a slew of [X Minus One][xm1] and [Dimension X][dx] episodes as MP3s.  I'm tempted to make a BitTorrent-based podcast from those.  I'm not at all certain about the legality, but I do know that I was thoroughly enjoying an \"old time radio\" audio stream of these shows all last Winter.\r\n\r\n[xm1]: http://members.aol.com/jimfnshr/radio/x_minus_one.html\r\n[dx]: http://otrsite.com/logs/logd1013.htm\r\n\r\n* You know, I never knew that [Bruce Campbell][bc] had been in a remake of [The Love Bug][bug].  It came up in an interview during [Slice of Scifi #15][sos15], where they were grousing about all the recent remakes and he said something to the effect of \"That one's so old, even *I've* done a remake of it...\"\r\n\r\n[bc]: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0132257/\r\n[bug]: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119571/\r\n[sos15]: http://www.sliceofscifi.com/archives/slice_of_sci-fi_015.html\r\n\r\n* So far, [The Seanachai][sean] has been brilliant.  I keep thinking I'd really like to do a podcast like this, producing 5-15 minute weekly fiction segments.  Check out [How to Succeed at Evil][evil]...  It's like side stories from [The Tick][tick].  I love the brain-in-a-jar Dalek-esque villain giving himself continual mild concussions as his grey matter repeatedly bumps up against the glass.

My car doesn't get audio streams, nor do I when I'm out walking.  I also don't have to sit down and listen when the show happens to be on.\r\n\r\nYes, in the past, I've timeshifted / downloaded audio streams using some ripper tool and taken the cached stream with me.  But this time, I don't have to do anything-- it's timeshifted and cached to begin with.  This is what's different.\r\n\r\nAlso, you could say \"Hey, I put this MP3 up for download,\" but that'd be stupid.  Instead, push that notification in machine readable form into an RSS feed.  \r\n\r\nOn the other end, I have a machine (iTunes 4.9, most recently) that reads your feed and I don't have to pay attention and download anything myself-- it just shows up and I've got it by the time I think to look for it.  This is what's different.\r\n\r\nPut it all together, and you've got something that's actually a new thing.  It's a kind of subscription-based, timeshifted audio tech we didn't have before.  (At least, not for free.)\r\n\r\nIt's different enough that it needs a new word to hang the concept from-- thus, podcasting.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085038\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=665b78d0565078210ae9f72ed147a804&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Dan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085038\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-28T01:16:18\">2005-07-28T01:16:18</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I do something similar to turn public radio RealAudio streams (All Things Considered, This American Life) into daily podcasts for ITunes 4.9.\r\n\r\ncron -> mplayer (with RealAudio DLLs) -> lame gives me the .mp3 file.\r\n\r\ncron -> wget (NPR website for show data) -> custom shell script builds the RSS file with description text\r\n\r\nScripts are quick and dirty but surprisingly reliable.

I&#39;d join Architecture Astronauts Anonymous--but that&#39;d be AAA, and we already use them for our car insurance. Anyway, here&#39;s my current trip into orbit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/tests.html\">http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/tests.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you click on that, you should see a page with a large textarea appear, in which a running log of tests begins.  So far, all but two of the tests succeed for me in Safari, FireFox, and MSIE6.  I&#39;ve got a bit more work to do on writing tests, though, as well as working on the server side.</p>\n<p>But, there are things going on behind the scenes in this test harness that I want to share right now before I fly off into space.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testing-with-ajax\">Testing with AJAX</h2>\n<p>First off, about a week ago, I mentioned an <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/an_experiment_in_rest_and_xml\">experiment in REST and XML</a> with which I was starting to play.  In a nutshell, it&#39;s a bastard hybrid between a wiki and an XML database, with a REST API.  Well, at the time, I was just poking at it with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/doc/log.txt\">invocations of cURL from the command line</a>.  </p>\n<p>But, my eventual goal was to get this thing hooked up with a browser via XMLHttpRequests and JavaScript.  Before just flying off to <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo_outliner_experiment\">wire up any UI demos</a>, though, I wanted to run it through some repeatable tests.  So first, I made my own XmlHTTPRequest wrapper:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/js/httpclient.js\">http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/js/httpclient.js</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, I went in search of unit testing frameworks for in-browser JavaScript.  I found a few neat things--including <a href=\"http://www.edwardh.com/jsunit/\">JsUnit</a>, <a href=\"http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/index.html\">Selenium</a>, and <a href=\"http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/\">httpunit</a>.</p>\n<p>But, none of these quite fulfilled my requirements of a) being simple, b) working well with code continuity broken by asynchronous HTTP requests, and c) being learned by me in an impatient jiffy.  So, I made this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/js/tests.js\">http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/js/tests.js</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#39;s by no means general or even all that nice to look at, but I&#39;ve got half a mind to further refactor this into my own AJAX-friendly mini-rendition of <a href=\"http://www.junit.org/index.htm\">JUnit</a>.  To anyone out there: Let me know if this would be useful, or if I&#39;m just wasting my time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"logging-in-browser-based-javascript\">Logging in Browser-based JavaScript</h2>\n<p>Along the way through reinventing my own testing wheel, I also got fed up with the usual ways I was used to generating debugging and informative messages from my JavaScript code.  So, I went off in search for something like <a href=\"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/\">Log4J</a> in Java or the <a href=\"http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-logging.html\">logging</a> module in Python.</p>\n<p>The closest I came was to <code>selenium-logging.js</code> in the <a href=\"http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/index.html\">Selenium</a> package, but that wasn&#39;t really what I wanted.  So, I made this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/js/log.js\">http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/js/log.js</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#39;s by no means general or even all that nice to look at, but I&#39;ve got half a mind to further expand this into my own JavaScript mini-rendition of <a href=\"http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-logging.html\">logging</a>.  Imagine logging from a browser-based JavaScript app to a server-based REST-ified syslog.  Seems like it <em>could</em> be useful, if done right.  To anyone out there: Let me know if this would be useful, or if I&#39;m just wasting my time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"but-wait-theres-more\">But wait, there&#39;s more...</h2>\n<p>I&#39;ll break off here and continue in another post with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/18/discovering_wsgi_and_xslt_as_middleware\">the server-side things I started doing with WSGI</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084940\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://codeswami.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0356c6e4c6151f59c9ffe67faad6e1b7&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://codeswami.com\">jm3</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084940\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-06T23:45:28\">2005-09-06T23:45:28</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">your js Log class is great for conventional, syslog-style logging, i.e. recording exceptional (client-side) events over time during lights-out operation. for the other type of commonly seen JS logging, viz. interactive \"alert debugging\", there's a neat approach that would be great to wire into your logger: the cache-and-bookmarklet approach [1]? all you do is cache log events locally in a browser in a buffer and then create a bookmarklet that reads and dumps the buffer into the page DOM or a popup, or an alert, etc. basically it's a multiline, on-demand trace console.\n[1] http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/07/03/bookmarklet-based-debugging/</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084941\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.opennms.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2a02f8818ce5a1b3edcbea9e24788885&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.opennms.org\">brozow</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084941\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-24T03:11:06\">2005-09-24T03:11:06</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Would love to see you enhance the AJAX testing stuff!!!\nThanks for what you've done so far!\nMatt</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084944\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://log4js.berlios.de/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=30375dd7e40b81bcee779f167b60aa78&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://log4js.berlios.de/\">Stephan Strittmatter</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084944\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-09T10:44:38\">2005-12-09T10:44:38</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Probably we could share our knowledge about logging?

Anyway, here's my current trip into orbit:\r\n\r\n[aa]: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html\r\n\r\n* [http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/tests.html](http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/tests.html)\r\n\r\nIf you click on that, you should see a page with a large textarea appear, in which a running log of tests begins.  So far, all but two of the tests succeed for me in Safari, FireFox, and MSIE6.  I've got a bit more work to do on writing tests, though, as well as working on the server side.\r\n\r\nBut, there are things going on behind the scenes in this test harness that I want to share right now before I fly off into space.\r\n\r\n## Testing with AJAX\r\n\r\nFirst off, about a week ago, I mentioned an [experiment in REST and XML][exp] with which I was starting to play.  In a nutshell, it's a bastard hybrid between a wiki and an XML database, with a REST API.  Well, at the time, I was just poking at it with [invocations of cURL from the command line][curl].  \r\n\r\nBut, my eventual goal was to get this thing hooked up with a browser via XMLHttpRequests and JavaScript.  Before just flying off to [wire up any UI demos][outliner], though, I wanted to run it through some repeatable tests.  So first, I made my own XmlHTTPRequest wrapper:\r\n\r\n* [http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/js/httpclient.js](http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/js/httpclient.js)\r\n\r\nThen, I went in search of unit testing frameworks for in-browser JavaScript.  I found a few neat things--including [JsUnit](http://www.edwardh.com/jsunit/), [Selenium][selenium], and [httpunit](http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/).\r\n\r\nBut, none of these quite fulfilled my requirements of a) being simple, b) working well with code continuity broken by asynchronous HTTP requests, and c) being learned by me in an impatient jiffy.  So, I made this:\r\n\r\n* [http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/js/tests.js](http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/js/tests.js)\r\n\r\nIt's by no means general or even all that nice to look at, but I've got half a mind to further refactor this into my own AJAX-friendly mini-rendition of [JUnit][junit].  To anyone out there: Let me know if this would be useful, or if I'm just wasting my time.\r\n\r\n[junit]: http://www.junit.org/index.htm\r\n[outliner]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/xoxo_outliner_experiment\r\n[curl]: http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/doc/log.txt\r\n[exp]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/12/an_experiment_in_rest_and_xml\r\n[selenium]: http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/index.html\r\n\r\n## Logging in Browser-based JavaScript\r\n\r\nAlong the way through reinventing my own testing wheel, I also got fed up with the usual ways I was used to generating debugging and informative messages from my JavaScript code.  So, I went off in search for something like [Log4J][log4j] in Java or the [logging][logging] module in Python.\r\n\r\nThe closest I came was to `selenium-logging.js` in the [Selenium][selenium] package, but that wasn't really what I wanted.  So, I made this:\r\n\r\n* [http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/js/log.js](http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/xmlwiki/www/js/log.js)\r\n\r\nIt's by no means general or even all that nice to look at, but I've got half a mind to further expand this into my own JavaScript mini-rendition of [logging][logging].  Imagine logging from a browser-based JavaScript app to a server-based REST-ified syslog.  Seems like it *could* be useful, if done right.  To anyone out there: Let me know if this would be useful, or if I'm just wasting my time.\r\n\r\n[log4j]: http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/\r\n[logging]: http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-logging.html\r\n\r\n## But wait, there's more...\r\n\r\nI'll break off here and continue in another post with [the server-side things I started doing with WSGI][next].\r\n\r\n[next]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/18/discovering_wsgi_and_xslt_as_middleware\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084940\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://codeswami.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0356c6e4c6151f59c9ffe67faad6e1b7&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://codeswami.com\">jm3</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084940\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-06T23:45:28\">2005-09-06T23:45:28</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">your js Log class is great for conventional, syslog-style logging, i.e. recording exceptional (client-side) events over time during lights-out operation. for the other type of commonly seen JS logging, viz. interactive \"alert debugging\", there's a neat approach that would be great to wire into your logger: the cache-and-bookmarklet approach [1]? all you do is cache log events locally in a browser in a buffer and then create a bookmarklet that reads and dumps the buffer into the page DOM or a popup, or an alert, etc. basically it's a multiline, on-demand trace console.\r\n\r\n[1] http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/07/03/bookmarklet-based-debugging/</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084941\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.opennms.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2a02f8818ce5a1b3edcbea9e24788885&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.opennms.org\">brozow</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084941\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-24T03:11:06\">2005-09-24T03:11:06</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Would love to see you enhance the AJAX testing stuff!!!\r\n\r\nThanks for what you've done so far!\r\n\r\nMatt</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084944\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://log4js.berlios.de/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=30375dd7e40b81bcee779f167b60aa78&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://log4js.berlios.de/\">Stephan Strittmatter</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084944\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-09T10:44:38\">2005-12-09T10:44:38</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Probably we could share our knowledge about logging?

Well, I do have to say that I&apos;ve recovered rather well from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/05/exocortex_stroke\">the &quot;stroke&quot;</a> last week.  Things have been pretty busy since then, so I haven&apos;t had much of a chance to blather any more around these parts.</p>\n<p>However, in the spirit of a few <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/drag_the_boxes_stretch_the_lines\">recent</a> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/07/02/css_treemaps\">experiments</a>, I have another demo for you.  Here&apos;s the URL of the latest work in progress / proof of concept:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/map-test/tree2.html\">http://www.decafbad.com/2005/07/map-test/tree2.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>What is it, you might ask before clicking a strange URL?  It&apos;s an outliner, in Javascript.  Or, rather, a first rough stab at one anyway.  It&apos;s got a long way to go, and there are indeed <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http://sproutliner.com/&amp;e=912\">better options out there already</a>, but I wanted to try making one myself.</p>\n<p>A quick summary of controls:  No mouse drag of items yet, but you can click on them to edit.  Use the up and down cursor keys to navigate through the outline.  Use shift along with the cursor keys to <em>shift</em> items around.  Use the control key along with the cursor keys to <em>control</em> visibility of child items.</p>\n<p><em>Update</em>: There&apos;re a few more things I didn&apos;t mention, as well as a few bug half-fixes.  Hitting return when the editor is on an existing item will insert a new blank item right after it.  Hitting shift-return will append a new child item to the current item.  Tab and shift-tab, as well as shift-right and shift-left, are supposed to indent and outdent items.  Unfortunately, they&apos;re not quite working yet and of course they semi-clobber other useful keyboard functions, so I&apos;m still feeling around for a good way to support these.</p>\n<p>The idea is that I want to unobtrusively drop some CSS and JavaScript into an HTML page with one or more <a href=\"http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/XOXO\">XOXO-style outlines</a>, magically turning them into in-browser outline editors.</p>\n<p>But, like I said, there&apos;s still lots of work to be done here, and I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;ve riddled this thing with circular references that will make your <a href=\"http://jibbering.com/faq/faq_notes/closures.html#clMem\">IE/Win combination leak like crazy</a>.  I just wanted to see if I could make something like this work, though.  And, roughly, it seems to do so in Safari and Firefox.</p>\n<p>The next part of this equation will be coming up soon, I think.  And that is: Okay, now that I&apos;ve created / edited an outline in my browser--how can I save it?  </p>\n"

    "html": "<p>So, this weekend, I suffered a sort of minor stroke in my exocortex.  The girl and I left for a bit to get food on Saturday afternoon and, when we got back, I found my PowerBook making grinding / growling noises from the general vicinity of its hard drive.  A reboot or two later, and the poor thing stopped bothering to spin up the drive and just sat there in blinking confusion looking for a System folder.</p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/17/are_powerbook_hard_drives_supposed_to_sound_like_amiga_floppy_drives\">if you&#39;ve been following along</a>, you might be thinking, &quot;Didn&#39;t he just go through this not too long ago?&quot;  If so, you&#39;d be right.  I&#39;m not sure what I do to these things, since <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/10/17/ooocoi\">I killed an iBook hard drive like this</a>, too.  I&#39;m very hesitant to blame Apple for this since, well, I&#39;m just really <em>not</em> a careful person when it comes to hardware.  I thank my lucky stars, so far, for AppleCare.</p>\n<p>The problem this time, though, is that the failure happened without warning.  The past two times, I had a bit of a gradual slide into failure with an agonizing period of intermittent function just long enough to evacuate some essentials onto another machine.  But this time, boom.  No warning.  And stupid me:  I deleted the backups I&#39;d made back <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/04/30/initial_tiger_thoughts\">when I upgraded to Tiger</a>.</p>\n<p>So, my last decent backup of anything is about a year old, from the last time I had a hard drive crash.  Thus, this feels a bit like a sound blow to the head.  I&#39;ve lost all my recent changes to my feed aggregator subscription list.  I&#39;ve lost all my Tinderbox documents.  I&#39;m still groping around for registration keys for all of my software.  The arrangement of tools I&#39;ve gotten used to being within finger-twitch range is now gone.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s been a long time since I had a serious failure in a machine I depend on where I didn&#39;t have a recovery plan.

Of course, <em>that</em> stuff got zipped up and uploaded to at least 3 locations on a weekly basis, so I was at least smartly paranoid about that.</p>\n<p>I guess this&#39;ll teach me though.  As soon as the PowerBook comes back, and I&#39;ve reconstructed my external headspace on it, I&#39;ll be setting up nightly backups to the basement file server and plan on doing monthly archival to DVD.

They put a different brand drive in with a little more room than the one that had come with my Powerbook and I've been quite happy since.\nThe point of the story is, the more and more people I talk to the more and more I hear the same story. It seems like there might be an issue with the hard drive's that come from Apple. Those that have used Applecare are invariably writing about recurrent issues. Those who have gone elsewhere for a new drive seem to be doing ok.\nAnd now I'm going to sit here hoping I just didn't jinx myself.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083298\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://trikuare.cx/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7d3d1e46aae8ca19855a6026d404b91d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://trikuare.cx/\">fluffy</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083298\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-06T01:33:11\">2005-07-06T01:33:11</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Ever since my media drive died I've done weekly backups of all my laptop's drives onto an external 300GB firewire drive which I bought specifically for backing up.

I started copying data from the 15\" to the 12\" left home for a while because it was estimated to take about 3 hours for the copy to happen. I came home and everything was fine, I mounted the 15\" drive onto my 12\" to copy anything I forgot and the drive was like all clunk, grind, clunk, clunk... I was all like huh? and then it died. It was 4 years old. I am thinking that Apple doesn't make machines like they used to. My old pismo is still a rock solid machine...</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "So, this weekend, I suffered a sort of minor stroke in my exocortex.  The girl and I left for a bit to get food on Saturday afternoon and, when we got back, I found my PowerBook making grinding / growling noises from the general vicinity of its hard drive.  A reboot or two later, and the poor thing stopped bothering to spin up the drive and just sat there in blinking confusion looking for a System folder.\r\n\r\nNow, [if you've been following along][lt], you might be thinking, \"Didn't he just go through this not too long ago?\"  If so, you'd be right.  I'm not sure what I do to these things, since [I killed an iBook hard drive like this][ib], too.  I'm very hesitant to blame Apple for this since, well, I'm just really *not* a careful person when it comes to hardware.  I thank my lucky stars, so far, for AppleCare.\r\n\r\nThe problem this time, though, is that the failure happened without warning.  The past two times, I had a bit of a gradual slide into failure with an agonizing period of intermittent function just long enough to evacuate some essentials onto another machine.  But this time, boom.  No warning.  And stupid me:  I deleted the backups I'd made back [when I upgraded to Tiger][tiger].\r\n\r\nSo, my last decent backup of anything is about a year old, from the last time I had a hard drive crash.  Thus, this feels a bit like a sound blow to the head.  I've lost all my recent changes to my feed aggregator subscription list.  I've lost all my Tinderbox documents.  I'm still groping around for registration keys for all of my software.  The arrangement of tools I've gotten used to being within finger-twitch range is now gone.\r\n\r\nIt's been a long time since I had a serious failure in a machine I depend on where I didn't have a recovery plan.  Ouch.  The two things that are keeping me from going entirely bonkers are:\r\n\r\n1. The girl never sold her old iBook and I turned it into a replacement for our ailing house Linux server, so I have a backup machine until the PowerBook comes back.\r\n2. I didn't lose this weekend's tinkerings because I shared them here.  \r\n\r\nAlso, it's lucky that I've turned in all the chapters and artwork for the book, because I'd've really been strolling off a cliff if I'd've had to recreate any of that work.  Of course, *that* stuff got zipped up and uploaded to at least 3 locations on a weekly basis, so I was at least smartly paranoid about that.\r\n\r\nI guess this'll teach me though.  As soon as the PowerBook comes back, and I've reconstructed my external headspace on it, I'll be setting up nightly backups to the basement file server and plan on doing monthly archival to DVD.  I can't imagine how lost I'd be if I were *really* living in my laptop.  :)\r\n\r\n[tiger]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/04/30/initial_tiger_thoughts\r\n[lt]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/17/are_powerbook_hard_drives_supposed_to_sound_like_amiga_floppy_drives\r\n[ib]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/10/17/ooocoi\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=exocortex_stroke\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083290\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://virtuallyshocking.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=066c167d7062108915aa0eb5dd59d8bf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://virtuallyshocking.com\">Brock Tice</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083290\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-05T12:14:10\">2005-07-05T12:14:10</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">\"I didn’t lose this weekend’s tinkerings because I shared them here.\"\r\n\r\nVery Linus Torvalds, as in, \r\n\r\n\"Only wimps use tape backup: real men just upload their important stuff on ftp, and let the rest of the world mirror it.\"</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083292\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.glennf.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c6aef8227056393525931c8677077126&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.glennf.com\">Glenn Fleishman</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083292\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-05T12:54:18\">2005-07-05T12:54:18</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Remember DriveSavers: they charge a fortune, but if a year's worth of missing data is worth as much as a few grand to you, they might be able to recover it.

    "summary": "<p>So, this weekend, I suffered a sort of minor stroke in my exocortex.  The girl and I left for a bit to get food on Saturday afternoon and, when we got back, I found my PowerBook making grinding / growling noises from the general vicinity of its hard drive.  A reboot or two later, and the poor thing stopped bothering to spin up the drive and just sat there in blinking confusion looking for a System folder.</p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/17/are_powerbook_hard_drives_supposed_to_sound_like_amiga_floppy_drives\">if you&apos;ve been following along</a>, you might be thinking, &quot;Didn&apos;t he just go through this not too long ago?&quot;  If so, you&apos;d be right.  I&apos;m not sure what I do to these things, since <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/10/17/ooocoi\">I killed an iBook hard drive like this</a>, too.  I&apos;m very hesitant to blame Apple for this since, well, I&apos;m just really <em>not</em> a careful person when it comes to hardware.  I thank my lucky stars, so far, for AppleCare.</p>\n<p>The problem this time, though, is that the failure happened without warning.  The past two times, I had a bit of a gradual slide into failure with an agonizing period of intermittent function just long enough to evacuate some essentials onto another machine.  But this time, boom.  No warning.  And stupid me:  I deleted the backups I&apos;d made back <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/04/30/initial_tiger_thoughts\">when I upgraded to Tiger</a>.</p>\n<p>So, my last decent backup of anything is about a year old, from the last time I had a hard drive crash.  Thus, this feels a bit like a sound blow to the head.  I&apos;ve lost all my recent changes to my feed aggregator subscription list.  I&apos;ve lost all my Tinderbox documents.  I&apos;m still groping around for registration keys for all of my software.  The arrangement of tools I&apos;ve gotten used to being within finger-twitch range is now gone.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s been a long time since I had a serious failure in a machine I depend on where I didn&apos;t have a recovery plan.  Ouch.  The two things that are keeping me from going entirely bonkers are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The girl never sold her old iBook and I turned it into a replacement for our ailing house Linux server, so I have a backup machine until the PowerBook comes back.</li>\n<li>I didn&apos;t lose this weekend&apos;s tinkerings because I shared them here.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, it&apos;s lucky that I&apos;ve turned in all the chapters and artwork for the book, because I&apos;d&apos;ve really been strolling off a cliff if I&apos;d&apos;ve had to recreate any of that work.  Of course, <em>that</em> stuff got zipped up and uploaded to at least 3 locations on a weekly basis, so I was at least smartly paranoid about that.</p>\n<p>I guess this&apos;ll teach me though.  As soon as the PowerBook comes back, and I&apos;ve reconstructed my external headspace on it, I&apos;ll be setting up nightly backups to the basement file server and plan on doing monthly archival to DVD.  I can&apos;t imagine how lost I&apos;d be if I were <em>really</em> living in my laptop.  :)</p>\n"

You can use a span whose style contains clear:both, or if you already have something which already goes after the list anyway you can set its style to clear:both\n2. You can use container-relative sizes (e.g. width:33% height:25%) or font-relative sizes (width:15em height:10em).  Then you have to know how big they'll be in advance, though, or else things might overflow the box, though if you set overflow:auto then you'll get a handy little scrollbar.

You can use a span whose style contains clear:both, or if you already have something which already goes after the list anyway you can set its style to clear:both\r\n\r\n2. You can use container-relative sizes (e.g. width:33% height:25%) or font-relative sizes (width:15em height:10em).  Then you have to know how big they'll be in advance, though, or else things might overflow the box, though if you set overflow:auto then you'll get a handy little scrollbar.  (note that this is also one of the more annoying places if you want to support IE since it uses totally different semantics than the W3C standards.  unfortunately, even a vendor as major as my employer needs to cater to our 70% IE userbase, which is REALLY annoying with some of the CSS/DHTML tricks I'm working with right now.)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082858\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://annevankesteren.nl/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=55d00c982dd73dcab2a1d2b0f68f8f9a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://annevankesteren.nl/\">Anne</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082858\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-07-03T05:48:13\">2005-07-03T05:48:13</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">For the first you can use generated content in combination with _height:1%; for Internet Explorer.

    "html": "<p>While I&#39;m thinking on the subject of common syndication feed frameworks, it occurred to me that it might be instructive to jot down some thoughts on one of the concerns at the root of my ideas for FeedReactor:  Shared feed fetching, caching, and storage.</p>\n<p>I wanted to build something that would intelligently handle all <a href=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2002/10/21/http_conditional_get_for_rss_hackers\">the issues</a> <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/tests/client/http/\">of HTTP</a> and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/25/dynamic_feed_scan_times\">feed</a> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/29/dynamic_polling_freq_too\">polling</a> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/11/26/polling_and_urgency\">schedules</a>, across all my apps, all in one spot--once and for all.  Maybe it wouldn&#39;t have quite that guarantee of finality, but I&#39;d <em>hope</em> to never directly perform an HTTP GET for a feed from one of my apps ever again.</p>\n<p>Toward that end, one of my primary requirements is this:  Once I&#39;ve acquired feed data, I need to store it in some form usable by my other programs and by some method as agnostic as possible toward the actual contents of the feed.  I want to preserve potential extension data, without needing prior knowledge of what that might be.  Extensions are one area where the fun stuff with syndication feeds will be taking off, and I&#39;ve wanted a foundation to support that.</p>\n<p>So, in my tinkering, I&#39;ve explored four main variations of storing feed data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fine-grained relational DB tables</li>\n<li>Triples in an RDF store</li>\n<li>XML database storage</li>\n<li>Coarse-grained persistence</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"feeds-in-relational-db-tables\">Feeds in relational DB tables</h3>\n<p>Mapping feed data to relational database tables seems to be the most common approach I&#39;ve seen in use by aggregators.  Another similar approach involves maintaining a persistent object model.  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb\">Syndication.framework</a>, <a href=\"http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2993\">NetNewsWire</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nongnu.org/straw/\">Straw</a>, and <a href=\"http://feedonfeeds.com/\">Feed on Feeds</a> all do something like this, more or less--and I&#39;m sure many others do, as well.   </p>\n<p>The idea is that the raw feed XML comes in, gets parsed, and then methodically dissected to populate columns in a table or properties of an object.  Since the table schema or class definition is planned out ahead of time, only feed data which conforms to this model gets preserved.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, an effort is made to &quot;expose all possible data&quot;, <a href=\"http://www.feedparser.org/docs/namespace-handling.html\">ala the Universal Feed Parser</a>.  But, this is really only practical if your objects are particularly dynamic--and even then <a href=\"http://bitsko.slc.ut.us/blog/rdf-longhorn.html\">you&#39;ll run into issues</a>, depending on just what shows up in a given feed.  But, if you don&#39;t really care much about anything all that exotic in feeds beyond title / link / description, this approach might work out just fine.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feeds-as-rdf-triples\">Feeds as RDF triples</h3>\n<p>But if you do care about extension data, and if you&#39;re going to go through all that trouble of dissecting a feed, you might as well have a sufficiently granular and flexible repository to dump it.  So, how about an RDF triple store?  The underlying model behind RDF can capture anything you can throw at it from syndication feed structures.  In fact, RSS 1.0 and all of its extension modules <em>are</em> serialized RDF data.</p>\n<p>Here, though, the issue isn&#39;t so much a matter of signal loss because pieces don&#39;t fit the model.  Instead, the issue is more akin to an impedance mismatch:  </p>\n<p>Do you try to transliterate pieces of RSS 2.0 and Atom 0.x feeds into RSS 1.0 parts?  Or do you <a href=\"http://semtext.org/atom/\">recast a feed format like Atom as an RDF vocabulary</a>?  Then, what do you do about all the mostly similar yet slightly different feed bits floating around as triples (i.e. RSS 1.0 vs Atom OWL)?  And, don&#39;t even get me started on all the annoyances involved in dismembering and reassembling arrangements of triples--although that&#39;s more a function of a particular RDF toolkit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feeds-in-an-xml-database\">Feeds in an XML database</h3>\n<p>Admittedly, I haven&#39;t done as much as I&#39;d like with feeds in an XML database--such as <a href=\"http://www.sleepycat.com/products/xml.shtml\">Berkeley DB XML</a>.  In part, that&#39;s been because the various packages have either just been too frustratingly dog-slow or nigh-impossible to get built and running on my OS X development machine.  </p>\n<p>One of the main benefits to this approach--on paper, anyway--is that the feed data stays intact in in the original format as XML.  It doesn&#39;t get dismembered, recast, rearranged, or exposed to much of anything that would put any exotic cargo it carries at risk.</p>\n<p>But, I think I&#39;ve got more playing to do with this option.  Although the opportunity to play much more with XSLT, XPath, and XQuery are attractive to me--this seems like potential overkill.  And, whereas the previous two approaches can accommodate a little <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/01/22/dive-into-xml.html\">liberal parsing</a>, this approach requires valid feeds.  So, here I&#39;ll need to pull in some repair kit tools to normalize and tidy any broken / soupy feeds.  Or, if I&#39;m feeling particularly annoyed, I can just <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/01/08/postels-law\">ignore Postel&#39;s Law</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#dt-wfc\">pound my fist on the spec</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feeds-in-coarse-grained-persistence\">Feeds in coarse-grained persistence</h3>\n<p>The notion which brought me to this final approach toward storing feed data  goes something like <a href=\"http://www.tbradford.org/2005/06/advanced-revelation.html\">what this guy wrote</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The biggest design mistake of dbXML was making it an XML database. The problem with XML databases is that they store XML, and the problems with XML are too numerous to go into here. Let&#39;s just say that processing XML in a native fashion in the database engine itself is a fool&#39;s errand, and leads to far too many potential external dependency problems to be worthwhile. If you&#39;re doing anything but the simplest of stripped down document storage, It&#39;s a much wiser approach to simply store the XML text in a BLOB, delegating the work of schema checking and external entity processing to a higher layer of your system. Otherwise, you can bet your ass that at some point in the feature, when you can least afford for it to happen, something is going to break.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, in FeedReactor, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/kwiki/index.cgi?FeedReactorDataModel\">that&#39;s pretty much what I did</a>.  I took Atom feeds and chopped them up into coarse feed and entry chunks, squirreled them away as blobs in a database table, along with a few select columns extracted from the XML data and indexed for easier future retrieval.  </p>\n<p>Other than digging for the feed start/end tags and element start/end tags, as well as using a few XPaths to extract those indexed columns, the feed store didn&#39;t do anything else other than stow away the XML source.  I left any further handling of the feed data up to XSL and REST API client apps.  </p>\n<p>Of course, FeedReactor has been sleeping for quite awhile now, so this is more an idea and an intention than a successfully demonstrated approach.  But, I was eating this dogfood as my main aggregator for the better part of a year, so I think it still has potential.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-what-now\">So, what now?</h3>\n<p>I&#39;m not sure what quite to do with feeds in a shared way, now and for the future.  Sticking things in a relational database is pretty quick, but very lossy.  Using RDF seems very flexible, but often not too quick or all that friendly.  Calling in an XML database seems like a &quot;good&quot; idea, but my spider sense is tingling.  And finally, chopping feeds up into coarse, vaguely indexed chunks seems less lossy, but not all that elegant.</p>\n<p>All in all, maybe it&#39;s just enough to download and cache the raw feeds.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ll post this now, but I&#39;m still thinking about all of this...</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090388\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dannyayers.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7028f422ca6da0180de6c9d922a3228f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dannyayers.com\">Danny</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090388\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-29T04:29:39\">2005-06-29T04:29:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I'm very much looking forward to hearing what you come up with. \nRather predictably I'm opting for the RDF store approach, but that's not to say the other approaches don't have their merits. Jon Udell (search his blog) has done some interesting work with feed data stored as XML, basically using XPath as the query language. It works, but I would suggest that he's tied to the XML structure too much. A year ago I might have gone for a hybrid RDF/RDBMS approach, with the core RSS material being contained in fixed tables bridged across to an RDF interface (somehow) to allow FOAF etc. But two factors put me off that idea now - the RSS 2.0 extensions that have appeared in recent weeks and SPARQL! Having a SQL-like query language that can be used against an RDF store (with XSLT-able results) really does simplify matters. Performance is likely to be an issue but I'm hoping a bit of filtering & caching will help there. I'm getting feed data into the store currently using XSLT (to RDF/XML), it's ok but the setup I've got could be a lot more modular.\nI think Microsoft have got things partly right in their RSS Longhorn architecture, separating out the \"Sync Engine\". But in the data handling there's heavy use of objects, which I don't think should be needed when you can do things declaratively using SQL or SPARQL.

    "body": "While I'm thinking on the subject of common syndication feed frameworks, it occurred to me that it might be instructive to jot down some thoughts on one of the concerns at the root of my ideas for FeedReactor:  Shared feed fetching, caching, and storage.\r\n\r\nI wanted to build something that would intelligently handle all [the issues][h1] [of HTTP][h2] and [feed][s1] [polling][s2] [schedules][s3], across all my apps, all in one spot--once and for all.  Maybe it wouldn't have quite that guarantee of finality, but I'd *hope* to never directly perform an HTTP GET for a feed from one of my apps ever again.\r\n\r\n[h1]: http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2002/10/21/http_conditional_get_for_rss_hackers\r\n[h2]: http://diveintomark.org/tests/client/http/\r\n[s1]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/25/dynamic_feed_scan_times\r\n[s2]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/29/dynamic_polling_freq_too\r\n[s3]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/11/26/polling_and_urgency\r\n\r\nToward that end, one of my primary requirements is this:  Once I've acquired feed data, I need to store it in some form usable by my other programs and by some method as agnostic as possible toward the actual contents of the feed.  I want to preserve potential extension data, without needing prior knowledge of what that might be.  Extensions are one area where the fun stuff with syndication feeds will be taking off, and I've wanted a foundation to support that.\r\n\r\nSo, in my tinkering, I've explored four main variations of storing feed data:\r\n\r\n1. Fine-grained relational DB tables\r\n2. Triples in an RDF store\r\n3. XML database storage\r\n4. Coarse-grained persistence\r\n\r\n### Feeds in relational DB tables\r\n\r\nMapping feed data to relational database tables seems to be the most common approach I've seen in use by aggregators.  Another similar approach involves maintaining a persistent object model.  [Syndication.framework][synd], [NetNewsWire][nnw], [Straw][straw], and [Feed on Feeds][fof] all do something like this, more or less--and I'm sure many others do, as well.   \r\n\r\n[synd]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/28/safarirssdb\r\n[fof]: http://feedonfeeds.com/\r\n[nnw]: http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2993\r\n[straw]: http://www.nongnu.org/straw/\r\n\r\nThe idea is that the raw feed XML comes in, gets parsed, and then methodically dissected to populate columns in a table or properties of an object.  Since the table schema or class definition is planned out ahead of time, only feed data which conforms to this model gets preserved.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, an effort is made to \"expose all possible data\", [ala the Universal Feed Parser][ufp].  But, this is really only practical if your objects are particularly dynamic--and even then [you'll run into issues][nxm], depending on just what shows up in a given feed.  But, if you don't really care much about anything all that exotic in feeds beyond title / link / description, this approach might work out just fine.\r\n\r\n[ufp]: http://www.feedparser.org/docs/namespace-handling.html\r\n[nxm]: http://bitsko.slc.ut.us/blog/rdf-longhorn.html\r\n\r\n### Feeds as RDF triples\r\n\r\nBut if you do care about extension data, and if you're going to go through all that trouble of dissecting a feed, you might as well have a sufficiently granular and flexible repository to dump it.  So, how about an RDF triple store?  The underlying model behind RDF can capture anything you can throw at it from syndication feed structures.  In fact, RSS 1.0 and all of its extension modules *are* serialized RDF data.\r\n\r\nHere, though, the issue isn't so much a matter of signal loss because pieces don't fit the model.  Instead, the issue is more akin to an impedance mismatch:  \r\n\r\nDo you try to transliterate pieces of RSS 2.0 and Atom 0.x feeds into RSS 1.0 parts?  Or do you [recast a feed format like Atom as an RDF vocabulary][atomowl]?  Then, what do you do about all the mostly similar yet slightly different feed bits floating around as triples (i.e. RSS 1.0 vs Atom OWL)?  And, don't even get me started on all the annoyances involved in dismembering and reassembling arrangements of triples--although that's more a function of a particular RDF toolkit.\r\n\r\n[atomowl]: http://semtext.org/atom/\r\n\r\n### Feeds in an XML database\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, I haven't done as much as I'd like with feeds in an XML database--such as [Berkeley DB XML][dbxml].  In part, that's been because the various packages have either just been too frustratingly dog-slow or nigh-impossible to get built and running on my OS X development machine.  \r\n\r\n[dbxml]: http://www.sleepycat.com/products/xml.shtml\r\n\r\nOne of the main benefits to this approach--on paper, anyway--is that the feed data stays intact in in the original format as XML.  It doesn't get dismembered, recast, rearranged, or exposed to much of anything that would put any exotic cargo it carries at risk.\r\n\r\nBut, I think I've got more playing to do with this option.  Although the opportunity to play much more with XSLT, XPath, and XQuery are attractive to me--this seems like potential overkill.  And, whereas the previous two approaches can accommodate a little [liberal parsing][liberal], this approach requires valid feeds.  So, here I'll need to pull in some repair kit tools to normalize and tidy any broken / soupy feeds.  Or, if I'm feeling particularly annoyed, I can just [ignore Postel's Law][plaw] and [pound my fist on the spec][xspec].\r\n\r\n[plaw]: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/01/08/postels-law\r\n[xspec]: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#dt-wfc\r\n[liberal]: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/01/22/dive-into-xml.html\r\n\r\n### Feeds in coarse-grained persistence\r\n\r\nThe notion which brought me to this final approach toward storing feed data  goes something like [what this guy wrote][dbmiss]:\r\n\r\n> The biggest design mistake of dbXML was making it an XML database. The problem with XML databases is that they store XML, and the problems with XML are too numerous to go into here. Let's just say that processing XML in a native fashion in the database engine itself is a fool's errand, and leads to far too many potential external dependency problems to be worthwhile. If you're doing anything but the simplest of stripped down document storage, It's a much wiser approach to simply store the XML text in a BLOB, delegating the work of schema checking and external entity processing to a higher layer of your system. Otherwise, you can bet your ass that at some point in the feature, when you can least afford for it to happen, something is going to break.\r\n\r\nSo, in FeedReactor, [that's pretty much what I did][frmodel].  I took Atom feeds and chopped them up into coarse feed and entry chunks, squirreled them away as blobs in a database table, along with a few select columns extracted from the XML data and indexed for easier future retrieval.  \r\n\r\nOther than digging for the feed start/end tags and element start/end tags, as well as using a few XPaths to extract those indexed columns, the feed store didn't do anything else other than stow away the XML source.  I left any further handling of the feed data up to XSL and REST API client apps.  \r\n\r\nOf course, FeedReactor has been sleeping for quite awhile now, so this is more an idea and an intention than a successfully demonstrated approach.  But, I was eating this dogfood as my main aggregator for the better part of a year, so I think it still has potential.\r\n\r\n[frmodel]: http://www.decafbad.com/kwiki/index.cgi?FeedReactorDataModel\r\n[dbmiss]: http://www.tbradford.org/2005/06/advanced-revelation.html\r\n\r\n### So, what now?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what quite to do with feeds in a shared way, now and for the future.  Sticking things in a relational database is pretty quick, but very lossy.  Using RDF seems very flexible, but often not too quick or all that friendly.  Calling in an XML database seems like a \"good\" idea, but my spider sense is tingling.  And finally, chopping feeds up into coarse, vaguely indexed chunks seems less lossy, but not all that elegant.\r\n\r\nAll in all, maybe it's just enough to download and cache the raw feeds.\r\n\r\nI'll post this now, but I'm still thinking about all of this...\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090388\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dannyayers.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7028f422ca6da0180de6c9d922a3228f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dannyayers.com\">Danny</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090388\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-29T04:29:39\">2005-06-29T04:29:39</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I'm very much looking forward to hearing what you come up with. \r\n\r\nRather predictably I'm opting for the RDF store approach, but that's not to say the other approaches don't have their merits. Jon Udell (search his blog) has done some interesting work with feed data stored as XML, basically using XPath as the query language. It works, but I would suggest that he's tied to the XML structure too much. A year ago I might have gone for a hybrid RDF/RDBMS approach, with the core RSS material being contained in fixed tables bridged across to an RDF interface (somehow) to allow FOAF etc. But two factors put me off that idea now - the RSS 2.0 extensions that have appeared in recent weeks and SPARQL! Having a SQL-like query language that can be used against an RDF store (with XSLT-able results) really does simplify matters. Performance is likely to be an issue but I'm hoping a bit of filtering & caching will help there. I'm getting feed data into the store currently using XSLT (to RDF/XML), it's ok but the setup I've got could be a lot more modular.\r\n\r\nI think Microsoft have got things partly right in their RSS Longhorn architecture, separating out the \"Sync Engine\". But in the data handling there's heavy use of objects, which I don't think should be needed when you can do things declaratively using SQL or SPARQL. Their object model is limited, I can guarantee that'll turn into a big ball of mud ;-)\r\n\r\nWhat I'm intrigued by is the potential for using multiple stores on different hosts. My immediate target being a fairly big aggregator/store on a remote server and a shiny-GUI client tool with more limited storage that selectively addresses the remote store.

Because, I&#39;ve never seen anything announced by Apple which would suggest an architecture like the one proposed for RSS in Longhorn.  However, he did mention something called <code>Syndication.framework</code>.  And, indeed, there appear to be interesting things under this path in Mac OS X Tiger:</p>\n<p>  /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Syndication.framework</p>\n<p>And, the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/InternetWeb/SafariRSS.html\">Safari RSS Developer Release Notes</a> mention the <code>SyndicationAgent</code> application as a part of that Framework.  So, I wonder how open this framework is for use by other applications?  I wonder in what format are its databases under <code>~/Library/Syndication</code>?  (Code Data ?

Windows 95 enabled the mass migration to an internet enabled world that we have today.\r\n\r\n### Syndication.framework already here, in Mac OS X Tiger?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, [Jens Alfke][softed] posted (and later retracted) about Microsoft's newly announced RSS support being nothing more than a copy of Apple's work on Safari RSS.\r\n\r\nHe may have just been grousing based on screenshots, though.  Because, I've never seen anything announced by Apple which would suggest an architecture like the one proposed for RSS in Longhorn.  However, he did mention something called `Syndication.framework`.  And, indeed, there appear to be interesting things under this path in Mac OS X Tiger:\r\n\r\n  /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Syndication.framework\r\n\r\nAnd, the [Safari RSS Developer Release Notes][srss] mention the `SyndicationAgent` application as a part of that Framework.  So, I wonder how open this framework is for use by other applications?  I wonder in what format are its databases under `~/Library/Syndication`?  (Code Data ? SQLite?)\r\n\r\n[srss]: http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/InternetWeb/SafariRSS.html\r\n[mina]: http://wroxblog.typepad.com/minatel/2005/06/microsoft_rss_l.html\r\n[arch]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/understanding/rss/rsslonghorn/#architecture\r\n[prev]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/25/microsoft_rss_godzilla_tiptoes_into_tokyo\r\n[sle]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/rss/simplefeedextensions/\r\n[softed]: http://mooseyard.com/Jens/index.php\r\n[response]: http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/archive/2005/06/25/432686.aspx\r\n[phil]: http://philringnalda.com/blog/2005/06/ms_embraces_rss.php\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085617\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://diveintomark.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=357a20e8c56e69d6f9734d23ef9517e8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://diveintomark.org/\">Mark</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085617\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-29T16:57:30\">2005-06-29T16:57:30</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">> I doubt I barely rate as a C-list blogger in the 'sphere as a whole, so that anyone bothered to contact little old me seems unexpected as well.\r\n\r\nI got that email as well, and I've been out of the community for almost a year.

The IT admins of tomorrow are the kids with more time than money of today.  \nThey'll be happy to buy a mod chip for their Dell that will allow them to dual-boot between Windows and OS X.  Then, in theory, they'll love it so much that when their parents get them a computer for college OS X will be a requirement, and guess who will get that sale?\nAfter college when they're wrangling a bunch of desktop users and are asked what to buy, they'll be familiar with OS X and be able to recommend it where it makes sense.\nOS X on the enterprise desktop in 5-10 years, if kids are able to pirate OS X at home next year.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088712\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=747d53109205f8b601078cb4df5bd75b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">peter</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088712\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-24T22:37:49\">2005-06-24T22:37:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I honestly think if it's possible to patch the installer in such a way that the dongle is totally taken out of the equation, it might hurt Apple's bottom line.  Yes, lots and lots of people pay for Windows when they buy a new machine, but I also know TONS of people who hook up their non-techie friends/family with pirated copies on a beige box.  MS is trying to fight the piracy of Windows in Asia and other markets.  If it wasn't hurting their bottom line, they wouldn't give a shit.\nI was kind of hoping they'd introduce some sort of really funky architecture that would make it impossible for the OS to run on anything else.  Overpriced as it is, I've always loved the fact that Apple \"owned\" the hardware, and everything just works.  From what we've seen from Steve, I'm 90% sure this will continue to be the case (whether or not people start installing it on beige boxes), but I still worry about the possibility of Apple having to cowtow(sp?) to the latest trends in Intel architecture, making it not \"just work\" anymore.\nI have to admit, the fact that people can install XP out of the box on the dev machines makes me a bit nervous.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088713\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb7f2a3ba74af37415ab7df101a86c75&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088713\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-24T23:30:12\">2005-06-24T23:30:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">peter: I'm not worried about Win-on-Mac and I still don't think OSX-on-Beige is a problem.  \nApple *does* still own the hardware configuration, even if it's composed from off-the-shelf parts.  And, since they're not catering to anyone but themselves, Apple will only write drivers and offer support for their narrow bands of hardware configuration.\nWindows may run on it, but that's actually one of its Achilles' Heels: Windows has to support every off the wall jumble of whacky hardware.  It's in Windows job description to not be picky about hardware.\nBut, unless you manage to assemble the particular combination of components which make up an Intel Mac, you're sunk with respect to OS X.  And, in the end, putting together *that exact PC config* will likely be just enough trouble to most people to make it worth just buying a ready-made Mac.\nSure, some enterprising tinkerers will find ways to hack the DRM and make drivers for their favorite components.  But, those drivers will  always be unsupported, and they'll ultimately suck.\nYou'll always have that one motherboard that it never runs on, and that other video card that'll never go above 800x600, that sound card that won't do anything but make shrill whistles, and so on.

But, don't expect to get a seriously usable OS X system on anything other than what Apple supports.\r\n\r\n[macintel]: http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0506intelmac.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088711\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7d1c8d2b1a7643236a4661e9a974dee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\">George Hotelling</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088711\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-24T11:49:06\">2005-06-24T11:49:06</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I think Apple would benefit strongly from not trying too hard to force people onto their hardware.

Then, in theory, they'll love it so much that when their parents get them a computer for college OS X will be a requirement, and guess who will get that sale?\r\n\r\nAfter college when they're wrangling a bunch of desktop users and are asked what to buy, they'll be familiar with OS X and be able to recommend it where it makes sense.\r\n\r\nOS X on the enterprise desktop in 5-10 years, if kids are able to pirate OS X at home next year.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088712\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=747d53109205f8b601078cb4df5bd75b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">peter</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088712\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-24T22:37:49\">2005-06-24T22:37:49</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I honestly think if it's possible to patch the installer in such a way that the dongle is totally taken out of the equation, it might hurt Apple's bottom line.  Yes, lots and lots of people pay for Windows when they buy a new machine, but I also know TONS of people who hook up their non-techie friends/family with pirated copies on a beige box.  MS is trying to fight the piracy of Windows in Asia and other markets.  If it wasn't hurting their bottom line, they wouldn't give a shit.\r\n\r\nI was kind of hoping they'd introduce some sort of really funky architecture that would make it impossible for the OS to run on anything else.  Overpriced as it is, I've always loved the fact that Apple \"owned\" the hardware, and everything just works.  From what we've seen from Steve, I'm 90% sure this will continue to be the case (whether or not people start installing it on beige boxes), but I still worry about the possibility of Apple having to cowtow(sp?) to the latest trends in Intel architecture, making it not \"just work\" anymore.\r\n\r\nI have to admit, the fact that people can install XP out of the box on the dev machines makes me a bit nervous.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088713\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb7f2a3ba74af37415ab7df101a86c75&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088713\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-24T23:30:12\">2005-06-24T23:30:12</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">peter: I'm not worried about Win-on-Mac and I still don't think OSX-on-Beige is a problem.  \r\n\r\nApple *does* still own the hardware configuration, even if it's composed from off-the-shelf parts.  And, since they're not catering to anyone but themselves, Apple will only write drivers and offer support for their narrow bands of hardware configuration.\r\n\r\nWindows may run on it, but that's actually one of its Achilles' Heels: Windows has to support every off the wall jumble of whacky hardware.  It's in Windows job description to not be picky about hardware.\r\n\r\nBut, unless you manage to assemble the particular combination of components which make up an Intel Mac, you're sunk with respect to OS X.  And, in the end, putting together *that exact PC config* will likely be just enough trouble to most people to make it worth just buying a ready-made Mac.\r\n\r\nSure, some enterprising tinkerers will find ways to hack the DRM and make drivers for their favorite components.  But, those drivers will  always be unsupported, and they'll ultimately suck.\r\n\r\nYou'll always have that one motherboard that it never runs on, and that other video card that'll never go above 800x600, that sound card that won't do anything but make shrill whistles, and so on.  And these are all the things I left behind when I gave up attaching monitors to my Linux boxes.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088714\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb7f2a3ba74af37415ab7df101a86c75&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088714\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-24T23:33:36\">2005-06-24T23:33:36</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">george:  Hmm, yeah, that's a good point.

In any case, more tinkering to be done...\r\n\r\n\r\n[flooterbuck]: http://flooterbuck.sourceforge.net/\r\n[decafbot]: aim:goim?Screenname=decafbot&Message=help+index\r\n[infobot]: http://www.infobot.org\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086940\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://suttree.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=6bb123eda79aeb10b804c6d4c643f69e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://suttree.com\">duncan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086940\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-24T09:43:36\">2005-06-24T09:43:36</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">If you're interested in a Python bot, I can recommend Grokitbot (and not just because I wrote it):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.suttree.com/code/GrokItBot/</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086941\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://singe.rucus.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=70f4c3580e61128421cd3899a2dcf6f1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://singe.rucus.net/\">Dominic White</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086941\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-26T15:37:38\">2005-06-26T15:37:38</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">There has been a rewrite of infobot called Knab, it is far more extensible and can do much that you have done with decafbot nativley.

It may or may not be online depending on how stable the rig is and how tolerant AIM&#39;s flood/spam triggers are.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve always been a fan of <code>purl</code> on the <code>#perl</code> IRC channel, so maybe I can try turning this little infobot into something useful.  At any rate, it was a quick hack involving two installs via DarwinPorts and a few config file tweaks.  So, send an IM on the AIM network to <a href=\"aim:goim?Screenname=decafbot&Message=help\"><code>decafbot</code></a> and see what happens.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Today&#39;s not-so-fun trick?  (Well, the past 2 weeks&#39; not-so-fun...)</p>\n<p>Imagine a crazy crapstorm web app project which features allowing visitors to upload pictures, presumably from their digital cameras.  Ignore for the moment any details of feasibility, scope, timing, or resource planning.</p>\n<p>Oh, and you&#39;re stuck working with classic ASP 3.0.  You have no access to write to the file system on the production web server, and you&#39;ve been told not to stick big things in the database tables--like photos from digital cameras, for instance.  Also, did I mention that you can&#39;t register any new DLLs on the production servers?  At least, not without the consultation of a committee who only meets every quarter or so.  Oh, and did I mention this was due last week?</p>\n<p>So, you&#39;ve got to <em>somehow</em> capture those images and the accompanying metadata and stash it all <em>somewhere</em>, despite being denied a filesystem or a database.  What to do, what to do?  Oh, I know: let&#39;s email all this crap off to an inbox somewhere that something (or someone (<em>sorry, intern</em>)) will be able to batch process!</p>\n<p>Great!  Except, well... er...  ASP 3.0 doesn&#39;t really particularly like processing forms with file uploads.  In fact, it doesn&#39;t support it at all.  Luckily, I was able to find some code <a href=\"http://aspzone.com/articles/160.aspx\">implementing file upload handling in pure VBScript</a>, although I had to scrape it off the HTML page itself since the .zip file had gone missing.</p>\n<p>With that, then, you can actually accept the form submission.  Now, how to fire off an email with the image as an attachment?  The only email support we have available is <a href=\"http://www.mostlylucid.co.uk/archive/2003/10/15/589.aspx\">CDONTS.DLL</a>, and it appears to only offer some support for attachments which are available in the filesystem--and all we have here is a stream of bytes in memory.  </p>\n<p>So, armed with a pure-ASP implementation of <a href=\"http://www.freevbcode.com/ShowCode.asp?ID=5248\">base64</a> and a decent understanding of SMTP and RFCs, I forged ahead to piece together a MIME multipart email the hard way in VBScript.  Remember to line break your stream of base64-encoded binary at 75 columns, and you&#39;ll need to trick CDONTS to allow you to inject a <code>Content-Type: multipart/mixed</code> header into the mix, and you&#39;re off!</p>\n<p>Whew... and, believe it or not, it all works.  I almost wish I could share the source code, ignoring that it&#39;s implemented with an obsolete set of technologies and that it&#39;s certainly not the prettiest code in the world.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086027\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rasterweb.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rasterweb.net/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086027\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-22T20:02:05\">2005-06-22T20:02:05</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">After \"classic ASP 3.0\" I just kept mutter \"poor bastard\" and couldn't even muster up the courage to read on.

At any rate, it was a quick hack involving two installs via DarwinPorts and a few config file tweaks.  So, send an IM on the AIM network to <a href=\"aim:goim?Screenname=decafbot&Message=help\">`decafbot`</a> and see what happens.\r\n\r\n[ib]: http://infobot.sourceforge.net\r\n[bb]: http://www.bitlbee.org/\r\n\r\n* Today's not-so-fun trick?  (Well, the past 2 weeks' not-so-fun...)\r\n\r\n  Imagine a crazy crapstorm web app project which features allowing visitors to upload pictures, presumably from their digital cameras.  Ignore for the moment any details of feasibility, scope, timing, or resource planning.\r\n\r\n  Oh, and you're stuck working with classic ASP 3.0.  You have no access to write to the file system on the production web server, and you've been told not to stick big things in the database tables--like photos from digital cameras, for instance.  Also, did I mention that you can't register any new DLLs on the production servers?  At least, not without the consultation of a committee who only meets every quarter or so.  Oh, and did I mention this was due last week?\r\n\r\n  So, you've got to *somehow* capture those images and the accompanying metadata and stash it all *somewhere*, despite being denied a filesystem or a database.  What to do, what to do?  Oh, I know: let's email all this crap off to an inbox somewhere that something (or someone (*sorry, intern*)) will be able to batch process!\r\n\r\n  Great!  Except, well... er...  ASP 3.0 doesn't really particularly like processing forms with file uploads.  In fact, it doesn't support it at all.  Luckily, I was able to find some code [implementing file upload handling in pure VBScript][file], although I had to scrape it off the HTML page itself since the .zip file had gone missing.\r\n\r\n  With that, then, you can actually accept the form submission.  Now, how to fire off an email with the image as an attachment?  The only email support we have available is [CDONTS.DLL][cdonts], and it appears to only offer some support for attachments which are available in the filesystem--and all we have here is a stream of bytes in memory.  \r\n\r\n  So, armed with a pure-ASP implementation of [base64][] and a decent understanding of SMTP and RFCs, I forged ahead to piece together a MIME multipart email the hard way in VBScript.  Remember to line break your stream of base64-encoded binary at 75 columns, and you'll need to trick CDONTS to allow you to inject a `Content-Type: multipart/mixed` header into the mix, and you're off!\r\n\r\n  Whew... and, believe it or not, it all works.  I almost wish I could share the source code, ignoring that it's implemented with an obsolete set of technologies and that it's certainly not the prettiest code in the world.\r\n\r\n[base64]: http://www.freevbcode.com/ShowCode.asp?ID=5248\r\n[file]: http://aspzone.com/articles/160.aspx\r\n[cdonts]: http://www.mostlylucid.co.uk/archive/2003/10/15/589.aspx\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086027\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086027\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-22T20:02:05\">2005-06-22T20:02:05</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">After \"classic ASP 3.0\" I just kept mutter \"poor bastard\" and couldn't even muster up the courage to read on.

Awesome :)\nJust to beat my own geeky chest a bit, back in college I started to write my own BBS system. On my Radio Shack Color Computer (1MHz 6809, 64K of RAM). With floppy disks (2 double-sided 5-1/4\" 80-track drives, no HD). And a manually operated 300baud modem (I hacked auto-answer by running the ring signal to a joystick port). And I was basically writing my own customized file system to implement a fixed-size message queue that would automatically drop out the oldest messages.

Awesome :)\r\n\r\nJust to beat my own geeky chest a bit, back in college I started to write my own BBS system. On my Radio Shack Color Computer (1MHz 6809, 64K of RAM). With floppy disks (2 double-sided 5-1/4\" 80-track drives, no HD). And a manually operated 300baud modem (I hacked auto-answer by running the ring signal to a joystick port). And I was basically writing my own customized file system to implement a fixed-size message queue that would automatically drop out the oldest messages. In BASIC.\r\n\r\nI was probably about 80% done before some other project distracted me from finishing it :)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090902\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=41961d4385a56ed0724cb621b8814125&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090902\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-17T15:18:54\">2005-06-17T15:18:54</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Congratulations Les!

    "html": "<p>I was just snooping through the installer package for Nathan Yergler&#39;s <a href=\"http://yergler.net/projects/cc-spotlight/\">CC Metadata Importer</a> looking for some clues toward resolving my gripes noted in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/10/blosxom_tiger_and_spotlight\">Blosxom, Tiger, and Spotlight</a>.  In doing so, I just realized that the <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7432157&amp;forum_id=4355\">guts of this importer are written in Python</a>.  That&#39;s really pretty nifty and I need to look into this some more.</p>\n<p>However, more toward the gripes from <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/10/blosxom_tiger_and_spotlight\">that previous post</a>, I&#39;m assuming that this <a href=\"http://yergler.net/projects/cc-spotlight/\">CC Metadata Importer</a> will kick out any other importer dealing with MP3 files once it&#39;s installed.  Let&#39;s see what happens...  (<em>runs off to install the importer</em>)</p>\n<p>In fact, after I installed the importer, I noticed metadata missing from my MP3s that had been there pre-install, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>kMDItemMediaTypes              = (Sound)</li>\n<li>kMDItemMusicalGenre            = &quot;Rock&quot;</li>\n<li>kMDItemTitle                   = &quot;Sunday&quot;</li>\n<li>kMDItemTotalBitRate            = 256</li>\n<li>kMDItemAudioBitRate            = 256</li>\n<li>kMDItemAudioChannelCount       = 2</li>\n<li>kMDItemAudioSampleRate         = 44100</li>\n<li>kMDItemAuthors                 = (&quot;David Bowie&quot;)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I looked into <code>Audio.mdimporter</code> under <code>/System/Library/Spotlight</code> and this is what I found in <code>Contents/Info.plist</code>:</p>\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\n    <key>CFBundleDocumentTypes</key>\n    <array>\n        <dict>\n            <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\n            <string>MDImporter</string>\n            <key>LSItemContentTypes</key>\n            <array>\n                <string>public.mp3</string>\n                <string>public.aifc-audio</string>\n                <string>public.aiff-audio</string>\n                <string>com.digidesign.sd2-audio</string>\n                <string>com.microsoft.waveform-audio</string>\n                <string>public.ulaw-audio</string>\n                <string>com.apple.coreaudio-format</string>\n            </array>\n        </dict>\n    </array>\n  </textarea>\n\n<p>  And, what do you know?  This is what I found in <code>Contents/Info.plist</code> for <code>Creative Commons Metadata Importer.mdimporter</code>:</p>\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\n    <key>CFBundleDocumentTypes</key>\n    <array>\n        <dict>\n            <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\n            <string>MDImporter</string>\n            <key>LSItemContentTypes</key>\n            <array>\n                <string>public.mp3</string>\n            </array>\n        </dict>\n    </array>\n  </textarea>\n\n<p>This new importer wants to handle <code>public.mp3</code>, just like Apple&#39;s <code>Audio.mdimporter</code>.  So, from my understanding, the CC importer will replace Apple&#39;s--rather than cooperating with it, as I&#39;d like to see.  (I wonder if there&#39;s any way to hack <em>chaining</em> into these things?)</p>\n<p>When I run <code>mdls</code> on an MP3 I have lying around, this is what I get before installing the importer:</p>\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\n01 Sunday.mp3 -------------\nkMDItemAlbum                   = \"Heathen\"\nkMDItemAttributeChangeDate     = 2005-05-03 20:41:01 -0400\nkMDItemAudioBitRate            = 256\nkMDItemAudioChannelCount       = 2\nkMDItemAudioSampleRate         = 44100\nkMDItemAuthors                 = (\"David Bowie\")\nkMDItemContentCreationDate     = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\nkMDItemContentModificationDate = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\nkMDItemContentType             = \"public.mp3\"\nkMDItemContentTypeTree         = (\n    \"public.mp3\", \n    \"public.audio\", \n    \"public.audiovisual-content\", \n    \"public.data\", \n    \"public.item\", \n    \"public.content\"\n)\nkMDItemDisplayName             = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\nkMDItemDurationSeconds         = 856\nkMDItemFSContentChangeDate     = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\nkMDItemFSCreationDate          = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\nkMDItemFSCreatorCode           = 0\nkMDItemFSFinderFlags           = 0\nkMDItemFSInvisible             = 0\nkMDItemFSLabel                 = 0\nkMDItemFSName                  = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\nkMDItemFSNodeCount             = 0\nkMDItemFSOwnerGroupID          = 501\nkMDItemFSOwnerUserID           = 501\nkMDItemFSSize                  = 9138342\nkMDItemFSTypeCode              = 0\nkMDItemID                      = 820671\nkMDItemKind                    = \"MP3 Audio File\"\nkMDItemLastUsedDate            = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\nkMDItemMediaTypes              = (Sound)\nkMDItemMusicalGenre            = \"Rock\"\nkMDItemTitle                   = \"Sunday\"\nkMDItemTotalBitRate            = 256\nkMDItemUsedDates               = (2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500)\n  </textarea>\n\n<p>So, I installed the CC importer, let it re-index things, and this is what <code>mdls</code> gives me now:</p>\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\n01 Sunday.mp3 -------------\nkMDItemAttributeChangeDate     = 2005-06-15 12:27:57 -0400\nkMDItemContentCreationDate     = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\nkMDItemContentModificationDate = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\nkMDItemContentType             = \"public.mp3\"\nkMDItemContentTypeTree         = (\n    \"public.mp3\", \n    \"public.audio\", \n    \"public.audiovisual-content\", \n    \"public.data\", \n    \"public.item\", \n    \"public.content\"\n)\nkMDItemDisplayName             = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\nkMDItemFSContentChangeDate     = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\nkMDItemFSCreationDate          = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\nkMDItemFSCreatorCode           = 0\nkMDItemFSFinderFlags           = 0\nkMDItemFSInvisible             = 0\nkMDItemFSLabel                 = 0\nkMDItemFSName                  = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\nkMDItemFSNodeCount             = 0\nkMDItemFSOwnerGroupID          = 501\nkMDItemFSOwnerUserID           = 501\nkMDItemFSSize                  = 9138342\nkMDItemFSTypeCode              = 0\nkMDItemID                      = 820671\nkMDItemKind                    = \"MP3 Audio File\"\nkMDItemLastUsedDate            = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\nkMDItemUsedDates               = (2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500)\n  </textarea>\n\n<p>In case those two floods of metadata set your head spinning, the post-install metadata is lacking items from the pre-install metadata.

That's really pretty nifty and I need to look into this some more.\r\n\r\n[bts]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/10/blosxom_tiger_and_spotlight\r\n[guts]: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7432157&forum_id=4355\r\n[cci]: http://yergler.net/projects/cc-spotlight/\r\n\r\nHowever, more toward the gripes from [that previous post][bts], I'm assuming that this [CC Metadata Importer][cci] will kick out any other importer dealing with MP3 files once it's installed.  Let's see what happens...  (*runs off to install the importer*)\r\n\r\nIn fact, after I installed the importer, I noticed metadata missing from my MP3s that had been there pre-install, such as:\r\n\r\n* kMDItemMediaTypes              = (Sound)\r\n* kMDItemMusicalGenre            = \"Rock\"\r\n* kMDItemTitle                   = \"Sunday\"\r\n* kMDItemTotalBitRate            = 256\r\n* kMDItemAudioBitRate            = 256\r\n* kMDItemAudioChannelCount       = 2\r\n* kMDItemAudioSampleRate         = 44100\r\n* kMDItemAuthors                 = (\"David Bowie\")\r\n\r\nI looked into `Audio.mdimporter` under `/System/Library/Spotlight` and this is what I found in `Contents/Info.plist`:\r\n\r\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\r\n    <key>CFBundleDocumentTypes</key>\r\n    <array>\r\n        <dict>\r\n            <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\r\n            <string>MDImporter</string>\r\n            <key>LSItemContentTypes</key>\r\n            <array>\r\n                <string>public.mp3</string>\r\n                <string>public.aifc-audio</string>\r\n                <string>public.aiff-audio</string>\r\n                <string>com.digidesign.sd2-audio</string>\r\n                <string>com.microsoft.waveform-audio</string>\r\n                <string>public.ulaw-audio</string>\r\n                <string>com.apple.coreaudio-format</string>\r\n            </array>\r\n        </dict>\r\n    </array>\r\n  </textarea>\r\n\r\n  And, what do you know?  This is what I found in `Contents/Info.plist` for `Creative Commons Metadata Importer.mdimporter`:\r\n\r\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\r\n    <key>CFBundleDocumentTypes</key>\r\n    <array>\r\n        <dict>\r\n            <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\r\n            <string>MDImporter</string>\r\n            <key>LSItemContentTypes</key>\r\n            <array>\r\n                <string>public.mp3</string>\r\n            </array>\r\n        </dict>\r\n    </array>\r\n  </textarea>\r\n\r\nThis new importer wants to handle `public.mp3`, just like Apple's `Audio.mdimporter`.  So, from my understanding, the CC importer will replace Apple's--rather than cooperating with it, as I'd like to see.  (I wonder if there's any way to hack *chaining* into these things?)\r\n\r\nWhen I run `mdls` on an MP3 I have lying around, this is what I get before installing the importer:\r\n\r\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\r\n01 Sunday.mp3 -------------\r\nkMDItemAlbum                   = \"Heathen\"\r\nkMDItemAttributeChangeDate     = 2005-05-03 20:41:01 -0400\r\nkMDItemAudioBitRate            = 256\r\nkMDItemAudioChannelCount       = 2\r\nkMDItemAudioSampleRate         = 44100\r\nkMDItemAuthors                 = (\"David Bowie\")\r\nkMDItemContentCreationDate     = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\r\nkMDItemContentModificationDate = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\r\nkMDItemContentType             = \"public.mp3\"\r\nkMDItemContentTypeTree         = (\r\n    \"public.mp3\", \r\n    \"public.audio\", \r\n    \"public.audiovisual-content\", \r\n    \"public.data\", \r\n    \"public.item\", \r\n    \"public.content\"\r\n)\r\nkMDItemDisplayName             = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\r\nkMDItemDurationSeconds         = 856\r\nkMDItemFSContentChangeDate     = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\r\nkMDItemFSCreationDate          = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\r\nkMDItemFSCreatorCode           = 0\r\nkMDItemFSFinderFlags           = 0\r\nkMDItemFSInvisible             = 0\r\nkMDItemFSLabel                 = 0\r\nkMDItemFSName                  = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\r\nkMDItemFSNodeCount             = 0\r\nkMDItemFSOwnerGroupID          = 501\r\nkMDItemFSOwnerUserID           = 501\r\nkMDItemFSSize                  = 9138342\r\nkMDItemFSTypeCode              = 0\r\nkMDItemID                      = 820671\r\nkMDItemKind                    = \"MP3 Audio File\"\r\nkMDItemLastUsedDate            = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\r\nkMDItemMediaTypes              = (Sound)\r\nkMDItemMusicalGenre            = \"Rock\"\r\nkMDItemTitle                   = \"Sunday\"\r\nkMDItemTotalBitRate            = 256\r\nkMDItemUsedDates               = (2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500)\r\n  </textarea>\r\n\r\nSo, I installed the CC importer, let it re-index things, and this is what `mdls` gives me now:\r\n\r\n  <textarea cols=\"60\" rows=\"10\">\r\n01 Sunday.mp3 -------------\r\nkMDItemAttributeChangeDate     = 2005-06-15 12:27:57 -0400\r\nkMDItemContentCreationDate     = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\r\nkMDItemContentModificationDate = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\r\nkMDItemContentType             = \"public.mp3\"\r\nkMDItemContentTypeTree         = (\r\n    \"public.mp3\", \r\n    \"public.audio\", \r\n    \"public.audiovisual-content\", \r\n    \"public.data\", \r\n    \"public.item\", \r\n    \"public.content\"\r\n)\r\nkMDItemDisplayName             = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\r\nkMDItemFSContentChangeDate     = 2005-05-03 20:41:00 -0400\r\nkMDItemFSCreationDate          = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\r\nkMDItemFSCreatorCode           = 0\r\nkMDItemFSFinderFlags           = 0\r\nkMDItemFSInvisible             = 0\r\nkMDItemFSLabel                 = 0\r\nkMDItemFSName                  = \"01 Sunday.mp3\"\r\nkMDItemFSNodeCount             = 0\r\nkMDItemFSOwnerGroupID          = 501\r\nkMDItemFSOwnerUserID           = 501\r\nkMDItemFSSize                  = 9138342\r\nkMDItemFSTypeCode              = 0\r\nkMDItemID                      = 820671\r\nkMDItemKind                    = \"MP3 Audio File\"\r\nkMDItemLastUsedDate            = 2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500\r\nkMDItemUsedDates               = (2003-01-22 12:43:35 -0500)\r\n  </textarea>\r\n\r\nIn case those two floods of metadata set your head spinning, the post-install metadata is lacking items from the pre-install metadata.  I need to uninstall this importer and get my other metadata back.  And, this isn't a slight against the importer--it looks like really cool work.  No, this is a bummer of Spotlight.\r\n\r\n*Almost there...*\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088590\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://ulaluma.com/pyx\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9e03aaf8edbe4b2c0d25e30ab9a69ffb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://ulaluma.com/pyx\">Donovan Preston</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088590\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-15T12:55:56\">2005-06-15T12:55:56</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">At WWDC I heard some of the Apple developers complaining about this as well.

Control+Q or Cmd+Q is not mapped to Quit as in Mozilla and Netscape\n2. No site navigation bar\nI truly believe that the site navigation bar with Top, Up, First, Previous, Next, Last buttons and the Document and ubiquitous \"More\" folder that listed alternate links such as different feeds on the page is a breakthrough  in the browser interface (albeit an incremental one) much like the back button. The site navigation bar is much maligned (and was pulled from an early Mozilla release circa 1.3? \"because of its effect on page load performance\" before it was added back after an outcry and those \"performance\" issues were addressed. Still the default setting has it always hidden, you have to go find the \"Show only if needed\" option in the menu. \nI quite like the next and previous buttons that appear on some blogs (and used to appear in Slashdot - although they disabled that because of concerns about link pre-fetching. For those of us in the Long Tail of the blog world that site navigation bar really works well for navigating the site. And it pulls me out of Bloglines for many sites when I want to just lazily surf around.\nIf we could standardize a few more primitives beyond the Top, Up, First, Previous, Next, Last buttons there could be lots of interface innovations and the navigation of web sites could be made easier. In the Atom working group there was talk about standardizing various linking primitives in this manner. The fact that this is all hyperlink mediated is strangly appropriate.\nNow it is only the pull of Monkeyed Grease and inline autocomplete that keep me turning to that foxy thing, otherwise Luddite and late adopter that I am, the Mozilla suite is where I would stay.\nhmm worthy of a blog... lessee http://www.bloglines.com/blog/amaah?id=38</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083441\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb7f2a3ba74af37415ab7df101a86c75&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083441\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-15T11:55:42\">2005-06-15T11:55:42</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Koranteng:  I think I'm a little confused what you mean with #1...

Control+Q or Cmd+Q is not mapped to Quit as in Mozilla and Netscape\r\n\r\n2. No site navigation bar\r\n\r\nI truly believe that the site navigation bar with Top, Up, First, Previous, Next, Last buttons and the Document and ubiquitous \"More\" folder that listed alternate links such as different feeds on the page is a breakthrough  in the browser interface (albeit an incremental one) much like the back button. The site navigation bar is much maligned (and was pulled from an early Mozilla release circa 1.3? \"because of its effect on page load performance\" before it was added back after an outcry and those \"performance\" issues were addressed. Still the default setting has it always hidden, you have to go find the \"Show only if needed\" option in the menu. \r\n\r\nI quite like the next and previous buttons that appear on some blogs (and used to appear in Slashdot - although they disabled that because of concerns about link pre-fetching. For those of us in the Long Tail of the blog world that site navigation bar really works well for navigating the site. And it pulls me out of Bloglines for many sites when I want to just lazily surf around.\r\n\r\nIf we could standardize a few more primitives beyond the Top, Up, First, Previous, Next, Last buttons there could be lots of interface innovations and the navigation of web sites could be made easier. In the Atom working group there was talk about standardizing various linking primitives in this manner. The fact that this is all hyperlink mediated is strangly appropriate.\r\n\r\nNow it is only the pull of Monkeyed Grease and inline autocomplete that keep me turning to that foxy thing, otherwise Luddite and late adopter that I am, the Mozilla suite is where I would stay.\r\n\r\nhmm worthy of a blog... lessee http://www.bloglines.com/blog/amaah?id=38</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083441\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb7f2a3ba74af37415ab7df101a86c75&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083441\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-15T11:55:42\">2005-06-15T11:55:42</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Koranteng:  I think I'm a little confused what you mean with #1...

    "html": "<p>I&#39;m feeling a bit retro in terms of gadgets right now.  And I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a matter of reduced expectations or what, but I&#39;m finding myself strangely happier with this situation.  </p>\n<p>The screen on my <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo 600</a> suffered a crack, and although it was still limping along as a phone, it just wasn&#39;t worth it.  And besides, the thing has disappointed me overall--crappy phone, crappy camera, crappy screen, outmoded OS, badly thought-out headset/headphone situation.  </p>\n<p>After having looked forward to getting one so much, I&#39;m happy to be done with it now.  I just hope I can find my receipts to call in the replacement policy and maybe eBay an unopened <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo</a> to recoup some costs.  Oh, and not be tempted to buy a new camera just to use the spare 512MB SD card I have sitting around now.</p>\n<p>So, the <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo</a> has been replaced by my old <a href=\"http://product.samsung.com/cgi-bin/nabc/prod/hhcommerce/telecommunications/sph_a500_features.jsp\">Samsung A500</a> phone and a first-gen <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Handspring Visor Deluxe</a>, both of which I dug out of old junk boxes in the basement.  </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://product.samsung.com/cgi-bin/nabc/prod/hhcommerce/telecommunications/sph_a500_features.jsp\">Samsung A500</a> phone works well, makes calls, fits comfortably in the same pocket as my wallet.  And, over the years, it&#39;s taken a great share of knocks and drops and has barely flinched.  I&#39;ve downgraded my phone service a bit and abandoned most of the data features, which will save me some money for awhile.  I kind of wish I had a camera on this phone, but I won&#39;t cry over the savings from the missing data plan, nor will I pine for carrying <a href=\"http://www.steves-digicams.com/2002_reviews/pcs_vision.html\">the external camera attachment</a> Sprint offered for the phone.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Handspring Visor</a> has also taken a number of knocks, but keeps going.  The only glitchy bit is that I have to jam a few post-it notes in the cradle with it to ensure a connection, because some of the copper has rubbed off the contacts on the bottom of the PDA.  (I think I might invest in a conductive ink pen.)  Oh, and it doesn&#39;t have a rechargeable battery pack--I&#39;ll have to seek out some decent solution with rechargeable AAA&#39;s (do they even make those anymore?)  But, I remember Graffiti and can probably write that as fast or faster than I could thumb-type on the <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo</a>.</p>\n<p>The really odd thing is that, although the OS on the <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Visor</a> is even further behind than what I had on the <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo</a>, I&#39;m not too sad with it.  Like I said, maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m just not expecting that much.  Hell, I was happy to remember that this model has a backlight!  I miss the internet connectivity a bit, but I never used it much on the <a href=\"http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\">Treo</a> because the lack of multitasking and quasi-dialup experience always just pissed me off.  </p>\n<p>But, the address book and date book work on the <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Visor</a>, though I only wish I hadn&#39;t lost my regcode for <a href=\"http://www.pimlicosoftware.com/\">DateBk5</a>.  It syncs with my PowerBook.  I can get text files back and forth with <a href=\"http://mac-huwis.lut.ac.uk/~wis/programs/NoteTaker/NoteTaker.html\">NoteTaker</a>, which ties into all <em>sorts</em> of things.  And, best of all, <a href=\"http://frobnitz.sourceforge.net/\">Frobnitz</a> and <a href=\"http://roguelike-palm.sourceforge.net/\">Rogue</a> both work.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m slowly rediscovering a few of the tools I used to use on this thing, and telling myself that it&#39;s just slightly better than a stack of 3x5 cards.  Because you know, although I love my Moleskine, I just never could quite get into the <a href=\"http://www.hipsterpda.com/\">Hipster PDA</a> thing.  This is unplugged enough for me, thanks.  </p>\n<p>Anyway...  anyone have any cool tricks or tips for my <a href=\"http://product.samsung.com/cgi-bin/nabc/prod/hhcommerce/telecommunications/sph_a500_features.jsp\">Samsung A500</a> phone or this <a href=\"http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\">Handspring Visor</a>?</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085050\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085050\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T15:58:12\">2005-06-14T15:58:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Man, I'm glad I skipped the Treo 600!

(I think this should tell me something.)\nOne of the things I really hated on my 600 is the multitasking and the not-always-connected internet connectivity.  Especially when I wanted to jump between email, IM, and web, and it would completely disconnect and redial between programs.  Sometimes it would stay connected, but the IM client would need to reconnect.\nAnd as for media... ugh.  The 600 screen was only 160x160, if I recall, which killed a lot of opportunities.  And the headphone / headset duality sucked:  You had a headset to make calls with, and headphones to listen to music.  But even though the two shared the same port, they weren't the same thing.  And a 2-in-1 rig seemed to go for around US$40\nFrom the few opportunities I've had to play with a 650 (all of two), it seems like the much better machine.  But, I *would* be surprised if they had addressed enough of my gripes for me to like it.\nI think the problem now is that, after having used a Palm III with a Novatel Minstrel wireless cradle like 7 years ago, I expect flying cars by now :)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085052\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.darkglass.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3da2ed23539be35727b2844e4a6a9b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.darkglass.org/\">tamaracks</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085052\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T22:11:52\">2005-06-14T22:11:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Huh, I had some flaky contact problems with my old Visor Deluxe too.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085053\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085053\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T23:42:39\">2005-06-14T23:42:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">tamaracks:  Yeah, if you happen to still have it and play with your Visor again, take a look at the contacts on the bottom.

I bought the Sanyo 5300 because it was the first Sprint camphone available in my area. And after an ongoing survey of online examples, I think I can safely say that the 5300 has the *worst*, *slowest* camera ever grafted on to a clamshell. I grew to loathe the thing... early-adopterism can bite ya sometimes.\n\"One of the things I really hated on my 600 is the multitasking and the not-always-connected internet connectivity.\"\nMultitasking is obviously still an issue with the 650, although I find that I'm not missing it as much as I would have thought. I always admired the way my Axim could be playing an MP3, tracking the car's movements via GPS, and surfing the web simultaneously... but in practice, I just don't do much app switching. I tend to jump into the PDA, do X for a while, and then jump out.\nThe off-and-on connectivity issue, OTOH, may be minimized a bit with the 650. It virtually never happens when moving from built-in app to built-in app... it's the third-party stuff that seems to default to zapping the connection every time I exit.

    "body": "I'm feeling a bit retro in terms of gadgets right now.  And I don't know if it's a matter of reduced expectations or what, but I'm finding myself strangely happier with this situation.  \r\n\r\nThe screen on my [Treo 600][treo] suffered a crack, and although it was still limping along as a phone, it just wasn't worth it.  And besides, the thing has disappointed me overall--crappy phone, crappy camera, crappy screen, outmoded OS, badly thought-out headset/headphone situation.  \r\n\r\nAfter having looked forward to getting one so much, I'm happy to be done with it now.  I just hope I can find my receipts to call in the replacement policy and maybe eBay an unopened [Treo][treo] to recoup some costs.  Oh, and not be tempted to buy a new camera just to use the spare 512MB SD card I have sitting around now.\r\n\r\nSo, the [Treo][] has been replaced by my old [Samsung A500][a500] phone and a first-gen [Handspring Visor Deluxe][visor], both of which I dug out of old junk boxes in the basement.  \r\n\r\nThe [Samsung A500][a500] phone works well, makes calls, fits comfortably in the same pocket as my wallet.  And, over the years, it's taken a great share of knocks and drops and has barely flinched.  I've downgraded my phone service a bit and abandoned most of the data features, which will save me some money for awhile.  I kind of wish I had a camera on this phone, but I won't cry over the savings from the missing data plan, nor will I pine for carrying [the external camera attachment][cam] Sprint offered for the phone.\r\n\r\nThe [Handspring Visor][visor] has also taken a number of knocks, but keeps going.  The only glitchy bit is that I have to jam a few post-it notes in the cradle with it to ensure a connection, because some of the copper has rubbed off the contacts on the bottom of the PDA.  (I think I might invest in a conductive ink pen.)  Oh, and it doesn't have a rechargeable battery pack--I'll have to seek out some decent solution with rechargeable AAA's (do they even make those anymore?)  But, I remember Graffiti and can probably write that as fast or faster than I could thumb-type on the [Treo][].\r\n\r\nThe really odd thing is that, although the OS on the [Visor][] is even further behind than what I had on the [Treo][], I'm not too sad with it.  Like I said, maybe it's because I'm just not expecting that much.  Hell, I was happy to remember that this model has a backlight!  I miss the internet connectivity a bit, but I never used it much on the [Treo][] because the lack of multitasking and quasi-dialup experience always just pissed me off.  \r\n\r\nBut, the address book and date book work on the [Visor][], though I only wish I hadn't lost my regcode for [DateBk5][dtb].  It syncs with my PowerBook.  I can get text files back and forth with [NoteTaker][mnt], which ties into all *sorts* of things.  And, best of all, [Frobnitz][frob] and [Rogue][rogue] both work.\r\n  \r\nI'm slowly rediscovering a few of the tools I used to use on this thing, and telling myself that it's just slightly better than a stack of 3x5 cards.  Because you know, although I love my Moleskine, I just never could quite get into the [Hipster PDA][pda] thing.  This is unplugged enough for me, thanks.  \r\n\r\nAnyway...  anyone have any cool tricks or tips for my [Samsung A500][a500] phone or this [Handspring Visor][visor]?\r\n\r\n[Treo]: http://web.palmone.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml\r\n[visor]: http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/visor.html\r\n[a500]: http://product.samsung.com/cgi-bin/nabc/prod/hhcommerce/telecommunications/sph_a500_features.jsp\r\n[pda]: http://www.hipsterpda.com/\r\n[cam]: http://www.steves-digicams.com/2002_reviews/pcs_vision.html\r\n[dtb]: http://www.pimlicosoftware.com/\r\n[rogue]: http://roguelike-palm.sourceforge.net/\r\n[frob]: http://frobnitz.sourceforge.net/\r\n[mnt]: http://mac-huwis.lut.ac.uk/~wis/programs/NoteTaker/NoteTaker.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085050\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://admin.support.journurl.com/\">Roger Benningfield</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085050\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T15:58:12\">2005-06-14T15:58:12</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Man, I'm glad I skipped the Treo 600! I waited for the 650, and while it hasn't converted me into a PalmOS fan (I've always been a Pocket PC person), it's still a solid little unit. The browser is a step up from Pocket IE, and the camera is miles better than the one on my Sanyo phone. \r\n\r\nAnd while it *was* expensive, it completely killed my desire to buy a PSP for portable video. I can fit hours-n-hours of 320x320 video on 1GB SD card... I can watch a rip of the Battlestar Galactica DVD in the car while my wife is clothes shopping.

(I think this should tell me something.)\r\n\r\nOne of the things I really hated on my 600 is the multitasking and the not-always-connected internet connectivity.  Especially when I wanted to jump between email, IM, and web, and it would completely disconnect and redial between programs.  Sometimes it would stay connected, but the IM client would need to reconnect.\r\n\r\nAnd as for media... ugh.  The 600 screen was only 160x160, if I recall, which killed a lot of opportunities.  And the headphone / headset duality sucked:  You had a headset to make calls with, and headphones to listen to music.  But even though the two shared the same port, they weren't the same thing.  And a 2-in-1 rig seemed to go for around US$40\r\n\r\nFrom the few opportunities I've had to play with a 650 (all of two), it seems like the much better machine.  But, I *would* be surprised if they had addressed enough of my gripes for me to like it.\r\n\r\nI think the problem now is that, after having used a Palm III with a Novatel Minstrel wireless cradle like 7 years ago, I expect flying cars by now :)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085052\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.darkglass.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3da2ed23539be35727b2844e4a6a9b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.darkglass.org/\">tamaracks</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085052\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T22:11:52\">2005-06-14T22:11:52</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Huh, I had some flaky contact problems with my old Visor Deluxe too.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085053\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085053\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-14T23:42:39\">2005-06-14T23:42:39</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">tamaracks:  Yeah, if you happen to still have it and play with your Visor again, take a look at the contacts on the bottom.

I bought the Sanyo 5300 because it was the first Sprint camphone available in my area. And after an ongoing survey of online examples, I think I can safely say that the 5300 has the *worst*, *slowest* camera ever grafted on to a clamshell.

I always admired the way my Axim could be playing an MP3, tracking the car's movements via GPS, and surfing the web simultaneously... but in practice, I just don't do much app switching. I tend to jump into the PDA, do X for a while, and then jump out.\r\n\r\nThe off-and-on connectivity issue, OTOH, may be minimized a bit with the 650. It virtually never happens when moving from built-in app to built-in app... it's the third-party stuff that seems to default to zapping the connection every time I exit.

But, it really peeves me when people assume Moore&#39;s Law alone will get us there--the idea that, if we just had a Pentium chip with enough mega/giga/tera/petahertz, an assemblage of hardware will magically come to approximate our own brains enough to spontaneously gain consciousness or at least enable it to host one of our own existing cells of awareness.</p>\n<p>The problem is that consciousness and cognition aren&#39;t a matter of brute force processing, and even an infinite array of CPUs won&#39;t necessarily <a href=\"http://www.aihorizon.com/essays/goai/\">play a good game of Go</a> or cause a mind to emerge.  Sure, incomprehensible resources of computational power helps, but it&#39;s about the clever algorithms.  </p>\n<p>Look, here&#39;s an analogy:  Consider dynamite.  It blows things up.  Make better dynamite, blow bigger things up.  Make infinitely powerful dynamite, and you can blow up anything in the universe.  But, you&#39;re still just blowing things up--you&#39;re not making <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/moru/\">Mount Rushmore</a>.</p>\n<p>Another analogy:  Consider a sports car.  It goes fast.  Make a better sports car, it goes faster.  Make an infinitely fast sports car, and it goes as fast as you can imagine.  But, it&#39;s not a boat or a plane.  Drive that car into the ocean and, barring any quirks or inertia that allow insanely-fast tires to grip water or skip over it altogether--I&#39;ll bet that the car sinks to the bottom rather than getting you from New York to London.</p>\n<p>You can have all the power promised by Moore&#39;s Law projected out into infinity, but you&#39;ll never build a brain until you figure out what real tricks it has up its sleeves.  </p>\n<p>In the meantime, I think efforts like <a href=\"http://www.bootstrap.org/\">Doug Engelbart&#39;s Bootstrap Institute</a> are where it&#39;s really at.  I think that human brains won&#39;t get replaced for a few hundred or thousand years yet, but in the meantime we&#39;ll wrap ourselves in layer upon layer of cognitive amplification.  Hopefully, medicine will come to a point where the little magic meat in the middle can be sustained indefinitely, so we can all become our own versions of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=vger+%22star+trek%22\">VGER</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087520\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=41961d4385a56ed0724cb621b8814125&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087520\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-10T13:53:41\">2005-06-10T13:53:41</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Les, one thing I've noticed about the computer-as-a-brain idea is that computers do a lousy job at forgetting.

That said, though, I believe we're quite likely to create consciousness (or things that look conscious) without really understanding the mechanisms of consciousness. I imagine that at some point we'll build a model of a human brain -- which might model operations at the neuron level or at the molecular level -- and it will act as if it's conscious.

    "body": "And while I'm on a roll trying to dump pent-up writing thoughts:  Last month, I read this [article in the Guardian][ag] presenting claims that we'll be downloading our brains in 2050.\r\n\r\nWell, it's no secret that I'm a [Ray Kurzweil fan][rk] and a [Singularitarian geek][sing] who's certainly eagerly working toward achieving [The Rapture][rapture].  But, it really peeves me when people assume Moore's Law alone will get us there--the idea that, if we just had a Pentium chip with enough mega/giga/tera/petahertz, an assemblage of hardware will magically come to approximate our own brains enough to spontaneously gain consciousness or at least enable it to host one of our own existing cells of awareness.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that consciousness and cognition aren't a matter of brute force processing, and even an infinite array of CPUs won't necessarily [play a good game of Go][go] or cause a mind to emerge.  Sure, incomprehensible resources of computational power helps, but it's about the clever algorithms.  \r\n\r\nLook, here's an analogy:  Consider dynamite.  It blows things up.  Make better dynamite, blow bigger things up.  Make infinitely powerful dynamite, and you can blow up anything in the universe.  But, you're still just blowing things up--you're not making [Mount Rushmore][mr].\r\n\r\nAnother analogy:  Consider a sports car.  It goes fast.  Make a better sports car, it goes faster.  Make an infinitely fast sports car, and it goes as fast as you can imagine.  But, it's not a boat or a plane.  Drive that car into the ocean and, barring any quirks or inertia that allow insanely-fast tires to grip water or skip over it altogether--I'll bet that the car sinks to the bottom rather than getting you from New York to London.\r\n\r\nYou can have all the power promised by Moore's Law projected out into infinity, but you'll never build a brain until you figure out what real tricks it has up its sleeves.  \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I think efforts like [Doug Engelbart's Bootstrap Institute][bi] are where it's really at.  I think that human brains won't get replaced for a few hundred or thousand years yet, but in the meantime we'll wrap ourselves in layer upon layer of cognitive amplification.  Hopefully, medicine will come to a point where the little magic meat in the middle can be sustained indefinitely, so we can all become our own versions of [VGER][vger].\r\n\r\n[go]: http://www.aihorizon.com/essays/goai/\r\n[vger]: http://www.google.com/search?q=vger+%22star+trek%22\r\n[bi]: http://www.bootstrap.org/\r\n[rk]: http://www.kurzweilai.net/index.html?flash=0\r\n[ag]: http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/science/story/0,12996,1489699,00.html\r\n[rapture]: http://www.antipope.org/charlie/toughguide.html\r\n[sing]: http://www.wholeearthmag.com/ArticleBin/111-6.pdf\r\n[mr]: http://www.nps.gov/moru/\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087520\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=41961d4385a56ed0724cb621b8814125&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://vielmetti.typepad.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087520\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-10T13:53:41\">2005-06-10T13:53:41</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Les, one thing I've noticed about the computer-as-a-brain idea is that computers do a lousy job at forgetting.

It&#39;s worth noting, however, that WordPress uses textareas too.  So does LiveJournal.  So do most comment posting forms.

However, while I personally use Movable Type, this is a hack for <strong><em>textareas in FireFox</em></strong>. </i></p><i>\n</i><p><i>Movable Type just happens to use textareas.  It&apos;s worth noting, however, that WordPress uses textareas too.  So does LiveJournal.  So do most comment posting forms.

So it looks like <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0764597582.html\">the book</a> is out of my hands now, having finished the final reviews.  I have some more to say about that, but first I want to post the results of the last day or so of hacking I&apos;ve done.</p>\n<p>I&apos;ve been working on the stuff for the book so long that I just had to do something else (ie. <em>not RSS or Atom</em>) to help clear my head.  But, I&apos;m addicted to learning and building stuff.  So, although I did relax a bit since the main effort of the book passed--that is, relax as normal people define it--I just can&apos;t stop making things.  </p>\n<p>So, I had a beer, cracked open <a href=\"http://diveintogreasemonkey.org/\">Dive Into GreaseMonkey</a>, and decided to make good on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/17/magic_microformat_forms\">that idea I wrote about last month</a>.  Not only that, but I had a little free time over lunch today, so I downloaded a trial of <a href=\"http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/\">Snapz Pro X 2</a> to try my hand at a little screencasting, ala <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/05/11/20OPstrategic_1.html\">Jon Udell</a>.</p>\n<p>I&apos;ve got more things to say about all this, and my new found excitement for GreaseMonkey, but first I&apos;ll share the goods.</p>\n<p>If you want to risk running my horribly premature code on your machine, here&apos;s the script:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/06/magic_hcalendar.user.js\">magic_hcalendar.user.js</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&apos;d like a preview of what it does, here&apos;s a movie:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/06/magic_hcalendar.mov\">magic_hcalendar.mov</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And, just for the sake of completeness, here&apos;s a quick screen grab:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/06/magic_hcalendar.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/06/magic_hcalendar.jpg\" width=\"315\" height=\"258\"></a></p>\n"

And there's RDF, a nice, clean, spec pure way to do things.\nOn the other hand, there's XML-RPC-- a workable hack that shoehorns remote procedure calls across a channel not quite meant for that purpose.  And there're Microformats, workable hacks shoehorning data into a channel not quite meant for that purpose.\nExcept that, well, microformats are kinda in the middle, since there *is* a lot of effort made to express things in semantic HTML, rather than outright subverting the carrier wave.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087638\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://philwilson.org/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=abb5e982d97d7539860141b7904ba31a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://philwilson.org/blog/\">Phil Wilson</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087638\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-18T08:35:46\">2005-05-18T08:35:46</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Great idea!</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087639\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dannyayers.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7028f422ca6da0180de6c9d922a3228f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dannyayers.com\">Danny</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087639\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-29T07:53:32\">2005-05-29T07:53:32</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I think the approach you describe sounds like it should be feasible - Greasemonkey seems a bit heavyweight, I'd guess a bookmarklet (perhaps appearing simply as a link in the blogging software) would be easiest.\nRe. Phillip's point: \"Their disadvantage is that if you don’t know about the specific format used, you won’t even be able to realise that there is metadata attached to the review (or whatever).\".\nIt's  not as clear as it could be in the microformat docs, but these things can be decribed as profiles of XHTML, which can be indicated by a profile attribute (containing one or more URIs) in the head element of the doc. This is a *huge* plus. On the one hand it means the microformat data is globally identified as such, and potentially discoverable using existing tools (like Google). It also opens the way to use GRDDL (XSLT) to extract unambiguous RDF/XML from the XHTML. Taken as a whole, this means you don't need to know anything about the format in advance for it to be useful (in say a queryable RDF store).\nbtw, I'm in the process of a little proof-of-concept with microformat+GRDDL, working with DOAP (Description of a Project) data:\nhttp://purl.org/stuff/hdoap/profile\nso far, so good...</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

And hopefully, focusing on the textarea itself can make this sort of thing fairly publishing-tool-agnostic.\r\n\r\nJust a quick thought that I haven't time at the moment to implement or check for stupidity.\r\n\r\nOf course, this whole idea of [shoehorning structured data into blogs and feeds via specially arranged HTML][shoe] strikes me as similar in spirit to XML-RPC, but it might just [be useful][useful] until something cleaner catches on ([or I catch on to it][catch])...\r\n\r\n[catch]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/11/02/ooocae\r\n[useful]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/11/26/oooccb\r\n[shoe]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/05/the_right_place_for_data_in_your_feed\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087634\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=475a543984769e9890f8dc0091f602c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/\">Phillip Pearson</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087634\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-17T19:11:53\">2005-05-17T19:11:53</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">You talk about similarity with XML-RPC as if it's a bad thing ... :-)\r\n\r\nHere's how I see it:\r\n\r\nThe h-formats (hReview, hCalendar etc) have the advantage that they can go anywhere HTML goes -- perhaps on a web page, or inside an RSS 'description' element.\r\n\r\nTheir disadvantage is that if you don't know about the specific format used, you won't even be able to realise that there is metadata attached to the review (or whatever).\r\n\r\nThis seems more like the problem with REST interfaces - you need to write a new parser each time.\r\n\r\nMy favourite thing about XML-RPC is that you can use the same code to send and receive calls every time, and the only thing that changes is what the arguments mean.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an XML-RPC style approach to reviews would be more like Russell Beattie's recent suggestion, or like RSS-Data, which we talked about last year sometime, I think.\r\n\r\nThat way an aggregator could just look for certain standard tags, and then pass them off to a separate parser for review, rather than having to recognise certain \"hidden\" elements (class attributes etc).</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087636\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb7f2a3ba74af37415ab7df101a86c75&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087636\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-17T20:11:05\">2005-05-17T20:11:05</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Oh, actually, my comparison was more like this:\r\n\r\nXML-RPC : REST :: Microformats : RDF/XML\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there's REST-- a nice, clean, standards pure way to do things.  And there's RDF, a nice, clean, spec pure way to do things.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there's XML-RPC-- a workable hack that shoehorns remote procedure calls across a channel not quite meant for that purpose.  And there're Microformats, workable hacks shoehorning data into a channel not quite meant for that purpose.\r\n\r\nExcept that, well, microformats are kinda in the middle, since there *is* a lot of effort made to express things in semantic HTML, rather than outright subverting the carrier wave.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087638\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://philwilson.org/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=abb5e982d97d7539860141b7904ba31a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://philwilson.org/blog/\">Phil Wilson</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087638\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-18T08:35:46\">2005-05-18T08:35:46</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Great idea!</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087639\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dannyayers.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7028f422ca6da0180de6c9d922a3228f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dannyayers.com\">Danny</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087639\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-29T07:53:32\">2005-05-29T07:53:32</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I think the approach you describe sounds like it should be feasible - Greasemonkey seems a bit heavyweight, I'd guess a bookmarklet (perhaps appearing simply as a link in the blogging software) would be easiest.\r\n\r\nRe. Phillip's point: \"Their disadvantage is that if you don’t know about the specific format used, you won’t even be able to realise that there is metadata attached to the review (or whatever).\".\r\n\r\nIt's  not as clear as it could be in the microformat docs, but these things can be decribed as profiles of XHTML, which can be indicated by a profile attribute (containing one or more URIs) in the head element of the doc. This is a *huge* plus. On the one hand it means the microformat data is globally identified as such, and potentially discoverable using existing tools (like Google). It also opens the way to use GRDDL (XSLT) to extract unambiguous RDF/XML from the XHTML. Taken as a whole, this means you don't need to know anything about the format in advance for it to be useful (in say a queryable RDF store).\r\n\r\nbtw, I'm in the process of a little proof-of-concept with microformat+GRDDL, working with DOAP (Description of a Project) data:\r\nhttp://purl.org/stuff/hdoap/profile\r\nso far, so good...</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

More and more blogging tools publish in well-formed XHTML by default and are  becoming better and better at \"tidying\" ill-formed markup into well-formed markup.  \nIn addition, right now you can get started with a bit of a hybrid approach:  you can use a regexp to find the *start* of a microformat such as hCard, hCalendar, hReview, XOXO etc. simply by looking for class attributes that contain the right value.  Then at that point, you can hand the stream over to an XML parser to process the well-formed microformatted markup and handle the structured data as you wish!\nTantek</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084973\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.metafy.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=314b3139fd18612a532413debb27279a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.metafy.com\">joe @ metafy</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084973\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-10T14:59:25\">2005-05-10T14:59:25</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I remember that presentation at WWDC last year or the year before in which the very nice Sara ? explains that scraping is for H4x0Rs, to which I commented to her afterward that it's actually for 3L337 H4x0Rs...\nI particularly enjoy the \"Scraping is Fun\" bent of this thread, so I thought I'd bang my own drum a little to show how much I enjoy it, too:\nhttp://www.metafy.com/products/anthracite/\nIt works great with Perl (or any other UNIX command) and AppleScript now, and even better later this week when we release the Automator actions for Anthracite (whoops, not supposed to say that yet until they're all done)...\nAmong other nifty things you can do with it today are convert the results of a Google search into an RSS feed, and/or search those results via Spotlight.\nI hope it helps you enjoy scraping even more!\nJoe @ Metafy\nBoulder, Colorado USA</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084975\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ransom.dyndns.ws\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3c2c53afc4e0af6c1b091b185096a4e5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ransom.dyndns.ws\">Doug Ransom</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084975\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-23T00:52:56\">2005-05-23T00:52:56</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Here is a microformat I proposed a couple years ago http://internetalchemy.org/2003/04/rssInXHTML\nGenerally, I think the microformat concept is great.

I wrote sitescooper, which was a proto-scraper for a wide variety of sites to transcode them into an offline-readable format for small-screen handheld devices.  \r\n\r\nI really like the microformat idea, thanks for the pointer.  one difficulty, however, of using it for scraping is that you'll have to use XPath and trust that the input XHTML is valid.  regexps won't work, because the close tags don't include the \"id\" or \"class\" attributes, so nested close tags won't match correctly with simple regexps.\r\n\r\nbut then, we're all told that scraping and regexps are kludges anyway, so I guess we shouldn't be using them any more ;)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084970\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb7f2a3ba74af37415ab7df101a86c75&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084970\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-09T16:09:29\">2005-05-09T16:09:29</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Well, the thing about the microformats, if I recall, is that you have to at least start with well-formed XHTML.  Otherwise, your microformatted content is broken.\r\n\r\nThat said, though, I've been using Python's HTMLParser to lift data out of microformat content with a lot of success.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084971\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://tantek.com/log/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02cd45622e90350cc061aaaa02229195&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://tantek.com/log/\">Tantek</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084971\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-09T23:34:35\">2005-05-09T23:34:35</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Leslie, that's exactly right.  More and more blogging tools publish in well-formed XHTML by default and are  becoming better and better at \"tidying\" ill-formed markup into well-formed markup.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, right now you can get started with a bit of a hybrid approach:  you can use a regexp to find the *start* of a microformat such as hCard, hCalendar, hReview, XOXO etc. simply by looking for class attributes that contain the right value.  Then at that point, you can hand the stream over to an XML parser to process the well-formed microformatted markup and handle the structured data as you wish!\r\n\r\nTantek</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084973\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.metafy.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=314b3139fd18612a532413debb27279a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.metafy.com\">joe @ metafy</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084973\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-10T14:59:25\">2005-05-10T14:59:25</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I remember that presentation at WWDC last year or the year before in which the very nice Sara ? explains that scraping is for H4x0Rs, to which I commented to her afterward that it's actually for 3L337 H4x0Rs...\r\n\r\nI particularly enjoy the \"Scraping is Fun\" bent of this thread, so I thought I'd bang my own drum a little to show how much I enjoy it, too:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.metafy.com/products/anthracite/\r\n\r\nIt works great with Perl (or any other UNIX command) and AppleScript now, and even better later this week when we release the Automator actions for Anthracite (whoops, not supposed to say that yet until they're all done)...\r\n\r\nAmong other nifty things you can do with it today are convert the results of a Google search into an RSS feed, and/or search those results via Spotlight.\r\n\r\nI hope it helps you enjoy scraping even more!\r\n\r\nJoe @ Metafy\r\nBoulder, Colorado USA</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084975\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://ransom.dyndns.ws\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3c2c53afc4e0af6c1b091b185096a4e5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://ransom.dyndns.ws\">Doug Ransom</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084975\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-23T00:52:56\">2005-05-23T00:52:56</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Here is a microformat I proposed a couple years ago http://internetalchemy.org/2003/04/rssInXHTML\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, I think the microformat concept is great.  If an html author can at least use CSS nicely, its trivial to create an RSS with tidy + XSL (or any other way).  Thats useful if their content management system is some sort of lame html editing system that inserts the authors text into a template (i.e. only one page can be created from a single source) rather than generating markup for several pages (html, rss) from a content source.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

(though I think the really promise doesn't lie with generalist, but domain specific aggregators developed by small affinity groups)\r\n\r\nIf you do have good enough tools to provide the data in a more structured way then by all means *do* it, more elegant, easier to consume, more meaningful, less ambiguous, easier to grok, etc. \r\n\r\nmod_event is *much* more useful then hCalendar in the context of feeds, but perhaps its non-obvious because you're thinking of it from the context of S-to-P (site to person) syndication, but where it comes in very useful is S-to-S (site to site) syndication, the original RSS design goal.\r\n\r\nadditionally the joy of XML means you can mix in other namespaces to enrich mod_event's intentionally limited expressiveness.  in particular we've played with mixing in vCard and geo namespaces to get more specific\r\n\r\nas for your last question, i've seen several hundred feeds with mod_event, but i'm kind of odd like that :)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085747\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=475a543984769e9890f8dc0091f602c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/\">Phillip Pearson</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085747\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-05T20:17:32\">2005-05-05T20:17:32</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Exactly -- from the perspective of trying to maximize usefulness, it's great to put your \"semantic markup\" in both the feed and the data.\r\n\r\nIt depends on your target market, of course... if nobody will ever scrape your site but you have an aggregator of calendar events watching your feed like a hawk, then the feed is most important.\r\n\r\nBut if you're just kicking off a new market, you might as well do it in a way that makes the most sense for the future...which is what this seems to be.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085748\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://tantek.com/log/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02cd45622e90350cc061aaaa02229195&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://tantek.com/log/\">Tantek</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085748\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-08T12:42:02\">2005-05-08T12:42:02</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">You've made an excellent observation.\r\n\r\nDoes one have to request permission from the envelope makers before one writes a letter in a different way? \r\n\r\nDoes it make sense to ask everyone to write envelopes differently just because you've figured out a new way to write letters or new things to put in your letters?\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense to feel obligated to duplicate the information in your letter on the envelope as well?\r\n\r\nOf course not.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, feeds are nothing more than another medium for passing messages, and just as there was no need to change nor extend TCP/IP to handle HTTP or HTML for that matter, there is no need to change RSS/Atom to handle new types of content which are well described by portable microformats.\r\n\r\nTantek\r\n\r\nP.S.

It&#39;s kinda like videos we tried making in high school, only with a budget.  I can&#39;t breathe, and coffee keeps shooting out my nose.  I can only hope that this condition isn&#39;t permanent.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Considering the <code>mdls</code> and <code>mdfind</code> commands on Tiger gives me an idea toward making an über-Blosxom.  (I&#39;m really abusing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber\">über</a> lately.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I hope someone works out a way to tie Spotlight to indexing arbitrary HFS extended attributes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Times like these, I wish I was developing software for Mac :)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Under Tiger, it seems like CPU and memory consumption are markedly reduced.

I like the new split-pane, versus the drawer, but I want my old toolbar and window style back.  \r\n\r\n  And I *definitely* don't want third-party developers getting the idea that this is the keen new thing and changing *their* toolbars to this style.\r\n\r\n[m2]: http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars/3\r\n\r\n* I'm reading about things like [file system metadata in Tiger][fsm]--*BeFS über alles!*--and seeing the author express suspicions and point to signs of various decisions divined from hints half-buried in semi-obscure documentation.  \r\n\r\n  It makes me wonder what it'd be like reading this as an in-house Apple developer, or as someone behind the wall of an NDA.  That is, having been *in* the real group huddles and meetings, writing code and committing changes, seeing the actual whiteboards at work.\r\n  \r\n  I think about when I see someone report on something I've been involved in.  Sometimes I'm amazed at the differences--or similarities--between my reality over here and the reality pieced together by the person reporting things.\r\n  \r\n  Seems kinda like a weird game of charades where I'm not necessarily trying to help you figure out what I'm thinking.\r\n\r\n[fsm]: http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars/9\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087337\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9b71d738d26738a90411501ac572ceaf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Scott</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087337\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-05-04T06:41:10\">2005-05-04T06:41:10</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Tiger link at the top is borked.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

Very few people have this luxury, even in the \"civilized,\" \"modern\" world.\r\n\r\nPS.: I was going to ask you to enable at least some rudimentary markup such as italics, blockquotes and the like, since you moderate your comments anyway. Then I noticed in preview that you're running your comments through Markdown.

And, on the other hand, if you \"just mention the important bits\", you're fragmenting the concept and left without a single workable handle again.\r\n  \r\n  [seven]:http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html\r\n  \r\n  Oh well, I'd better stop auditioning as amateur cognitive scientist now, before I follow through with this impulse to find some way to recast the whole \"[Eskimos have 100 words for snow][eskimos]\" myth to suit web developers.\r\n  \r\n   [eskimos]:http://www.public.iastate.edu/~honeyl/derrida/eskimos.html\r\n    \r\n   [hix]:http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1111339822&#38;count=1\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083773\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=49fa0e19d460d0717dd06b1862d94eb5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/\">Ryan Tomayko</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083773\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-22T10:49:04\">2005-03-22T10:49:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I had the same feeling when reading that post.

I like REST from a purist theoretical standpoint, but I like the fact that with SOAP (and XML-RPC) I can just call the functions I want from my programming language just like any other function, and all of the wacky marshalling and unmarshalling happens automatically.\nWith REST APIs, unless they are just returning raw data as the answer, you must parse whatever was returned to get the answer you were looking for.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083203\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://lion.taoriver.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b49f34733c8d7cf1120f83d6c21433df&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://lion.taoriver.net/\">Lion Kimbro</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083203\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-18T02:11:55\">2005-03-18T02:11:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Hm. I first used XML-RPC. Then, at the nudging of some friends, did HTTP programming. But now I'm moving back into XML-RPC land.\nWhy?\nBecause I haven't found a nice easy way to do RPC over HTTP in Python.\nTo make a simple call for some data by HTTP, I have to construct a query string, make the call, get the results, interpret them according to all the various details of HTTP (mainly MIME type and encoding possibilities, but it seems like I keep finding more little details to be respected as time goes by,) and then perform further interpretation of the returned document.\nSo, XML-RPC (or SOAP; they're practically identical) is looking much nicer again.\nPeople say, \"But it's so complicated!\" And originally I was swayed by the argument. But, you know: After lots of frustration with figuring out how to communicate encoding, I said to myself: \"Lion, HTTP isn't simple. It's primitive.\"\nIn XML-RPC, the only time I ever had to think about how it worked, was when I transfered DateTime values. But aside from that, everything else just worked. And I got so much stuff for free- Self-documenting servers by GET, introspection by XML-RPC, automaticly unpacked data.\nSure, it may be complex underneath. I guess. (It's an XML format, it doesn't strike me as so wild.) Sure, it may be overhead.\nBut I know I get a lot more done with it, when I use it.\nSo, my sympathies have returned to XML-RPC.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

I like REST from a purist theoretical standpoint, but I like the fact that with SOAP (and XML-RPC) I can just call the functions I want from my programming language just like any other function, and all of the wacky marshalling and unmarshalling happens automatically.\r\n\r\nWith REST APIs, unless they are just returning raw data as the answer, you must parse whatever was returned to get the answer you were looking for.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083203\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://lion.taoriver.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b49f34733c8d7cf1120f83d6c21433df&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://lion.taoriver.net/\">Lion Kimbro</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083203\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-18T02:11:55\">2005-03-18T02:11:55</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Hm. I first used XML-RPC. Then, at the nudging of some friends, did HTTP programming. But now I'm moving back into XML-RPC land.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nBecause I haven't found a nice easy way to do RPC over HTTP in Python.\r\n\r\nTo make a simple call for some data by HTTP, I have to construct a query string, make the call, get the results, interpret them according to all the various details of HTTP (mainly MIME type and encoding possibilities, but it seems like I keep finding more little details to be respected as time goes by,) and then perform further interpretation of the returned document.\r\n\r\nSo, XML-RPC (or SOAP; they're practically identical) is looking much nicer again.\r\n\r\nPeople say, \"But it's so complicated!\" And originally I was swayed by the argument. But, you know: After lots of frustration with figuring out how to communicate encoding, I said to myself: \"Lion, HTTP isn't simple. It's primitive.\"\r\n\r\nIn XML-RPC, the only time I ever had to think about how it worked, was when I transfered DateTime values. But aside from that, everything else just worked. And I got so much stuff for free- Self-documenting servers by GET, introspection by XML-RPC, automaticly unpacked data.\r\n\r\nSure, it may be complex underneath. I guess. (It's an XML format, it doesn't strike me as so wild.) Sure, it may be overhead.\r\n\r\nBut I know I get a lot more done with it, when I use it.\r\n\r\nSo, my sympathies have returned to XML-RPC.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

It uses the python applescript bindings (via gensuitemodule, not any of the modern stuff) and just wakes up and scans all of the winodws for a url, and keeps a log of changes.  Problem is, applescript can't \"see\" tabs at all, so it won't save anything but the one you have immediately open.

Stable, that is, except [when the odd Flash movie appears and seizes the whole thing up][flash] and I'm forced to euthanize it.  That, and, it seems to \"leak\" CPU usage--no matter how many windows and tabs I've closed, after a few hours usage, FireFox eventually grows to consume all available CPU until I quit and restart.\r\n  \r\n[flash]:http://george.hotelling.net/90percent/os_x/firefox_flash_and_os_x.php\r\n\r\n  Eventually, one or another annoyance with whichever of these two browsers I'm using drives me to start using the other.  I've got about a 14-20 day cycle going on between them.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087132\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://monket.samedi-studios.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a2ca4341abe663426bd058b124bd22f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://monket.samedi-studios.com\">Crutcher Dunnavant</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087132\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-17T10:55:04\">2005-03-17T10:55:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I've ended up using Camino for similar reasons.

What a nightmare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I ended up uninstalling then reinstalling Firefox, without the No Script extension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as I'm concerned, the worst part of the internet is the web browser. They all suck. During my problems with Firefox No Script, I tried to lauch Opera, Avant, and IE. They could not find any servers, as though my broadband connection was not working. Netscape worked, but it is so buggy, it's worthless. My blog, for example, was actually flashing and endlessly reloading the main page. Weird.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I play bouncing browsers quite often.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Love your book, Hacking Rss and Atom.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

The new Yahoo web services are nice, and I&#39;ve already been enjoying Amazon&#39;s web services.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>But, speaking of SOAP: <a href=\"http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/18/WS-Oppo\">For the sake of sanity</a>, I&#39;ve mostly been keeping my brain out of the tumult surrounding SOAP and WS-Tech.  I was tracking things a few years ago, but have since wandered away.</p>\n<p>I think I really need to dip into it again, though, because I catch myself regarding this behemoth of technologies as stupid and worthless--a reaction which I&#39;ve been coming to consider as a red flag on my own ignorance, especially when there are a lot of smart people still seeing value in the same thing.  </p>\n<p>Part of it, I suspect, is that I tend not to use rich IDE&#39;s on a daily basis, and I&#39;m perfectly happy dealing with REST-style APIs using XPath to extract data and using DOM or string templates to send data.  It seems so easy to me that I wonder just what I&#39;m missing.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve heard that SOAP and friends brings a lot of joy to people who can just drag-and-drop a schema or self-describing blob into their favorite tool and have all the webbish bits hidden behind native-looking calls and code.  But, for the most part, I just don&#39;t get it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I don&#39;t like working with Microsoft technologies much.

I'm currently agitating for turning the stack inside out, and making the SOAP shims run on top of HTTP interfaces... and then give up on the SOAP parts if it turns out that they *really* get no developer traction.  (Groove gets some blame for the SOAP hype, but it doesn't seem to have resulted in any actual code for this app...)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "* I know I've already mentioned it, but man I wish Google had a REST-style API.  The new Yahoo web services are nice, and I've already been enjoying Amazon's web services.\r\n\r\n* But, speaking of SOAP: [For the sake of sanity][wsopp], I've mostly been keeping my brain out of the tumult surrounding SOAP and WS-Tech.  I was tracking things a few years ago, but have since wandered away.\r\n\r\n  I think I really need to dip into it again, though, because I catch myself regarding this behemoth of technologies as stupid and worthless--a reaction which I've been coming to consider as a red flag on my own ignorance, especially when there are a lot of smart people still seeing value in the same thing.  \r\n  \r\n  Part of it, I suspect, is that I tend not to use rich IDE's on a daily basis, and I'm perfectly happy dealing with REST-style APIs using XPath to extract data and using DOM or string templates to send data.  It seems so easy to me that I wonder just what I'm missing.\r\n  \r\n  I've heard that SOAP and friends brings a lot of joy to people who can just drag-and-drop a schema or self-describing blob into their favorite tool and have all the webbish bits hidden behind native-looking calls and code.  But, for the most part, I just don't get it.\r\n\r\n* I don't like working with Microsoft technologies much.  However, it is what we use at work, between legacy ASP 3.0 pages and a smattering of .NET stuff we've been gradually phasing in.  \r\n\r\n  One thing I do have to admit is satisfying, though, is using Windows Scripting Host with JScript to pry data out of Word documents and MSSQL tables to build a pile of XML documents--mostly because I didn't think it would work.\r\n\r\n[wsopp]:http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/18/WS-Oppo\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085932\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085932\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-09T18:34:55\">2005-03-09T18:34:55</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Sometimes I wonder if it's just the hacker mentality or instant gratification, but whenever I dig into SOAP, I get bored with it and want to move on.

No fiddling with the DOM required... the developer doesn't even have to think about XML, since it's all handled for her.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085948\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.thok.org/bloggery\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2545d4ff0ba72eb5d5979186f4b02d85&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.thok.org/bloggery\">Mark Eichin</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085948\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-10T11:29:46\">2005-03-10T11:29:46</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">But then, if really bright people like Norm Walsh (\"Mr. Docbook\") have trouble with WS-* (see his current blog thread on building a service) maybe there's something to the theory that they are as broken as they look :-)  I'm certainly regretting a project choice to use SOAP about 2 years ago; the APIs that are actually getting used now are HTTP (not-even-REST) shims that make the SOAP calls underneath, but http support *works* and is *efficient* in every language that anyone actually uses, which isn't true of SOAP... I'm currently agitating for turning the stack inside out, and making the SOAP shims run on top of HTTP interfaces... and then give up on the SOAP parts if it turns out that they *really* get no developer traction.  (Groove gets some blame for the SOAP hype, but it doesn't seem to have resulted in any actual code for this app...)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

Finally, my hunch is confirmed that Battlestar Galactica's opening sequence with episode preview is \"an homage to Space 1999\".\r\n\r\n[bgal]:http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/  \r\n  \r\n* Lately, my favorite thing to toss back at Podcast naysayers: Dismissing Podcasts because of issues of quality or amateurism is like dismissing eBay because people try [selling their used sneakers][sneakers] there.\r\n\r\n[sneakers]:http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#38;category=63889&#38;item=5367710154&#38;rd=1\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile, I've just about got a full commute to and from work filled with pretty good quality content--or at least decently entertaining content (to me)--to the point that I've almost stopped listening to NPR.  Also, it's becoming a rapidly heating issue at work--not sure if it will go where I hope it does, but I've started getting drafted to educate some co-workers in other departments.\r\n  \r\n[brant]:http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/z2005-03-03-PodcastRant/\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085399\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.cleverdevil.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=755c2b459dbfd42c96a3066c94e94a31&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.cleverdevil.org\">Jonathan LaCour</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085399\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-07T21:29:30\">2005-03-07T21:29:30</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I haven't been able to find much in the way of podcasts that I enjoy nearly as much as National Public Radio from end to end.

    "html": "<p>I&#39;m almost proud, yet considering <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestration\">defenestration</a>:  </p>\n<p>  Our &quot;plus-size&quot; female cat has learned that I tend to get up around 6AM now, and shortly after I get up, I feed her and her brother.  She&#39;s also learned that jumping onto The Girl&#39;s dresser, covered in clinky bottles and delicate things, tends to make me wake instantly and lunge out of bed--sometimes pulling my CPAP mask out of its hose--to retrieve her before she starts knocking things over for the pretty sounds they make.</p>\n<p>  Now, both our cats tend to start doing restless foraging things when they&#39;re hungry.  Cabinets open and close, forbidden shelves get jumped upon, running around happens.  And, that&#39;s why the dresser-jumping started, I think.  Unfortunately, this past weekend, I made the mistake of storming down the stairs once and feeding the cats, after having been woken up two hours early by tinkling nail-polish bottles.</p>\n<p>  Oh ho!  She&#39;s a fast one, she is.  It didn&#39;t take her long to make a connection:  This morning, she was like a snooze alarm 1/2 hour early.  Our bed is positioned such that there&#39;s about a 3-foot leap from its end, to the dresser of delicates.  She made sure to leap from atop one of my ankles at the foot of the bed and onto the dresser; when I lunged out of bed, she hopped down immediately and ran out of the room.  I went back to bed.  </p>\n<p>  Just as I started falling back asleep, she was back, and this time launched onto the dresser using my toes as a platform.  Another lunge, another run out of the room.  This happened once more before the alarm finally went off, which was good because the sleepy girl lying next to me was probably about ready to defenestrate cat and boyfriend both.

    "body": "I'm almost proud, yet considering [defenestration][defe]:  \r\n  \r\n  Our \"plus-size\" female cat has learned that I tend to get up around 6AM now, and shortly after I get up, I feed her and her brother.  She's also learned that jumping onto The Girl's dresser, covered in clinky bottles and delicate things, tends to make me wake instantly and lunge out of bed--sometimes pulling my CPAP mask out of its hose--to retrieve her before she starts knocking things over for the pretty sounds they make.\r\n  \r\n  Now, both our cats tend to start doing restless foraging things when they're hungry.  Cabinets open and close, forbidden shelves get jumped upon, running around happens.  And, that's why the dresser-jumping started, I think.  Unfortunately, this past weekend, I made the mistake of storming down the stairs once and feeding the cats, after having been woken up two hours early by tinkling nail-polish bottles.\r\n  \r\n  Oh ho!  She's a fast one, she is.  It didn't take her long to make a connection:  This morning, she was like a snooze alarm 1/2 hour early.  Our bed is positioned such that there's about a 3-foot leap from its end, to the dresser of delicates.  She made sure to leap from atop one of my ankles at the foot of the bed and onto the dresser; when I lunged out of bed, she hopped down immediately and ran out of the room.  I went back to bed.  \r\n  \r\n  Just as I started falling back asleep, she was back, and this time launched onto the dresser using my toes as a platform.  Another lunge, another run out of the room.  This happened once more before the alarm finally went off, which was good because the sleepy girl lying next to me was probably about ready to defenestrate cat and boyfriend both.  When I finally got up, she led me to the food, chirping and mewing smugly the whole way.\r\n  \r\n  Tonight, I sleep with a squirt gun under my pillow.\r\n\r\n[defe]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestration\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090766\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://littlefros.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1532e95dac29ca2fb58aee01baa4cff0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://littlefros.com\">adampsyche</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090766\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-02T09:44:54\">2005-03-02T09:44:54</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Thank you for introducing me to my new favorite word.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090767\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.bobtheking.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3dfb53a940519b1d93a17efc1200d633&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.bobtheking.com\">Jeramey Jannene</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090767\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-02T13:07:04\">2005-03-02T13:07:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">My cat is slowly learning that I need to take my shoes off before I will walk over and pet her when I get home.

The proper place for this is in the aggregator, but it could be a fun project for the book.\r\n\r\n[jcc]:http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/02/19/tonights_items_of_little_import#comment-4323\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087952\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=81717a172b6918071fbea1a52483294b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/\">Dougal Campbell</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087952\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-02-22T09:30:39\">2005-02-22T09:30:39</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Les, what kind of problems did you run into with WordPress?

Today, there&#39;s lots of support for it, and it&#39;s even found its way into browsers.  But, well, it still doesn&#39;t solve the problem of people clicking on those darn candy-like <img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/images/xml.gif\" /> buttons.</p>\n<p>So, then some folks came up with <a href=\"http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/06/feeddemon_and_t.html\">a new feed:// protocol for feed URLs</a>.  It seems there&#39;s just too much <a href=\"http://pirate.typepad.com/blog/2003/09/problems_with_m.html\">gone wrong with MIME types</a> and the like.  When I first heard of feed://, I thought it was a weird and ugly hack, but I never piped up because I was too busy at the time, didn&#39;t know much of the details, and was too busy to be bothered to catch up.  Besides, other people were <a href=\"http://alpha-geek.com/2004/09/20/inelegant\">grousing about it</a> already.  And, later, I saw that a slew of aggregators were supporting it, so I figured it must not have been that bad, although I still thought it was odd to kludge around a new URL &quot;protocol&quot; just to pass a feed URL to an aggregator.</p>\n<p>But, in the comment above, Phil makes a suggestion that seems ideal to me.  Don&#39;t link to feeds directly, don&#39;t use a funky protocol, link to a &quot;playlist&quot; of feeds.  URLs linking to MP3 playlists (ie. the <a href=\"http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=65772\">informally specified</a> M3U and PLS files) seem to get tossed and handled just fine by your preferred media player.  I don&#39;t even know how the MIME-type situation is handled with M3U or PLS links, but it seems to work just fine nonetheless.</p>\n<p>And, wasn&#39;t there this <a href=\"http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/rsd\">Really Simple Discovery</a> thing published a long time ago?  Point a weblog management tool at your site, it looks for <code>rsd.xml</code>, and it gets all the funky URLs it needs for web services from there?</p>\n<p>What if we circled back around with <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/30/rss_autodiscovery\">autodiscovery</a> and published a file like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;feeds xmlns=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2005/01/feeds&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; title=&quot;Full RSS&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/index.rdf&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot; title=&quot;Full Atom&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/atom.xml&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; title=&quot;Blog-only RSS&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/index.rdf&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot; title=&quot;Blog-only Atom&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/atom.xml&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; title=&quot;Links-only RSS&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/links/index.rdf&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot; title=&quot;Links-only Atom&quot; \n         href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/links/atom.xml&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/feeds&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Name it something like <code>feeds.fss</code>, link your candy-like buttons to it, and register applications to handle that extension.  Give it a MIME-type, and handle that too.  Sounds just like M3U and PLS files, to me.  Someone tell me why this is a dumb idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>:  Just to clarify, <a href=\"http://jaeger.blogmatrix.com/weblog/archives/2005_01.shtml#003186\">before anyone thinks</a> I&#39;m just railing against Dave Winer personally--I made a comment below about not liking OPML.  Well, I don&#39;t, at least not for this particular purpose.

Since there is no path, the server typically returns a home page as some prespecified page or by redirection.\nTo find the feed playlist, the browser could do a default GET on the URL with an accept MIME type of \"application/atom+xml\" (which is already registered). The browser does not need to know the name of the file or its extension - it just needs to know the server and the MIME type.\nThe file returned by a default GET with an accept type of application/atom+xml would be the \"feed list\" for the site.

You're looking at the page, mouse hovering over a link to the feed, and you want to click on it, hoping it'll do the right thing.\nSo, really, you wouldn't ever need to autodiscover a \"playlist\".  If you want autodiscovery, put the playlist contents in the HTML head tag.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

Today, there's lots of support for it, and it's even found its way into browsers.  But, well, it still doesn't solve the problem of people clicking on those darn candy-like <img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/images/xml.gif\" /> buttons.\r\n\r\nSo, then some folks came up with [a new feed:// protocol for feed URLs][feed].  It seems there's just too much [gone wrong with MIME types][mimewrong] and the like.  When I first heard of feed://, I thought it was a weird and ugly hack, but I never piped up because I was too busy at the time, didn't know much of the details, and was too busy to be bothered to catch up.  Besides, other people were [grousing about it][grouse] already.  And, later, I saw that a slew of aggregators were supporting it, so I figured it must not have been that bad, although I still thought it was odd to kludge around a new URL \"protocol\" just to pass a feed URL to an aggregator.\r\n\r\nBut, in the comment above, Phil makes a suggestion that seems ideal to me.  Don't link to feeds directly, don't use a funky protocol, link to a \"playlist\" of feeds.  URLs linking to MP3 playlists (ie. the [informally specified][winamp] M3U and PLS files) seem to get tossed and handled just fine by your preferred media player.  I don't even know how the MIME-type situation is handled with M3U or PLS links, but it seems to work just fine nonetheless.\r\n\r\nAnd, wasn't there this [Really Simple Discovery][rsd] thing published a long time ago?  Point a weblog management tool at your site, it looks for `rsd.xml`, and it gets all the funky URLs it needs for web services from there?\r\n\r\nWhat if we circled back around with [autodiscovery][autodiscovery] and published a file like this:\r\n\r\n    <feeds xmlns=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/01/feeds\">\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" title=\"Full RSS\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/index.rdf\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/atom+xml\" title=\"Full Atom\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/atom.xml\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" title=\"Blog-only RSS\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/index.rdf\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/atom+xml\" title=\"Blog-only Atom\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/atom.xml\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" title=\"Links-only RSS\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/links/index.rdf\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/atom+xml\" title=\"Links-only Atom\" \r\n             href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/links/atom.xml\" />\r\n    </feeds>\r\n    \r\nName it something like `feeds.fss`, link your candy-like buttons to it, and register applications to handle that extension.  Give it a MIME-type, and handle that too.  Sounds just like M3U and PLS files, to me.  Someone tell me why this is a dumb idea.\r\n\r\n**Update**:  Just to clarify, [before anyone thinks][anyone] I'm just railing against Dave Winer personally--I made a comment below about not liking OPML.  Well, I don't, at least not for this particular purpose.  But, my preferences aside, it's undeniable that most aggregators support OPML import/export in one form or another, so the above example could probably be expressed as OPML with all the same data.\r\n\r\nJust one thing, though (and this is part of why I don't like OPML for this):  On my machine, OPML outlines and files with an \".opml\" extension open with OmniOutliner.

Personally, I'd rather avoid OPML and re-use what we have for autodiscovery headers.  I wouldn't necessarily want to see this file used *literally* like a playlist or an OPML subscription list.  \r\n\r\nUsually OPML is used for wholesale import/export of your subscriptions, whereas autodiscovery headers tend to be used to provide a choice.  \r\n\r\nNot that OPML couldn't be used this way, too, but I do have to admit I don't like OPML much.

I certainly see a trivial \"pop up those titles in a list, when the user selects one, throw it at the configured reader\" app, if that format is nailed down I might toss one together...\r\n\r\nThe key is to have a well-known-extension *and* a mime type, so that both lame tools and Proper ones can do the right thing. (The extension can't be OPML of course, because it is the *verb*, but I don't care what syntax is used as long as it has a human readable label...)  Oh, and that extension should replace XML on the candy buttons - because the word XML has \"always\" been wrong, in that it made about much sense as saying \"ASCII\" or \"UTF-8\" there - but it *did* make the value of candy-like buttons really really clear, and it deserves credit for that...\r\n\r\nFSS will do, I don't see it in my local (aggressively updated debian) mime.types at least -- there's some artistic value in having it be \".feed\" instead though...</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090364\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090364\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-13T18:43:02\">2005-01-13T18:43:02</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Jim: A browser plugin - who'd install that? :)\r\n\r\nDid you have to install a browser plugin the last time you clicked on the URL to a streaming station to make it startup in WinAmp or iTunes?

It would be a bit like having a greeting card printing program register itself as the handler for all JPEGs.\r\n\r\nFunny thing about this idea, though: after I mentioned Atom being able to do mime-type handling, with a link rel=\"start\" included in the feed, I looked at the current version of the format spec, and it seems to not do that, but instead has a link to a separate introspection file, which is basically an Atom playlist.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090366\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=769084f2da2ebbc1e483af3f0e72adaa&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Jim</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090366\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-13T22:59:38\">2005-01-13T22:59:38</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">> A browser plugin - who’d install that?\r\n\r\nThe aggregator installer.\r\n\r\nThe only trouble I can imagine with the plugin idea is if different aggregators all wanted to install their own plugin.

Since there is no path, the server typically returns a home page as some prespecified page or by redirection.\r\n\r\nTo find the feed playlist, the browser could do a default GET on the URL with an accept MIME type of \"application/atom+xml\" (which is already registered). The browser does not need to know the name of the file or its extension - it just needs to know the server and the MIME type.\r\n\r\nThe file returned by a default GET with an accept type of application/atom+xml would be the \"feed list\" for the site.

You're looking at the page, mouse hovering over a link to the feed, and you want to click on it, hoping it'll do the right thing.\r\n\r\nSo, really, you wouldn't ever need to autodiscover a \"playlist\".

The word \"Joe\" should be replaced by a link to the node for the whole person, Joe. (If you wanted to know that person's name, it the node for the person Joe would have an attribute \"first name\" that linked to \"Joe.\") The destination, in turn, links to the node for Frank. The *time* links to a temporal node, which may be a virtual node on a continuum. Finally, the message is an attribute that links to the particular string.\nThis is a MUCH more powerful model, because you can look at the graph, and say, \"Show me everything that happened from time t1 to time t2,\" and it will mesh with the entire system.\nIn fact, you can say, \"Let me know whenever a message is posted between time t3-t4 where the target is Frank.\"</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085217\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://creativekarma.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b581950de350ed6ad83f09ec48a6be3f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://creativekarma.com/\">Doug</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085217\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-14T01:09:55\">2005-01-14T01:09:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Since I don't understand either concept in detail, I'll ignorantly ask, \"Is this somehow different from the Semantic Web?\" They sound the same to me.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085219\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jamesbritt.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ff9e18f0699bf079f1fc91c8d4506438&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jamesbritt.com\">James Britt</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085219\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-18T10:29:22\">2005-01-18T10:29:22</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\"Since I don't understand either concept in detail, I'll ignorantly ask, 'Is this somehow different from the Semantic Web?' They sound the same to me\"\nGood question.  The description of tuples as a vector of attributes looks just like del.icio.us.  Bookmarks (i.e., resources) are the marbles.  You can ask for resources by some tag vector:\n[ 'Ruby', 'XML', 'Rinda' ]\nand see what comes back.\nOne interesting difference is that the tags do not (currently, that I know of) have types.  The Python example shows the use of type selectors (e.g., include as a criteria any Integer).  Tags on del.icio.us (and probably all folksonomy sites) are unclassified.  You cannot, for example, ask for all resource with tags related to database programming; something has to know that this request set includes more than just those resources explicitly tagged 'database-programming'.  You would likely also want resource tagged 'mysql-programming', and so on.  (And this is the harder part: the metadata itself needs metadata to define such higher-level groupings. To get a richer navigation scheme, it would be good if tags/topics were assigned to facets. )\nBut even without such sophistication the use of tagged resources is very much like tuple spaces.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085220\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://thefourthplace.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b96fe040c899286ba7ec28e05aab6e5f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://thefourthplace.net/\">Simon Gibbs</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085220\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-20T07:57:40\">2005-01-20T07:57:40</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">You are talking about the Semantic Web, RDF in particular, though you can indirectly derive tuples from X/HTML too. blockquote, used with cite, is a great example, and link, meta etc as well.\n\"this is the harder part: the metadata itself needs metadata to define such higher-level groupings\"\nThis is what OWL does.

The word \"Joe\" should be replaced by a link to the node for the whole person, Joe. (If you wanted to know that person's name, it the node for the person Joe would have an attribute \"first name\" that linked to \"Joe.\") The destination, in turn, links to the node for Frank. The *time* links to a temporal node, which may be a virtual node on a continuum. Finally, the message is an attribute that links to the particular string.\r\n\r\nThis is a MUCH more powerful model, because you can look at the graph, and say, \"Show me everything that happened from time t1 to time t2,\" and it will mesh with the entire system.\r\n\r\nIn fact, you can say, \"Let me know whenever a message is posted between time t3-t4 where the target is Frank.\"</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085217\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://creativekarma.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b581950de350ed6ad83f09ec48a6be3f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://creativekarma.com/\">Doug</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085217\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-14T01:09:55\">2005-01-14T01:09:55</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Since I don't understand either concept in detail, I'll ignorantly ask, \"Is this somehow different from the Semantic Web?\" They sound the same to me.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085219\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.jamesbritt.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ff9e18f0699bf079f1fc91c8d4506438&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.jamesbritt.com\">James Britt</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085219\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-18T10:29:22\">2005-01-18T10:29:22</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">\"Since I don't understand either concept in detail, I'll ignorantly ask, 'Is this somehow different from the Semantic Web?' They sound the same to me\"\r\n\r\nGood question.  The description of tuples as a vector of attributes looks just like del.icio.us.  Bookmarks (i.e., resources) are the marbles.  You can ask for resources by some tag vector:\r\n[ 'Ruby', 'XML', 'Rinda' ]\r\nand see what comes back.\r\n\r\nOne interesting difference is that the tags do not (currently, that I know of) have types.  The Python example shows the use of type selectors (e.g., include as a criteria any Integer).  Tags on del.icio.us (and probably all folksonomy sites) are unclassified.  You cannot, for example, ask for all resource with tags related to database programming; something has to know that this request set includes more than just those resources explicitly tagged 'database-programming'.  You would likely also want resource tagged 'mysql-programming', and so on.  (And this is the harder part: the metadata itself needs metadata to define such higher-level groupings. To get a richer navigation scheme, it would be good if tags/topics were assigned to facets. )\r\n\r\nBut even without such sophistication the use of tagged resources is very much like tuple spaces.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085220\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://thefourthplace.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b96fe040c899286ba7ec28e05aab6e5f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://thefourthplace.net/\">Simon Gibbs</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085220\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-20T07:57:40\">2005-01-20T07:57:40</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">You are talking about the Semantic Web, RDF in particular, though you can indirectly derive tuples from X/HTML too. blockquote, used with cite, is a great example, and link, meta etc as well.\r\n\r\n\"this is the harder part: the metadata itself needs metadata to define such higher-level groupings\"\r\n\r\nThis is what OWL does. For example, ((url),(topic),(mysql-programming))\r\n is a \"specialisation\" of the tuple ((url),(topic),(database-programming)).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.w3c.org for more.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    \r\n",

The disappearance of hyperlinks from online newspapers is due to a court case[1] in which the judge ruled that hyperlinks to copyrighted material were illegal.  Although this was a ruling against the 2600 website, other online newspapers have interpreted this to mean that they too could be held accountable for links to questionable sites.  But note that \"the judgment did not specifically prohibit 2600 from providing non-hyperlinked URLs of web sites that provide DeCSS\", which is why you'll find non-hyperlinked URLs at the end of, for example, some New York Times articles.\r\n\r\n[1] http://gsulaw.gsu.edu/lawand/papers/fa00/weiland/</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089741\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.DetroitWonk.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fffd82dd155e2315ef424947df052e21&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.DetroitWonk.com\">Ray</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089741\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-01-12T04:58:49\">2006-01-12T04:58:49</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Umm...Lutz has been blogging on FastLane for like...I dunno...half a year now?

    "html": "<blockquote>To me, in its simplest form, the beginner's mind is a state of eager anticipation of learning something new, but without preconceptions about what is to be learned.  For me, the great challenge -- and the great rewards -- of cultivating the beginner's mind lie in maintaining it in the face of actual learning.  Learning means building a knowledge base and conceptual framework.  Maintaining a beginner's mind means actively welcoming information and ideas that may require me to abandon what I've already built and to start building anew -- and to find joy in the task. </blockquote>\n<div align=\"right\"><small>Source: <cite><a href=\"http://www.beginners-mind.net/what_is.htm\">What is the Beginner's Mind?</a></cite></small></div>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been wondering lately whether I&#39;ve gone too far <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/06/13/oooaih\">in cultivating</a> what I understand as a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=beginner%27s+mind\">beginner&#39;s mind</a>&quot; in myself.  One of the roles I&#39;ve always wanted to grow into is that of an expert and a teacher, and part of that has been wanting to write more tutorial-style pieces for this place.  Having just gotten <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/07/belated_happy_new_year\">the opportunity to write a book</a> certainly makes me feel like I&#39;m making big progress toward this.  However, due to habits of thought I&#39;ve developed in adopting this &quot;beginner&#39;s mind&quot;, I&#39;ve been having trouble figuring out what&#39;s worth writing about and about what I&#39;m worthy of writing.</p>\n<p>In learning, I&#39;ve tried to keep an open and unassuming mind about things.  And even after I have learned quite a bit about something, and I can demonstrate obvious expertise with something to anyone who&#39;s watching, I still consider myself a beginner.  There&#39;s always someone who knows more about that thing than I do--from whom I want to learn even more--so I don&#39;t ever want to let myself feel like <em>I&#39;ve arrived</em> and allow my learning to be clouded.</p>\n<p>So herein lies the rub: If I&#39;m always a beginner, how can I ever be a teacher?  It&#39;s not so much a rational issue--it&#39;s more an issue of emotion and habits of thought.  Rationally, I think it&#39;s safe to say that as I learn about something, I climb up a ladder of experts&#39; shoulders.  And below me, still down the ladder, are other beginners doing the climb.  But where I run into trouble is in trying to figure out where I am on the ladder, and where and how I should make myself available as a rung.  Because, there are so many others at and above my level already providing their shoulders, and the climb still has so much farther yet to go above me.  </p>\n<p>Now this metaphor has its problems, since it&#39;s neither charitable nor useful to me to think of others as above or below me in any competitive or evaluative sense.  Although amassing a lot of skill and expertise can take me places and get me better compensation, this isn&#39;t a zero-sum game in my mind.</p>\n<p>But anyway, my hangup remains the same:  About what should I be writing, and who am I to be writing about it?</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t have any good answers yet.

But good teachers are always learning more about their subject. I don't think beginner's mind requires you to deny what you know or to unfairly slight yourself in comparison with others. What it requires is to be humble in the face of how much more you have yet to learn.\nPerhaps the way to apply beginner's mind here is in constantly making fresh appraisals of yourself and others, in always being open to opportunities to teach as well as to learn.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "<blockquote>To me, in its simplest form, the beginner's mind is a state of eager anticipation of learning something new, but without preconceptions about what is to be learned.  For me, the great challenge -- and the great rewards -- of cultivating the beginner's mind lie in maintaining it in the face of actual learning.  Learning means building a knowledge base and conceptual framework.  Maintaining a beginner's mind means actively welcoming information and ideas that may require me to abandon what I've already built and to start building anew -- and to find joy in the task. </blockquote>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><small>Source: <cite><a href=\"http://www.beginners-mind.net/what_is.htm\">What is the Beginner's Mind?</a></cite></small></div>\r\n\r\nI've been wondering lately whether I've gone too far [in cultivating][mymind] what I understand as a \"[beginner's mind][beginnersmind]\" in myself.  One of the roles I've always wanted to grow into is that of an expert and a teacher, and part of that has been wanting to write more tutorial-style pieces for this place.  Having just gotten [the opportunity to write a book][book] certainly makes me feel like I'm making big progress toward this.  However, due to habits of thought I've developed in adopting this \"beginner's mind\", I've been having trouble figuring out what's worth writing about and about what I'm worthy of writing.\r\n\r\nIn learning, I've tried to keep an open and unassuming mind about things.  And even after I have learned quite a bit about something, and I can demonstrate obvious expertise with something to anyone who's watching, I still consider myself a beginner.  There's always someone who knows more about that thing than I do--from whom I want to learn even more--so I don't ever want to let myself feel like *I've arrived* and allow my learning to be clouded.\r\n\r\nSo herein lies the rub: If I'm always a beginner, how can I ever be a teacher?  It's not so much a rational issue--it's more an issue of emotion and habits of thought.  Rationally, I think it's safe to say that as I learn about something, I climb up a ladder of experts' shoulders.  And below me, still down the ladder, are other beginners doing the climb.  But where I run into trouble is in trying to figure out where I am on the ladder, and where and how I should make myself available as a rung.  Because, there are so many others at and above my level already providing their shoulders, and the climb still has so much farther yet to go above me.  \r\n\r\nNow this metaphor has its problems, since it's neither charitable nor useful to me to think of others as above or below me in any competitive or evaluative sense.  Although amassing a lot of skill and expertise can take me places and get me better compensation, this isn't a zero-sum game in my mind.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, my hangup remains the same:  About what should I be writing, and who am I to be writing about it?\r\n\r\nI don't have any good answers yet.  There are a lot of things I know for which I don't have much regard--because back in my head I tell myself that they can't be worth too much since, well, *I* know them, and *I'm just a beginner*.  But then I catch some new trick or buzz making the rounds, and I realize that maybe I knew about it a few years ago and could've been writing reams about it.  \r\n\r\nI've thought that maybe I should start taking an inventory of all the things I think I can do and all the things I think I've learned.  Maybe I could put this list online, and ask anyone who cares to drop me a note or maybe cast a vote for whatever they think I should write about.\r\n\r\nBut, bah:  This sounds like a cute (as in My Little Pony) yet brain-dead (as in eating paint chips) idea to me, really.  It's a bit cloying like [Stuart Smalley][smalley] and the self-help book of the month.

And by teaching them you are bring them up to your level so both of you can learn the next level together.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083459\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=da828f7f73d835410ab83894eee2db42&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">William Pietri</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083459\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-01-24T17:01:51\">2005-01-24T17:01:51</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">You seem to think being a beginner and being a teacher are opposed. But good teachers are always learning more about their subject. I don't think beginner's mind requires you to deny what you know or to unfairly slight yourself in comparison with others. What it requires is to be humble in the face of how much more you have yet to learn.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the way to apply beginner's mind here is in constantly making fresh appraisals of yourself and others, in always being open to opportunities to teach as well as to learn.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",
