          <ul>
<li><p>I really shouldn&#39;t mess around with my caffeine intake: I really can&#39;t get started until after the first pot of the day--it&#39;s all self-doubt and spinning wheels until then.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I kinda miss my Trackbacks.  Have been insanely busy for about 3 months now--and at the first sign of Trackback spam, I just renamed the <code>mt-tb.cgi</code> and took it out of circulation rather than give it another thought.  I still have comments, but since MT 3.0, they&#39;re in full moderation mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I also miss IRC.  I haven&#39;t been putting any &quot;quality&quot; wasted time in there lately, and when occasionally I have poked my head in, it seems like all the channels I was idling in have gone quiet.  Or maybe they&#39;re just quieting down when I look.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Moving again - only this time, it&#39;s not between servers.  </p>
<p>With a week&#39;s notice and our current lease up at the end of the month, The Girl and I discovered a wonderful townhouse with cheaper rent and coveted wood floors about 8 blocks away from where we are now.  So...  here&#39;s hoping that the transfer of cable, internet, gas, and electric all go smooth this weekend!</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and I hope all the heavy furniture makes it, too.  Maybe the heavy lifting will make me lose some weight.  Last year, I threw an old mattress and box-spring from a third-floor balcony--too bad there&#39;ll be no such pleasures this time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Oh and I never mentioned it, but toward the end of last year I moved decafbad.com to new digs with <a href="http://george.hotelling.net/90percent/">George Hotelling</a> and company.  And, not long after settling in, <a href="http://george.hotelling.net/90percent/geekery/my_server_got_0wned.php">I helped get the server hacked</a> - hooray!</p>
<p>Now I just have to get some spare time to execute my yearly refresh.  And get back to blogging in earnest.</p>
</li>
