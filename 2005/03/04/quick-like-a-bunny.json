I probably need to edit things, but I hope the goofiness and sheer hack value comes through. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Speaking of Podcasts:  Check out the <a href=\"http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/\">Battlestar Galactica Podcast</a>.  It&#39;s like getting the DVD commentary track, but about a year early.  Finally, my hunch is confirmed that Battlestar Galactica&#39;s opening sequence with episode preview is &quot;an homage to Space 1999&quot;.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Lately, my favorite thing to toss back at Podcast naysayers: Dismissing Podcasts because of issues of quality or amateurism is like dismissing eBay because people try <a href=\"http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#38;category=63889&#38;item=5367710154&#38;rd=1\">selling their used sneakers</a> there.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  Meanwhile, I&#39;ve just about got a full commute to and from work filled with pretty good quality content--or at least decently entertaining content (to me)--to the point that I&#39;ve almost stopped listening to NPR.  Also, it&#39;s becoming a rapidly heating issue at work--not sure if it will go where I hope it does, but I&#39;ve started getting drafted to educate some co-workers in other departments.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085399\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.cleverdevil.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=755c2b459dbfd42c96a3066c94e94a31&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.cleverdevil.org\">Jonathan LaCour</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085399\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-07T21:29:30\">2005-03-07T21:29:30</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">I haven&#39;t been able to find much in the way of podcasts that I enjoy nearly as much as National Public Radio from end to end.  But I really like the other aspects of podcasting: timeshifting, listen anywhere you have your iPod, etc.\n\nSo, I created an application to help me listen to NPR on my iPod.  Let me know what you think.  I have the initial exploratory announcement on my website -&gt;  <a href=\"http://cleverdevil.org\">http://cleverdevil.org</a></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
