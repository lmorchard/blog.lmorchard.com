These are two things that I&#39;ve all but forgotten about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I can&#39;t pause or rewind--if I&#39;ve missed something, I&#39;ve missed it.  What if I want to take off for a minute to get some more coffee, or have a conversation with my girlfriend?</li>\n<li>Did you know that they actually prioritize a televised sports game over what the schedule said they were going to deliver?  (Don&#39;t they, like, have whole channels dedicated to that sort of thing now?)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#39;s funny: This sort of thing makes me feel kind of indignantly surprised.  I wonder if someday everyone will feel this way?</p>\n"}
