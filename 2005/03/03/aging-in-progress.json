This is a big step: I once had a car with plants growing out of the carpet on the passenger side.</li>\n<li>I quit smoking cold turkey a few years ago and, with the exception of one half-cigarette after losing a job (which only made things worse), I haven&#39;t started or been seriously tempted to start again.</li>\n<li>I don&#39;t eat out for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day anymore.  I&#39;ve even been known to bring leftovers to work for lunch.  This is a new thing for me.</li>\n<li>I haven&#39;t eaten at McDonald&#39;s in about 5 years, although I am still a sucker for Taco Bell occasionally.</li>\n<li>These days I drink water, coffee, tea, and milk--and I haven&#39;t had much more than a sip of Coke or some other sugar bomb in years.</li>\n<li>I&#39;m finally getting my hypoglycemic blood sugar swings under some semblance of control and maintaining mental coherence pretty much all day.</li>\n<li>I&#39;m actually starting to do things I&#39;ve always though of as Life Goals.  (Like, writing a book.)</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083309\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://techno-weenie.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=821395fe70906c8290df7f18ac4ac6cf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://techno-weenie.net\">rick</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083309\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-03T12:49:12\">2005-03-03T12:49:12</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">I feel the same way.
