[It's been 1000 days since Dave Winer stopped smoking.][smoke]  

  I think he's dead-on about smoking as a not-so-little expression of self-loathing and self-destruction--I know that it's one of the ways I used it.  Feeling my lungs crinkle like paper gave me a deep, perverse sort of satisfaction on certain nights.
  
  But, I do miss (and have never replaced) the social aspects, like taking a thinking break and gravitating to some common area where a bunch of other surly colleagues regularly appeared for chat and bitching.  I spend too much time habitually desk-chained these days.  Still surly, though.
  
  Funny thing is, I've already stopped counting the days.  I had to use my own blog search to find [a mention of my kicking the habit][habit] to recall when it was that I gave it up.
  
  I quit cold turkey, went insane for about 12 weeks with some serious panic attack episodes, but then it stopped being a component of who I am.  It never fit all that well to begin with, really.  
  
  But, having quit cold turkey is something I often use to remember that changing myself, if not easy, is always possible.

I quit on New Years just over 3 years ago.  I'm so happy that I did.  I think it took me about 2 years to get over it completely.</div>
