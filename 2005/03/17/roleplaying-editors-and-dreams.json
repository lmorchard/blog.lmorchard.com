Today I just gained a level, maybe two, thanks to <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=182\">SuperTab</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/tips/tip.php?tip_id=173\">Tip #173</a>.  Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll even be giving up the cursor keys soon and <a href=\"http://store.yahoo.com/pfuca-store/haphaccrad.html\">my original HHKB, sans-inverted-T</a>, will make more sense.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Speaking of RPGs: Last night, I had a hyper-realistic dream that some college roommates, who&#39;d started a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LARP\">LARP</a> of their own design back in the mid-90s, had gotten back together to start a new authorized LARP based on World of Warcraft.</p>\n<p>It was $1400 per month to play--which seemed reasonable at the time--and took place 24/7 on the grounds of the <a href=\"http://www.michrenfest.com/\">Michigan Renaissance Festival</a> in Holly.  Strangely, this was within walking distance of our old townhouse in Royal Oak.  I jumped into the game to play some kind of &quot;wind mage&quot;, dressed up like a 3-foot-tall leprechaun.  (Yes, somehow my costume reduced my height by 3 feet or so.)</p>\n<p>There&#39;s no real point to this, other than I felt I needed to share its utter depths of nerdity.  Oh, and although I&#39;ve watched someone play WoW, I don&#39;t actually have a machine capable of running it--so I don&#39;t even know if it features leprechaun wind mages.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083867\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://fatcaterpillar.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b43edc5c93b4a2f069d2eb1b44239af4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://fatcaterpillar.org/\">Stewart Johnson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083867\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-18T03:04:19\">2005-03-18T03:04:19</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Two very helpful vim things that really accelerated my vim learning (I never did figure out how to do these in emacs):\n\n(1) Substitute:\n\nsubstitute on the current line:\n\n:s/search for this/replace with this/\n\nsubstitute on all lines:\n\n:%s/search for this/replace with this/\n\nfind all matches on each line, not just the first one:\n\n:%s/search for this/replace with this/g\n\nprompt to confirm each replace:\n\n:%s/search/replace/gc\n\ncase insensitive \n\n:%s/search/replace/gi\n\n:help substitute for more\n\n(2) Execute commands on matching lines\n\n:normal command means to execute commands as if you typed them in, eg: &#39;dd&#39; or &#39;yyp&#39;, etc. With standard {range} operators, you can use :normal to execute a command on every matching line:\n\ndelete every line that contains the word &quot;foo&quot;\n\n:/foo/normal dd\n\nI find :normal <em>really</em> useful.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
