I first used XML-RPC. Then, at the nudging of some friends, did HTTP programming. But now I'm moving back into XML-RPC land.\nWhy?\nBecause I haven't found a nice easy way to do RPC over HTTP in Python.\nTo make a simple call for some data by HTTP, I have to construct a query string, make the call, get the results, interpret them according to all the various details of HTTP (mainly MIME type and encoding possibilities, but it seems like I keep finding more little details to be respected as time goes by,) and then perform further interpretation of the returned document.\nSo, XML-RPC (or SOAP; they're practically identical) is looking much nicer again.\nPeople say, \"But it's so complicated!\" And originally I was swayed by the argument. But, you know: After lots of frustration with figuring out how to communicate encoding, I said to myself: \"Lion, HTTP isn't simple. It's primitive.\"\nIn XML-RPC, the only time I ever had to think about how it worked, was when I transfered DateTime values. But aside from that, everything else just worked. And I got so much stuff for free- Self-documenting servers by GET, introspection by XML-RPC, automaticly unpacked data.\nSure, it may be complex underneath. I guess. (It's an XML format, it doesn't strike me as so wild.) Sure, it may be overhead.\nBut I know I get a lot more done with it, when I use it.\nSo, my sympathies have returned to XML-RPC.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
