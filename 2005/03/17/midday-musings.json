My Movable Type install and everything else has been slowly rotting and it&#39;s starting to smell.  </p>\n<p>And, I really need to get some comment-spam plugins in place, which fell off my radar when I installed MT v3.  I&#39;ve been neglecting my duties in approving comments, thus defeating their purpose in sparking conversation when I&#39;m not around, not to mention showing some appreciation for all the valuable pointers and things people say.  (<em>Thank you for your comments, even if I don&#39;t get around to making them appear promptly!</em>)</p>\n<p>And hell, while I&#39;m at it, I might even move over to WordPress.  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Speaking of comments... <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/03/09/techy_miscellaney#comment-4613\">Pete commented</a> on my SOAP musings thusly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes I wonder if it&#8217;s just the hacker mentality or instant gratification, but whenever I dig into SOAP, I get bored with it and want to move on. When I dig into a RESTful API like Yahoo! has, it&#8217;s so darn quick and easy to kick out an idea that it gets done before I ever get a chance to be bored with it. In fact, I get done, and am still excited about it!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;m wondering if this isn&#39;t it in a nutshell for me and my taste for REST over SOAP.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083200\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083200\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-17T14:14:04\">2005-03-17T14:14:04</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Please switch to WordPress.

I like REST from a purist theoretical standpoint, but I like the fact that with SOAP (and XML-RPC) I can just call the functions I want from my programming language just like any other function, and all of the wacky marshalling and unmarshalling happens automatically.\n</code></pre><p>With REST APIs, unless they are just returning raw data as the answer, you must parse whatever was returned to get the answer you were looking for.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083203&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://lion.taoriver.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b49f34733c8d7cf1120f83d6c21433df&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://lion.taoriver.net/&quot;&gt;Lion Kimbro&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083203&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-03-18T02:11:55&quot;&gt;2005-03-18T02:11:55&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Hm. I first used XML-RPC. Then, at the nudging of some friends, did HTTP programming. But now I&#39;m moving back into XML-RPC land.\n</code></pre><p>Why?</p>\n<p>Because I haven&#39;t found a nice easy way to do RPC over HTTP in Python.</p>\n<p>To make a simple call for some data by HTTP, I have to construct a query string, make the call, get the results, interpret them according to all the various details of HTTP (mainly MIME type and encoding possibilities, but it seems like I keep finding more little details to be respected as time goes by,) and then perform further interpretation of the returned document.</p>\n<p>So, XML-RPC (or SOAP; they&#39;re practically identical) is looking much nicer again.</p>\n<p>People say, &quot;But it&#39;s so complicated!&quot; And originally I was swayed by the argument. But, you know: After lots of frustration with figuring out how to communicate encoding, I said to myself: &quot;Lion, HTTP isn&#39;t simple. It&#39;s primitive.&quot;</p>\n<p>In XML-RPC, the only time I ever had to think about how it worked, was when I transfered DateTime values. But aside from that, everything else just worked. And I got so much stuff for free- Self-documenting servers by GET, introspection by XML-RPC, automaticly unpacked data.</p>\n<p>Sure, it may be complex underneath. I guess. (It&#39;s an XML format, it doesn&#39;t strike me as so wild.) Sure, it may be overhead.</p>\n<p>But I know I get a lot more done with it, when I use it.</p>\n<p>So, my sympathies have returned to XML-RPC.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
