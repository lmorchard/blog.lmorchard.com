Actually, it's likely that some mental boredom filters kick in, and they don't even see the discussion whatsoever.\r\n  \r\n  Well, that, and Ian's got part of the main concern nailed right in the request: the string of names describing the aggregate concept is far to unwieldy to bear fresh and active thought and discussion.  \r\n  \r\n  It's that whole [seven-plus-or-minus-two][seven] thing, and six words and acronyms just about overflows my stack.  Hell, I had to stick spaces in just to make that string line wrap properly--just imagine what that lead weight does sitting in your headspace.  And, on the other hand, if you \"just mention the important bits\", you're fragmenting the concept and left without a single workable handle again.\r\n  \r\n  [seven]:http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html\r\n  \r\n  Oh well, I'd better stop auditioning as amateur cognitive scientist now, before I follow through with this impulse to find some way to recast the whole \"[Eskimos have 100 words for snow][eskimos]\" myth to suit web developers.\r\n  \r\n   [eskimos]:http://www.public.iastate.edu/~honeyl/derrida/eskimos.html\r\n    \r\n   [hix]:http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1111339822&#38;count=1\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083773\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=49fa0e19d460d0717dd06b1862d94eb5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/\">Ryan Tomayko</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083773\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-22T10:49:04\">2005-03-22T10:49:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I had the same feeling when reading that post.

I like REST from a purist theoretical standpoint, but I like the fact that with SOAP (and XML-RPC) I can just call the functions I want from my programming language just like any other function, and all of the wacky marshalling and unmarshalling happens automatically.\nWith REST APIs, unless they are just returning raw data as the answer, you must parse whatever was returned to get the answer you were looking for.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083203\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://lion.taoriver.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b49f34733c8d7cf1120f83d6c21433df&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://lion.taoriver.net/\">Lion Kimbro</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083203\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-18T02:11:55\">2005-03-18T02:11:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Hm. I first used XML-RPC. Then, at the nudging of some friends, did HTTP programming. But now I'm moving back into XML-RPC land.\nWhy?\nBecause I haven't found a nice easy way to do RPC over HTTP in Python.\nTo make a simple call for some data by HTTP, I have to construct a query string, make the call, get the results, interpret them according to all the various details of HTTP (mainly MIME type and encoding possibilities, but it seems like I keep finding more little details to be respected as time goes by,) and then perform further interpretation of the returned document.\nSo, XML-RPC (or SOAP; they're practically identical) is looking much nicer again.\nPeople say, \"But it's so complicated!\" And originally I was swayed by the argument. But, you know: After lots of frustration with figuring out how to communicate encoding, I said to myself: \"Lion, HTTP isn't simple. It's primitive.\"\nIn XML-RPC, the only time I ever had to think about how it worked, was when I transfered DateTime values. But aside from that, everything else just worked. And I got so much stuff for free- Self-documenting servers by GET, introspection by XML-RPC, automaticly unpacked data.\nSure, it may be complex underneath. I guess. (It's an XML format, it doesn't strike me as so wild.) Sure, it may be overhead.\nBut I know I get a lot more done with it, when I use it.\nSo, my sympathies have returned to XML-RPC.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

I like REST from a purist theoretical standpoint, but I like the fact that with SOAP (and XML-RPC) I can just call the functions I want from my programming language just like any other function, and all of the wacky marshalling and unmarshalling happens automatically.\r\n\r\nWith REST APIs, unless they are just returning raw data as the answer, you must parse whatever was returned to get the answer you were looking for.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083203\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://lion.taoriver.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b49f34733c8d7cf1120f83d6c21433df&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://lion.taoriver.net/\">Lion Kimbro</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083203\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-18T02:11:55\">2005-03-18T02:11:55</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Hm. I first used XML-RPC. Then, at the nudging of some friends, did HTTP programming. But now I'm moving back into XML-RPC land.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nBecause I haven't found a nice easy way to do RPC over HTTP in Python.\r\n\r\nTo make a simple call for some data by HTTP, I have to construct a query string, make the call, get the results, interpret them according to all the various details of HTTP (mainly MIME type and encoding possibilities, but it seems like I keep finding more little details to be respected as time goes by,) and then perform further interpretation of the returned document.\r\n\r\nSo, XML-RPC (or SOAP; they're practically identical) is looking much nicer again.\r\n\r\nPeople say, \"But it's so complicated!\" And originally I was swayed by the argument. But, you know: After lots of frustration with figuring out how to communicate encoding, I said to myself: \"Lion, HTTP isn't simple. It's primitive.\"\r\n\r\nIn XML-RPC, the only time I ever had to think about how it worked, was when I transfered DateTime values. But aside from that, everything else just worked. And I got so much stuff for free- Self-documenting servers by GET, introspection by XML-RPC, automaticly unpacked data.\r\n\r\nSure, it may be complex underneath. I guess. (It's an XML format, it doesn't strike me as so wild.) Sure, it may be overhead.\r\n\r\nBut I know I get a lot more done with it, when I use it.\r\n\r\nSo, my sympathies have returned to XML-RPC.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

And since the <strong>W</strong> is next to the <strong>Q</strong> and there&#39;s no quit-confirmation in Safari, I&#39;ve got yet another way to lose large groups of open tabs.  <a href=\"http://www.statusq.org/archives/2005/02/20/608/\">And then there&#39;s all the stuff I turned off and deleted to prevent beachballs</a>.</p>\n<p>  FireFox, on the other hand, seems relatively stable and has many shiny features.  Stable, that is, except <a href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/90percent/os_x/firefox_flash_and_os_x.php\">when the odd Flash movie appears and seizes the whole thing up</a> and I&#39;m forced to euthanize it.  That, and, it seems to &quot;leak&quot; CPU usage--no matter how many windows and tabs I&#39;ve closed, after a few hours usage, FireFox eventually grows to consume all available CPU until I quit and restart.</p>\n<p>  Eventually, one or another annoyance with whichever of these two browsers I&#39;m using drives me to start using the other.  I&#39;ve got about a 14-20 day cycle going on between them.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087132\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://monket.samedi-studios.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a2ca4341abe663426bd058b124bd22f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://monket.samedi-studios.com\">Crutcher Dunnavant</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087132\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-17T10:55:04\">2005-03-17T10:55:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I've ended up using Camino for similar reasons.

It uses the python applescript bindings (via gensuitemodule, not any of the modern stuff) and just wakes up and scans all of the winodws for a url, and keeps a log of changes.  Problem is, applescript can't \"see\" tabs at all, so it won't save anything but the one you have immediately open.

And since the **W** is next to the **Q** and there's no quit-confirmation in Safari, I've got yet another way to lose large groups of open tabs.  [And then there's all the stuff I turned off and deleted to prevent beachballs][beach].\r\n  \r\n  [beach]:http://www.statusq.org/archives/2005/02/20/608/\r\n  \r\n  FireFox, on the other hand, seems relatively stable and has many shiny features.  Stable, that is, except [when the odd Flash movie appears and seizes the whole thing up][flash] and I'm forced to euthanize it.  That, and, it seems to \"leak\" CPU usage--no matter how many windows and tabs I've closed, after a few hours usage, FireFox eventually grows to consume all available CPU until I quit and restart.\r\n  \r\n[flash]:http://george.hotelling.net/90percent/os_x/firefox_flash_and_os_x.php\r\n\r\n  Eventually, one or another annoyance with whichever of these two browsers I'm using drives me to start using the other.  I've got about a 14-20 day cycle going on between them.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087132\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://monket.samedi-studios.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a2ca4341abe663426bd058b124bd22f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://monket.samedi-studios.com\">Crutcher Dunnavant</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087132\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-17T10:55:04\">2005-03-17T10:55:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I've ended up using Camino for similar reasons.

Firefox, until just a few weeks ago, was crashing every 10 to 30 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About a week ago, my \"No Script\" javascript permit/forbid bar simply vanished, leaving all scripts forbidden by default. I searched all over my computer for the cause of this. I checked my extensions, and posted a topic thread at Mozillazine forum, about it. My forum post was ignored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without the ability to permit scripts at trusted sites, I was screwed. Many things were impossible to accomplish, right? What a nightmare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I ended up uninstalling then reinstalling Firefox, without the No Script extension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as I'm concerned, the worst part of the internet is the web browser. They all suck. During my problems with Firefox No Script, I tried to lauch Opera, Avant, and IE. They could not find any servers, as though my broadband connection was not working. Netscape worked, but it is so buggy, it's worthless. My blog, for example, was actually flashing and endlessly reloading the main page. Weird.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I play bouncing browsers quite often.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Love your book, Hacking Rss and Atom.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

The new Yahoo web services are nice, and I&#39;ve already been enjoying Amazon&#39;s web services.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>But, speaking of SOAP: <a href=\"http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/18/WS-Oppo\">For the sake of sanity</a>, I&#39;ve mostly been keeping my brain out of the tumult surrounding SOAP and WS-Tech.  I was tracking things a few years ago, but have since wandered away.</p>\n<p>I think I really need to dip into it again, though, because I catch myself regarding this behemoth of technologies as stupid and worthless--a reaction which I&#39;ve been coming to consider as a red flag on my own ignorance, especially when there are a lot of smart people still seeing value in the same thing.  </p>\n<p>Part of it, I suspect, is that I tend not to use rich IDE&#39;s on a daily basis, and I&#39;m perfectly happy dealing with REST-style APIs using XPath to extract data and using DOM or string templates to send data.  It seems so easy to me that I wonder just what I&#39;m missing.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve heard that SOAP and friends brings a lot of joy to people who can just drag-and-drop a schema or self-describing blob into their favorite tool and have all the webbish bits hidden behind native-looking calls and code.  But, for the most part, I just don&#39;t get it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I don&#39;t like working with Microsoft technologies much.

I'm currently agitating for turning the stack inside out, and making the SOAP shims run on top of HTTP interfaces... and then give up on the SOAP parts if it turns out that they *really* get no developer traction.  (Groove gets some blame for the SOAP hype, but it doesn't seem to have resulted in any actual code for this app...)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "* I know I've already mentioned it, but man I wish Google had a REST-style API.  The new Yahoo web services are nice, and I've already been enjoying Amazon's web services.\r\n\r\n* But, speaking of SOAP: [For the sake of sanity][wsopp], I've mostly been keeping my brain out of the tumult surrounding SOAP and WS-Tech.  I was tracking things a few years ago, but have since wandered away.\r\n\r\n  I think I really need to dip into it again, though, because I catch myself regarding this behemoth of technologies as stupid and worthless--a reaction which I've been coming to consider as a red flag on my own ignorance, especially when there are a lot of smart people still seeing value in the same thing.  \r\n  \r\n  Part of it, I suspect, is that I tend not to use rich IDE's on a daily basis, and I'm perfectly happy dealing with REST-style APIs using XPath to extract data and using DOM or string templates to send data.  It seems so easy to me that I wonder just what I'm missing.\r\n  \r\n  I've heard that SOAP and friends brings a lot of joy to people who can just drag-and-drop a schema or self-describing blob into their favorite tool and have all the webbish bits hidden behind native-looking calls and code.  But, for the most part, I just don't get it.\r\n\r\n* I don't like working with Microsoft technologies much.  However, it is what we use at work, between legacy ASP 3.0 pages and a smattering of .NET stuff we've been gradually phasing in.  \r\n\r\n  One thing I do have to admit is satisfying, though, is using Windows Scripting Host with JScript to pry data out of Word documents and MSSQL tables to build a pile of XML documents--mostly because I didn't think it would work.\r\n\r\n[wsopp]:http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/18/WS-Oppo\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085932\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085932\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-09T18:34:55\">2005-03-09T18:34:55</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Sometimes I wonder if it's just the hacker mentality or instant gratification, but whenever I dig into SOAP, I get bored with it and want to move on.

No fiddling with the DOM required... the developer doesn't even have to think about XML, since it's all handled for her.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085948\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.thok.org/bloggery\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2545d4ff0ba72eb5d5979186f4b02d85&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.thok.org/bloggery\">Mark Eichin</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085948\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-10T11:29:46\">2005-03-10T11:29:46</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">But then, if really bright people like Norm Walsh (\"Mr. Docbook\") have trouble with WS-* (see his current blog thread on building a service) maybe there's something to the theory that they are as broken as they look :-)  I'm certainly regretting a project choice to use SOAP about 2 years ago; the APIs that are actually getting used now are HTTP (not-even-REST) shims that make the SOAP calls underneath, but http support *works* and is *efficient* in every language that anyone actually uses, which isn't true of SOAP... I'm currently agitating for turning the stack inside out, and making the SOAP shims run on top of HTTP interfaces... and then give up on the SOAP parts if it turns out that they *really* get no developer traction.  (Groove gets some blame for the SOAP hype, but it doesn't seem to have resulted in any actual code for this app...)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

    "html": "<p>I&#39;m almost proud, yet considering <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestration\">defenestration</a>:  </p>\n<p>  Our &quot;plus-size&quot; female cat has learned that I tend to get up around 6AM now, and shortly after I get up, I feed her and her brother.  She&#39;s also learned that jumping onto The Girl&#39;s dresser, covered in clinky bottles and delicate things, tends to make me wake instantly and lunge out of bed--sometimes pulling my CPAP mask out of its hose--to retrieve her before she starts knocking things over for the pretty sounds they make.</p>\n<p>  Now, both our cats tend to start doing restless foraging things when they&#39;re hungry.  Cabinets open and close, forbidden shelves get jumped upon, running around happens.  And, that&#39;s why the dresser-jumping started, I think.  Unfortunately, this past weekend, I made the mistake of storming down the stairs once and feeding the cats, after having been woken up two hours early by tinkling nail-polish bottles.</p>\n<p>  Oh ho!  She&#39;s a fast one, she is.  It didn&#39;t take her long to make a connection:  This morning, she was like a snooze alarm 1/2 hour early.  Our bed is positioned such that there&#39;s about a 3-foot leap from its end, to the dresser of delicates.  She made sure to leap from atop one of my ankles at the foot of the bed and onto the dresser; when I lunged out of bed, she hopped down immediately and ran out of the room.  I went back to bed.  </p>\n<p>  Just as I started falling back asleep, she was back, and this time launched onto the dresser using my toes as a platform.  Another lunge, another run out of the room.

    "body": "I'm almost proud, yet considering [defenestration][defe]:  \r\n  \r\n  Our \"plus-size\" female cat has learned that I tend to get up around 6AM now, and shortly after I get up, I feed her and her brother.  She's also learned that jumping onto The Girl's dresser, covered in clinky bottles and delicate things, tends to make me wake instantly and lunge out of bed--sometimes pulling my CPAP mask out of its hose--to retrieve her before she starts knocking things over for the pretty sounds they make.\r\n  \r\n  Now, both our cats tend to start doing restless foraging things when they're hungry.  Cabinets open and close, forbidden shelves get jumped upon, running around happens.  And, that's why the dresser-jumping started, I think.  Unfortunately, this past weekend, I made the mistake of storming down the stairs once and feeding the cats, after having been woken up two hours early by tinkling nail-polish bottles.\r\n  \r\n  Oh ho!  She's a fast one, she is.  It didn't take her long to make a connection:  This morning, she was like a snooze alarm 1/2 hour early.  Our bed is positioned such that there's about a 3-foot leap from its end, to the dresser of delicates.  She made sure to leap from atop one of my ankles at the foot of the bed and onto the dresser; when I lunged out of bed, she hopped down immediately and ran out of the room.  I went back to bed.  \r\n  \r\n  Just as I started falling back asleep, she was back, and this time launched onto the dresser using my toes as a platform.  Another lunge, another run out of the room.  This happened once more before the alarm finally went off, which was good because the sleepy girl lying next to me was probably about ready to defenestrate cat and boyfriend both.  When I finally got up, she led me to the food, chirping and mewing smugly the whole way.\r\n  \r\n  Tonight, I sleep with a squirt gun under my pillow.\r\n\r\n[defe]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestration\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090766\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://littlefros.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1532e95dac29ca2fb58aee01baa4cff0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://littlefros.com\">adampsyche</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090766\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-02T09:44:54\">2005-03-02T09:44:54</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Thank you for introducing me to my new favorite word.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090767\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.bobtheking.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3dfb53a940519b1d93a17efc1200d633&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.bobtheking.com\">Jeramey Jannene</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090767\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-02T13:07:04\">2005-03-02T13:07:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">My cat is slowly learning that I need to take my shoes off before I will walk over and pet her when I get home.
