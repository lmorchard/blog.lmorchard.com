And then when I get completely stymied on the book, I&#39;ve been trying to spew blog postings to keep the verbal part of my brain lubricated.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s worked middlingly well, but has left me with four chapters, each 1/3-2/3 done.  Hoping to get a burnout breakthrough from either sleep, caffeine, or beer and maybe get all of these done and submitted in the next day or two.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Meanwhile, The Girl is having a rough time of it as a convergence of ill-defined midterms and projects assail her this weekend.

I&#39;m going to the British Eastercon next weekend, which will take me away from home for close to a week (it&#39;s about 350 miles away and for reasons too tedious to go into I need to take a car there and back). In June, I&#39;m guest of honour at a con in Gothenburg, Sweden, and in August I&#39;m guest of honour at a con in Austin, Texas as well as going to the worldcon in Glasgow, the Edinburgh Book Festival, and other venues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"}
