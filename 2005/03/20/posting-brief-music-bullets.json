(But, neither can Party Shuffle, Quicksilver, or much of anything else other than iTunes&#39; plain old browser.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Just had &quot;Everybody Have Fun Tonight&quot; from Wang Chung pop up in my shuffle from one of my various 80&#39;s CDs.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;d never heard this before, but somewhere in the middle of the babbling and ad-lib around 3:21 into the song, someone croons &quot;Can you tell me what a Wang Chung is?&quot;  </p>\n<p>Cracked me up, it did.  Though, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m the last person on the planet not to have heard this.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>After running through an all-day playlist, I just realized that the last three <a href=\"http://www.dreamtheater.net\">Dream Theater</a> albums all link together, with respect to the sound on which one album fades out and the next fades back in.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dreamtheater.net/disco_dreamtheater.php?s=sfam\">Scenes from a Memory</a> fades out with the sound of a record having ended and the needle dragging around on the label--and <a href=\"http://www.dreamtheater.net/disco_dreamtheater.php?s=6doit\">Six Degrees of Inner Turbluence</a> starts with that sound.  That album, then, ends with a certain synthesizer chord fading out--which is picked up and faded back in with the first track of <a href=\"http://www.dreamtheater.net/disco_dreamtheater.php?s=tot\">Train of Thought</a>.</p>\n<p>I love this sort of detail some musicians throw into their work.  This is the sort of thing you don&#39;t tend to get from collecting and shuffling singles via file-sharing networks or the iTunes Music Store.  </p>\n<p>Of course, concept albums and rock operas don&#39;t lend well to singles-collecting or shuffle mode either.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"}
