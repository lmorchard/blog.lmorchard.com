<li><p>Between moving apartments and other various things this past week, I&#39;ve hit a wall and gotten just about nothing fully completed.</p>
<p>To try to keep some momentum going, I&#39;ve started work on four chapters for the book simultaneously, jumping tracks whenever I get bogged down in one thing or another.  And then when I get completely stymied on the book, I&#39;ve been trying to spew blog postings to keep the verbal part of my brain lubricated.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worked middlingly well, but has left me with four chapters, each 1/3-2/3 done.  Hoping to get a burnout breakthrough from either sleep, caffeine, or beer and maybe get all of these done and submitted in the next day or two.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Meanwhile, The Girl is having a rough time of it as a convergence of ill-defined midterms and projects assail her this weekend.  Wishing one or both of us had &quot;<a href="http://members.tripod.com/~jessicarae/ootw/outofthisworld.html">Out of this World</a>&quot;-style time-stop powers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>And just when I thought <em>I</em> was busy, <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blosxom.cgi/2005/03/18#writing-113">Charles Stross shows me how the pros get buried</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This would be a fairly complete workload (only 150,000 words by the end of June) but there&#39;s other stuff, too. I&#39;m going to the British Eastercon next weekend, which will take me away from home for close to a week (it&#39;s about 350 miles away and for reasons too tedious to go into I need to take a car there and back). In June, I&#39;m guest of honour at a con in Gothenburg, Sweden, and in August I&#39;m guest of honour at a con in Austin, Texas as well as going to the worldcon in Glasgow, the Edinburgh Book Festival, and other venues.</p>
