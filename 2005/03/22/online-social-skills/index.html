          <p><em>Here&#39;s something else I&#39;ve had in bubbling around for a little while.  I think there&#39;s more for me to think about here, but here goes:</em></p>
<p>  Once, when I was a wee lad in the 80&#39;s--probably around the time when the original source for my &quot;When I Grow Up&quot; graphic down at the page bottom was scrawled by my tiny hands--I was on a trip with my Mom and Grandma to visit relatives in Baltimore, MD.  </p>
<p>  Well, one of the people we visited was a Great Uncle, a nice older man whom I barely remember now.  But, what I do remember--and what gets brought up at least once a year at family gatherings--is this:</p>
<p>  At the time, I was so all-consumed by my beginning obsession with computers that it was all I wanted to talk about.  After awhile, I&#39;d figured out that most people didn&#39;t know much about computers or didn&#39;t want to talk to me about them.  So, by the time I came around to meeting this Great Uncle of mine, I figured I&#39;d save some time--having begun my love affair with these clean and logical machines, I considered efficiency a virtue.  </p>
<p>  The first thing I asked him, then, was, &quot;So, do you know anything about computers?&quot;  </p>
<p>  To this, he responded, &quot;No, sorry, I don&#39;t really know anything about those.&quot;</p>
<p>  &quot;Well,&quot; I said, without missing a beat, &quot;there really isn&#39;t any use in me talking to you, then.&quot;</p>
<p>  Of course, my Mother was mortified, and although I don&#39;t really remember it, I&#39;ve been told that my Great Uncle was gracious about it, both surprised and amused.  I think I <em>did</em> end up talking to him about some other things, but this conversation is the only thing which survives in my memory.</p>
<p>  What reminds me of this story today, though, is a sort of inversion that popped into my head a few minutes ago: </p>
<p>  &quot;<em>So, can I talk to you with computers?*&quot;<br>  &quot;</em>No?*&quot;<br>  &quot;<em>Well, there really isn&#39;t any use in me knowing you, then.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>  Like my Mother years ago, I feel a bit morified that this bubbled up from my subconscious.  I&#39;m afraid of just how true this is about me, and it doesn&#39;t seem very good.  In fact, it seems downright dysfunctional to me.</p>
<p>  Then again, no one&#39;s ever accused me of being any sort of <em>social dynamo</em>.</p>

<div class="content">I know how you feel.  My infatuation with computers started back in 1979, and for the most part if anyone didn't know anything about computers I wouldn't bother getting to know them.
I'm a little better than that now, but not a lot.
My dialog could go somthing like this:
"So, do you know anything about Linux or web development with open source tools?"
"No?"
"Let's find something else to talk about."
Trouble is that I don't follow sports, or prime time TV, so there aren't many subjects to talk about.  Except of course, religion or politics, and that's generally a bad way to get to know anyone.</div>
