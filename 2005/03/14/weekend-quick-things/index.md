* The new apartment seemed strangely quiet and isolated until I got the blinking lights of a cable modem and wireless router going.  Very glad I had The Girl and pets to hang out with.

* Also, I didn't know this could happen:  I moved so much stuff that I must've strained my arms, because they got into a state where I couldn't straighten them out again for 10-12 hours.

* I've just subscribed again to a Technorati search feed on "decafbad" after having forgotten about them for a few months.

  I'm liking it, but I wish they could exclude links to me found in other people's blogrolls--while on one hand I've been very happy and surprised to find all the links to me, I kinda wish I could limit to links that come up in the middle of a post.

            <div class="content">re: technorati searches.

pubsub actually indexes syndication feeds so it doesn't get "polluted" by blogrolls etc. 

re: the arms.

I've seen the same condition on people that never weightlifted before and kill them selves on arm curls. A day or two later they can't straighten their arms.  No pain no gain!</div>
