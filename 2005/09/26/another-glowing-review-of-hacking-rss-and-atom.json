It&#39;s another glowing review of my book, this time from <a href=\"http://hostit1.connectria.com/twduff/home.nsf/plinks/TDUF-6GJTYJ\">Thomas Duff&#39;s &quot;Duffbert&#39;s Random Musings&quot;</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Excellent idea and application book...  If you&#39;re interested in going beyond simple feed readers and building stuff for yourself, this is a definite purchase you want to check out...</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thanks Thomas!  It&#39;s really cool to start seeing feedback on this thing, and it&#39;s interesting when comments match up with thing about which I had a few concerns when writing the bookâ€”such as doing all the code in Python versus, say, PHP.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082964\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.soundprinciples.com/ad-verse/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ac8b885e7e65dc8234c890e6a20d7d4b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.soundprinciples.com/ad-verse/\">Eric Weaver</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082964\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-27T04:40:58\">2005-10-27T04:40:58</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I was browsing through my local Barnes &amp; Noble in downtown Seattle when I ran across this book and thought, &#39;it&#39;s about time.&#39; And then, &#39;hmm, I knew a Les Orchard when he was at Magnet Detroit.&#39; Sure enough it was you.</p>\n\n<p>Great book, well written.
