I was flipping through a few pent-up podcasts I had laying around before purging the backlog, and found this mention at the tail-end of GNC #101.</p>\n<p>Not only did he call my book &quot;totally, totally amazing,&quot; but he also called me a gentleman.  Thank you very much, Todd!  And with this sort of glowing review, I&#39;d feel remiss without mentioning that <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597787/0xdecafbad01-20\">Todd&#39;s book <i>Podcasting</i></a> is mighty fine as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Holy crap--looks like Todd liked my book well enough to toss a panel into his sidebar to buy it from Amazon!</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085404\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.ericweaver.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ac8b885e7e65dc8234c890e6a20d7d4b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.ericweaver.com\">Weave</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085404\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-27T04:34:26\">2005-10-27T04:34:26</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I was browsing through the downtown Seattle Barnes &amp; Noble when I ran across this book. Looked at the title and thought, &#39;hey, I remember a Les Orchard from Magnet Detroit.&quot; Sure enough it was you.</p>\n\n<p>Great book, well written...wish I was more of a hands-on code jockey and I&#39;d probably get a lot more out of it. As it is, I have to stick with XHTML and CSS and work my way up from there. :)</p>\n\n<p>Nice job. Take care.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Eric Weaver (former Detroiter, Wundermaner, friend of Pauler Schweizerer)</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
