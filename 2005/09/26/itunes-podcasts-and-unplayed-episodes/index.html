    <section class="post-content"><p>Here&#39;s something that really bugs me about iTunes&#39; podcast support:  Its definition of an &quot;unplayed episode&quot; with respect to retention.  </p>
<p>When you play a track in iTunes, its play count doesn&#39;t increment until you&#39;ve gotten through the entire track.  It took me awhile to realize the wisdom of that fact and how it helps with smart playlists.  However, it seems like they&#39;ve flipped the conditional for podcastsâ€”if I even brush past a podcast, it&#39;s marked as played, and therefore deleted from my iPod if I happen to choose to only retain unplayed episodes.</p>
<p>What this means is that what I was listening to on the ride into work won&#39;t be waiting for me on the ride home from work.  That sucks.  I&#39;d set aside my own podcast tuner I&#39;d built for my book in favor of iTunes 4.9 when it arrived, but I&#39;m starting to reconsider that.  It&#39;s the small things, but they matter.</p>
