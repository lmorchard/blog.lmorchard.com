Did you know that it comes with a Python interpreter, and that there&#39;s a <a href=\"http://www.xbmcscripts.com/\">scripting community</a> building really cool living room apps for it?  Did you know that it bundles the <a href=\"http://www.goahead.com/products/web_server.htm\">GoAhead webserver</a> along with <a href=\"http://spyce.sourceforge.net/\">Spyce Python Server Pages</a>?  </p>\n<p>I&#39;d never heard of GoAhead&#39;s tiny webserver before, but Spyce looks interesting.  Overall, XBMC is surprisingly polished for an &quot;amateur&quot; effort, and it&#39;s certainly more <a href=\"http://www.makezine.com/03/welcome/\">maker friendly</a> than anything else in our living room besides our laptops.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087129\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://highearthorbit.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a25421f6c79d5f381fab65c82abf85e8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://highearthorbit.com\">Andrew Turner</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087129\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-27T16:27:50\">2005-09-27T16:27:50</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Wow, I had no idea all this was going on. I setup my XBox, XBMC (and ol&#39; XBMP), and Xebian about 2 years ago and never really kept up. It was a huge effort at the time to get it going, and I just counted my lucky stars.</p>\n\n<p>However, all this progress really makes me want to go back and start mucking with it again. Hrm - view my home automation &amp; home intranet from my XBox. View MythTV from within XBMC? Sounds very yummy.</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
