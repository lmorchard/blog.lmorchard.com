The common thread I&#39;ve seen between both of these--and other bloggers expressing similar sentiments--is a vague sort of guilt over &quot;missing something&quot;.  </p>\n<p>However, before we had access to syndication feeds or high-traffic mailing lists, we were missing all kinds of good stuff already.  It&#39;s just been in the past decade or so that personal information aggregation tech has gotten to a point where we&#39;re now aware of the dull roar of Things Being Missed.</p>\n<p>Fact is, though, that you can&#39;t catch everything.  At least not and have a human life left over--and even then, you only have so much raw mental capacity to catch it.  No, the best thing to do is to relax, accept that you&#39;re only able to lap from the stream as it goes by, and be happy that there&#39;s a stream to lap from where there was none before.  </p>\n<p>Aggregate, prioritize, peruse, and discard with abandon.
