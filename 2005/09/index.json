It only works well to connect individuals, not collectives. It's very much like meatspace in these respects.

Quite like the typical computer club / writer's workshop / keyboard school in meatspace, where the locality of people is a bigger constraint to the makeup of the membership than the intensity of their interest. On LJ, I think the key factor is that it's so easy to find dedicated topical online communities, which offer a far more satisfactory experience, that only those who cannot be bothered to look for them are compelled to look for corresponding communities on LJ.</p>\n<p>On a different note, another case of succesful social networking just occured to me---Flickr. There too the networking it is a very successful component, cherished by many, but again only a component that compounds the experience, not an end in itself. And arguably that's why it's so successful.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083715\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sporkmonger.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=56ee28134dd0776825445e3551979b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://sporkmonger.com\">Bob Aman</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083715\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-20T19:16:52\">2005-10-20T19:16:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>After some careful consideration, I decided to rename SporkID to something more generic sounding (Sporklet) and pull the identity stuff right out of the application.</p>\n<p>But to answer your question, absolutely, yes.  I am definately planning on building on top of OpenID, and possibly Sxip (though not definately).  I'm working on a modular reputation-based authorization system of identity, which I'm planning on setting up under a non-profit org in order to allay any fears people might have of, say, having my company get acquired by another larger company and then finding themselves having lost control of their identity.</p>\n<p>The general idea is, \"Great, we've got a decent, easy to implement system of authenticating via OpenID, but the decentralized model doesn't work quite as well for authorization systems because systems can lie.\"  So what I'm working on is a method of bringing different trust metrics under a single roof that's easy to access via a REST web services API.  And then Sporklet (the stuff I described in my earlier comment) just makes use of the reputation/identity stuff in the background.</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

It props up the other features of the site, instead being the end that the other features are merely the means to. Just as in life, the networking just happens as you go about the things you <em>actually</em> wanted to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, I've found that <abbr title=\"Livejournal\">LJ</abbr> is lousy place to find topical communities (unless you're into typical teenage popularity contests). It only works well to connect individuals, not collectives. It's very much like meatspace in these respects. (I'm not entirely sure where I'm going with this point, but it has some relevance to the other one that I can't quite grasp.

Quite like the typical computer club / writer's workshop / keyboard school in meatspace, where the locality of people is a bigger constraint to the makeup of the membership than the intensity of their interest. On LJ, I think the key factor is that it's so easy to find dedicated topical online communities, which offer a far more satisfactory experience, that only those who cannot be bothered to look for them are compelled to look for corresponding communities on LJ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a different note, another case of succesful social networking just occured to me---Flickr. There too the networking it is a very successful component, cherished by many, but again only a component that compounds the experience, not an end in itself.

I am definately planning on building on top of OpenID, and possibly Sxip (though not definately).  I'm working on a modular reputation-based authorization system of identity, which I'm planning on setting up under a non-profit org in order to allay any fears people might have of, say, having my company get acquired by another larger company and then finding themselves having lost control of their identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The general idea is, \"Great, we've got a decent, easy to implement system of authenticating via OpenID, but the decentralized model doesn't work quite as well for authorization systems because systems can lie.\"  So what I'm working on is a method of bringing different trust metrics under a single roof that's easy to access via a REST web services API.  And then Sporklet (the stuff I described in my earlier comment) just makes use of the reputation/identity stuff in the background.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

I dislike the usual category technology, am hooked on del.icio.us tagging, so here we are.\r\n\r\n* [WordPress Administration Design: Tiger](http://orderedlist.com/articles/wordpress-administration-design-tiger/ \"WordPress Administration Design: Tiger // Ordered List by Steve Smith\") -- Because WordPress' default admin style kinda looks like butt.\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\n**2002**: [It looked like this.](http://web.archive.org/web/20020525024010/http://www.decafbad.com/) I launched this site on a lark, liking the name `oxDECAFBAD`.  It's a 32-bit hexadecimal number, as well as an expression of distaste for things not containing caffeine.   Initially, the software was [Movable Type][mt2], which I quickly overwhelmed with hacks and plugins and all manner of crap.\r\n\r\n**2003**: [It looked like this.](http://web.archive.org/web/20030603165048/www.decafbad.com/blog/)  Tired of the crud I'd accumulated with my Movable Type exploits, I rebooted things and reworked everything to use [Blosxom][blosxom].  I also started taking a turn away from blogging \"proper\" and mostly posted lists of links for awhile.\r\n\r\n**2004**: [It looked like this.](http://web.archive.org/web/20040618092324/www.decafbad.com/blog/)  I stole some ideas from [Mark Pilgrim's accessibility series](http://diveintoaccessibility.org/) (whether it showed or not), and planned to switch to a more verbose and article-oriented style of blogging.  I also tried to integrate my wiki and link-blogging activities into a more unified navigation on the site.  Unfortunately, the net result was that the only thing that really every got updated was my linkblog.\r\n\r\n**2005**: Wanting to switch back to a more free and lightweight style of blogging, I ditched Movable Type and my article-length-biased templates.  (For some reason, I always end up making MT move like a battleship.)  This is another reboot, and as such, many of my site's previous features (ie. the wiki and linkblog) have gone away until I've had a chance to reevaluate them.\r\n\r\n**@@ More soon.**\r\n\r\n[mt2]: http://www.movabletype.org\r\n[blosxom]: http://blosxom.com\n",

Combine your above example with <a href=\"http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/posts/show/763\" rel=\"nofollow\">these directions for creating VIPs</a> and you can set up a pretty functional VPN. I create VIPs for the hosts that are most interesting at work and have a custom hosts file map the work hostnames to the local IPs. Then when I open the tunnel with ssh I bind to the VIP IPs. It takes a little while to set everything up but the result is very nice. </p>\n<p>I'm in the process of building up a simple config file syntax for specifying which hosts/ports should be tunneled and a little script that does all the dirty work of creating the VIPs and opening the ssh connection.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086056\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086056\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-27T14:38:59\">2005-09-27T14:38:59</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Hmm...

Basically I can make it look like a small subset of the work LAN with just VIPs, hosts file modification, and ssh tunnels.</p>\n<p>So say I have two boxes at work - <code>work-box-1</code> and <code>work-box-2</code>, running SMB and a web server, respectively. I create a host file that points the host names to IPs on my home lan: </p>\n<p><code>/etc/hosts.ssh-vip-vpn</code>:</p>\n<pre><code> 192.168.1.130  work-box-1\n192.168.1.131  work-box-2\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, I have a little script that ups the VIPs using ifconfig, symlinks the hosts file, and opens the tunnels:</p>\n<p><code>~/bin/open-vpn</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>#!/bin/bash\nifconfig en1 inet 192.168.1.130 netmask 255.255.255.255 alias\nifconfig en1 inet 192.168.1.131 netmask 255.255.255.255 alias\nln -s /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.ssh-vip-vpn\nssh -L192.168.1.130:445:real-work-ip1:445 \\\n-L192.168.1.130:137:real-work-ip1:137 \\\n-L192.168.1.131:80:real-work-ip2:80 external-work-hostname\n</code></pre>\n<p>The cool thing is that everything pretty much looks exactly as it does at work.

I close it up, leave home, open it up on a new network.  Repeat at least twice a day.</p>\n<p>What autossh does is start an SSH connection and monitor it continuously to be sure it's up.  If the connection ever goes down, autossh starts it up again.</p>\n<p>So, instead of the usually SSH command to connect to a server at home, I use autossh.  When I open my PowerBook in a new location, autossh sees that it's lost the connection to home and automatically reconnects.  This way, I always have a terminal window to home—along with a handful of forwarded ports—even after travelling between networks.  And, since I'm running <code>screen</code> at home, everything I was doing before travelling is all in the same state I left it.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086074\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://enduringvoices.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5d833a456f8dc70c9a48f7f242880212&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://enduringvoices.com\">Nathan Nutter</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086074\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-29T03:27:56\">2005-09-29T03:27:56</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>OK, Thank you.

    "body": "I've just recently put some pieces together in my head, and have found this to be a very useful invocation to run in a Terminal window on my PowerBook:\r\n\r\n`while [ 1 ]; do ssh -t home '/usr/sbin/screen -R work'; done`\r\n\r\n*(**Update:** Thanks to a [comment by Leland Johnson](http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/27/ssh-and-screen-better-together#comment-2052), I've realized that the above just poorly reinvents [autossh](http://www.harding.motd.ca/autossh/).  Use it instead.)*\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, here's what's up:\r\n\r\n* `home` is a host defined in my `~/.ssh/config`;\r\n* `work` is a persistent [`screen`](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) session I have running there;\r\n* The `-t` option for `ssh` is key for making `screen` work;\r\n* I have several forwarded ports set up to enable things like IRC and sometimes HTTP proxied through a home machine;\r\n* I have ssh-agent running in order to ensure I never have to enter a password; \r\n* The `while` loop runs forever, so that whenever my `ssh` connection drops—say when I go from home to work or vice versa—it gets reestablished as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe end result is that I always have a window with a few shells open on a machine at home, as well as a slew of ports tunneled to machines back home to provide a rough sort of VPN.  The connection is usually reestablished and waiting by the time I've gotten settled and get around to visiting that window.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086054\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=abfc88b96ae18c85ba7aac3bded2ec5e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/\">Ryan Tomayko</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086054\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-27T14:28:36\">2005-09-27T14:28:36</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>A great tip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of this, I was messing around the other day and found that it's really easy to create VIPs in OS X. Combine your above example with <a href=\"http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/posts/show/763\" rel=\"nofollow\">these directions for creating VIPs</a> and you can set up a pretty functional VPN. I create VIPs for the hosts that are most interesting at work and have a custom hosts file map the work hostnames to the local IPs. Then when I open the tunnel with ssh I bind to the VIP IPs. It takes a little while to set everything up but the result is very nice. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm in the process of building up a simple config file syntax for specifying which hosts/ports should be tunneled and a little script that does all the dirty work of creating the VIPs and opening the ssh connection.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086056\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086056\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-27T14:38:59\">2005-09-27T14:38:59</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hmm...

Basically I can make it look like a small subset of the work LAN with just VIPs, hosts file modification, and ssh tunnels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So say I have two boxes at work - <code>work-box-1</code> and <code>work-box-2</code>, running SMB and a web server, respectively. I create a host file that points the host names to IPs on my home lan: </p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>/etc/hosts.ssh-vip-vpn</code>:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code> 192.168.1.130  work-box-1\r\n 192.168.1.131  work-box-2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, I have a little script that ups the VIPs using ifconfig, symlinks the hosts file, and opens the tunnels:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>~/bin/open-vpn</code>:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>#!/bin/bash\r\nifconfig en1 inet 192.168.1.130 netmask 255.255.255.255 alias\r\nifconfig en1 inet 192.168.1.131 netmask 255.255.255.255 alias\r\nln -s /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.ssh-vip-vpn\r\nssh -L192.168.1.130:445:real-work-ip1:445 \\\r\n      -L192.168.1.130:137:real-work-ip1:137 \\\r\n      -L192.168.1.131:80:real-work-ip2:80 external-work-hostname\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The cool thing is that everything pretty much looks exactly as it does at work.

If the connection ever goes down, autossh starts it up again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, instead of the usually SSH command to connect to a server at home, I use autossh.  When I open my PowerBook in a new location, autossh sees that it's lost the connection to home and automatically reconnects.  This way, I always have a terminal window to home—along with a handful of forwarded ports—even after travelling between networks.  And, since I'm running <code>screen</code> at home, everything I was doing before travelling is all in the same state I left it.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086074\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://enduringvoices.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5d833a456f8dc70c9a48f7f242880212&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://enduringvoices.com\">Nathan Nutter</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086074\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-29T03:27:56\">2005-09-29T03:27:56</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>OK, Thank you.

I have been trying to figure out how to use it because my school has a server that us students are allowed to use to compile things and what not. But it also stores all our files on it so I have been trying to setup [AlmostVPN][2] to forward the Apple File Share that has our home directories on it. Unfortunately, I have not gotten it to work yet, but that is mostly because I have very limited knowledge of SSH. I use it in place of telnet but that is all I know how to do right now.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

As a self-confessed Star Wars dweeb, I've read alot of extended universe and some writers have good explanations.   For instance, Jabba the Hutt is a sexual deviant in his culture, and is really frowned upon.  In fact Hutts are asexual and become \"female\"  after they have a baby.  Jabba was a real freak who made a point to avoid that, but he's considered young.  Ive never read about a Wookie who liked human women though.  Everyone seems to like Twi'leks though.</p>\n<p>It's sad that I know that much about sexuality in a fictional universe.</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

As a self-confessed Star Wars dweeb, I've read alot of extended universe and some writers have good explanations.   For instance, Jabba the Hutt is a sexual deviant in his culture, and is really frowned upon.  In fact Hutts are asexual and become \"female\"  after they have a baby.  Jabba was a real freak who made a point to avoid that, but he's considered young.  Ive never read about a Wookie who liked human women though.  Everyone seems to like Twi'leks though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's sad that I know that much about sexuality in a fictional universe.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

On the one hand, producing something like XML using &quot;proper&quot; DOM invocations and handwavings seems like the &quot;correct&quot; thing to do.  Yet, on the other hand, using a templating system lets me get down to business much more quickly and with much more clarity and succinct code.  </p>\n<p>Yeah, templates provide a range of flexibility sufficient to aim the barrel at your own toes, while an API like the XML DOM keeps everything on the rails--but sometimes you know where you&#39;re going and don&#39;t need the rails to get you there.  Furthermore, isn&#39;t it possible to make a template system that Does The Right Thing?</p>\n<p>Anyway, it&#39;s rather apparent that I&#39;m solidly in favor of templates:  After all, a book of mine just hit the shelves which is just rife with template-based generation of RSS and Atom feeds.  </p>\n<p>My only issue, really, is that I feel vaguely guilty about it.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084924\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=821395fe70906c8290df7f18ac4ac6cf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">rick</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084924\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T02:27:37\">2005-09-26T02:27:37</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Ruby has the nice Builder module for this (http://builder.rubyforge.org/).

Don&#8217;t do that.\nCheck <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henri Sivonen</a>&#8217;s suggestions just published in his <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/producing-xml/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HOWTO Avoid Being Called a Bozo When Producing XML</a>. Instead of building a DOM, generate SAX events, using the program structure to ensure proper nesting &#8211; or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.\nThe emission of synthesised SAX events can be generalised by writing a datastructure-to-SAX serialiser, so that you can build your data within your language&#8217;s native datastructures prior to outputting it, for maximum comfort. (Of course you serialise piecemeal too, f.ex. by outputting the head of a feed manually, then for each item, building the data structure and immediately serialising it, then emitting the final events to complete the document.)\nDepending on the complexity of the output, you could directly emit the otuput format or feed the events into to an XSLT transform that generates the full-blown thing from an easy to generate document structure. In both cases this can be done with or without the involvement of a serialiser as middle man.\nThere are plenty of ways to make sure that the entire toolchain from one end to the other consists only of steps that conserve well-formedness, and they need not be any less convenient than using templates.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084926\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084926\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:16:35\">2005-09-26T04:16:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><blockquote>or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.</blockquote>\nAristotle:  Now here's where I think certain templating technologies get interesting, and may Do the Right Thing.  My so-far-favorite templating kit, ZPT, wants well-formed XML as templates--although I think that restriction is unfortunately relaxed as a nod to HTML.  On the other hand, my possibly-new-favorite templating kit, Kid, [demands well-formed XML as templates](http://lesscode.org/projects/kid/wiki/KidFaq#must-templates-be-well-formed-xml).\nIn case you haven't played with them, these two template languages center around the idea that certain attributes on elements define where content provided in a data structure should be inserted / swapped in by the template engine.  The engine handles character encodings and such to ensure that the well-formed template results in a well-formed document.\nDoes this match up with what you say up there?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084928\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084928\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:28:49\">2005-09-26T04:28:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I guess the other thing that bugs me about constructing documents via DOM or via generating SAX events—which I'd first discovered in <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/12/py-xml.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this XML.com article by Uche Ogbuji</a>—is how awkward and removed it is from the view-source XML I've gotten used to hacking around with.

I confess I actually kind of liked <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI.pm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CGI.pm</a> &#8211; because nesting is automatically taken care of without so much typing of end tags, and you can seamlessly weave <code>map</code>s into the code for output loops.\nI have to note though that I used it as a sort of template language in its own right &#8211; I never littered <code>print</code>s all over my code, I kept all the calls in a single place, in fact, usually a single expression. That is also why I find it strange that people create template languages for PHP, which was itself born as a template language. What matters is that the output generation is separate from the processing logic, whether or not the template and the code are in different languages.\nAnyway, I digress.\nWhat I wanted to say is, no, I hadn&#8217;t seen either ZPT or Kid. I had put off reading the lesscode.org article you quoted and went back to it after responding here. Now that I&#8217;ve read it, I admit I&#8217;m intrigued.

Logic and presentation in separate blocks / files / etc.  And then, my take is that if you're going to have your presentation/view separate from the logic/controller, you may as well code the presentation in a form as close to the goal as possible (ie. in XML or HTML, not in s-expressions or the logic implementation idiom)—especially since oftimes you've got separate people or teams working primarily on each.\nI suspect, however, that a templating system like Kid goes quite a ways toward solving the problem of \"gluing strings together\".

Somehow that strikes me as natural and easy, but many of my users seem to disagree, preferring to learn a templating system instead of learning to write Perl code.  I'm still undecided about the issue.

Problem is, I haven't gotten much closer now, but I figured I'd at least post a few thoughts and conjure up a vague sketch of the issue.\r\n\r\nYou see, I think it all goes back to [thoughts about which I posted almost three years ago][lazy].  On the one hand, producing something like XML using \"proper\" DOM invocations and handwavings seems like the \"correct\" thing to do.  Yet, on the other hand, using a templating system lets me get down to business much more quickly and with much more clarity and succinct code.  \r\n\r\nYeah, templates provide a range of flexibility sufficient to aim the barrel at your own toes, while an API like the XML DOM keeps everything on the rails--but sometimes you know where you're going and don't need the rails to get you there.  Furthermore, isn't it possible to make a template system that Does The Right Thing?\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's rather apparent that I'm solidly in favor of templates:  After all, a book of mine just hit the shelves which is just rife with template-based generation of RSS and Atom feeds.  \r\n\r\nMy only issue, really, is that I feel vaguely guilty about it.\r\n\r\n[lazy]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/12/13/oooced\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084924\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=821395fe70906c8290df7f18ac4ac6cf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">rick</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084924\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T02:27:37\">2005-09-26T02:27:37</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Ruby has the nice Builder module for this (http://builder.rubyforge.org/).

Don&#8217;t do that.\n\nCheck <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henri Sivonen</a>&#8217;s suggestions just published in his <a href=\"http://hsivonen.iki.fi/producing-xml/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HOWTO Avoid Being Called a Bozo When Producing XML</a>. Instead of building a DOM, generate SAX events, using the program structure to ensure proper nesting &#8211; or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.\n\nThe emission of synthesised SAX events can be generalised by writing a datastructure-to-SAX serialiser, so that you can build your data within your language&#8217;s native datastructures prior to outputting it, for maximum comfort. (Of course you serialise piecemeal too, f.ex. by outputting the head of a feed manually, then for each item, building the data structure and immediately serialising it, then emitting the final events to complete the document.)\n\nDepending on the complexity of the output, you could directly emit the otuput format or feed the events into to an XSLT transform that generates the full-blown thing from an easy to generate document structure. In both cases this can be done with or without the involvement of a serialiser as middle man.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to make sure that the entire toolchain from one end to the other consists only of steps that conserve well-formedness, and they need not be any less convenient than using templates.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084926\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084926\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:16:35\">2005-09-26T04:16:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><blockquote>or instead of generating the SAX events all manually, generate them by parsing a static XML document and using certain interesting points in the stream (such as Processing Instructions) as hooks for inserting payload.</blockquote>\nAristotle:  Now here's where I think certain templating technologies get interesting, and may Do the Right Thing.  My so-far-favorite templating kit, ZPT, wants well-formed XML as templates--although I think that restriction is unfortunately relaxed as a nod to HTML.  On the other hand, my possibly-new-favorite templating kit, Kid, [demands well-formed XML as templates](http://lesscode.org/projects/kid/wiki/KidFaq#must-templates-be-well-formed-xml).\n\nIn case you haven't played with them, these two template languages center around the idea that certain attributes on elements define where content provided in a data structure should be inserted / swapped in by the template engine.  The engine handles character encodings and such to ensure that the well-formed template results in a well-formed document.\n\nDoes this match up with what you say up there?</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084928\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084928\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-26T04:28:49\">2005-09-26T04:28:49</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">I guess the other thing that bugs me about constructing documents via DOM or via generating SAX events—which I'd first discovered in <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/12/py-xml.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this XML.com article by Uche Ogbuji</a>—is how awkward and removed it is from the view-source XML I've gotten used to hacking around with.

I confess I actually kind of liked <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI.pm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CGI.pm</a> &#8211; because nesting is automatically taken care of without so much typing of end tags, and you can seamlessly weave <code>map</code>s into the code for output loops.\n\nI have to note though that I used it as a sort of template language in its own right &#8211; I never littered <code>print</code>s all over my code, I kept all the calls in a single place, in fact, usually a single expression. That is also why I find it strange that people create template languages for PHP, which was itself born as a template language. What matters is that the output generation is separate from the processing logic, whether or not the template and the code are in different languages.\n\nAnyway, I digress.\n\nWhat I wanted to say is, no, I hadn&#8217;t seen either ZPT or Kid.

Logic and presentation in separate blocks / files / etc.  And then, my take is that if you're going to have your presentation/view separate from the logic/controller, you may as well code the presentation in a form as close to the goal as possible (ie. in XML or HTML, not in s-expressions or the logic implementation idiom)—especially since oftimes you've got separate people or teams working primarily on each.\n\nI suspect, however, that a templating system like Kid goes quite a ways toward solving the problem of \"gluing strings together\".

Your MT installation permitted Markdown but no literal tags, which caught me off guard once or twice until I noticed. But thankfully it had a preview button, so I could figure it out. I <strong><em>hate</em></strong> how WordPress does not ship with preview button available and enabled by default, and the default configuration doesn't even mention the expected formatting anywhere either.\n\nI just suspected that your WordPress was vanilla and used HTML on that hunch &#8211; and it worked.

Often people want me to switch to templates.  At the moment, when you want to radically change the HTML for the stuff that is not the wiki content, ie. headers and footers, you need to override the Perl subs that I provide.  Somehow that strikes me as natural and easy, but many of my users seem to disagree, preferring to learn a templating system instead of learning to write Perl code.  I'm still undecided about the issue.  At the moment I'm still sticking to the \"write Perl code instead of templating\" because being able to write Perl code will make so many other task easy.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084938\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084938\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-27T11:31:23\">2005-09-27T11:31:23</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Alex:  Well, from my perspective, I've worked on a lot of teams where you've essentially got two roles—software engineer (SE) and interface engineer (IE).

There's usually overlap, of course, but these are the roles on paper at least.</p>\n\n<p>When you're trying to come up with an overarching framework which accomodates collaboration between these two sorts of people and their respective skill sets, it helps to have a bridge between the logic and the presentation which can keep the Perl out of the HTML and the HTML out of the Perl.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand...

In a nutshell:  It polls feeds and downloads the data.  New entries are split out into individual files, like an email or usenet spool.  That&#39;s it.  Other programs are expected to do the clever bits.</p>\n<p>And, to go along with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/feedspool/\">FeedSpool</a>, I&#39;ve been toying with building a Spotlight importer for OS X Tiger which indexes RSS and Atom feeds and entries.  Not in Subversion yet, and not nearly ready for public consumption, but it&#39;s been pretty fun to play with.

I've also continued working a bit with some feed hacks since finishing the book.  \r\n\r\n[FeedSpool][feedspool] is one of these: I've revived some of FeedReactor's old code--this time aiming for a much higher degree of simplicity, trying to stick with standard Python modules, and dumping the database altogether.  \r\n\r\nI've been meaning to make a more formal announcement about this thing, once it's a bit more in usable shape.  In a nutshell:  It polls feeds and downloads the data.  New entries are split out into individual files, like an email or usenet spool.  That's it.  Other programs are expected to do the clever bits.\r\n\r\nAnd, to go along with [FeedSpool][feedspool], I've been toying with building a Spotlight importer for OS X Tiger which indexes RSS and Atom feeds and entries.  Not in Subversion yet, and not nearly ready for public consumption, but it's been pretty fun to play with.  (And I totally forgot just how many feeds I have lying around on my hard drive!)\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's enough for now.  Time to post this and get to thinking about what I want to post next!\r\n\r\n[feedspool]: http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/feedspool/\r\n[quick]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/08/12/quick-and-random-thoughts\r\n[noticed]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/12/redesigninprogress#comment-1850\r\n[kottke]: http://www.kottke.org/03/11/kottke-redesign\r\n[asides]: http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Asides\r\n[hackingfeeds]: http://www.hackingfeeds.com/blog/\r\n[book]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/13/hacking-rss-and-atom-is-out \"Hacking RSS and Atom is out! » Archive » Blog » 0xDECAFBAD\"\r\n[redesign]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/12/redesigninprogress \"Redesign in progress (or, no need to adjust your set) » Archive » Blog » 0xDECAFBAD\"\r\n[yak]: http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html \"yak shaving\"\r\n[hulk]: http://www.hulkgames.com/us/ \"THE INCREDIBLE HULK: ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION\"\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083237\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083237\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-23T02:03:28\">2005-09-23T02:03:28</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Just a quick note that as of this writing, neither the feeds (ironic!) nor commenting works at hackingfeeds.com.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083238\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083238\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-23T02:18:02\">2005-09-23T02:18:02</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Aristotle:  Thanks for the note!

I intended to read my feeds with tin or slrn (I'd use thunderbird now) and call it a day.  I didn't get very far with it, though, because I couldn't find an NNTP server package that I was happy with, and then something shinier came along.  I think there is a lot of merit to this idea, though, and I'm going to be taking a look at FeedSpool.</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

And [you should buy it!][buy]  Lookee, lookee:  It's already got a 5-star review from someone I don't even know!\r\n\r\nFor the moment, I'm going to wrap up this post, finish my dinner, and go for a walk with the girl--but, when we get back, I think I might post a few more details on what you'll find in my book debut. \r\n\r\n[buy]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1\r\n[announce]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/07/belated-happy-new-year\r\n[quick]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/02/19/writing-no-things-of-epic-import\r\n[dec04]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/12/\r\n[book]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2005/04/25/hacking-rss-and-atom-is-a-real-book\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082500\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://monkey.org/~jose/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d74863ca9c7785cd396379766095036c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://monkey.org/~jose/\">jose</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082500\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-14T01:03:36\">2005-09-14T01:03:36</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">congrats, les, if anyone should have written that book it's you. i'm glad to see it's hit the shelves .. now to go find a copy and look it over :)</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082501\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://stingthebee.nu\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0c6c4240507baf594a95fd3b25b975d2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://stingthebee.nu\">Jim Renaud</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082501\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-14T01:54:39\">2005-09-14T01:54:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Congrats Les.

But, just for The Girl, here's me with the new book!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/09/IMG_3562.JPG\" target=\"_new\"><img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2005/09/IMG_3562_th.JPG\" /></a><br />\r\n\r\n[book]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/0764597582/\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088745\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=abfc88b96ae18c85ba7aac3bded2ec5e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/\">Ryan Tomayko</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088745\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-13T07:59:13\">2005-09-13T07:59:13</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Looks great!</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088746\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088746\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-13T11:23:34\">2005-09-13T11:23:34</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Awesome, now get back to posting on a regular basis! ;)</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088747\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.skippy.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1a320ac7f6818504df79fe42fc6b84a9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.skippy.net/\">skippy</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088747\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-13T13:14:17\">2005-09-13T13:14:17</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Welcome to WordPress!
