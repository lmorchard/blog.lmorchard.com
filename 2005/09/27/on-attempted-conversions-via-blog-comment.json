Seems like we might like the same technologies, maybe the same TV shows and music.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I think it&#39;s a really strange thing, to be so similar yet so different.  But, usually, I just smile and nod and move on—there&#39;s no sense in trying to convert someone on their own blog, if there&#39;s even a way to convert them in the first place.</p>\n<p>And besides, I don&#39;t even like the idea of trying to induce a conversion in the first place—best thing to do is just meet in peace on whatever common grounds exist.  And, if there&#39;s any changing of opinions in the cards, it&#39;ll happen naturally.  Which assumes, of course, that you&#39;re dealing with rational actors.  When you&#39;re not, that&#39;s when you may need to revisit your strategy and likely walk away.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083143\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://gfmorris.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=505e3b39dcea29b3ded74a5494c493eb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://gfmorris.net/\">Geof F.

I mean, I look at all of us like circles on Venn diagrams: we overlap in spots, but not everywhere.  I&#39;ve yet to find the blogger with whom I agree 100% and wholeheartedly [if I found them, I&#39;d just stop, y&#39;know?].</p>\n\n<p>And frankly, I think it&#39;s good to read the opposing viewpoints, even if you get really angry and disagree.  I hope that it&#39;s a situation where we can all admit that, at some level, they have a point.  [Not everyone does, though.]  I generally assume that folks are rational actors trying to muddle through with logic---we just have a varying set of basic assumptions from which we start, which may or may not be variable...</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083145&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://emmott.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b1ec7a0c94d320d3c4727015bf111127&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://emmott.net&quot;&gt;Kevan Emmott&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083145&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2005-09-28T05:22:14&quot;&gt;2005-09-28T05:22:14&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think Keith&#39;s site was one of the first that had me so interested in some parts and so appalled at others. But there are certainly plenty out there. I guess I could just subscribe to a specific tag or category they have on their blog, but then you get this weird half truth...&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre><p><p>BTW, nice implementation of Wordpress - one of the better Kubrick-based ones I&#39;ve seen (liking the AJAX commenting, for instance :-)).</p></div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
