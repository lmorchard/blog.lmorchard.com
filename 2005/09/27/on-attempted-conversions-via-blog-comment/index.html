<p>That&#39;s all I have to say about the matter, though I do find it strange that people would complain about and try to dictate what I put on my eponymous web site. You can just stop reading if you&#39;d like. You don&#39;t need to tell me about it.</p>

<p>There are a handful or two of bloggers to whose feeds I&#39;m subscribed who occasionally post things to which I&#39;m vehemently opposed—right-wing US politics, certain religious stances, etc.  But for the most part, I seem to agree with them the rest of the time.  Seems like we might like the same technologies, maybe the same TV shows and music.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think it&#39;s a really strange thing, to be so similar yet so different.  But, usually, I just smile and nod and move on—there&#39;s no sense in trying to convert someone on their own blog, if there&#39;s even a way to convert them in the first place.</p>
<p>And besides, I don&#39;t even like the idea of trying to induce a conversion in the first place—best thing to do is just meet in peace on whatever common grounds exist.  And, if there&#39;s any changing of opinions in the cards, it&#39;ll happen naturally.  Which assumes, of course, that you&#39;re dealing with rational actors.  When you&#39;re not, that&#39;s when you may need to revisit your strategy and likely walk away.</p>

<div class="content"><p>Exactly, Les.  I mean, I look at all of us like circles on Venn diagrams: we overlap in spots, but not everywhere.  I&#39;ve yet to find the blogger with whom I agree 100% and wholeheartedly [if I found them, I&#39;d just stop, y&#39;know?].</p>
<p>And frankly, I think it&#39;s good to read the opposing viewpoints, even if you get really angry and disagree.  I hope that it&#39;s a situation where we can all admit that, at some level, they have a point.  [Not everyone does, though.]  I generally assume that folks are rational actors trying to muddle through with logic---we just have a varying set of basic assumptions from which we start, which may or may not be variable...</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>Yeah, I think Keith&#39;s site was one of the first that had me so interested in some parts and so appalled at others. But there are certainly plenty out there. I guess I could just subscribe to a specific tag or category they have on their blog, but then you get this weird half truth...</p>
<p>BTW, nice implementation of Wordpress - one of the better Kubrick-based ones I&#39;ve seen (liking the AJAX commenting, for instance :-)).</p></div>
