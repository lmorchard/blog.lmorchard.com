Maybe it&#39;ll take <a href=\"http://www.space.com/news/050920_nasa_moon_response.html\">putting another man on the Moon</a> to make the role &quot;rocket scientist&quot; a non-ironic hero again.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, although I&#39;m no religious scholar and will resort to sheer snark during debate, here&#39;s my angry answer to ID proponents:  </p>\n<p>When did God tell you to give up your mind and stop naming things?  Intelligent Design is &quot;<a href=\"http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9452500/page/2/\">utterly boring</a>&quot; and doesn&#39;t help you at all to fulfill one of the first and most basic of mandates in the Bible.  Given this, how can ID be anything but poison?</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Dahlia Lithwick at Slate says it all in &quot;<a href=\"http://slate.msn.com/id/2127054/\">Mind the Gaps - Intelligent design as an answer to all life&#39;s great conundrums</a>&quot;</p>\n<blockquote cite=\"http://slate.msn.com/id/2127054/\">ID says we shouldn&#39;t bother ourselves with resolving scientific inconsistencies or untangling puzzles. We should recognize that what God really wants is for us just to stop learning.</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Also, because I thought it was so apropos:</p>\n<p><blockquote cite=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2005/09/30/intelligent_design_and_me\">And Heâ€™s not going to create a Universe based on rational laws, then not want us to practice our rationality.</blockquote><small style=\"text-align:right; display:block\">Source: <a href=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2005/09/30/intelligent_design_and_me\">The Fishbowl: Intelligent Design and Me</a></small><br /></p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086427\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://singe.rucus.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=70f4c3580e61128421cd3899a2dcf6f1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://singe.rucus.net/\">Dominic White</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086427\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-09-29T19:58:40\">2005-09-29T19:58:40</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Have a look at <a href=\"http://talkorigins.net/\">http://talkorigins.net/</a> it has all sorts of interesting refutations of intelligent design.
