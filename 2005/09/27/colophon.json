I live with two spotted Ocicats, two dwarf bunnies, and a very patient and understanding <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/09/wedding-day-is-today\">wife</a>.  On rare occasions when spare time comes in copious amounts, I play around with odd bits of code and writing here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-under-the-hood-\">What&#39;s under the hood?</h2>\n<p>This site largely runs on <a href=\"http://www.wordpress.org\">WordPress</a> now, with a small handful of tweaks and hacks I couldn&#39;t resist tossing in.  I haven&#39;t yet done any proper release of my modifications here, but I may someday and certainly am not averse to sharing when asked.</p>\n<p>@@ Watch this space as I rebuild this site with things it used to have.  (ie. a wiki, projects, links, etc)</p>\n<h2 id=\"got-any-plugins-\">Got any plugins?</h2>\n<p>In no particular order, here&#39;s an overview of the plugins I use around here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://elasticdog.com/2004/09/optimal-title/\">Optimal Title</a> -- I like making my page titles read from specific to general, so this helps me lead with the post title and trail with the blog title.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.dreamprojections.com/SyntaxHighlighter/\">dp.SyntaxHighlighter</a> -- Beats all those clumsy attempts I&#39;ve made using &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; tags and textareas.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/\">PHP Markdown</a> -- I got hooked on Markdown while using Blosxom and Movable Type.  There&#39;s no turning back now.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://blogwaffe.com/2005/06/14/298/\">AJAX Comment Preview</a> -- By semi-popular demand, I offer AJAX-enabled comment preview.  It seems pretty nifty to have.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.w-a-s-a-b-i.com/archives/2004/05/26/wordpress-related-entries-plugin/\">Related Posts</a> -- I think that attempting to show some relation between posts provides a better way to wander around in archives than by dates.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/\">Ultimate Tag Warrior</a> -- It&#39;s an ultimate warrior for tagging.  I dislike the usual category technology, am hooked on del.icio.us tagging, so here we are.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://orderedlist.com/articles/wordpress-administration-design-tiger/\" title=\"WordPress Administration Design: Tiger // Ordered List by Steve Smith\">WordPress Administration Design: Tiger</a> -- Because WordPress&#39; default admin style kinda looks like butt.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"history\">History</h2>\n<p><strong>2002</strong>: <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20020525024010/http://www.decafbad.com/\">It looked like this.</a> I launched this site on a lark, liking the name <code>oxDECAFBAD</code>.  It&#39;s a 32-bit hexadecimal number, as well as an expression of distaste for things not containing caffeine.   Initially, the software was <a href=\"http://www.movabletype.org\">Movable Type</a>, which I quickly overwhelmed with hacks and plugins and all manner of crap.</p>\n<p><strong>2003</strong>: <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030603165048/www.decafbad.com/blog/\">It looked like this.</a>  Tired of the crud I&#39;d accumulated with my Movable Type exploits, I rebooted things and reworked everything to use <a href=\"http://blosxom.com\">Blosxom</a>.  I also started taking a turn away from blogging &quot;proper&quot; and mostly posted lists of links for awhile.</p>\n<p><strong>2004</strong>: <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20040618092324/www.decafbad.com/blog/\">It looked like this.</a>  I stole some ideas from <a href=\"http://diveintoaccessibility.org/\">Mark Pilgrim&#39;s accessibility series</a> (whether it showed or not), and planned to switch to a more verbose and article-oriented style of blogging.  I also tried to integrate my wiki and link-blogging activities into a more unified navigation on the site.  Unfortunately, the net result was that the only thing that really every got updated was my linkblog.</p>\n<p><strong>2005</strong>: Wanting to switch back to a more free and lightweight style of blogging, I ditched Movable Type and my article-length-biased templates.  (For some reason, I always end up making MT move like a battleship.)  This is another reboot, and as such, many of my site&#39;s previous features (ie. the wiki and linkblog) have gone away until I&#39;ve had a chance to reevaluate them.</p>\n<p><strong>@@ More soon.</strong></p>\n"}
