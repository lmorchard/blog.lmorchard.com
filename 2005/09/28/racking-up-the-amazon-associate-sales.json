That&#39;s already been done! Why you lousy son of a...</p>\n\n<p>Seriously, I&#39;m going back and doing all kinds of things with rss after I perused your ideas. Made me think of the idea of creating a most recent comments rss feed for my sites that I can rig up to google&#39;s homepage to keep track of what is going on...anything you want to keep track of when you wake up in the morning, as long as its in rss form you can view everytime you open your browser--or whatever else you would like to rig it up to. </p>\n\n<p>As for Australia, funny how things work--I just quit my software job to do some contracting work for JWT on fordvehicles.com. We still live in a shitty apartment, but we&#39;re moving to a house on the beach in three months--my wife&#39;s brother is moving to Japan and we&#39;re taking over the place. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, for everyone else out there, Les spent a LOT of time writing this book, and even if he didn&#39;t put police state references in it, it is still worth reading.</p>\n\n<p><p>Cheers!</p></div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
