I've told people for years that <em>every</em> other social software app on the web is a reinvention of LiveJournal, done badly.  </p>\n<p>I'll never do it, but ever since I realized that LJ was Open Source, I've wanted to launch my own LJ-based social software site.

Quite like the typical computer club / writer's workshop / keyboard school in meatspace, where the locality of people is a bigger constraint to the makeup of the membership than the intensity of their interest. On LJ, I think the key factor is that it's so easy to find dedicated topical online communities, which offer a far more satisfactory experience, that only those who cannot be bothered to look for them are compelled to look for corresponding communities on LJ.</p>\n<p>On a different note, another case of succesful social networking just occured to me---Flickr. There too the networking it is a very successful component, cherished by many, but again only a component that compounds the experience, not an end in itself. And arguably that's why it's so successful.</p></div>\n\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083715\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sporkmonger.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=56ee28134dd0776825445e3551979b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\"></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sporkmonger.com\">Bob Aman</a>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#comment-221083715\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-20T19:16:52\">2005-10-20T19:16:52</time></a></p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"content\"><p>After some careful consideration, I decided to rename SporkID to something more generic sounding (Sporklet) and pull the identity stuff right out of the application.</p>\n<p>But to answer your question, absolutely, yes.  I am definately planning on building on top of OpenID, and possibly Sxip (though not definately).  I'm working on a modular reputation-based authorization system of identity, which I'm planning on setting up under a non-profit org in order to allay any fears people might have of, say, having my company get acquired by another larger company and then finding themselves having lost control of their identity.</p>\n<p>The general idea is, \"Great, we've got a decent, easy to implement system of authenticating via OpenID, but the decentralized model doesn't work quite as well for authorization systems because systems can lie.\"  So what I'm working on is a method of bringing different trust metrics under a single roof that's easy to access via a REST web services API.  And then Sporklet (the stuff I described in my earlier comment) just makes use of the reputation/identity stuff in the background.</p></div>\n\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n",

Quite like the typical computer club / writer's workshop / keyboard school in meatspace, where the locality of people is a bigger constraint to the makeup of the membership than the intensity of their interest. On LJ, I think the key factor is that it's so easy to find dedicated topical online communities, which offer a far more satisfactory experience, that only those who cannot be bothered to look for them are compelled to look for corresponding communities on LJ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a different note, another case of succesful social networking just occured to me---Flickr. There too the networking it is a very successful component, cherished by many, but again only a component that compounds the experience, not an end in itself. And arguably that's why it's so successful.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083715\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://sporkmonger.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=56ee28134dd0776825445e3551979b14&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://sporkmonger.com\">Bob Aman</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083715\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-10-20T19:16:52\">2005-10-20T19:16:52</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>After some careful consideration, I decided to rename SporkID to something more generic sounding (Sporklet) and pull the identity stuff right out of the application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But to answer your question, absolutely, yes.  I am definately planning on building on top of OpenID, and possibly Sxip (though not definately).  I'm working on a modular reputation-based authorization system of identity, which I'm planning on setting up under a non-profit org in order to allay any fears people might have of, say, having my company get acquired by another larger company and then finding themselves having lost control of their identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The general idea is, \"Great, we've got a decent, easy to implement system of authenticating via OpenID, but the decentralized model doesn't work quite as well for authorization systems because systems can lie.\"  So what I'm working on is a method of bringing different trust metrics under a single roof that's easy to access via a REST web services API.  And then Sporklet (the stuff I described in my earlier comment) just makes use of the reputation/identity stuff in the background.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",
