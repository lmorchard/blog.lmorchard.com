The world would really be a better place if he could go on with his project.

The potential to do something beautiful that every person has inside should be explored better. If the Third World were only half as civilized as we are, they would contribute so much to the development of civilization that the world would be different. How many MILLION of poor people JUST DIE every day, every second just because of their extreme poverty problems. What would be, if we helped them to help themselves? To become educated, to read, to understand how it could be different, and than to do the hardest part by themselves?</p></div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
