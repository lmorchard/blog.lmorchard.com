Again.  True, life itself has been pretty busy lately.  The days are booked, the weekends have been filling up--and in spare moments I&#39;ve been obsessed with <a href=\"http://www.hulkgames.com/us/\" title=\"THE INCREDIBLE HULK: ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION\">jumping from building to building</a>.  But, when it comes down to me and a pile of code on the screen, I find myself in ever further depths of recursion.</p>\n<p>For instance, I keep meaning to get down to posting some <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Asides\">lightweight &quot;asides&quot;</a> in place of my old <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/08/12/quick-and-random-thoughts\">&quot;quick bullets&quot;</a> posts I was doing.  But, of course, before I do that, I want to do some <a href=\"http://www.kottke.org/03/11/kottke-redesign\">Kottkesque template mungeing</a> to more properly present these smaller bits.  </p>\n<p>And, though I&#39;m actually most of the way done making another rev to the theme here, I also want to fold my linkblog back into the site.  The absence of these <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/12/redesigninprogress#comment-1850\">has already been noticed</a>, so I&#39;d like to give those a proper treatment.</p>\n<p>In addition, I still mean to start pimping my new book a bit; maybe even starting tonight.  I&#39;ve got a notion to post teasers highlighting a few of my favorite things.  And then, of course, there&#39;s the <a href=\"http://www.hackingfeeds.com/blog/\">neglected companion site</a> on which I&#39;ve yet to spend much time at all.  But I&#39;ve got grand plans, including some which go beyond the book itself and toward making <a href=\"http://www.hackingfeeds.com/blog/\">hackingfeeds.com</a> a regularly updated and relevant resource.</p>\n<p>Speaking of that...  I&#39;ve also continued working a bit with some feed hacks since finishing the book.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/feedspool/\">FeedSpool</a> is one of these: I&#39;ve revived some of FeedReactor&#39;s old code--this time aiming for a much higher degree of simplicity, trying to stick with standard Python modules, and dumping the database altogether.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to make a more formal announcement about this thing, once it&#39;s a bit more in usable shape.  In a nutshell:  It polls feeds and downloads the data.  New entries are split out into individual files, like an email or usenet spool.  That&#39;s it.

Not in Subversion yet, and not nearly ready for public consumption, but it&#39;s been pretty fun to play with.  (And I totally forgot just how many feeds I have lying around on my hard drive!)</p>\n<p>Anyway, that&#39;s enough for now.
