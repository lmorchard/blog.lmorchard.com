I won&#39;t say this is the start of a renewed blogging habit, but let&#39;s see what happens.





Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions
afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it
allows users to pair the selection of an object with the
execution of an action, often including a second object in the
operation.  It&#39;s a simple yet powerful UI concept used to
support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),
and even the creation of link relationships.

Since it&#39;s so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web
applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first
offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although
mousedown, mousemove, and
mouseup made it possible, the implementation has been
limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,
since these events refer only to the object being dragged,
there&#39;s a challenge to find the subject of the drop when
the interaction is completed.

Of course, that doesn&#39;t prevent most modern JavaScript
frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and
throwing in some flourishes while they&#39;re at it.  But, wouldn&#39;t
it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and
drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?

As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification 
section on new drag-and-drop events, and 
Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation of those events.

If you want to jump straight to the code, I&#39;ve put together 
some simple demos 
of the new events.  

I&#39;ve even scratched an itch of my own and
built the beginnings of an outline editor,
where every draggable element is also a drop target—of which
there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something
that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past
while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.

<div id="events">
<h2>The New Drag and Drop Events</h2>
<p>
So, with no further ado, here are the new drag and drop events,
in roughly the order you might expect to see them fired:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>dragstart</code></dt>
<dd>
A drag has been initiated, with the dragged element as the
event target.
</dd>
<dt><code>drag</code></dt>
<dd>
The mouse has moved, with the dragged element as the event target.
</dd>
<dt><code>dragenter</code></dt>
<dd>
The dragged element has been moved into a drop listener,
with the drop listener element as the event target.
</dd>
<dt><code>dragover</code></dt>
<dd>
The dragged element has been moved over a drop listener,
with the drop listener element as the event target.  Since
the default behavior is to cancel drops, returning
<code>false</code> or calling <code>preventDefault()</code> in
the event handler indicates that a drop is allowed here.
</dd>
<dt><code>dragleave</code></dt>
<dd>
The dragged element has been moved out of a drop listener,
with the drop listener element as the event target.
</dd>
<dt><code>drop</code></dt>
<dd>
The dragged element has been successfully dropped on a drop
listener, with the drop listener element as the event
target.
</dd>
<dt><code>dragend</code></dt>
<dd>
A drag has been ended, successfully or not, with the
dragged element as the event target.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Like the mouse events of yore, listeners can be attached to
elements using <code>addEventListener()</code> 
directly or by way of your favorite JS library.  
</p><p>
Consider the following example using jQuery, 
<a target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#newschool">also available as a live demo</a>:
</p>
<pre lang="javascript" line="1"><div id="newschool">
<div class="dragme">Drag me!</div>


<div class="drophere">Drop here!</div>


</div>



<script type="text/javascript">
$(document).ready(function() {
$('#newschool .dragme')
.attr('draggable', 'true')
.bind('dragstart', function(ev) {
var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;
dt.setData("Text", "Dropped in zone!");
return true;
})
.bind('dragend', function(ev) {
return false;
});
$('#newschool .drophere')
.bind('dragenter', function(ev) {
$(ev.target).addClass('dragover');
return false;
})
.bind('dragleave', function(ev) {
$(ev.target).removeClass('dragover');
return false;
})
.bind('dragover', function(ev) {
return false;
})
.bind('drop', function(ev) {
var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;
alert(dt.getData('Text'));
return false;
});
});
</script>

<p>
Thanks to the new events and jQuery, this example is both short
and simple—but it packs in a lot of functionality, as the rest
of this article will explain.  
</p><p>
Before moving on, there are at least three things about the above
code that are worth mentioning:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Drop targets are enabled by virtue of having
listeners for drop events.  But, 
<a target="_new" href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#drag-and-drop-processing-model">per the HTML 5 spec</a>,
draggable elements need an
attribute of <code>draggable="true"</code>, set either in
markup or in JavaScript.  
</p>
<p>
Thus, <code>$('#newschool&nbsp;.dragme').attr('draggable', 'true')</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The original DOM event (as opposed to jQuery's event
wrapper) offers a property called <code>dataTransfer</code>.
Beyond just manipulating elements, the new drag and drop
events accomodate the transmission of user-definable data
during the course of the interaction.  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Since these are first-class events, you can apply 
<a target="_new" href="http://icant.co.uk/sandbox/eventdelegation/">the technique of Event Delegation</a>.
</p><p>
What's that?  Well, imagine you have a list of 1000
list items—as part of a deeply-nested outline document,
for instance.  Rather than needing to attach listeners
or otherwise fiddle with all 1000 items, simply attach
a listener to the parent node (eg. the
<code></code></p><ul> element) and all events from
the children will propagate up to the single parent listener.
As a bonus, all new child elements added after page
load will enjoy the same benefits.
<p></p><p>
<a target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#delegated">Check out this demo</a>, 
and 
<a target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-delegated.js">the associated JS code</a> 
to see more about these events and Event Delegation.
</p>

</ul>


</li></ul></pre></div>



<div id="datatransfer">
<h2>Using dataTransfer</h2>
<p>
As mentioned in the last section, the new drag and drop events
let you send data along with a dragged element.  But, it's even
better than that:  Your drop targets can receive data
transferred by content objects dragged into the window from 
other browser windows, and even <i>other applications</i>.
</p><p>
Since the example is a bit longer,  
<a target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#data_transfer">check out the live demo</a>
and 
<a target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-datatransfer.js">associated code</a>
to get an idea of what's possible with <code>dataTransfer</code>.
</p><p>
In a nutshell, the stars of this show are the
<code>setData()</code> and <code>getData()</code> methods of
the <code>dataTransfer</code> property exposed by the Event object.
</p>
<p>
The <code>setData()</code> method is typically called in the 
<code>dragstart</code> listener, loading <code>dataTransfer</code>
up with one or more strings of content with associated
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Recommended_Drag_Types#link">recommended content types</a>.
</p>
<p>
For illustration, here's a quick snippet from the example code:
</p>
<pre lang="javascript" line="1">var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    
dt.setData('text/plain', $('#logo').parent().text());
dt.setData('text/html', $('#logo').parent().html());
dt.setData('text/uri-list', $('#logo')[0].src);
</pre>
<p></p><p>
On the other end, <code>getData()</code> allows you to query
for content by type (eg. <code>text/html</code> followed by
<code>text/plain</code>).  This, in turn, allows you to decide
on acceptable content types at the time of the
<code>drop</code> event or even during <code>dragover</code>
to offer feedback for unacceptable types during the drag.
</p><p>
Here's another example from the receiving end of the example code:
</p>
<pre lang="javascript" line="1">var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    
$('.content_url .content').text(dt.getData('text/uri-list'));
$('.content_text .content').text(dt.getData('text/plain'));
$('.content_html .content').html(dt.getData('text/html'));
</pre>

<p>
Where <code>dataTransfer</code> really shines, though, is that
it allows your drop targets to receive content from 
sources outside your defined draggable elements and even from
outside the browser altogether.  Firefox accepts such drags, 
and attempts to populate <code>dataTransfer</code> with
appropriate content types extracted from the external object.
</p><p>
Thus, you could select some text in a word processor window and
drop it into one of your elements, and at least expect to find
it available as <code>text/plain</code> content.  
</p><p>
You can also select content in 
another browser window, and expect to see <code>text/html</code>
appear in your events.  Check out the 
<a target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html">outline editing demo</a>
and see what happens when you try dragging various elements

<h2>Using Drag Feedback Images</h2>
<p>
An important aspect of the drag and drop interaction is a
representation of the thing being dragged.  By default in
Firefox, this is a "ghost" image of the dragged element itself.  But,
the <code>dataTransfer</code> property of the original Event
object exposes the method <code>setDragImage()</code> for use
in customizing this representation.
</p><p>
There's
<a target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#feedback_image">a live demo</a> of this feature, as well as
<a target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-feedback-images.js">associated JS code</a> 
available.  The gist, however, is sketched out in these code snippets:
</p>
<pre lang="javascript" line="1">var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    

<p>dt.setDragImage( $('#feedback_image h2')[0], 0, 0);</p>
<p>dt.setDragImage( $('#logo')[0], 32, 32); </p>
<p>var canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
canvas.width = canvas.height = 50;</p>
<p>var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
ctx.lineWidth = 8;
ctx.moveTo(25,0);
ctx.lineTo(50, 50);
ctx.lineTo(0, 50);
ctx.lineTo(25, 0);
ctx.stroke();</p>
<p>dt.setDragImage(canvas, 25, 25);
</p></pre><p></p>
<p>
You can supply a DOM node as the first parameter to 
<code>setDragImage()</code>, which includes everything from
text to images to <code>canvas</code> elements.  The
second two parameters indicate at what left and top offset
the mouse should appear in the image while dragging.
</p><p>
For example, since the <code>#logo</code> image is 64x64,
the parameters in the second <code>setDragImage()</code>
method places the mouse right in the center of the image.
On the other hand, the first call positions the feedback
image such that the mouse rests in the upper left corner.
</p><p>
</p>
</div>



<div id="dragfeedback">
<h2>Using Drop Effects</h2>
<p>
As mentioned at the start of this article, the drag and drop
interaction has been used to support actions such as copying,
moving, and linking.  Accordingly, the HTML 5 specification 
accomodates these operations in the form of the 
<code>effectAllowed</code> and <code>dropEffect</code>
properties exposed by the Event object.
</p>
<p>
For a quick fix, check out the
<a target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#drag_effects">a live demo</a> 
of this feature, as well as the
<a target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-effects.js">associated JS code</a>.
</p><p>
The basic idea is that the <code>dragstart</code> event
listener can set a value for <code>effectAllowed</code> like so:
</p>
<pre lang="javascript" line="1">var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;
switch (ev.target.id) {
case 'effectdrag0': dt.effectAllowed = 'copy'; break;
case 'effectdrag1': dt.effectAllowed = 'move'; break;
case 'effectdrag2': dt.effectAllowed = 'link'; break;
case 'effectdrag3': dt.effectAllowed = 'all'; break;
case 'effectdrag4': dt.effectAllowed = 'none'; break;
}
</pre>
<p>The choices available for this property include the following:</p>
<dl> 
<dt><code>none</code></dt><dd>no operation is permitted </dd>
<dt><code>copy</code></dt><dd>copy only </dd>
<dt><code>move</code></dt><dd>move only </dd>
<dt><code>link</code></dt><dd>link only </dd>
<dt><code>copyMove</code></dt><dd>copy or move only </dd>
<dt><code>copyLink</code></dt><dd>copy or link only </dd>
<dt><code>linkMove</code></dt><dd>link or move only </dd>
<dt><code>all</code></dt><dd>copy, move, or link </dd>
</dl>
<p>
On the other end, the <code>dragover</code> event listener 
can set the value of the
<code>dropEffect</code> property to indicate the expected effect
invoked on a successful drop.  If the value does
not match up with <code>effectAllowed</code>, the drop will
be considered cancelled on completion.
</p><p>
In the 
<a target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#drag_effects">a live demo</a>,
you should be able to see that only elements with matching
effects can be dropped into the appropriate drop zones.  This
is accomplished with code like the following:
</p>
<pre lang="javascript" line="1">var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;
switch (ev.target.id) {
case 'effectdrop0': dt.dropEffect = 'copy'; break;
case 'effectdrop1': dt.dropEffect = 'move'; break;
case 'effectdrop2': dt.dropEffect = 'link'; break;
case 'effectdrop3': dt.dropEffect = 'all'; break;
case 'effectdrop4': dt.dropEffect = 'none'; break;
}
</pre>
<p>
Although the OS itself can provide some feedback, you 
can also use these properties to update your own visible 
feedback, both on the dragged element and on the drop zone
itself.
</p>

<div id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The new first-class drag and drop events in HTML5 and Firefox
make supporting this form of UI interaction simple, concise,
and powerful in the browser.  But beyond the new simplicity of
these events, the ability to transfer content between
applications opens brand new avenues for web-based applications
and collaboration with desktop software in general.

<div class="content"><p>Wow - thanks for a great introduction to D+D in HTML 5, I'm really looking forward to giving it a thorough road test. </p>
<p>The key part of the implementation are the target listeners, because, as I'm sure you're aware, onmouseover would historically never fire over the target element because the dragged item would always 'cover it up'. BTW, my proposed solution was to add an 'event transparency' property, which would have made the dragged item invisible from the point of view of selected events, eg onmouseover.</p>
<p>This implementation is going to take a lot of pain away. You have no idea how many hoops I had to jump through to get a fully generic D+D implementation working without these new calls.</p>
<p>If you're interested, you can see it working here: http://lmframework.com/page.php?id=vd_twig_short_2</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>Hey,</p>
<p>Looks great and useful article.  For dragging from external applications (such as the Desktop) is a normal webpage able to get the data from the drop?  I was just playing with it and seem to always get what seems to be a security error with getData or mozGetDataAt.  However, the documentation seems to state that on drop that data should be made available to the page.  Likewise, in the same way an image can be dragged off the page onto the desktop, can an arbitrary element be dragged onto the desktop with whatever file content to be saved?  Thanks for the help.</p>

<div class="content"><p>Dragging &amp; dropping <em>is</em> as you say, a "one of the most fundamental interations" that users of computer graphical interfaces have come to know, and expect.</p>
<p>It therefore completes dumbfounds me how it is that we <em>still</em> can not natively drag &amp; scroll (&amp; then drop) in Firefox. We can only drag &amp; drop an item within the currently visible portion of a Firefox webpage or tab, no further up, no further down.</p>
<p>That is should be limited makes absolutely no sense. Microsoft built the function into their Windows 3.x (file) Explorer, and then when visual browsers came along, naturally carried it through into Internet Explorer. </p>
<p>Firefox Bug 41708, "Should be able to scroll in the viewport while dragging" was opened in June, 2000 (yes, 9 years ago!) and remains open, and is disregarded by Firefox developers as little more than a trivial little annoyance, and therefore is and should be treated as a low-importance 'enhancement' rather than as the 'standard feature' it should really be.</p>
<p>If it weren't for the extension 'DragToScroll', which has been around for 3-1/2 years now (not updated in a long time but still works if you override version compatibility), I would have dumped Firefox and switched to a different browser (Maxthon 3, most likely).</p>
<p>So, I'm wondering (and hoping) -- does the new HTML5 drag and drop specification include anything that if implemented properly would make it possible to scroll &amp; drag?</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>@RenegadeX: Ugh.  I don't work on the browser itself, but I noticed that unexpected behavior on drag &amp; drop.  The window really should scroll when you get toward the top or bottom while dragging - and, in fact, most pre-HTML5 JS frameworks do that in their own drag &amp; drop abstractions.  </p>
<p>Until / unless Firefox gets this fixed, the same sort of auto-scrolling could be hacked in to HTML5 drag and drop.  Not perfect, but it's doable.  That is, in the drag event, you can check if the mouse is near the upper or lower edge of the viewport - and if so, start scrolling appropriately. That's pretty much how the JS frameworks do it with old-school D&amp;D</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>Why not a first class WYSIWYG rich text editor with copy from clipboard image support?  </p>
<p><em>NO ONE</em> has built a decent text editor in JavaScript - At least not that I've seen.  And browsers don't allow image paste for reasons I don't understand.  </p>
<p>And by decent I mean just like you'd get in textmate or another editor.  Have the standard text editor features everyone expects:  tab, select indent/select unindent, resize image, home, end, duplicate line, delete line, styling, etc.</p>
<p>would push the browser to the next level in killing the desktop.  non-techies hate wikis.  They want a real editor.  I do too actually.... would be great for forums, bug tracking system (imagine pasting screen shots in line with your bug desc), email, etc.</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>This is a great move forward no more relying on 3rd party apps and extensions to play video or audio, i have been reading up on HTML 5 at the <a href="http://html5tutorial.net/" title="HTML tutorials" rel="nofollow">HTML 5 Tutorials</a> website, i am now playing around with one of the free templates and was wondering how to embed audio, so thanks a lot, great information, lets hope more people lean towards HTML 5 and SOON!!!</p>
<p>The drag and drop feature i did not notice was already working in FF 3.5, i was told to get Safari to see HTML 5 in action. Thanks for a great post</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>A million thank yous!  This article was great introduction to HTML5 D+D.  With it, I was able to extend it to other browsers.  It was a little painful at first because the browser implementations diverge in significant, but manageable ways.</p>
<p>If you are interested, check out my article at http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2010/01/10/cross-browser-html5-drag-and-drop/ if you are interested in my results.</p>
<p>I noticed you haven't blogged in a while - I hope you haven't stopped totally and continue to share with the webdev community.</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>Hi, Leslie. I've just come across a problem that's driving me nuts. I'm not fully comfortable with D&amp;D, but managed to move a crosshairs image over a map to very precisely controlled positions. It worked great on FF 3.6 and FF 4. After a couple of days of successful testing, the image suddenly refused to de dropped after being dragged (it rather flew back to its previous position). Do you know if there is a bug in FF that might cause this? </p>
<p>BTW, during the programming process I updated Firebug, which also is getting a little cranky.</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt answer, Raul</p></div>
