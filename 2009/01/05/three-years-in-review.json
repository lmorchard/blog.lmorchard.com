It&#39;s not <em>quite</em> LiveJournal material, but it&#39;ll be completely devoid of code or any notable geekery—so feel free to move along.</p>\n<p>In late 2005 to early 2006, after <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/07/reading-lists-for-auto-shows\">a busy and stressful Autoshow season working at Organic</a>, I finished <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/14/hacking-delicious-is-a-real-book\">a book on del.icio.us</a>. Meanwhile, the girl and I prepared for a wedding and a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/04/25/a-honeymoon-in-san-francisco\">honeymoon in San Francisco</a>. Unexpectedly, I got offered a job at Yahoo! a month or so before getting married. <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/09/wedding-day-is-today\">We got married on June 9, 2006</a>. We had a honeymoon in San Francisco. Then, less than a month after that, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/24/go-west-young-man\">we moved to Santa Clara and I started at Yahoo! working on del.icio.us</a>.</p>\n<p>Three months <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/07/25/youngmangonewest\">after moving to Santa Clara</a>, I <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/18/just-call-me-crash\">got injured and lived in a Vicodin-fueled haze on the couch for a month or two</a>. I limped around through to Spring 2007, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/10/02/back-in-the-saddle-again\">back to work</a> and occasionally trying to make it to geek events like <a href=\"http://superhappydevhouse.org/LesOrchard\">SuperHappyDevHouse</a>. At Yahoo!, <a href=\"http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2007/02/overdue_new_yea.html\">we started complete ground-up rewrite work on Delicious 2</a> with a <a href=\"http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2007/04/we_are_hiring.html\">much expanded team</a>. <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2007/05/16/hack-day-in-london\">I went to Hack Day London</a>, but couldn&#39;t say much about Delicious. <a href=\"http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2007/07/usability-lab.html\">We continued working on Delicious 2 throughout the Summer of 2007</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2007/09/25/dad\">My Dad passed away in August of 2007</a>, and we flew back to Michigan to take care of things. From remote, at my Mom&#39;s house in Michigan, I worked a little on Delicious 2. <a href=\"http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2007/09/taste-test.html\">It seemed so close to launch</a>, and I wanted distractions. Then, after a month or so back in CA, I started work on a new <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047038459X.html\">JavaScript book</a>. <a href=\"http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2007/02/overdue_new_yea.html\">Work on Delicious 2 trudged on</a>. I took on more work for the JavaScript book. We didn&#39;t go out much at all, and weren&#39;t all that happy. The holidays were particularly hard.</p>\n<p>Around that point, my wife and I got fed up with our state of affairs in the Bay Area and decided it was time for things to change. Having gotten injured and couch-bound right at the beginning probably didn&#39;t help, but we never quite felt at home in California. I still have a lot of <a href=\"http://decafbad.vox.com/library/post/so-simultaneously-extraordinary-and-mundane.html\">starry-eyed regard</a> for <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/buying-tomatoes-at-the-birthplace-of-silicon-valley/?apage=2\">the birthplace of Silicon Valley</a> and all, but for us it&#39;s maybe a better place to visit than to live.</p>\n<p>In early 2008, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/missadroit/sets/72157605078355701/\">my wife found us a wonderful house in Michigan</a>. Work on Delicious 2 hadn&#39;t yet completed, but <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/787565793\">I left Yahoo! anyway</a>. I changed jobs twice in one month, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/804009957\">finally landing at Mozilla</a>. After 6 weeks or so of working from Mountain View, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/05/14/go-midwest-young-man\">we left California and moved into our new house back in our home state</a>. Relatives and old friends were suddenly thousands of miles closer, and we got out of the house more in the first 2 weeks than we had in the previous 2 years. Telecommuting for Mozilla presented me with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/05/22/week-3-at-mozilla\">a steep learning curve</a>, but <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/2867692971/\">an undeniably great working arrangement</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, more than half a year later, I&#39;m still at Mozilla and they seem to like me there so far. Also, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/12/19/the-concise-guide-to-dojo-is-a-real-book\">part of my work on the JavaScript book has made it to the shelves</a> in the form of the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470452021?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;c%0D%0Areative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470452021\" title=\"BUY MY BOOK!\">Concise Guide to Dojo</a>. This past summer, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/08/04/delicious-20-is-more-than-a-pretty-new-face\">Delicious 2 finally launched</a>—and though I&#39;m sad not to have been there when the finish line was crossed, I still think leaving was the best decision for me and mine. We&#39;ve settled into the new house, and I&#39;ve been gradually trying to leave the hermitage to get into the happenings in the Ann Arbor / Detroit area, of which there seem to be an interestingly growing number.</p>\n<p>And, that&#39;s pretty much the past 3 years&#39; exhausting adventure so far... <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2009/01/05/resolutions\">what&#39;s next</a>?</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082757\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://delicious.com/davedash\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=dce6951264f7d72429a9964e1756dad3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://delicious.com/davedash\">Dave Dash</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082757\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-06T05:45:10\">2009-01-06T05:45:10</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I&#39;m glad we had you on the team.
