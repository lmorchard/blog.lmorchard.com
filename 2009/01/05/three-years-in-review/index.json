Meanwhile, the girl and I prepared for a wedding and a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/04/25/a-honeymoon-in-san-francisco\">honeymoon in San Francisco</a>. Unexpectedly, I got offered a job at Yahoo! a month or so before getting married. <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/09/wedding-day-is-today\">We got married on June 9, 2006</a>. We had a honeymoon in San Francisco. Then, less than a month after that, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/24/go-west-young-man\">we moved to Santa Clara and I started at Yahoo! working on del.icio.us</a>.</p>\n<p>Three months <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/07/25/youngmangonewest\">after moving to Santa Clara</a>, I <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/18/just-call-me-crash\">got injured and lived in a Vicodin-fueled haze on the couch for a month or two</a>. I limped around through to Spring 2007, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/10/02/back-in-the-saddle-again\">back to work</a> and occasionally trying to make it to geek events like <a href=\"http://superhappydevhouse.org/LesOrchard\">SuperHappyDevHouse</a>. At Yahoo!, <a href=\"http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2007/02/overdue_new_yea.html\">we started complete ground-up rewrite work on Delicious 2</a> with a <a href=\"http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2007/04/we_are_hiring.html\">much expanded team</a>. <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2007/05/16/hack-day-in-london\">I went to Hack Day London</a>, but couldn't say much about Delicious. <a href=\"http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2007/07/usability-lab.html\">We continued working on Delicious 2 throughout the Summer of 2007</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2007/09/25/dad\">My Dad passed away in August of 2007</a>, and we flew back to Michigan to take care of things. From remote, at my Mom's house in Michigan, I worked a little on Delicious 2. <a href=\"http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2007/09/taste-test.html\">It seemed so close to launch</a>, and I wanted distractions. Then, after a month or so back in CA, I started work on a new <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047038459X.html\">JavaScript book</a>. <a href=\"http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2007/02/overdue_new_yea.html\">Work on Delicious 2 trudged on</a>. I took on more work for the JavaScript book. We didn't go out much at all, and weren't all that happy. The holidays were particularly hard.</p>\n<p>Around that point, my wife and I got fed up with our state of affairs in the Bay Area and decided it was time for things to change. Having gotten injured and couch-bound right at the beginning probably didn't help, but we never quite felt at home in California. I still have a lot of <a href=\"http://decafbad.vox.com/library/post/so-simultaneously-extraordinary-and-mundane.html\">starry-eyed regard</a> for <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/buying-tomatoes-at-the-birthplace-of-silicon-valley/?apage=2\">the birthplace of Silicon Valley</a> and all, but for us it's maybe a better place to visit than to live.</p>\n<p>In early 2008, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/missadroit/sets/72157605078355701/\">my wife found us a wonderful house in Michigan</a>. Work on Delicious 2 hadn't yet completed, but <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/787565793\">I left Yahoo! anyway</a>. I changed jobs twice in one month, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/804009957\">finally landing at Mozilla</a>. After 6 weeks or so of working from Mountain View, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/05/14/go-midwest-young-man\">we left California and moved into our new house back in our home state</a>. Relatives and old friends were suddenly thousands of miles closer, and we got out of the house more in the first 2 weeks than we had in the previous 2 years. Telecommuting for Mozilla presented me with <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/05/22/week-3-at-mozilla\">a steep learning curve</a>, but <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/2867692971/\">an undeniably great working arrangement</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, more than half a year later, I'm still at Mozilla and they seem to like me there so far. Also, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2008/12/19/the-concise-guide-to-dojo-is-a-real-book\">part of my work on the JavaScript book has made it to the shelves</a> in the form of the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470452021?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;c%0D%0Areative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470452021\" title=\"BUY MY BOOK!\">Concise Guide to Dojo</a>.
