<!--more-->
<ol start="5">
<li>My wife is a nerd, who tracked me down via a user name shown in the webcam picture I used for my Yahoo! Personals ad, in order to avoid paying to reply.  <a href="http://deus-x.livejournal.com/91013.html" title="An old entry on LiveJournal, only a few dates in with my now-wife.">Dial-up BBSes and DOOR games played a part in our courtship</a>.</li>
<li>We have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocicat">two ocicats</a>, littermates named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puck_(mythology)">Puck</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inanna">Inanna</a>.  They&#39;re both <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/60975345/in/set-1316941/" title="Look at these cute kitties.">very cute</a> and are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/60976282/in/set-1316941/" title="Look at these awesome cats.">more awesome</a> than anyone else&#39;s cats. </li>
<li>I have <a href="http://www.sleepapnea.org/">sleep apnea</a>, and use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_airway_pressure">a CPAP machine</a> every night.  <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/12/03/if-you-snore-get-tested-for-sleep-apnea-now" title="No, really, go get tested for sleep apnea if you snore.">If you snore, go get tested</a>.  Heart disease, <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2007/09/25/dad" title="RIP Dad.">of which my snoring father died</a>, is one of many possible consequences of untreated sleep apnea.</li>
<li><a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly-digital" title="I was newly digital in 1983">Although I have been a computer nerd since the age of 7</a>, I had the wild notion in starting college that I wanted to be <a href="http://www.algonac.k12.mi.us/ahs/Newspaper/newspaper1.htm" title="I was production editor of my High School newspaper!">a journalist</a> or a psychologist.  Luckily, the web took off during my freshman year, which let me be a little of all the above.  <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/colophon#growup" title="An explanation of that image at the bottom of the page.">I&#39;m not sure why I ever thought I&#39;d be anything other than a computer nerd</a>.</li>
<li>I&#39;m <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200303/rauch">a complete introvert</a> and though I work hard at being sociable, I need a day or two alone for every half-day or so spent being social.  My main coping mechanism since even before my teenage years was to make friends from behind a keyboard and screen, and the internet has made that even more scalable as I&#39;ve grown up.  And now, I get to work that way too—HUGE SUCCESS!</li>
<li>In my senior year of High School, I won 2nd place in <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=education_contests_tf">the Ayn Rand Institute&#39;s <em>The Fountainhead</em> essay contest</a>.  This was the culmination of having read every scrap of Ayn Rand&#39;s writing I could get my hands on throughout High School.  I used the money to take a summer trip to visit a friend who&#39;d moved to Texas and to buy my <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2007/09/21/sadness-for-my-dead-palmtop">well used, now dead palmtop PC</a>.</li>
<li>I like extremely hot spicy food, insanely hop-saturated beer, Irish whiskey, and fresh locally roasted coffee.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/bhearsum/archives/71">Per Ben Hearsum</a>, I think I&#39;ll make this a leaf node in the meme spanning the <a href="http://planet.mozilla.org/">Mozillasphere</a>.  In a quick 5 minute search, it looks like most blogging Mozillans have already been tagged, and I&#39;m not going to spread the contagion outside the organization.  :)</p>

<div class="content"><p>Re #5, I just realized how annoying my &quot;les is more&quot; jokes must be! I need to figure out how I can deliver these high class jokes in a more subtle way while still being able to entertain myself. Maybe I could just think about the phrase instead?</p>
