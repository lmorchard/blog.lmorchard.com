    "summary": "Oh hey, look! It's another blog post—and this one\nis cross-posted on hacks.mozilla.com.\nI won't say this is the start of a renewed blogging habit, but let's see what happens.\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions\n        afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it\n        allows users to pair the selection of an object with the\n        execution of an action, often including a second object in the\n        operation.  It's a simple yet powerful UI concept used to\n        support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),\n        and even the creation of link relationships.\n    \n        Since it's so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web\n        applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first\n        offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although\n        mousedown, mousemove, and\n        mouseup made it possible, the implementation has been\n        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,\n        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,\n        there's a challenge to find the subject of the drop when\n        the interaction is completed.\n    \n\n    Of course, that doesn't prevent most modern JavaScript\n    frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and\n    throwing in some flourishes while they're at it.  But, wouldn't\n    it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and\n    drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?\n</p><p>\n    As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification \n    <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd\">section on new drag-and-drop events</a>, and \n    <a target=\"_new\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop\">Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation</a> of those events.\n</p><p>\n    If you want to jump straight to the code, I've put together \n    <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html\">some simple demos</a> \n    of the new events.  \n</p><p>\n\n    I've even scratched an itch of my own and\n    built <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html\">the beginnings of an outline editor</a>,\n    where every draggable element is also a drop target—of which\n    there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something\n    that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past\n    while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.\n</p><p>\n    And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from \n    <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop\">a GitHub repository</a>\n    I've created especially for this article—which continues after the jump.\n</p>",

There are enough cracks in the case for rev=\"canonical\" to stop caring about it and instead focus on the notion behind it.  However it's expressed—is it rel=\"shortlink\" now?—the final remaining things I'd like to see are:\n\nAn more generalized scope for alternate URL choices asserted by publishers, not just URL shortening.  Other criteria beyond character length include ease of entry on mobile devices (eg. short, but also simple, maybe mostly numeric), ease of verbal mention (eg. billboards, postcards, etc).\n\nHTTP headers are great where available—hooray for HEAD—but it still needs to be in the page for publishers who can't set custom headers.\n\nMicroformats are great, but I'd rather not parse a whole page to the footer to lift out the desired URLs.\n\nDon't panic. Have fun.\n\n\nAnd with that, I'm going to try coming up with other things to write about so this blog doesn't stay dormant.  The rest of this entry remains unedited below...",

    "summary": "For the \"too long; didn't read\" crowd:\n\nI've been using a lot of tags on Delicious over a relatively long time, so they seem very useful to me.\nDelicious encourages the use of tags through UI convention and tool usage patterns, whereas Flickr presents no particular bias toward collecting tags from users.\nSince title and description attract more contribution effort from users on Flickr than on Delicious, it's natural that search over those fields will be more productive than for tags.\nSearch on Delicious doesn't have access to the complete text of the bookmarked resource, and often tags will contain information missing from the supplied title or description.\nAll told, tags on Delicious are more essential than tags on Flickr.\nIn conclusion, I think Do Tags Work? misses the value of tags, as I know them, by focusing on Flickr.\n\nOf course, I don't really care what this means for folksonomy and the rest of Web 2.0—tags work for me on Delicious.  So, I suspect this means I'm not entirely opposed to the sentiment in Do Tags Work?, because I don't think tags work everywhere their use is attempted.\nThe rest of this entry elaborates on the above.",
