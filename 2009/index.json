    "html": "<p><i>\nOh hey, look! It's another blog post—and this one\n<a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/html5-drag-and-drop/\">is cross-posted on hacks.mozilla.com</a>.\nI won't say this is the start of a renewed blogging habit, but let's see what happens.\n</i></p>\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\ndl { margin-left: 2em; }\ndd { margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.25em; }\n</style>\n<div id=\"introduction\">\n    <p>\n        Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions\n        afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it\n        allows users to pair the selection of an object with the\n        execution of an action, often including a second object in the\n        operation.  It's a simple yet powerful UI concept used to\n        support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),\n        and even the creation of link relationships.\n    </p><p>\n        Since it's so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web\n        applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first\n        offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although\n        <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, and\n        <code>mouseup</code> made it possible, the implementation has been\n        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,\n        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,\n        there's a challenge to find the subject of the drop when\n        the interaction is completed.\n    </p><p>\n\n<pre><code>    Of course, that doesn&#39;t prevent most modern JavaScript\n    frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and\n    throwing in some flourishes while they&#39;re at it.

Well, imagine you have a list of 1000\n            list items—as part of a deeply-nested outline document,\n            for instance.  Rather than needing to attach listeners\n            or otherwise fiddle with all 1000 items, simply attach\n            a listener to the parent node (eg. the\n            &lt;code&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element) and all events from\n            the children will propagate up to the single parent listener.\n            As a bonus, all new child elements added after page\n            load will enjoy the same benefits.\n        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n            &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#delegated&quot;&gt;Check out this demo&lt;/a&gt;, \n            and \n            &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-delegated.js&quot;&gt;the associated JS code&lt;/a&gt; \n            to see more about these events and Event Delegation.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"datatransfer\">\n    <h2>Using dataTransfer</h2>\n    <p>\n        As mentioned in the last section, the new drag and drop events\n        let you send data along with a dragged element.  But, it's even\n        better than that:  Your drop targets can receive data\n        transferred by content objects dragged into the window from \n        other browser windows, and even <i>other applications</i>.\n    </p><p>\n\n<pre><code>    Since the example is a bit longer,  \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#data_transfer&quot;&gt;check out the live demo&lt;/a&gt;\n    and \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-datatransfer.js&quot;&gt;associated code&lt;/a&gt;\n    to get an idea of what&#39;s possible with &lt;code&gt;dataTransfer&lt;/code&gt;.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    In a nutshell, the stars of this show are the\n    &lt;code&gt;setData()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getData()&lt;/code&gt; methods of\n    the &lt;code&gt;dataTransfer&lt;/code&gt; property exposed by the Event object.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n    The &lt;code&gt;setData()&lt;/code&gt; method is typically called in the \n    &lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt; listener, loading &lt;code&gt;dataTransfer&lt;/code&gt;\n    up with one or more strings of content with associated\n    &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Recommended_Drag_Types#link&quot;&gt;recommended content types&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n    For illustration, here&#39;s a quick snippet from the example code:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot; line=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;<br>dt.setData(&#39;text/plain&#39;, $(&#39;#logo&#39;).parent().text());\ndt.setData(&#39;text/html&#39;, $(&#39;#logo&#39;).parent().html());\ndt.setData(&#39;text/uri-list&#39;, $(&#39;#logo&#39;)[0].src);\n    </pre>\n    </p><p>\n        On the other end, <code>getData()</code> allows you to query\n        for content by type (eg. <code>text/html</code> followed by\n        <code>text/plain</code>).  This, in turn, allows you to decide\n        on acceptable content types at the time of the\n        <code>drop</code> event or even during <code>dragover</code></p>\n<pre><code>    to offer feedback for unacceptable types during the drag.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    Here&#39;s another example from the receiving end of the example code:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot; line=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;<br>$(&#39;.content_url .content&#39;).text(dt.getData(&#39;text/uri-list&#39;));\n$(&#39;.content_text .content&#39;).text(dt.getData(&#39;text/plain&#39;));\n$(&#39;.content_html .content&#39;).html(dt.getData(&#39;text/html&#39;));\n    </pre>\n    <p>\n        Where <code>dataTransfer</code> really shines, though, is that\n        it allows your drop targets to receive content from \n        sources outside your defined draggable elements and even from\n        outside the browser altogether.  Firefox accepts such drags, \n        and attempts to populate <code>dataTransfer</code> with\n        appropriate content types extracted from the external object.\n    </p><p></p>\n<pre><code>    Thus, you could select some text in a word processor window and\n    drop it into one of your elements, and at least expect to find\n    it available as &lt;code&gt;text/plain&lt;/code&gt; content.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    You can also select content in \n    another browser window, and expect to see &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt;\n    appear in your events.

For dragging from external applications (such as the Desktop) is a normal webpage able to get the data from the drop?  I was just playing with it and seem to always get what seems to be a security error with getData or mozGetDataAt.  However, the documentation seems to state that on drop that data should be made available to the page.  Likewise, in the same way an image can be dragged off the page onto the desktop, can an arbitrary element be dragged onto the desktop with whatever file content to be saved?

I don't work on the browser itself, but I noticed that unexpected behavior on drag &amp; drop.  The window really should scroll when you get toward the top or bottom while dragging - and, in fact, most pre-HTML5 JS frameworks do that in their own drag &amp; drop abstractions.  </p>\n<p>Until / unless Firefox gets this fixed, the same sort of auto-scrolling could be hacked in to HTML5 drag and drop.  Not perfect, but it's doable.  That is, in the drag event, you can check if the mouse is near the upper or lower edge of the viewport - and if so, start scrolling appropriately. That's pretty much how the JS frameworks do it with old-school D&D</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090975\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.copperbot.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=df48b2c2a3a2be51b1e15f10c5fb05da&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.copperbot.net\">CopperBot</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090975\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-07-23T21:41:07\">2009-07-23T21:41:07</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Very cool article!

I've just come across a problem that's driving me nuts. I'm not fully comfortable with D&amp;D, but managed to move a crosshairs image over a map to very precisely controlled positions. It worked great on FF 3.6 and FF 4. After a couple of days of successful testing, the image suddenly refused to de dropped after being dragged (it rather flew back to its previous position). Do you know if there is a bug in FF that might cause this? </p>\n<p>BTW, during the programming process I updated Firebug, which also is getting a little cranky.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your prompt answer, Raul</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-324410737\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/google-4014af7ac4ea5d00df95bef4503b78dd.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Alexander Plutov</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-324410737\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-10-01T11:51:12\">2011-10-01T11:51:12</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Good post about Drag & Drop http://plutov.by/post/html5_drag_and_drop</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

In one gesture, it\r\n        allows users to pair the selection of an object with the\r\n        execution of an action, often including a second object in the\r\n        operation.  It's a simple yet powerful UI concept used to\r\n        support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),\r\n        and even the creation of link relationships.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        Since it's so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web\r\n        applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first\r\n        offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although\r\n        <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, and\r\n        <code>mouseup</code> made it possible, the implementation has been\r\n        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,\r\n        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,\r\n        there's a challenge to find the subject of the drop when\r\n        the interaction is completed.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        Of course, that doesn't prevent most modern JavaScript\r\n        frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and\r\n        throwing in some flourishes while they're at it.  But, wouldn't\r\n        it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and\r\n        drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd\">section on new drag-and-drop events</a>, and \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop\">Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation</a> of those events.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        If you want to jump straight to the code, I've put together \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html\">some simple demos</a> \r\n        of the new events.  \r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        I've even scratched an itch of my own and\r\n        built <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html\">the beginnings of an outline editor</a>,\r\n        where every draggable element is also a drop target—of which\r\n        there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something\r\n        that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past\r\n        while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from \r\n        <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop\">a GitHub repository</a>\r\n        I've created especially for this article—which continues after the jump.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"events\">\r\n\r\n    <h2>The New Drag and Drop Events</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        So, with no further ado, here are the new drag and drop events,\r\n        in roughly the order you might expect to see them fired:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <dl>\r\n        <dt><code>dragstart</code></dt>\r\n        <dd>\r\n            A drag has been initiated, with the dragged element as the\r\n            event target.\r\n        </dd>\r\n\r\n        <dt><code>drag</code></dt>\r\n        <dd>\r\n            The mouse has moved, with the dragged element as the event target.\r\n        </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>dragenter</code></dt>\r\n        <dd>\r\n            The dragged element has been moved into a drop listener,\r\n            with the drop listener element as the event target.\r\n        </dd>\r\n        <dt><code>dragover</code></dt>\r\n\r\n        <dd>\r\n            The dragged element has been moved over a drop listener,\r\n            with the drop listener element as the event target.

But, it's even\r\n        better than that:  Your drop targets can receive data\r\n        transferred by content objects dragged into the window from \r\n        other browser windows, and even <i>other applications</i>.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        Since the example is a bit longer,  \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#data_transfer\">check out the live demo</a>\r\n        and \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-datatransfer.js\">associated code</a>\r\n        to get an idea of what's possible with <code>dataTransfer</code>.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        In a nutshell, the stars of this show are the\r\n        <code>setData()</code> and <code>getData()</code> methods of\r\n        the <code>dataTransfer</code> property exposed by the Event object.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        The <code>setData()</code> method is typically called in the \r\n        <code>dragstart</code> listener, loading <code>dataTransfer</code>\r\n        up with one or more strings of content with associated\r\n        <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Recommended_Drag_Types#link\">recommended content types</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        For illustration, here's a quick snippet from the example code:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    \r\ndt.setData('text/plain', $('#logo').parent().text());\r\ndt.setData('text/html', $('#logo').parent().html());\r\ndt.setData('text/uri-list', $('#logo')[0].src);\r\n    </pre>\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        On the other end, <code>getData()</code> allows you to query\r\n        for content by type (eg. <code>text/html</code> followed by\r\n        <code>text/plain</code>).  This, in turn, allows you to decide\r\n        on acceptable content types at the time of the\r\n        <code>drop</code> event or even during <code>dragover</code>\r\n\r\n        to offer feedback for unacceptable types during the drag.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n        Here's another example from the receiving end of the example code:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    \r\n$('.content_url .content').text(dt.getData('text/uri-list'));\r\n$('.content_text .content').text(dt.getData('text/plain'));\r\n$('.content_html .content').html(dt.getData('text/html'));\r\n    </pre>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Where <code>dataTransfer</code> really shines, though, is that\r\n        it allows your drop targets to receive content from \r\n        sources outside your defined draggable elements and even from\r\n        outside the browser altogether.  Firefox accepts such drags, \r\n        and attempts to populate <code>dataTransfer</code> with\r\n        appropriate content types extracted from the external object.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        Thus, you could select some text in a word processor window and\r\n        drop it into one of your elements, and at least expect to find\r\n        it available as <code>text/plain</code> content.  \r\n    </p><p>\r\n        You can also select content in \r\n        another browser window, and expect to see <code>text/html</code>\r\n        appear in your events.

But,\r\n       the <code>dataTransfer</code> property of the original Event\r\n       object exposes the method <code>setDragImage()</code> for use\r\n       in customizing this representation.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        There's\r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#feedback_image\">a live demo</a> of this feature, as well as\r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-feedback-images.js\">associated JS code</a> \r\n        available.

If the value does\r\n        not match up with <code>effectAllowed</code>, the drop will\r\n        be considered cancelled on completion.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n\r\n        In the \r\n        <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#drag_effects\">a live demo</a>,\r\n        you should be able to see that only elements with matching\r\n        effects can be dropped into the appropriate drop zones.  This\r\n        is accomplished with code like the following:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <pre lang=\"javascript\" line=\"1\">\r\nvar dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;\r\nswitch (ev.target.id) {\r\n    case 'effectdrop0': dt.dropEffect = 'copy'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop1': dt.dropEffect = 'move'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop2': dt.dropEffect = 'link'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop3': dt.dropEffect = 'all'; break;\r\n    case 'effectdrop4': dt.dropEffect = 'none'; break;\r\n}\r\n    </pre>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Although the OS itself can provide some feedback, you \r\n        can also use these properties to update your own visible \r\n        feedback, both on the dragged element and on the drop zone\r\n        itself.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"conclusion\">\r\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        The new first-class drag and drop events in HTML5 and Firefox\r\n        make supporting this form of UI interaction simple, concise,\r\n        and powerful in the browser.

For dragging from external applications (such as the Desktop) is a normal webpage able to get the data from the drop?

However, the documentation seems to state that on drop that data should be made available to the page.  Likewise, in the same way an image can be dragged off the page onto the desktop, can an arbitrary element be dragged onto the desktop with whatever file content to be saved?

I don't work on the browser itself, but I noticed that unexpected behavior on drag &amp; drop.  The window really should scroll when you get toward the top or bottom while dragging - and, in fact, most pre-HTML5 JS frameworks do that in their own drag &amp; drop abstractions.  </p>\n\n<p>Until / unless Firefox gets this fixed, the same sort of auto-scrolling could be hacked in to HTML5 drag and drop.  Not perfect, but it's doable.  That is, in the drag event, you can check if the mouse is near the upper or lower edge of the viewport - and if so, start scrolling appropriately.

I've just come across a problem that's driving me nuts. I'm not fully comfortable with D&amp;D, but managed to move a crosshairs image over a map to very precisely controlled positions. It worked great on FF 3.6 and FF 4. After a couple of days of successful testing, the image suddenly refused to de dropped after being dragged (it rather flew back to its previous position). Do you know if there is a bug in FF that might cause this? </p>\n\n<p>BTW, during the programming process I updated Firebug, which also is getting a little cranky.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your prompt answer, Raul</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-324410737\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/google-4014af7ac4ea5d00df95bef4503b78dd.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Alexander Plutov</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-324410737\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-10-01T11:51:12\">2011-10-01T11:51:12</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Good post about Drag & Drop http://plutov.by/post/html5_drag_and_drop</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

It&apos;s another blog post&#x2014;and this one\n<a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/html5-drag-and-drop/\">is cross-posted on hacks.mozilla.com</a>.\nI won&apos;t say this is the start of a renewed blogging habit, but let&apos;s see what happens.\n</i></p>\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\ndl { margin-left: 2em; }\ndd { margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.25em; }\n</style>\n<div id=\"introduction\">\n    <p>\n        Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions\n        afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it\n        allows users to pair the selection of an object with the\n        execution of an action, often including a second object in the\n        operation.  It&apos;s a simple yet powerful UI concept used to\n        support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),\n        and even the creation of link relationships.\n    </p><p>\n        Since it&apos;s so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web\n        applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first\n        offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although\n        <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, and\n        <code>mouseup</code> made it possible, the implementation has been\n        limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,\n        since these events refer only to the object being dragged,\n        there&apos;s a challenge to find the subject of the drop when\n        the interaction is completed.\n    </p><p>\n\n</p><pre><code>    Of course, that doesn&apos;t prevent most modern JavaScript\n    frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and\n    throwing in some flourishes while they&apos;re at it.  But, wouldn&apos;t\n    it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and\n    drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd&quot;&gt;section on new drag-and-drop events&lt;/a&gt;, and \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop&quot;&gt;Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation&lt;/a&gt; of those events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    If you want to jump straight to the code, I&apos;ve put together \n    &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html&quot;&gt;some simple demos&lt;/a&gt; \n    of the new events.  \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n    I&apos;ve even scratched an itch of my own and\n    built &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html&quot;&gt;the beginnings of an outline editor&lt;/a&gt;,\n    where every draggable element is also a drop target&#x2014;of which\n    there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something\n    that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments in the past\n    while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n    And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from \n    &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop&quot;&gt;a GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;\n    I&apos;ve created especially for this article&#x2014;which continues after the jump.\n&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n"

    "html": "<div>\n  <p>\n    I took the pills. Like everyone else, I took the pills and I sent in the hair and the piss to prove I took the pills. I’d figured something out, though: I could stop taking the pills for the first half of the month, then double up at the end. I still passed the tests; no one knocked on the door.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <!--more-->\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Thus, for twelve weeks a year, I spent whole evenings in the crawlspace. I cracked open the cache of brushes and watercolors under the light of a single incandescent bulb. I let the shapes and hues out to play, each season informing the work.

    "html": "<p><em>Update 4/14</em>: So, I liked <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code>, but I like the notion of pages offering sets of alternative URLs better.  <a href=\"http://www.mnot.net/blog/2009/04/14/rev_canonical_bad\">There are enough cracks in the case</a> for <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> to stop caring about it and instead focus on the notion behind it.  However it&#39;s expressed—is it <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/shortlink\"><code>rel=&quot;shortlink&quot;</code></a> now?—the final remaining things I&#39;d like to see are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>An more generalized scope for alternate URL choices asserted by publishers, not just URL shortening.  Other criteria beyond character length include ease of entry on mobile devices (eg. short, but also simple, maybe mostly numeric), ease of verbal mention (eg. billboards, postcards, etc).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>HTTP headers are great where available—hooray for HEAD—but it still needs to be in the page for publishers who can&#39;t set custom headers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Microformats are great, but I&#39;d rather not parse a whole page to the footer to lift out the desired URLs.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Don&#39;t panic. Have fun.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And with that, I&#39;m going to try coming up with other things to write about so this blog doesn&#39;t stay dormant.  The rest of this entry remains unedited below...</p>\n<!--more-->\n<hr />\n\n<p><strike>So, like it says up there: I like <a href=\"http://revcanonical.appspot.com/\">rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</a>.</strike></p>\n<p>Basically, it&#39;s a way of saying—instead of using that 3rd-party service <em>you</em> like for munging <em>my</em> URLs, use one of these pre-munged URLs I&#39;ve provided.  Ideally, the URLs I provide will be shorter for your needs, but my URLs won&#39;t be subject to <a href=\"http://joshua.schachter.org/2009/04/on-url-shorteners.html\">potentially distasteful things I object to with respect to a service you might pick</a>.</p>\n<p>I like keeping control of URL spaces in the hands of their publishers.  This also opens the field for more individual choice in URL shortening services, allowing more people to try their hand at building a better mouse trap—or allowing publishers to opt out of the mess altogether.  </p>\n<p>And, apropos of that, I tend to like <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> as the means of expressing this choice.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s a lot more background on this whole shebang, but I&#39;ll just stick to my $0.02 on the discussion so far.</p>\n<h3 id=\"its-too-alpha-geeky-to-get-adoptedalso-nerds\"><a href=\"http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2009/04/11/revcanonicalDiggBarOutrageCausesBadIdeasToComeOutOfTheWoodWork.aspx\">It&#39;s too alpha geeky to get adopted—also: NERDS!</a></h3>\n<p>Alpha geeks write plugins for web publishing systems used by less-alpha geeks, who eventually install web publishing systems for those even further down the geek scale.  It&#39;s not unheard of for something incredibly nerdy to become relatively common, if it proves useful.</p>\n<p>Feed auto-discovery is in blogging software and browsers now—it was once considered a somewhat arcane usage of the <code>rel</code> attribute on <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags in HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"everyone-needs-to-implement-their-own-url-shortener\"><a href=\"http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2009/04/11/revcanonicalDiggBarOutrageCausesBadIdeasToComeOutOfTheWoodWork.aspx\">Everyone needs to implement their own URL shortener.</a></h3>\n<p>No, but everyone gets to pick a shortener for their own URLs—which could coincidentally be self-hosted or third-party.  Isn&#39;t the web great?</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-rev-attribute-is-too-hard-to-understand-people-will-get-it-wrong\"><a href=\"http://benramsey.com/archives/a-revcanonical-rebuttal/\">The <code>rev</code> attribute is too hard to understand, people will get it wrong</a>.</h3>\n<p>I hadn&#39;t paid much attention to the <code>rev</code> attribute until a week or so ago.  I <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#adef-rev\">read the HTML spec on links</a> again.  Within 10 minutes of reading the spec, my understanding became this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>rel=&quot;{X}&quot;</code> — &quot;this link means {X} in relation to the current page&quot;.</li>\n<li><code>rev=&quot;{X}&quot;</code> — &quot;this current page means {X} in relation to this link&quot;.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I may have misunderstood it—if so, explain to me how and I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s harder to understand than I think.  There are harder concepts in the HTML 4 spec.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-rev-attribute-is-removed-in-html5\">The <code>rev</code> attribute is removed in HTML5</h3>\n<p>That&#39;s too bad for HTML5.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-July/006888.html\">The rationale given for the removal</a> seems sensible enough.  But, I&#39;d say the rationale for removal is weakened if someone finds a use for the attribute and uses it correctly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"relshorter--relshort-is-better-and-more-explicit\"><code>rel=&quot;shorter&quot;</code> / <code>rel=&quot;short&quot;</code> is better and more explicit.</h3>\n<p>I like this idea in general, and I don&#39;t <em>really</em> care strongly enough about <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> vs <code>rel=&quot;short&quot;</code> to make much noise beyond this blog post.  </p>\n<p>But, I prefer the semantics of <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code>, I don&#39;t think <code>rel=&quot;short(er)&quot;</code> is better, and actually I think the less explicit assertion is a feature.  I&#39;ve not yet been convinced otherwise—but realistically, if either catches on, I&#39;ll probably use the most popular.</p>\n<h3 id=\"revcanonical-doesnt-mean-shorter-url\"><code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> doesn&#39;t mean &quot;shorter URL&quot;</h3>\n<p>That&#39;s okay—what if I don&#39;t <em>want</em> you to have shortened versions of my URLs?  Doesn&#39;t fit in your tweet?  Screw you.  I didn&#39;t want you to link to me that badly anyway.  Bah.  </p>\n<p>That, of course, is self-defeating.  Conventional use of the attribute will probably yield shorter URLs out of self-interest.  Furthermore, I could even offer a half-dozen URL variations, and you could use the string length function in the language of your choice to pick one on the basis of shortness.  There&#39;s a lot of choice to go around here.</p>\n<p>Also, feed auto-discovery links don&#39;t always lead to truly alternate versions of the current page—but instead to a useful set of items, many of which may currently appear somewhere on the page.  So, even the &quot;clear&quot; semantics have some play in them as used in the wild.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-revcanonical-http-header-is-better\"><a href=\"http://shiflett.org/blog/2009/apr/a-rev-canonical-http-header\">A <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> HTTP header is better.</a></h3>\n<p>Hmm, maybe.  It would certainly allow for possibly lighter-weight HEAD requests in determining the alternative URL for a given URL.  But, I would expect it to fall apart in collections of static HTML pages baked by an offline script where web server configuration might not make setting custom headers easy.</p>\n<p>Not everyone has the luxury / inclination to have a dynamic language capable of setting headers running in their web server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"revcanonical-should-appear-on-hyperlinks-in-the-body-of-the-page\"><a href=\"http://adactio.com/journal/1568/\"><code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> should appear on hyperlinks in the body of the page</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/08/whats-old-scraping-is-new-again-microformats\">I like microformats</a>, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/17/magic-microformat-forms\">in general</a>.  But, I don&#39;t really want to potentially parse a whole page to find the shorter URL that might be in the footer.  With <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, I only have to parse so far before I find it or give up.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s a lot of prior art on this with relation to feed autodiscovery—we used to mainly look for RSS feed URLs inside the page, too.  It sucked.</p>\n<h3 id=\"claiming-to-be-canonical-for-another-url-is-trouble\"><a href=\"http://benramsey.com/archives/a-revcanonical-rebuttal/#comment-288465\">Claiming to be canonical for another URL is trouble.</a></h3>\n<p>Okay, how about requiring a reciprocal <code>rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> on the same page with <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p>Trust but verify—and only accept <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> where <code>rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> matches the current URL <em>and</em> <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> yields a 301 redirect to the <code>rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p>I can&#39;t see this verification process being necessarily more burdensome than using a 3rd-party shortener API—and that&#39;s <em>if</em> you&#39;re paranoid and building an index that needs some measure of resistance to gaming.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-single-character-slip-from-revcanonical-to-relcanonical-could-wreck-your-googlejuice\"><a href=\"http://samj.net/2009/04/revcanonical-considered-harmful.html?showComment=1239617160000#c7231589643969293690\">A single character slip from <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> to <code>rel=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> could wreck your Googlejuice!</a></h3>\n<p>So, don&#39;t do that.  </p>\n<p>Maybe Googlejuice should be more resilient.  Maybe it actually is—has anyone actually soured their juice yet with a mistake like this and lived to tell the tale?  </p>\n<p>Either way, characters mean things in computer languages, so make sure you use the right ones in the right order.</p>\n<h3 id=\"you-guys-are-moving-on-this-stuff-too-fast\">You guys are moving on this stuff too fast!</h3>\n<p>Welcome to 2002, when lots of us had more spare time than employment and we deployed new crap like this on our blogs and sites daily.  </p>\n<p>Back in those olden days, we manipulated raw HTML with our bare hands and deployed radioactive code using our teeth—all without benefit of protective change control.  We probably all have cancer of the access logs now, but it was all in the name of Web Science!</p>\n<h3 id=\"too-long-didnt-read\">Too long; didn&#39;t read</h3>\n<p>So, yeah.  I like the idea behind <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> and I prefer its expression as <code>rev=&quot;canonical&quot;</code> best—but the idea is the important thing.  Let&#39;s get over the expression part fast and spend more time exploring the nuts and bolts and implications of the concept itself.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091011\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4e160e713acf1ab8547d1c36233389c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/\">http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221091011\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-13T14:00:04\">2009-04-13T14:00:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Forget rel=\"short\" or rel=\"shorter\".

The problem I have is this:</p>\n<p>rel=canonical was introduced so when people went to various urls that a search engine would know that the url specified in rel=canonical was the real one.  Let's do this to make life easier:</p>\n<p>http://foo.com/A\nand \nhttp://foo.com/B</p>\n<p>both go to the exact same page, and the publisher can't for some reason redirect to the canonicalized page (maybe it's amazon and they have stupid large urls with affiliate codes).</p>\n<p>so if the former is canonical then this is present:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>whether you go to /A or /B.</p>\n<p>if they use rev=\"canonical\":</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Should only be shown if they are visitng /A not /B otherwise that rev statement implies that /A or /B are the canonical forms of \"http://f.us/A\".</p>\n<p>I think that's why the rev attribute isn't a very good one.

That was an amazingly dumb move, luckily it is a draft still is all I can say. Here is why I believe this:\n1) 1 char diff argument: shut up you nub programmers\n2) misuse: it's night vs day, black vs white, there is no gray area except that which your confused minds have created. The confusion -I think- usually comes in to play when considering a value, which is easy if you truly understand the diff between @rel and @rev.\n3) @rev values can be represented as @rel values: sure I agree but this can not be true without adding more rel values then are necessary with a @rev which is already in the html 4 spec for a reason. If you remove something with use you cause confusion on multiple fronts: first people have to become aware of the change, then they need to understand why the change was made, then they need to make the changes to their code base, and finally when they want to express rev=canonical with a @rel value, debates over what best @rel value represents the equivalent of another @rel value if it were used in @rev occur..</p>\n<p>I submit the debate which the opposition to rev=canonical are having over rel=short* as evidence that @rev is required. A link with rev=canonical that is short is a short url of the canonical url by definition, thus rel=short* is redundant for the use case of discovering a short url for the canonical url of some document. Albeit, I think rel=shorturl (or whatever is finally decided on) could be used by the publisher to indicate a preferred short url(s), if say there were &gt;1 rev=canonical.</p>\n<p>In an algorithm to discover a short url for a document one method could be to scan all links and find the shortest rev=canonical, or if a rel=shorturl is provided then use that and stop scanning immediately. My point is that rev=canonical should be used. Also rel=shorturl adds a marginal benefit to rev=canonical.</p>\n<p>Another point, a rel=shorturl is rev=canonical by definition, thus if you were to use rel=shorturl and @rev were alive and well as it should be, you should automatically add rev=canonical (even though it is implied).</p>\n<p>Another argument the opposition make to using rev=canonical is that the number of rev=canonical's are possibly infinite, so I say only list the rev=canonical's which a user may find of interest for the use cases you can imagine.</p>\n<p>Another case for using rev=canonical is using rev=canonical with rel=mobile perhaps? so that a user can scan rev=canonical's for a rel=mobile url which is short enough to fit in the newest microblog gadget. Where a rel=mobile without rev=canonical could be the mobile site's homepage, even better for this link would be rel=\"mobile home\" without rev=canonical.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091029\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://erikvold.com/index.cfm\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8fa21a16e24905fba4413501e3afb36e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://erikvold.com/index.cfm\">Erik Vold</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221091029\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-21T05:17:14\">2009-04-21T05:17:14</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>The reasons why I like rev=canonical: http://erikvold.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/4/21/rev_canonical_good</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091030\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221091030\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-28T05:31:35\">2009-04-28T05:31:35</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>@Erik: Well, I \"gave in\" mainly because I wasn't really looking for a fight and had a vacation to attend to.</p>\n<p>After that, the amount of hyperbolic stop energy being slung around rel=short{foo} has exhausted my care for the subject.</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "*Update 4/14*: So, I liked `rev=\"canonical\"`, but I like the notion of pages offering sets of alternative URLs better.  [There are enough cracks in the case](http://www.mnot.net/blog/2009/04/14/rev_canonical_bad) for `rev=\"canonical\"` to stop caring about it and instead focus on the notion behind it.  However it's expressed—is it [`rel=\"shortlink\"`](http://groups.google.com/group/shortlink) now?—the final remaining things I'd like to see are:\r\n\r\n* An more generalized scope for alternate URL choices asserted by publishers, not just URL shortening.  Other criteria beyond character length include ease of entry on mobile devices (eg. short, but also simple, maybe mostly numeric), ease of verbal mention (eg. billboards, postcards, etc).\r\n\r\n* HTTP headers are great where available—hooray for HEAD—but it still needs to be in the page for publishers who can't set custom headers.\r\n\r\n* Microformats are great, but I'd rather not parse a whole page to the footer to lift out the desired URLs.\r\n\r\n* Don't panic. Have fun.\r\n\r\nAnd with that, I'm going to try coming up with other things to write about so this blog doesn't stay dormant.  The rest of this entry remains unedited below...\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strike>So, like it says up there: I like [rev=\"canonical\"](http://revcanonical.appspot.com/).</strike>\r\n\r\nBasically, it's a way of saying—instead of using that 3rd-party service *you* like for munging *my* URLs, use one of these pre-munged URLs I've provided.  Ideally, the URLs I provide will be shorter for your needs, but my URLs won't be subject to [potentially distasteful things I object to with respect to a service you might pick](http://joshua.schachter.org/2009/04/on-url-shorteners.html).\r\n\r\nI like keeping control of URL spaces in the hands of their publishers.  This also opens the field for more individual choice in URL shortening services, allowing more people to try their hand at building a better mouse trap—or allowing publishers to opt out of the mess altogether.  \r\n\r\nAnd, apropos of that, I tend to like `rev=\"canonical\"` as the means of expressing this choice.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot more background on this whole shebang, but I'll just stick to my $0.02 on the discussion so far.\r\n\r\n### [It's too alpha geeky to get adopted—also: NERDS!](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2009/04/11/revcanonicalDiggBarOutrageCausesBadIdeasToComeOutOfTheWoodWork.aspx)\r\n\r\nAlpha geeks write plugins for web publishing systems used by less-alpha geeks, who eventually install web publishing systems for those even further down the geek scale.  It's not unheard of for something incredibly nerdy to become relatively common, if it proves useful.\r\n\r\nFeed auto-discovery is in blogging software and browsers now—it was once considered a somewhat arcane usage of the `rel` attribute on `<link>` tags in HTML `<head>`.\r\n\r\n### [Everyone needs to implement their own URL shortener.](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2009/04/11/revcanonicalDiggBarOutrageCausesBadIdeasToComeOutOfTheWoodWork.aspx)\r\n\r\nNo, but everyone gets to pick a shortener for their own URLs—which could coincidentally be self-hosted or third-party.  Isn't the web great?\r\n\r\n### [The `rev` attribute is too hard to understand, people will get it wrong](http://benramsey.com/archives/a-revcanonical-rebuttal/).\r\n\r\nI hadn't paid much attention to the `rev` attribute until a week or so ago.  I [read the HTML spec on links](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#adef-rev) again.  Within 10 minutes of reading the spec, my understanding became this:\r\n\r\n* `rel=\"{X}\"` — \"this link means {X} in relation to the current page\".\r\n* `rev=\"{X}\"` — \"this current page means {X} in relation to this link\".\r\n\r\nI may have misunderstood it—if so, explain to me how and I'll admit it's harder to understand than I think.  There are harder concepts in the HTML 4 spec.\r\n\r\n### The `rev` attribute is removed in HTML5\r\n\r\nThat's too bad for HTML5.  \r\n\r\n[The rationale given for the removal](http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-July/006888.html) seems sensible enough.  But, I'd say the rationale for removal is weakened if someone finds a use for the attribute and uses it correctly.\r\n\r\n### `rel=\"shorter\"` / `rel=\"short\"` is better and more explicit.\r\n\r\nI like this idea in general, and I don't *really* care strongly enough about `rev=\"canonical\"` vs `rel=\"short\"` to make much noise beyond this blog post.  \r\n\r\nBut, I prefer the semantics of `rev=\"canonical\"`, I don't think `rel=\"short(er)\"` is better, and actually I think the less explicit assertion is a feature.  I've not yet been convinced otherwise—but realistically, if either catches on, I'll probably use the most popular.\r\n\r\n### `rev=\"canonical\"` doesn't mean \"shorter URL\"\r\n\r\nThat's okay—what if I don't *want* you to have shortened versions of my URLs?  Doesn't fit in your tweet?  Screw you.  I didn't want you to link to me that badly anyway.  Bah.  \r\n\r\nThat, of course, is self-defeating.  Conventional use of the attribute will probably yield shorter URLs out of self-interest.  Furthermore, I could even offer a half-dozen URL variations, and you could use the string length function in the language of your choice to pick one on the basis of shortness.  There's a lot of choice to go around here.\r\n\r\nAlso, feed auto-discovery links don't always lead to truly alternate versions of the current page—but instead to a useful set of items, many of which may currently appear somewhere on the page.  So, even the \"clear\" semantics have some play in them as used in the wild.\r\n\r\n### [A `rev=\"canonical\"` HTTP header is better.](http://shiflett.org/blog/2009/apr/a-rev-canonical-http-header)\r\n\r\nHmm, maybe.  It would certainly allow for possibly lighter-weight HEAD requests in determining the alternative URL for a given URL.  But, I would expect it to fall apart in collections of static HTML pages baked by an offline script where web server configuration might not make setting custom headers easy.\r\n\r\nNot everyone has the luxury / inclination to have a dynamic language capable of setting headers running in their web server.\r\n\r\n### [`rev=\"canonical\"` should appear on hyperlinks in the body of the page](http://adactio.com/journal/1568/)\r\n\r\n[I like microformats](http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/08/whats-old-scraping-is-new-again-microformats), [in general](http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/05/17/magic-microformat-forms).  But, I don't really want to potentially parse a whole page to find the shorter URL that might be in the footer.  With `rev=\"canonical\"` in the `<head>`, I only have to parse so far before I find it or give up.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of prior art on this with relation to feed autodiscovery—we used to mainly look for RSS feed URLs inside the page, too.  It sucked.\r\n\r\n### [Claiming to be canonical for another URL is trouble.](http://benramsey.com/archives/a-revcanonical-rebuttal/#comment-288465)\r\n\r\nOkay, how about requiring a reciprocal `rel=\"canonical\"` on the same page with `rev=\"canonical\"`.\r\n\r\nTrust but verify—and only accept `rev=\"canonical\"` where `rel=\"canonical\"` matches the current URL *and* `rev=\"canonical\"` yields a 301 redirect to the `rel=\"canonical\"`.\r\n\r\nI can't see this verification process being necessarily more burdensome than using a 3rd-party shortener API—and that's *if* you're paranoid and building an index that needs some measure of resistance to gaming.\r\n\r\n### [A single character slip from `rev=\"canonical\"` to `rel=\"canonical\"` could wreck your Googlejuice!](http://samj.net/2009/04/revcanonical-considered-harmful.html?showComment=1239617160000#c7231589643969293690)\r\n\r\nSo, don't do that.  \r\n\r\nMaybe Googlejuice should be more resilient.  Maybe it actually is—has anyone actually soured their juice yet with a mistake like this and lived to tell the tale?  \r\n\r\nEither way, characters mean things in computer languages, so make sure you use the right ones in the right order.\r\n\r\n### You guys are moving on this stuff too fast!\r\n\r\nWelcome to 2002, when lots of us had more spare time than employment and we deployed new crap like this on our blogs and sites daily.  \r\n\r\nBack in those olden days, we manipulated raw HTML with our bare hands and deployed radioactive code using our teeth—all without benefit of protective change control.  We probably all have cancer of the access logs now, but it was all in the name of Web Science!\r\n\r\n### Too long; didn't read\r\n\r\nSo, yeah.  I like the idea behind `rev=\"canonical\"` and I prefer its expression as `rev=\"canonical\"` best—but the idea is the important thing.  Let's get over the expression part fast and spend more time exploring the nuts and bolts and implications of the concept itself.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091011\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4e160e713acf1ab8547d1c36233389c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/\">http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221091011\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-13T14:00:04\">2009-04-13T14:00:04</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Forget rel=\"short\" or rel=\"shorter\".

The problem I have is this:</p>\n\n<p>rel=canonical was introduced so when people went to various urls that a search engine would know that the url specified in rel=canonical was the real one.  Let's do this to make life easier:</p>\n\n<p>http://foo.com/A\nand \nhttp://foo.com/B</p>\n\n<p>both go to the exact same page, and the publisher can't for some reason redirect to the canonicalized page (maybe it's amazon and they have stupid large urls with affiliate codes).</p>\n\n<p>so if the former is canonical then this is present:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>whether you go to /A or /B.</p>\n\n<p>if they use rev=\"canonical\":</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Should only be shown if they are visitng /A not /B otherwise that rev statement implies that /A or /B are the canonical forms of \"http://f.us/A\".</p>\n\n<p>I think that's why the rev attribute isn't a very good one.  Honestly I liked the suggestion (you made it maybe) for using rel=\"shortcut alternative\" or something.</p>\n\n<p>Am I seeing potential ambiguity when there isn't?</p>\n\n<p>-d</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091016\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221091016\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-13T15:36:42\">2009-04-13T15:36:42</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@Dave: I think you may have used some markup in your comment that got filtered out - I'm not exactly sure what you mean. :/</p>\n\n<p>If we have this URL:</p>\n\n<p>http://example.com/this/url/is/too/long</p>\n\n<p>With these links in the head:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>rel=\"canonical\" href=\"http://example.com/this/url/is/too/long\"\n  rev=\"canonical\" href=\"http://ex.pl/ab\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then, the URL http://ex.pl/ab will ideally lead to a 301 redirect.

That was an amazingly dumb move, luckily it is a draft still is all I can say. Here is why I believe this:\n1) 1 char diff argument: shut up you nub programmers\n2) misuse: it's night vs day, black vs white, there is no gray area except that which your confused minds have created. The confusion -I think- usually comes in to play when considering a value, which is easy if you truly understand the diff between @rel and @rev.\n3) @rev values can be represented as @rel values: sure I agree but this can not be true without adding more rel values then are necessary with a @rev which is already in the html 4 spec for a reason. If you remove something with use you cause confusion on multiple fronts: first people have to become aware of the change, then they need to understand why the change was made, then they need to make the changes to their code base, and finally when they want to express rev=canonical with a @rel value, debates over what best @rel value represents the equivalent of another @rel value if it were used in @rev occur..</p>\n\n<p>I submit the debate which the opposition to rev=canonical are having over rel=short* as evidence that @rev is required. A link with rev=canonical that is short is a short url of the canonical url by definition, thus rel=short* is redundant for the use case of discovering a short url for the canonical url of some document. Albeit, I think rel=shorturl (or whatever is finally decided on) could be used by the publisher to indicate a preferred short url(s), if say there were &gt;1 rev=canonical.</p>\n\n<p>In an algorithm to discover a short url for a document one method could be to scan all links and find the shortest rev=canonical, or if a rel=shorturl is provided then use that and stop scanning immediately. My point is that rev=canonical should be used. Also rel=shorturl adds a marginal benefit to rev=canonical.</p>\n\n<p>Another point, a rel=shorturl is rev=canonical by definition, thus if you were to use rel=shorturl and @rev were alive and well as it should be, you should automatically add rev=canonical (even though it is implied).</p>\n\n<p>Another argument the opposition make to using rev=canonical is that the number of rev=canonical's are possibly infinite, so I say only list the rev=canonical's which a user may find of interest for the use cases you can imagine.</p>\n\n<p>Another case for using rev=canonical is using rev=canonical with rel=mobile perhaps? so that a user can scan rev=canonical's for a rel=mobile url which is short enough to fit in the newest microblog gadget. Where a rel=mobile without rev=canonical could be the mobile site's homepage, even better for this link would be rel=\"mobile home\" without rev=canonical.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091029\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://erikvold.com/index.cfm\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8fa21a16e24905fba4413501e3afb36e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://erikvold.com/index.cfm\">Erik Vold</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221091029\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-21T05:17:14\">2009-04-21T05:17:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>The reasons why I like rev=canonical: http://erikvold.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/4/21/rev_canonical_good</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221091030\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221091030\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-04-28T05:31:35\">2009-04-28T05:31:35</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@Erik: Well, I \"gave in\" mainly because I wasn't really looking for a fight and had a vacation to attend to.</p>\n\n<p>After that, the amount of hyperbolic stop energy being slung around rel=short{foo} has exhausted my care for the subject.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

So, I suspect this means I&#39;m not <em>entirely</em> opposed to the sentiment in <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a>, because I don&#39;t think tags work everywhere their use is attempted.</p>\n<p>The rest of this entry elaborates on the above.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>From Cathy Marshall&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Have I convinced you that tags aren't all they've cracked up to be? I hope I have, but nonetheless there's a lingering fascination. Surely there's something to be done about tags: we don't want to just turn up our noses at Mr. Weinberger's argument.</blockquote>\n\n<p>From Mark Bernstein&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.markbernstein.org/Jan09/InTEKKATags.html\">In TEKKA: Tags</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\nThe study could be repeated on more images, and in additional contexts. It might be bad luck. But if it’s a repeatable result — and I think we all know it is — then we’re going to have to rethink a lot of our Web 2.0 rhetoric. Folksonomy is an illusion.</blockquote>\n\n<p>From my <a href=\"http://delicious.com/url/125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd#item-125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd972759\">bookmark on Delicious</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>If you can get past the rambling paragraphs of awkward fun-poking at tags interspersed with library science / web 2.0 / cultural references—as well as a discovery of what, you know, Flickr is all about—there's a well-embellished and obsessively-assembled statistical analysis of tags vs title vs notes in finding photos featuring tourist heel-spinning on the testicles of a bull mosaic in Milan. My impression is that she's missed the point of tags, but I'm having trouble reducing the impression to a critique.</blockquote>\n\n<p>It might be that I&#39;m intimidated by the writing in <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> or by the fact that a lot of work was done to produce numbers I can&#39;t dispute.  Either way, I have neither the time to produce a counter-study nor the wherewithal to extract and refute points in that article with precision.  So, I&#39;m just going to throw my impressions out there and hope they coalesce.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tags are extremely useful to me.<ul>\n<li>I&#39;ve been using tags on Delicious since shortly after the site was created.  </li>\n<li>To date, <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/deusx\">I&#39;ve saved 11825 bookmarks and spawned 6069 tags</a>.  (More on that ratio later.)  </li>\n<li>Tags have worked very well for me, both in later finding my own saved resources and in finding aggregates of others&#39;.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Flickr is not the poster child of tagging—Delicious is.  <ul>\n<li>On Flickr, I&#39;ve found tags occasionally interesting, but not incredibly so.  More a curiosity than a killer feature, really.  (More on that in a bit, too.)</li>\n<li>To be honest, I&#39;ve not found a great deal of use for tags around Web 2.0 properties beyond Delicious, folksonomy hype notwithstanding.  </li>\n<li>Fun fact: When I worked on Delicious, we disliked the term &quot;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy\">folksonomy</a>&quot; and tried never to use it in serious discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The places where I&#39;ve found tags useful are text-heavy, where the full text is either not indexed or not displayed in results when using search.<ul>\n<li>Consider magazine articles or blog posts bookmarked on Delicious.</li>\n<li>Those bookmarks are subject to the character limits of title or description fields.  </li>\n<li>Far more often than on Flickr, there is information in tags not present in a bookmark&#39;s title or description.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>On Delicious, the use of bookmarklets and extensions is the primary source of new bookmarks.  <ul>\n<li>These tools tend to produce a title based on the original bookmarked page and, when present, a description summarized from the page contents by way of highlighted text.</li>\n<li>With this in mind, consider that tags often make up the <strong>sole intentional contribution</strong> made to the bookmark by the person saving it.  <ul>\n<li>Beyond the choice to save the bookmark in the first place, that is.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Whereas on Flickr, the effort is spent on title and, sometimes, the description.  Beyond that point, tags are an afterthought, at best.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The user interface of tagging is near effortless versus, say, formal taxonomies or nested folders.  <ul>\n<li>Even the much-debated choice of the big, fat space bar as a delimiter supports minimal effort.</li>\n<li>Minimal effort lowers mental cost, which promotes more noise, but also encourages more input (or  any input) and thus more signal overall.</li>\n<li>People have limited attention span budgets from which useful metadata can be solicited.  Tagging lowers the budget requirement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The reason why I have generated a ratio of 1 new tag for every 2 bookmarks is that I use tags in a way akin to free association, made possible by the low cost of tagging.  <ul>\n<li><strong>This is a feature, not a bug.</strong></li>\n<li>I have many, many tags used only once and never again—some of them are, in fact, jokes.  </li>\n<li>But, I have generated some tags that I&#39;ve come to adopt more heavily, most of which proved surprisingly useful over months or years of recurrence.</li>\n<li>As for those tags I&#39;ve never used again: They cost nothing, can be hidden below visibility thresholds, and can be merged later into more appropriate tags if I care to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And, there&#39;s where I run out of steam.  For the conclusion, go back to the beginning of this entry.  Biased though I might be, I think Delicious is the place to study tagging, and there they&#39;re of great use.  This is where I think <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> misses the value, despite the volume of writing and data.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086340\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086340\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-18T07:40:08\">2009-01-18T07:40:08</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>In addition Flickr's tagging implementation has always been non-optimal because there is a 1-to-1-to-1 relationship of object (photo) - tag - tagger.

So at least you are in agreement on this.</p>\n<p>But let's dig a bit further what is she saying and what you are saying. I have too tagged a lot of stuff with another service similar to del.icio.us. The result is that no, it is not useful to find something quickly, and I would even go further that I don't even find my own stuff. What I do though on a regular basis is to reduce my own stuff by changing the tags for a set a of pages for example if there are économie, economie, economy, business, I might finally reduce it to one tag \"économie\". What I would really wish is that I could do a hierarchy of these. For example sometimes I tag Japan and Tokyo, what I wish is that in my own hierarchy when I tag Tokyo, the system assumed Japan.</p>\n<p>On Flickr it really depends on what we are looking for, but I'm using flickr for finding images for specific location and for specific creative commons licenses. In both cases, these metadata depends on an ontology (taxonomy, structured schemas, $ORGANIZATIONSYSTEM)</p>\n<p>geolocation… the ontology is the map, a well defined system where you can pinpoint an image somewhere and get the real lat/long values. </p>\n<p>licenses… a controlled vocabulary of different type of licenses.</p>\n<p>The debate is not about \"do tags suck\" but do they work? And indeed they are not really efficient compared to other methods. It's cool they exist, but they should not be here to justify that ontology sucks either.

On Delicious, something akin to lightweight communities emerge based around bottom-up tags. </p>\n<p>I am no library scientist—but, if you've got a community with a collection to organize, I don't think you really need tags.

Meaning tags work as intended, at least for me on Delicious.  I suspect they work for others too, since they keep tagging things in ways that I keep finding them.</p>\n<p>You wrote about another service, but I didn't—I'm writing about tags on Delicious.  I don't know what the thing they call tags looks like on that other unnamed service.  </p>\n<p>This is part of the reason behind my mild disdain for the term \"folksonomy\":  Delicious didn't introduce tagging to start a best practice for Web 2.0 at large—tagging was introduced as a site feature for Delicious.  Attempts to clone that feature elsewhere have been uneven in results, despite having had a term coined and a body of hype spun around it.</p>\n<p>Tagging is like a salt water fish that lots of people thought was pretty and they started trying to stick in fresh water tanks.  I don't think it thrives everywhere people have tried to stick it and not everyone who's tried to clone tagging has gotten all the important parts right.</p>\n<p>On Flickr, I've asserted that tags aren't that useful.  Machine tags like geo tags are a big exception though.  Otherwise, they have a wealth of other tools for finding things beyond tags, whereas on Delicious they're the only game in town.</p>\n<p>I guess my main point is this:  In my experience, tags work.  On Delicious.  Where they're largely agreed to have been cloned from.  Elsewhere, I think there have been transcription errors and misinterpretations that give the concept a dubious reputation. </p>\n<p>I'm not sure what you mean about tags being not really efficient compared to other methods.  Tags are a way to get people to provide metadata useful in emergent classification that would otherwise have not been supplied at all.  I think they're efficient at that.</p>\n<p>Many people just punt when faced with sorting a new resource into a formal category or folder structure.

For instance, I wouldn't tag this with \"tags\" but instead with \"tagging debate\", \"tagging meta\", or similar. That would allow a visitor to this site to find every similar discussion. The \"tags\" tag might include a lot of things that someone wasn't looking for, such as a comparison of tagging services.</p>\n<p>This could also be tagged with the name of the person who wrote the link so the visitors could find discussions involving that person.</p>\n<p>For how I do things, my tag cloud is at my name's link.</p>\n<p>Note the tags with [name topic], such as \"obama cabinet\". Anyone who sees that should realize right away what it involves. And, someone looking for specific Obama information can scan the tags starting with his name for subtopics. Note also the tags about themes, such as \"mean spirited\", which refers to an \"argument\" some people make. And, click a tag like \"bill richardson\" to see how I make some sense of large numbers of posts: many of the lists with a large number of posts are preceded by a summary linking to individual posts.</p>\n<p>(Note: that doesn't represent all the content at my site because I switched from MT to Drupal a couple months ago and only a fraction of thousands of posts is tagged.

    "body": "For the \"<a href=\"delicious.com/tag/tl;dr\">too long</a>; <a href=\"http://delicious.com/tag/tldr\">didn't read</a>\" crowd:\r\n\r\n* I've <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/deusx\">been using a lot of tags on Delicious</a> over a relatively long time, so they seem very useful to me.\r\n* Delicious encourages the use of tags through UI convention and tool usage patterns, whereas Flickr presents no particular bias toward collecting tags from users.\r\n* Since title and description attract more contribution effort from users on Flickr than on Delicious, it's natural that search over those fields will be more productive than for tags.\r\n* Search on Delicious doesn't have access to the complete text of the bookmarked resource, and often tags will contain information missing from the supplied title or description.\r\n* All told, tags on Delicious are more essential than tags on Flickr.\r\n* In conclusion, I think <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> misses the value of tags, as I know them, by focusing on Flickr.\r\n\r\nOf course, I don't really care what this means for folksonomy and the rest of Web 2.0—tags work for me on Delicious.  So, I suspect this means I'm not *entirely* opposed to the sentiment in <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a>, because I don't think tags work everywhere their use is attempted.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this entry elaborates on the above.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nFrom Cathy Marshall's <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a>:\r\n<blockquote>Have I convinced you that tags aren't all they've cracked up to be? I hope I have, but nonetheless there's a lingering fascination. Surely there's something to be done about tags: we don't want to just turn up our noses at Mr. Weinberger's argument.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFrom Mark Bernstein's <a href=\"http://www.markbernstein.org/Jan09/InTEKKATags.html\">In TEKKA: Tags</a>:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThe study could be repeated on more images, and in additional contexts. It might be bad luck. But if it’s a repeatable result — and I think we all know it is — then we’re going to have to rethink a lot of our Web 2.0 rhetoric. Folksonomy is an illusion.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFrom my <a href=\"http://delicious.com/url/125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd#item-125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd972759\">bookmark on Delicious</a>:\r\n<blockquote>If you can get past the rambling paragraphs of awkward fun-poking at tags interspersed with library science / web 2.0 / cultural references—as well as a discovery of what, you know, Flickr is all about—there's a well-embellished and obsessively-assembled statistical analysis of tags vs title vs notes in finding photos featuring tourist heel-spinning on the testicles of a bull mosaic in Milan. My impression is that she's missed the point of tags, but I'm having trouble reducing the impression to a critique.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt might be that I'm intimidated by the writing in <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> or by the fact that a lot of work was done to produce numbers I can't dispute.  Either way, I have neither the time to produce a counter-study nor the wherewithal to extract and refute points in that article with precision.  So, I'm just going to throw my impressions out there and hope they coalesce.\r\n\r\n* Tags are extremely useful to me.\r\n    * I've been using tags on Delicious since shortly after the site was created.  \r\n    * To date, <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/deusx\">I've saved 11825 bookmarks and spawned 6069 tags</a>.  (More on that ratio later.)  \r\n    * Tags have worked very well for me, both in later finding my own saved resources and in finding aggregates of others'.\r\n* Flickr is not the poster child of tagging—Delicious is.  \r\n    * On Flickr, I've found tags occasionally interesting, but not incredibly so.  More a curiosity than a killer feature, really.  (More on that in a bit, too.)\r\n    * To be honest, I've not found a great deal of use for tags around Web 2.0 properties beyond Delicious, folksonomy hype notwithstanding.  \r\n    * Fun fact: When I worked on Delicious, we disliked the term \"[folksonomy][]\" and tried never to use it in serious discussion.\r\n* The places where I've found tags useful are text-heavy, where the full text is either not indexed or not displayed in results when using search.\r\n    * Consider magazine articles or blog posts bookmarked on Delicious.\r\n    * Those bookmarks are subject to the character limits of title or description fields.  \r\n    * Far more often than on Flickr, there is information in tags not present in a bookmark's title or description.\r\n* On Delicious, the use of bookmarklets and extensions is the primary source of new bookmarks.  \r\n    * These tools tend to produce a title based on the original bookmarked page and, when present, a description summarized from the page contents by way of highlighted text.\r\n    * With this in mind, consider that tags often make up the **sole intentional contribution** made to the bookmark by the person saving it.  \r\n        * Beyond the choice to save the bookmark in the first place, that is.\r\n    * Whereas on Flickr, the effort is spent on title and, sometimes, the description.  Beyond that point, tags are an afterthought, at best.\r\n* The user interface of tagging is near effortless versus, say, formal taxonomies or nested folders.  \r\n    * Even the much-debated choice of the big, fat space bar as a delimiter supports minimal effort.\r\n    * Minimal effort lowers mental cost, which promotes more noise, but also encourages more input (or  any input) and thus more signal overall.\r\n    * People have limited attention span budgets from which useful metadata can be solicited.  Tagging lowers the budget requirement.\r\n* The reason why I have generated a ratio of 1 new tag for every 2 bookmarks is that I use tags in a way akin to free association, made possible by the low cost of tagging.  \r\n    * **This is a feature, not a bug.**\r\n    * I have many, many tags used only once and never again—some of them are, in fact, jokes.  \r\n    * But, I have generated some tags that I've come to adopt more heavily, most of which proved surprisingly useful over months or years of recurrence.\r\n    * As for those tags I've never used again: They cost nothing, can be hidden below visibility thresholds, and can be merged later into more appropriate tags if I care to do so.\r\n\r\nAnd, there's where I run out of steam.  For the conclusion, go back to the beginning of this entry.  Biased though I might be, I think Delicious is the place to study tagging, and there they're of great use.  This is where I think <a href=\"http://www.tekka.net/10/tags.html\">Do Tags Work?</a> misses the value, despite the volume of writing and data.\r\n\r\n[folksonomy]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086340\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=01457d1a0f0e533062cd0d1033fb4d7a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086340\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-18T07:40:08\">2009-01-18T07:40:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>In addition Flickr's tagging implementation has always been non-optimal because there is a 1-to-1-to-1 relationship of object (photo) - tag - tagger.

So at least you are in agreement on this.</p>\n\n<p>But let's dig a bit further what is she saying and what you are saying. I have too tagged a lot of stuff with another service similar to del.icio.us. The result is that no, it is not useful to find something quickly, and I would even go further that I don't even find my own stuff. What I do though on a regular basis is to reduce my own stuff by changing the tags for a set a of pages for example if there are économie, economie, economy, business, I might finally reduce it to one tag \"économie\". What I would really wish is that I could do a hierarchy of these. For example sometimes I tag Japan and Tokyo, what I wish is that in my own hierarchy when I tag Tokyo, the system assumed Japan.</p>\n\n<p>On Flickr it really depends on what we are looking for, but I'm using flickr for finding images for specific location and for specific creative commons licenses. In both cases, these metadata depends on an ontology (taxonomy, structured schemas, $ORGANIZATIONSYSTEM)</p>\n\n<p>geolocation… the ontology is the map, a well defined system where you can pinpoint an image somewhere and get the real lat/long values. </p>\n\n<p>licenses… a controlled vocabulary of different type of licenses.</p>\n\n<p>The debate is not about \"do tags suck\" but do they work? And indeed they are not really efficient compared to other methods. It's cool they exist, but they should not be here to justify that ontology sucks either. Every community which is in a need of achieving a specific repetitive task comes one day or the other to structured data organization.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086344\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.ethanhein.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4c0a6f9419c7bce70e889b6115e9bb77&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.ethanhein.com\">Ethan</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086344\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-19T02:33:33\">2009-01-19T02:33:33</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Very often, the suggested tags on a new Delicious post inspire my personal informational ontology.

And if they would work for Delicious, someone somewhere is probably emulating them with specially-formed tags to varying degrees of success.

(see also: for:* and system:media:*)</p>\n\n<p>Actually, one area where I think Flickr has done better with tagging is in machine tags.

I find tags on Delicious just as useful for finding <em>others'</em> bookmarks, too.</p>\n\n<p>I assume that many others use tags much like I do—especially the people bookmarking things I find interesting.  On Delicious, something akin to lightweight communities emerge based around bottom-up tags. </p>\n\n<p>I am no library scientist—but, if you've got a community with a collection to organize, I don't think you really need tags.  That community probably already has a notion of categories worth extracting in a more formal top-down process.  </p>\n\n<p>As for repeating the study, I probably won't be the person to do it.  But, for a quick example that I'd suggest is par for the course, take a look at <a href=\"http://delicious.com/url/125aaf42e2dfbf53b1cb8672d584bbdd\" rel=\"nofollow\">the bookmarks for the article in question</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Of the 18 bookmarks, 10 have notes. That page only shows the most common title, but I'd be surprised if any of the 18 have a title other than \"Do Tags Work?\"  That leaves the tags.  Of the top 10 tags, only one appears in the title (\"tags\").  The word \"folksonomy\" appears in none of the descriptions.  There's also \"socialsoftware\" used 3 times, which appears neither in title or description, nor in the original article itself.  I think this shows better use of tags than the example used from Flickr.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086348\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086348\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-19T03:12:10\">2009-01-19T03:12:10</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@karl: I wrote that tags are useful for finding both mine <em>and</em> others' bookmarks.  Meaning tags work as intended, at least for me on Delicious.  I suspect they work for others too, since they keep tagging things in ways that I keep finding them.</p>\n\n<p>You wrote about another service, but I didn't—I'm writing about tags on Delicious.  I don't know what the thing they call tags looks like on that other unnamed service.  </p>\n\n<p>This is part of the reason behind my mild disdain for the term \"folksonomy\":  Delicious didn't introduce tagging to start a best practice for Web 2.0 at large—tagging was introduced as a site feature for Delicious.  Attempts to clone that feature elsewhere have been uneven in results, despite having had a term coined and a body of hype spun around it.</p>\n\n<p>Tagging is like a salt water fish that lots of people thought was pretty and they started trying to stick in fresh water tanks.  I don't think it thrives everywhere people have tried to stick it and not everyone who's tried to clone tagging has gotten all the important parts right.</p>\n\n<p>On Flickr, I've asserted that tags aren't that useful.  Machine tags like geo tags are a big exception though.  Otherwise, they have a wealth of other tools for finding things beyond tags, whereas on Delicious they're the only game in town.</p>\n\n<p>I guess my main point is this:  In my experience, tags work.  On Delicious.  Where they're largely agreed to have been cloned from.  Elsewhere, I think there have been transcription errors and misinterpretations that give the concept a dubious reputation. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what you mean about tags being not really efficient compared to other methods.  Tags are a way to get people to provide metadata useful in emergent classification that would otherwise have not been supplied at all.

Like we always tell people, there's no wrong way to tag, and that makes it really really hard to generalize accurately about What Tags Mean.</p>\n\n<p>I tend to use Delicious tags to associate a bookmark with a thread of my thinking (which is very useful), and I use a combination of search and tags to find things. But on Flickr, I like looking through tagged photos, and I like looking through groups even more. I search to find old photos, often finding a picture because of the tags on the photo. Both Flickr and Delicious work very well for me.</p>\n\n<p>Tags are interface; the \"meaning\" of each tag is de-emphasized. Compared to hierarchical structures, they're easier, messier, more-used, more fun. They're flexible - they're personal.</p>\n\n<p>Tags on Delicious are collective; tags on Flickr are collective (except when you tag another person's photos); folksonomy implies collaborative.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086352\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://delicious.com/britta\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=57aab4d4b63173e994095032a52d78e6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://delicious.com/britta\">Britta</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086352\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-19T06:39:57\">2009-01-19T06:39:57</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>P.S.

I don't think this really invalidates his point, though: tags are the place for (most) people to put their mark on a link. Us description-editors are odd.</p>\n\n<p>(Annoyingly, I can't find a link that shows that well. There's <a href=\"http://delicious.com/blech/tagging\" rel=\"nofollow\">my bookmarks tagged 'tagging'</a>, I suppose. I've only just noticed this has related tags- that's a nice touch I'd never really spotted.)</p>\n\n<p>On a side note, I love machine tags in Flickr, mainly because they're hidden from the user by default. (They've got a lot more useful now that there are specialised methods in the API, too.) I mused on Twitter last week that neither Delicious nor a third party has done anything with the loose convention of via: or cite: tags that some people use.

Single tags don't solve this and tagging in general kind of shrugs on the issue—though tag intersections involving many tags help disambiguate intended meaning.

For instance, I wouldn't tag this with \"tags\" but instead with \"tagging debate\", \"tagging meta\", or similar. That would allow a visitor to this site to find every similar discussion. The \"tags\" tag might include a lot of things that someone wasn't looking for, such as a comparison of tagging services.</p>\n\n<p>This could also be tagged with the name of the person who wrote the link so the visitors could find discussions involving that person.</p>\n\n<p>For how I do things, my tag cloud is at my name's link.</p>\n\n<p>Note the tags with [name topic], such as \"obama cabinet\". Anyone who sees that should realize right away what it involves. And, someone looking for specific Obama information can scan the tags starting with his name for subtopics. Note also the tags about themes, such as \"mean spirited\", which refers to an \"argument\" some people make. And, click a tag like \"bill richardson\" to see how I make some sense of large numbers of posts: many of the lists with a large number of posts are preceded by a summary linking to individual posts.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: that doesn't represent all the content at my site because I switched from MT to Drupal a couple months ago and only a fraction of thousands of posts is tagged. There are also a few hundred tags that aren't shown; I need to figure out how to show lots of tags.)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

Oh yeah, and Mozilla is the name of <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/reorganization/\">both a Foundation and a Corporation</a>.</p>\n<p>Confused yet?  If not, then we should talk so you can explain it to me, because it all looks pretty tangly and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity\">intertwingled</a> to me.  Nonetheless, it seems to work, and produces a good chunk of my favorite software and technologies.</p>\n<p>There are many efforts to track what&#39;s going on—including <a href=\"http://planet.mozilla.org/\">planets</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/about_mozilla/\">newsletters</a> and <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/\">bugzillas</a> and <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/WeeklyUpdates/2009-01-05\">wikis</a> and <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/\">repositories</a> and <a href=\"http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=Firefox\">tinderboxen</a>.

    "body": "[caption id=\"attachment_1582\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"247\" caption=\"The Mozilla Tree\"]<a href=\"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2008/07/29/the-mozilla-tree/\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/moz-tree.jpg\" alt=\"The Mozilla Tree\" title=\"moz-tree\" width=\"247\" height=\"191\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1582\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nBehind Firefox is Mozilla, and behind Mozilla is a community.  And the Mozilla community acts a lot like an ecosystem, which can be visualized [as a kind of living tree][tree]—not to confused with the [mozilla-central tree][mctree].  Oh yeah, and Mozilla is the name of [both a Foundation and a Corporation][mocofo].\r\n\r\nConfused yet?  If not, then we should talk so you can explain it to me, because it all looks pretty tangly and [intertwingled][inter] to me.  Nonetheless, it seems to work, and produces a good chunk of my favorite software and technologies.\r\n\r\nThere are many efforts to track what's going on—including [planets][planet] and [newsletters][about] and [bugzillas][bugzilla] and [wikis][wikis] and [repositories][repos] and [tinderboxen][tinderbox].  Some of these resources report on, or are driven by, the activity occurring in the others.  Some are automated, and others are carefully stitched together by hand.  None offer a full picture of what's going on in the [Mozilla galaxy][galaxy] in a way that's casually comprehensible by a sane human being.\r\n\r\nOf course, that's not a slight against any of these sites or the people maintaining them—extracting an overview from such an organic phenomenon is neither easy nor straightforward.  But, it might be fun to try.\r\n\r\nAs an infovore and avid practitioner of [continuous partial attention][firehose], my first impulse is to reach for a firehose and stick my head into the stream.  Relax, defocus, and try to let my pattern recognizers do their thing—sometimes those pattern recognizers are in my head, and [sometimes they're written in Python][popularlinks].\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1585\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"225\" caption=\"Firefox Victory!\"]<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/intothefuzz/2571283860/in/set-72157605179678562/\"><img src=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/robo-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Firefox Victory Robot\" title=\"firefox-victory\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1585\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nBut, for Mozilla, I couldn't find a stream of sufficient volume or completeness to satisfy me or [my robots][myrobots].  Happily, though, my feeding urge found itself aligned with a project to discover the patterns of contribution in the Mozilla community and to find a way to thank the contributors responsible.\r\n\r\nSo, while we're still working on the thank-you angle, allow me to introduce you to [the Lizardfeeder][lizardfeeder].  The [LizardFeeder][lizardfeeder] is a feed aggregator, [whose source code][lizardcode] is built atop [Sam Ruby's Planet Venus][venus]. The [LizardFeeder][lizardfeeder] pulls together and archives activity streams from a wide variety of Mozilla community sources.  Beyond the usual human-readable pages produced by a [blog-gathering Planet][planet], the [LizardFeeder][lizardfeeder] accumulates [statistical and historical data][jsondata] meant for consumption and analysis by robots.\r\n\r\nAt present, the only robot navigating the [LizardFeeder][lizardfeeder] archives is an AJAX-ified user interface that animates the firehose as a near real-time or time-lapsed stream of events scrolling by.  \r\n\r\nThis is just meant as a conversation starter, though.  I'm hoping to [gather feedback and find more sources][requests], as well as to entice creative community members to come up with more sophisticated visualizations of this data.  \r\n\r\nSo, take a look, [check it out][lizardfeeder], and let me know what you think!\r\n\r\n[myrobots]: http://www.digitpress.com/dpsoundz/destroyhimrobots.wav\r\n[inter]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity\r\n[mocofo]: http://www.mozilla.org/reorganization/\r\n[mctree]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/mozilla-central\r\n[galaxy]: http://ascher.ca/blog/2008/06/19/whats-mozillas-scope-what-should-it-be/\r\n[popularlinks]: http://decafbad.com/hgwebdir.cgi/hacking_rss_and_atom/file/f7a85b9fd48a/ch15_popular_links.py\r\n[jsondata]: http://feeds.mozilla.com/archives/index.json\r\n[lizardcode]: https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/lizardfeeder/trunk/\r\n[venus]: http://www.intertwingly.net/code/venus/\r\n[lizardfeeder]: http://feeds.mozilla.com/\r\n[firehose]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/23/the-zen-of-firehose-drinking\r\n[tinderbox]: http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=Firefox\r\n[repos]: http://hg.mozilla.org/\r\n[wikis]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/WeeklyUpdates/2009-01-05\r\n[bugzilla]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/\r\n[planet]: http://planet.mozilla.org/\r\n[about]: http://blog.mozilla.com/about_mozilla/\r\n[tree]: http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2008/07/29/the-mozilla-tree/\r\n[requests]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=469838\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083355\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb4ef8f72f933b04a27b118070ac538e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">dria</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083355\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-06T01:26:18\">2009-01-06T01:26:18</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Is there a list of what sources are already being read by the LizardFeeder anywhere?

[what's next][resolutions]?\r\n\r\n[resolutions]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2009/01/05/resolutions\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082757\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://delicious.com/davedash\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=dce6951264f7d72429a9964e1756dad3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://delicious.com/davedash\">Dave Dash</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082757\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2009-01-06T05:45:10\">2009-01-06T05:45:10</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I'm glad we had you on the team.
