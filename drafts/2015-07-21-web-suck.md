TL;DR: The open web fills me with a sense of wonder. It's a beautiful thing that empowers makers while offering users leverage. There's nothing else like it. It's constantly improving. It's up to you what you do with it.

## Sensawunda

I was [newly digital in 1983][newlydigital]. I missed the eras of punch cards and kit computers. But, I *was* around for 8-bit, floppy disks, [magazine type-ins][typeins], and screechy 300 baud modems.

Eight years later, my networked reach was still limited by [area codes][] to about as far as I was allowed to drive. That said, driving to a [copyparty][] organized on the local BBS was the [high bandwidth option][carbandwidth].

[area codes]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbering_plan#Area_code_and_call_pricing

[carbandwidth]: https://www.google.com/search?q=never+underestimate+the+bandwidth+of+a+station+wagon+full+of+tapes&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8

In late high school, I read [Zen and the Art of the Internet][zen]. By college, I had mastered email and Usenet and FTP and Archie. I was downloading Commodore Amiga software [from Sweden][aminet]. Holy crap.

[aminet]: http://wiki.aminet.net/Mirrors

And then, sometime in 1993, I heard about this World Wide Web thing. It was **way** better than [Gopher][]!

We had [terminals][3270] in the libraries with access to a [mainframe][3090], and I figured out how to access a text-only browser. Occasionally I could get on a Sun X11 terminal or [NeXT machine][nextmachine] in the comp sci lab with [this new Mosaic browser][mosaicx11]. I was blown away. ([NeXT was the precursor to Mac OS X][nextosx], by the way.)

Toward the end of my Freshman year, I got dial-up internet on my Amiga and I had [a browser][amigabrowser] working *in my dorm room*. By Sophomore year, the lab machines with Windows got [Netscape Navigator][]. (That was great, because I mostly lived in the computer lab anyway.)

This thing was going to be a big deal - and that was before JavaScript or CSS. Or, hell, [even before the `<img>` tag][imgtag]! The web unified what used to be many separate network services - each with their own clients & quirks & required expertise - into a single point-and-click hypertext interface where you can quickly jump from thing to thing to thing across the whole global Internet.

I started telling everyone I knew.

I think I annoyed everyone I knew.

## The beauty of the open web

So, here I am again, channelling my easily excited self from 1993: Man, I love the web.

It's easy to take this thing for granted, but take a step back and consider it: You've got this thing called a [browser][]. It acts as an [Agent][] on your behalf, reaching out to computers on the Internet and requesting resources identified via [Universal Resource Locators][url]. Looking among these resources, you'd find [hypertext][], [style sheets][], and [multimedia][].

[url]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator
[browser]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser
[agent]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent
[hypertext]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext
[style sheets]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_(web_development)
[multimedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia

Your browser comes with code that knows what to do with common types of content. But, browsers can't anticipate every invention. So, one of the supported resource content types is [JavaScript][]. This is a *meta content type*. That is, it offers the ability to augment existing content types and support completely new ones.

[javascript]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript

Chew on *that* awhile: Not satisfied to be just a networked document viewer with a frozen set of features, browsers ship with a rich [toolchain][] for running code from the outside world on demand. Kind of scary, but it works way better than any reasonable person should expect.

[toolchain]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain

And again, thanks to the Internet, these resources can each come literally from anywhere ([even Sweden][cern]!), hosted by any person or company or organization. Your browser chases URL references and collects all these disparate resources automatically. It assembles them into what is basically a zero-installation software application that's temporarily resident on your computer.

[cern]: http://home.web.cern.ch/

We call these insane things "web pages". The intended ephemerality of their negotiated hold on our computers is why we say we only "visit" them. In fact, it might be more accurate to say web pages are guests we host on our computers for a short time.

<!--
So, yeah, I'm crazy about the web. Crazy enough to work for Mozilla and turn down every other job offer over the years because the mission aligns so well with so many of my favorite things.

## Makers have power

There is no other successful system like this on the planet. No other system for delivering content and software that is this open and free of gatekeepers deciding what we can publish. No other system where you are free to choose from many agents to operate on your behalf, independent of the publishers whose creations you visit.

There's no app store, no review process, no adult supervision. You can make the most amazing or terrible things. Short of legal action or government intervention, no one can really stop you as long as you're paying the hosting bill.

In fact, even though I wrote that browsers are agents acting on their users' behalf - they're historically weak advocates by default. In general, browsers do what web pages ask, with a few exceptions for safety and security. So, today's open web offers the balance of control largely to publishers.

No one will stop you from [building a magazine site that fires off hundreds of requests, chews up data plans, and makes a CPU melt through the casing][theverge] - all while ushering in dozens of global entities to observe every aspect of behavior that can be gleaned from keystroke, tap, and scroll.

Of course, you can also [emulate old computers to make running classic software linkable and embeddable][jsmess].

Or you can craft [a gorgeous existential narrative about luminous beings][enough].

Or you can [create new hats and weapons for an MMO][trovecreations], sharing your work [as a link to a live 3D modeling tool][troxel].

Or you can write [a blog that lands you in an Iranian jail][iranjail] for political speech.

(Granted, some of these things will also make many requests for lots of data and generate a lot of heat.)

And, it's never been cheaper to put something on the web. For example, [this blog lives mostly on Amazon S3][s3blog]. My [last post][theverge] got around 55,000 unique views so far - the most attention I've gotten in years. It looks like that's going to cost me about $6 by the end of the month. I could have probably cut that in half if I'd been smarter about things.

Even if I keep turning out blockbuster posts, I still won't come near my budget for burritos. (Of course, I really like burritos - maybe more than the web. So, this might be an unfair comparison.)

[s3blog]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/20/static-blog-generation-with-gulp/

To put this in my old-person perspective: Someone once told me it was $1 or $5 to photocopy & mail a single issue of a [zine][]. Bump that up to $5-10 for a CD-ROM or DVD in a nice padded envelope. Holy crap. I couldn't even imagine funding a passion project centered around media like that and reaching 55,000 people across the planet.

[zine]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine

## Users have leverage

I know I just wrote that the balance of control on the web leans mainly toward the publishers. But, users on the web are far from powerless when they care to assert themselves.

First, you have a choice in browsers. The browser market is pretty healthy & competitive right now. Once upon a time, [Microsoft Internet Explorer held 96% of the market][msie96]. Today, we've got [at least half-a-dozen browsers][browserstoday] with almost as many rendering engines under their hoods.

This diversity in browsers is important, because it helps discourage any single browser from annoying users too much. Switching cost is low on a web with shared common standards. You can vote with your feet and pick up another browser at any time. This also hinders any single company from injecting their own proprietary features into the web and setting up tollbooths.

[msie96]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#First_browser_war
[browserstoday]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#Second_browser_war

Second, once you've chosen a browser, is that many are heavily customizable with [add-ons][] and [extensions][]. This is where a browser can really shine as a personalized [User Agent][].

Install [Adblock Plus][], and you can deflect most attempts to track you & display ads.

Install [Readability][], and you can get a cleaner view of articles you'd like to read.

Install [Library Extension][] and your browser will automatically tell you when a book is available at your local library while you're shopping on Amazon.

You can even craft your own tweaks, if you're so inclined. In a spirit similar to the web itself, the tech to build these things is generally available to anyone.

Publishers on the web sometimes deride these tweaks. It's understandable: The most popular ones have long been centered around refusing to accept many of the annoyances that also happen to fund the web.

But, with this choice in personalized user agents, the relationship between reader and publisher must be *negotiated*. Mostly, it's a quiet negotiation by defaults: Publishers can do as much as readers accept. But, when readers introduce resistance in the form of using ad-blockers, they can impose a cost to publishers who get carried away.

As I wrote before, web pages are *guests* on our computers. Most users have been very tolerant of these guests' behavior. Tolerant to the point where a publisher could take for granted or even feel entitled to the bandwidth and hardware we pay for. But, it's entirely possible for this negotiation to turn sour, [forcing the industry to come up with a new deal][savingtheinternet].

## If it's not the web, it's not the web

There's a new iPhone ad out there - "[If it's not an iPhone, it's not an iPhone][iphonead]".

This is one of the things the narrator says:

> The hardware part makes the most of the software part, and the software part makes the most of the hardware part. When you design the whole phone, all the parts work together as one amazing part.

This is obviously true, and the iPhone is a great product. You can curate a smooth and "magical" experience, when you own a platform from bottom to top. But, the cost is that makers have less power and users have less leverage.

As gatekeepers running the one and only App Store, Apple can demand a cut of all money that flows to makers. [Apple also lists a lot of requirements][appguidelines]. Some are great ideas for users, while some serve to reinforce Apple's control over its platform.

<!-- more to say about makers? -->

As a user, you can somewhat customize your iPhone by the apps you install. As of iOS 8, there are also [App Extensions][appextensions] that allow you to add selected bits of new functionality to existing apps. Of course, all of this must pass through Apple's editorial filter. For instance, did you know that despite there being many apps that let you browse the web, [there's really only one web engine][onebrowser] on iOS? ("[2.17 Apps that browse the web must use the iOS WebKit framework and WebKit Javascript][appguidelines]")

Luckily, users of iOS 9 will soon benefit from [Content Blocker App Extensions][contentblocksafari] in Safari. These an improvement on filter lists for [AdBlock Plus][]: The extensions consist of JSON files containing patterns & rules used to block requests and selectively remove content from pages.

Outside of Safari and the constrained world of App Extensions, though, users don't have much leverage over what apps makers do. If you don't like it, don't install it. But, there's no view source or built-in developer tools, so even power users mainly rely on Apple to monitor apps.

[appextensions]: http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/06/explaining-ios-8s-extensions-opening-the-platform-while-keeping-it-secure/

[contentblocksafari]: http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/06/15/inside-app-extensions-webkit-content-blockers-extend-user-privacy-in-ios-9-safari-9
[onebrowser]: http://www.howtogeek.com/184283/why-third-party-browsers-will-always-be-inferior-to-safari-on-iphone-and-ipad/
[appguidelines]: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/
[iphonead]: https://www.apple.com/iphone/why-theres-iphone/

For all practical purposes, then, Apple is the user's agent in the iOS world. That's not entirely bad, of course, [because users are Apple's customers and not their product][nottheproduct]. The results are very satisfying for a profitably large number of people who enjoy the decisions Apple makes on their behalf.

If you don't like it, though, your only move is not to play in Apple's ecosystem. Like the ad says, the hardware part and the software part are inseparable. If you ever decide to leave once you've been inside, you leave behind most of what you ever bought.

[nottheproduct]: http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/16/tim-cook-on-why-apple-is-better-at-protecting-privacy-youre-not-our-product/

Personally, I don't like those compromises. I've owned iPods, but never an iPhone. Your mileage may vary.

## The web is learning from apps

* visiting vs installation, caching vs more permanent storage
