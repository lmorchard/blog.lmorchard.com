TL;DR: Wherein I write a web sci-fi story about how I imagine micropayments
could work.

*<b>DISCLAIMER DISCLAIMER DISCLAIMER</b>: I think about the web a lot. I've
been thinking about it for 20 years or so.  In fact, I work for Mozilla because
I've love the web and can't stop thinking about it.*

*That said, I'm not in any
position to speak for or make major decisions at Mozilla. What I'm going to
write here is completely web science fiction. I imagined it after having one too many
espressos.*

*For more context, this is kind of a response to [David Humphrey's "402:
Payment Required"][humphd] and [Joel Dueck's "Payment Required"][joel]*

## No such thing as a free lunch, anymore

The year is 2020. The consumer revolt against tracking & advertising on the web
is here to stay. 

The fallout has been brutal: Every "one weird trick" and
"you'll never believe" viral headline site has evaporated. Nine out of ten
daily news sites across all topics & interests have gone under or consolidated.
A few favorites have gotten by on a surprise surge of "premium" memberships,
but it's a lot quieter out there in general.

<div class="pullquote left">
Firefox... The browser so great, we're going
to let you pay for it!
</div>

A new campaign begins at Mozilla: "*Firefox... The browser so great, we're going
to let you pay for it!*"

Firefox becomes a subscription service. Five bucks a month in the US - $50 for
a year and save! It comes with a wallet you can fill with Foxcoins. A $5
subscription gives you 1000 Foxcoins every month and you can buy more from the
Foxstore.

"Wow," you say, "I thought Mozilla was a non-profit. Good luck with that."

A month later, more & more of the links you follow lead to an
ad for Firefox along with the message "*This page costs 1 Foxcoin to
view.*" You shake your head. The web really is dying off.

## At least it's not socks

At Christmas, you get a card from a relative you haven't seen in a few years. A
gift card falls out - it's worth 2500 Foxcoins. "What's this crap?" you think.
Curious, you head to the URL on the card to redeem it. It turns out you can get
a month of Firefox for 2000 Foxcoins. You shrug, sign up, and install Firefox.

<div class="pullquote right">
This page costs 1 Foxcoin to view.
</div>

The new Firefox is nice. It's fast. It has clever features. After a night of
poking around blogs & games & cat pictures, you notice the Foxcoin balance in
the corner of the screen has ticked down to 450. You realize you haven't seen
an ad all night - not even one of those Mozilla ads. 

You follow another link
and the balance drops to 449.

After a couple of weeks, your Foxcoin balance runs out. The next link shows
that old annoying warning: "*This page costs 1 Foxcoin to view*," along with a
link to top up your wallet at the Foxstore. 

You ignore it and keep browsing on
to other free sites - those are getting harder to find.

By the end of the month, Firefox just stops working. It shows a form to
reactivate your subscription. 

Annoyed, you go back to your old copy of
Chrome. But, every site wants Foxcoin now. You bite the bullet: You pull out a
credit card and start a Firefox subscription.

## Information wants to be expensive

Things are good again. The monthly allowance of 1000 Foxcoins seems to feed
your usual habits. But, you've noticed a few places have started asking for
more.

<div class="pullquote">
Soon, you find your Foxcoins running out in the middle of the month.
</div>

Your favorite beer homebrewing forum asks you to bump up to 2 Foxcoins per
view. In exchange, you get a gold border around on your avatar and you can use
some fun emoticons in posts. Feeling magnanimous, you agree.

An arcade site asks 50 Foxcoins to unlock every game for a few hours. The place
is pretty fun, so you splurge some nights.

You find a weekly podcast that's 150 Foxcoins per episode - or 500 per month to
subscribe. After listening to some free samples from the archives, you're
hooked.

Soon, you find your Foxcoins running out in the middle of the month. You bump
your subscription up to $10 and get 2500 Foxcoins every month. But, with so
much good stuff out there, you start using up even that allowance. There are
still higher subscription levels, but you decide something's got to give.

## Audience participation

The easiest thing to do is just deal with it - when the wallet's empty, you
just do without the web. You make an effort to budget your web use. But, that's
no fun after a few weeks. So, you look into more options.

<div class="pullquote right">
You can opt into ads to earn Foxcoin
</div>

Turns out you can opt into ads to earn Foxcoin. You don't really like
the sound of that, but you give it a try - you can always turn it back off
whenever you want. 

It's not like the old days, though: Ads aren't plastered all over. Instead,
Firefox shows you something every now and then between links. Usually it's a
quick interstitial image with some text. Occasionally it's a video.  Sometimes
it's a survey or even a puzzle. 

You're surprised at how little you're annoyed -
and how often you actually engage. There are other ad services to
try: They offer higher payouts, but they feel too intrusive for your tastes.

By the end of the month, you've gotten an extra 750 Foxcoins. Not terrible, but
you keep looking around.

<div class="pullquote left">
You can earn Foxcoin for moderating discussions.
</div>

Lots of your usual haunts have started offering some kind of payback scheme for
taking on odd jobs. On the homebrewing forum, you notice folks pitching in to
help run the place. You can earn Foxcoin for moderating discussions and weeding
out spam.

You apply & get approved - you now have an even more special border around your
avatar and you help douse flame wars in a few topics. This nets you about 200
Foxcoins the first month - plenty to offset your use of that particular site.

## Your information wants to be expensive, too

You find yourself writing some particularly long reviews & how-tos on the
forums. One day, someone snarks that you should start a blog if you're going to
keep posting walls of text like that.

It gets you thinking. You had a Tumblr, like 10 years ago. You just used it for
random GIFs and general life complaints. After a bit of research, you find
Amazon's web services: They support blogs and just started accepting Foxcoin to
pay for hosting. What's even more interesting is that they let *you* accept
Foxcoin from visitors to your site!

<div class="pullquote right">
Come to find out, you like writing.
</div>

So, you pick a clever name & create a site. Whenever you're tempted to post a
few paragraphs on the forum, you publish to your blog instead and link to it
with a TL;DR summary. Come to find out, you really like writing.

Even better, folks from the forums - and beyond - like reading what you've got
to say about weird & exotic beers and how to brew them. Word spreads. While
Amazon takes a cut of the Foxcoin flowing your way, you're surprised to find
that your balance grows every month. 

By the end of summer, you stop paying cash for your Firefox subscription.

You've even totally covered your web habits with plenty left over.

## Foxcoin gets real

Someone on the forums snarks that you must be rolling in it now, thanks to all
your fans. 

You'd read about it awhile back, but totally forgot until just now:
Foxcoin can be redeemed for cash. In fact, as kind of a reverse subscription,
you can have an amount deducted every month and deposited directly into your
bank account. So, you set that up.

<div class="pullquote">
Foxcoin can be redeemed for cash.
</div>

By the end of the year, your earnings get to a point where you actually have to
declare them on your taxes. 

You're far from quitting your day job, but your
blog buys you a lot of nice beer and a great splurgy dinner here & there. 

All of which, you know, is technically research for more writing.

## Social media stars rise again

Social media becomes a thing again: It had mostly died when companies &
investors realized ad money was drying up. 

<div class="pullquote right">
A few stars are making a living from their fans
</div>

But, with the advent of Foxcoin,
someone comes up with the idea to share revenues with folks posting
little quips & videos. For most users, it's like any old chat site. 

For a group of popular folks, the pay out overtakes
what they pay in - and suddenly a few stars are making a living from their
fans.

You're nowhere near that yourself, but it's good for driving traffic to
your blog.


## Competition grows

And of course, Foxcoin isn't the only game in town for long: Google revives the
Chrome team and unveils their own subscription-free currency. Apple and
Microsoft both unveil their own browser refreshes & currency offerings. The
browser wars start all over again - this time with even banks & credit card
networks jumping into the game.

<div class="pullquote left">
The browser wars start all over again
</div>

Your cousin is a web developer. She grouses constantly about having to
support all these browsers. But, she's never been so in demand.

Exchange services pop up to trade currency between browser wallets. You make
a small profit by playing the markets, but you decide it's not really your thing.
Some folks really make it big.

Fraud & scams grow - you get bitten more than once. But, Firefox & Chrome &
Safari & Edge are all in a race for user protections and offer generous
refunds, so it's never really a big problem for you. It's a little annoying to
keep up to date with the tech on your site, but Amazon mostly just takes care
of it as part of the hosting package.

## Good times

After a few years, it feels like another dot-com boom - just with fewer
billionaires and many more hundred-thousand-aires. Armchair analysts everywhere
enjoy the earnings as they weigh in with opinion pieces about when the bubble's
going to burst.

<div class="pullquote right">
You really do quit your day job.
</div>

You keep writing for your blog. Your traffic grows as you diversify
into other beverages & food. You really do quit your day job. 

You bring in guest writers - with revenue sharing, of course. They become
permanent staff.

You find yourself traveling a bit for exclusive interviews with up-and-coming
microbrewers & restaurateurs.

You adopt a cat with huge ears and name her Foxy. She's cute and has her own
microblog - ghostwritten by you. It pays for her kibble. 

Life is pretty good on the paid web, even for pets.
