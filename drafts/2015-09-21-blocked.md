With iOS9, Apple just went and did it. [They opened up the ability to implement
content blocking extensions for Safari][contentblocking].

## Who did what now?

To hear some folks tell it, Apple just nuked the web. Those maniacs! In
reality, though, Apple themselves haven't blocked anything.  Rather, they
opened up the *capability* to block. It's up to app developers to decide what
to block. From there, it's up to users to decide whether & what to purchase &
install. 

There's a lot of choice to go around: If this really is a nuclear strike, many
hands happily turned their keys in the launch silos. It's a big nasty veto
against the current state of affairs on the web.

## Apple didn't start this

Let's not pretend this is some sinister battle between corporate entities as an
excuse to ignore the people in the middle. While Apple does do lots of things I
dislike, [they are champions of user experience for their many paying
customers][applecustomers] - i.e. mainly the folks who buy hardware.

Apple opening the door to
content blockers that improve the user experience on the mobile web makes
perfect sense. So does Apple's News app, considering that it serves to exploit
the opportunities offered by the self-inflicted wounds evident on today's
tracking and ad laden web sites. (Of course, even there, [the experience
still has wrinkles in need of ironing][applenewsnyt].)

For years we've had things like [Adblock Plus][]. But, practically speaking,
that's been an obscure convenience reserved for folks in the know. True to
form, Apple didn't invent the content blocker. They made the tech more
accessible. If this whole thing is a master stroke by Apple to stab at any
competitor's heart, the blade was gladly thrust by the disgruntled masses
assumed until now to be [a passive compost heap][compost].

## Babies, bathwater, and ultimatums

While the shock may be understandable, publishers facing reduced revenues do
themselves no favors with panicked reactions to these content blocking
extensions. As I just wrote, Apple didn't invent this stuff - [taking swings at
them is a non-starter][robapple].

Branding ad-block users as thieves earns little sympathy, not when the
surveillance-driven infrastructure of delivering unwelcome messages grows daily -
all while user-owned attention & computing resources are taken completely for
granted. I'm sure to some folks - for right or wrong - the score feels even.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The reckoning is coming for an ad industry that grew reckless with user&#39;s bandwidth, privacy, CPU, and attention. About time.</p>&mdash; DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/644517154046410752">September 17, 2015</a></blockquote>

Claiming that some ad networks are the "good guys" is also maybe a bit too
subtle a point when the whole field looks dirty and the crowds are looking
to throw the bums out.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber">@gruber</a> they just want to block all ads, seeing all as garbage. <a href="http://t.co/jsq5UdVqo5">http://t.co/jsq5UdVqo5</a> <a href="http://t.co/21Vcksj4jA">pic.twitter.com/21Vcksj4jA</a></p>&mdash; Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) <a href="https://twitter.com/dannysullivan/status/645634044558884864">September 20, 2015</a></blockquote>

Then, there's this proposition: [Accept surveillance & marketing or face the
death of the web we love.][webdeath] Given the presumption - and frankly, the
arrogance - behind that stark ultimatum, it's no surprise that "Tough. Adapt or
die!" is the response from many. Seriously? Those are the only
choices? Frankly, this strikes me as a failure of imagination. And, possibly
an overestimation of value.

## Who knew they could talk?

Yes, I understand that today's ad-funded model has been insanely successful.
Turnkey services have empowered lots of folks to do their thing without
worrying about inventory or implementation. Frankly, even my own employer has
benefited - and me along with it by way of a regular paycheck. 

This ad-supported model on the web was built on quiet acceptance by an audience
who never gave consent except by default. But, browsers weren't really made to
make computers do things their owners don't want. So, refusal is possible.
[Defaults can change.][mozillacookies] If this spike of consumer revolt grows & deepens, those
assumptions evaporate and all the finger-wagging in the world won't un-pop the
bubble.

No, I think digging out of this mess will require some thought & creativity -
after first accepting the possibility that the old model might actually collapse. Have
some empathy & listen: If your users are blocking your ads, maybe stop treating
them like livestock and ask what's up. 

This *could* be the first round in a negotiation ends up with a better deal for
everyone involved. **Who knows?** 

A lot of us could just be jerks who want something for nothing. Or, this
opening salvo of block-all-the-things could be a first crude spastic
kick from stakeholders who were never really asked or given seats at the table
until they took them just now. I really hope for the latter, because otherwise
I guess we can't have nice things.

## To be continued

I've got a few ideas. They're quite likely terrible, or else I'd already be a
billionaire. In the interests of keeping this short, I'll save them for 
another blog post. Either way, I suspect that shaking the web out of comfy
ad-supported complacency could just possibly lead to interesting things -
provided we get the the finger pointing & wagging out of our systems and get
down to facing the challenge.

Or, this could all blow over, and things will be back to business as usual
in no time at all. Probably best not to rely on that, though.
