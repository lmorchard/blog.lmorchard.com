## Intro

[<img class="inset left" src="/uploads/2016/steam-controller/hhkb.jpg">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24726637531/in/dateposted/)

I've long been a fan of unusual input devices, the more fiddly the better. 

It's been a little over 15 years since I last used a standard 104-key keyboard
on a PC, having been a [Happy Hacking Keyboard][hhkb] enthusiast ever since I
first [read about it in Linux Journal][hhkb-review].

And, as the gaming world has invested in increasingly complex gaming mice over
the years, I've been solidly in the trackball camp ever since the days of Quake
2 and Unreal Tournament.

The [Mad Catz Panther XL][pantherxl] trackball-and-joystick combo
was my favorite for flight & space sims like Freespace. I used a [Microsoft
Sidewinder Strategic Commander][msssc] to play Everquest one-handed. (The
other hand was for tinkering with [ShowEQ][], of course.)

More recently, when I was playing a space trucker in EVE Online, I would often
ride a recumbent exercise bike and use a [One Finger Mouse][ofm] with my
laptop to align and warp between stations.

Given all the above, the [Steam Controller][] looked completely relevant to my
interests. I managed to wait a month or so after it was released, watching for
any red flags in early reviews. But, of course, I gave in and had it in time
for my traditional end-of-year holiday gaming binge. <br style="clear: both">

## Ergonomics

<img class="inset left" id="thumbnail" src="/uploads/2016/steam-controller/couch-pc.jpg">

At [my couch PC][couchpc], these days I use an Xbox 360 controller whenever I can. I don't
want to clutter the living room with big weird joysticks & such.

[couchpc]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch/

Besides that, having my hands in a neutral position in my lap seems to
help quite a lot with keeping wrist pain at bay after a day in my office
already spent with trackball and keyboard. But, not every game supports a
controller out of the box.

So, it seemed really promising when I read Valve's claims that the [Steam
Controller][] would work with "[games from all genres][steamhardware]"
including titles typically bound to a keyboard and mouse.

[<img class="inset right" src="/uploads/2016/steam-controller/all-3-controllers.jpg">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24524584120)

Now that I've got it in my hands, the [Steam Controller][] makes my Xbox 360
controller feel tiny.

It reminds me of the original Xbox controller, a little.  Though, it's really
unfair to take that comparison too far - I mean, that controller was bigger
than some actual game consoles.

The Xbox 360 "handles" taper down into rounded points that cover a third of my
palm. But, the [Steam Controller][] bulges out at the bottoms and covers about
half of my palm.  It's a bit like the difference between a small chicken egg
and a jumbo.  (Sorry, I've been cooking today.) And where my fingers curl
inward toward my palm with the 360 controller, the [Steam Controller][] has
them pointing toward my chest.
<br style="clear: both">

[<img class="inset left" src="/uploads/2016/steam-controller/360-hands.jpg">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24793856326)
[<img class="inset left" src="/uploads/2016/steam-controller/sc-hands.jpg">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24793858166)

And, this is where I realize I was never destined to find a career as a hand
model.

The Xbox 360 controller tends to feel like curved handlebars gripped between
my palms and the last three fingers, leaving my index fingers and thumbs
mostly free.  It feels like it just naturally falls into my relaxed hands. 

The [Steam Controller][], though, seems to call for a more tense grip. Most
times, I find myself using some arm muscle to kind of wedge it between the
upper edges of my hands and the bases of my thumbs. Except for a little
stabilization from my pinkies and occasionally ring fingers, this leaves the
rest of my fingers free to reach the thumbpads and buttons.

[<img class="inset right" src="/uploads/2016/steam-controller/sides.jpg">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24726646081/in/dateposted-public/)
[<img class="inset right" src="/uploads/2016/steam-controller/backs.jpg">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24702264542/in/dateposted-public/)

The face of the Xbox 360 controller follows a convex curve. When relaxed, the
pads of my extended thumbs rest on the left stick and right button cluster.

The face of the [Steam Controller][] forms a concave bowl. My thumbs hover
over a pair of circular trackpads, which are far better controlled with
strokes from tips of bent thumbs than by swiping or rolling flat thumb pads
across them.

Overall, I can't say I'm entirely comfortable with the [Steam Controller][] in
my hands yet. After years with the Xbox 360 controller, the general grip just
feels a bit awkward. That kind of stuff worries me a little bit after years of
being unkind to my wrists. But, I'm still kind of adjusting my grip on the
thing, so maybe I'll get used to it after awhile. 

After all, I spent years with the first NES gamepad - and it was no ergonomic
marvel.

## Hardware

In terms of input hardware, the [Steam Controller][] offers interesting
improvements over my trusty old Xbox 360 controller.

[<img class="inset wide left" src="/uploads/2016/steam-controller/sc-top.jpg">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24525157630/in/photostream/)

On the front, there's the "Valve" button flanked by a back & start buttons.
There's also an analog clicky joystick and an X/Y/A/B button cluster. 

But, the [Steam Controller][]'s special sauce is the pair of trackpads at the
top of the controller. More detail about those when I get to writing about the
software.

Beneath these trackpads are the [linear resonant actuators][lra] used for haptic
feedback: In the past, "rumble" motors in controllers used motors spinning
off-center weights to affect vibration. Linear resonant actuators are more like
speakers, and offer more precise control over the exact feel.

[<img class="inset wide left" src="/uploads/2016/steam-controller/sc-back.jpg">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24820691505/in/dateposted/)

On the back, there's a pair of shoulder buttons and analog triggers that bottom
out in clicks. Along the handgrips lie two more wide buttons under the
middle & ring fingers.  The plate for those buttons doubles as the battery
door, and one AA battery hides inside each of the handgrips.

[<img class="inset wide left" src="/uploads/2016/steam-controller/sc-back-open.jpg">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/24727371301/in/dateposted/)

On the inside, there are gyro and accelerometer sensors to detect motion and
orientation of the controller. If you want to see more of the innards, 
consult the folks at [iFixit][]. They did [a great job of documenting their Steam
Controller teardown][teardown]. They've saved me from feeling like I
should open mine up for the sake of this post.

As for power, the controller can run tethered via a micro-USB cable, or
wirelessly using an included a USB dongle and a pair of AA batteries. 

You can use rechargeables,
but the controller itself does not charge them while plugged in. I'd like to
see Valve come up with a rechargeable pack at some point, but
I haven't yet used up the first pair of batteries out of the box.

## Software

The physical design and laundry list of sensors is vaguely interesting. But,
what really makes the [Steam Controller][] shine - and sometimes stink - is
the software. And, that software is Steam in Big Picture Mode.

<img class="fullwidth" src="/uploads/2016/steam-controller/big-picture-home.jpg">

The only way to configure the Controller is via Big Picture mode.
And, as far as I can tell, launching games (even non-Steam games) via Big
Picture is the only way to load game-specific profiles. 

I understand that this thing was designed to be paired with a Steam Machine
and played on a TV. But, I don't play in front of a TV. I find Big Picture
Mode clunky and occasionally crashy. A few times, the controller has gone
non-responsive or got loaded with the wrong profile.

It's early days yet, so hopefully things will get better with future patches.
Still, I'd love it if Valve (or the community) released an "expert"
configuration tool as an straightforward desktop Windows application.  Just
let me quickly assign bindings in a solid, ugly, utilitarian interface and let
me manually save & load profiles.

The awkwardness is frustrating, because configuration is the whole reason the
controller exists: I put up with the annoying UI because the result is
interesting. With a little tweaking, it can generate whatever inputs are
needed for any game you want to play.

<img class="fullwidth" src="/uploads/2016/steam-controller/controller-config.png">

Except for the Valve button, there are 17 other buttons on the device available
to generate any combination of keyboard & mouse signals. That includes the
clicky trackpads & joystick - and I'm counting the analog triggers twice,
because you can set different inputs for both partial and full pulls.

<img class="fullwidth" src="/uploads/2016/steam-controller/trackpad-config.png">

And then, there are the trackpads: In a nutshell, either trackpad can be
configured as a mouse, a joystick, buttons, or a d-pad. There are 9 different
modes covering slightly different simulations of these devices. Each
mode comes with its own control panel offering an array of sliders,
variants, and advanced settings.

For button input, there are ways to define segments of the trackpad as
virtual buttons activated on touch or by clicking down the pad. 

Joystick input comes in a few subtly different flavors I haven't yet fully
explored.
 
For pointer input, there's a mouse mode similar to a laptop trackpad, with
various acceleration and sensitivity settings. 

To my personal delight, there's
a trackball mode: the pad signals momentum through haptic rumbles that
trail off after your thumb has lifted from a swipe - and it stops immediately
when your thumb returns to the pad. 

You can also enable scroll wheel inputs via
the raised outer edges of the trackpads, similar in feel to the old click-wheel
iPods. 

<img class="fullwidth" src="/uploads/2016/steam-controller/controller-config-import.png">

Finally, if all this sounds overwhelming, Steam offers ready-made profiles.
These are created by game developers, Valve, and shared by the community at
large. Hopefully, as time goes on, control schemes will arrive that hit a
sweet spot for each game.

Valve has certainly thrown a lot at the wall here. We'll see how much sticks.
It certainly scratches my itch for a fiddly input device, in any case.

## Compatibility

In a nutshell, if it accepts mouse, keyboard, joystick, or gamepad - the Steam
Controller works with it. The more pressing issue is whether the Controller is
compatible with *me* as an interface to *the games I like*.

I've had the most luck in mouse-and-keyboard games like the ponderously-paced
[Sunless Sea][] and even in the more frenetic [Diablo III][]. Of course, at
times, I lose track of the pointer in Diablo when I'm spazzing out with my
thumb and flinging it around between targets and running away to kite things.
That seems to get better as I turn down acceleration and play with
sensitivity.

[Rocket League][] worked out pretty well, in that I was equally terrible both
with the [Steam Controller][] and the Xbox 360 controller. But, I had a lot of fun
and never felt like I could blame the controller.

I didn't have as much luck with [Laserlife][], a surreal twin-stick rhythm
game in the tradition of Rez. Ideally, I should be able to use the two
trackpads as analog sticks. But, I did a lot better going back to the physical
sticks on my Xbox 360 controller. The feel of the joystick resistance helped
cue me into its position. I think it's similar to how I never get along with
on-screen joysticks in many smartphone games. I would like to see if I can
figure out workable settings here, though, because I like a lot of twin-stick
shooters.

[Elite Dangerous][] offers a kind of bottomless pit of customization.  It's a
work in progress translating my mouse-and-keyboard controls to a comfortable
scheme on the Controller. For example, it was kind of fun tying pitch and roll
to the motion sensors and flying the controller around like a spaceship. I
can't see this replacing a super-immersive HOTAS setup, but I think I can get
it to an enjoyable point.

Of course, that said, it should be noted that I'm by no means a pro gamer. I'm
the filthiest of casuals, whatever that means after playing video games avidly
for 30 years.
 
I've seen some folks describe the process a bit like
getting accustomed to a new keyboard layout like Dvorak.

## Hackability

The Controller is a USB HID composite device - in other words, It *is* a mouse
*and* a keyboard *and* a joystick *and* a gamepad, as far as USB is concerned.
When a profile is configured in Steam, it's uploaded to microcontrollers in
the device. I've gotten the sense that Steam does *something* with the
Controller input, but I'm not sure how much is pure USB input from the
controller and how much is Steam taking the place of things like [JoyToKey][]
or [AutoHotKey][] and translating things on the PC side.

[JoyToKey]: http://joytokey.net/en/
[AutoHotKey]: https://autohotkey.com/

As I'm starting to read up on building a custom keyboard, I'm acquainting
myself with the [Teensy line of USB development boards][teensy]. Right now,
I'm playing with the [Teensy 2.0][teensy20], which seems to be popular in the DIY
community for how easy it is to use in implementing custom USB devices.

Well, from [an iFixit teardown][teardown] and [a Reddit thread][reddit-chips],
I learned that the [Steam Controller][] is built around the [ARM
Cortex-M0][cortex-m0]. That happens to be similar to the [ARM
Cortex-M0+][cortex-m0-plus] used in the [Teensy LC][teensylc].  And Valve has
publicly stated early on that "the [Steam Controller][] was designed from the
ground up to be hackable"
