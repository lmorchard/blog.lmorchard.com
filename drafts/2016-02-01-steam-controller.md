## Intro

@@ picture of my couch PC setup

At my couch PC, these days I use an Xbox 360 controller whenever I can. I don't
want to clutter the living room with big weird joysticks & suchlike.

Additionally, having my hands in a neutral position in my lap seems to
help quite a lot with keeping wrist pain at bay after a day in my office
already spent with trackball and keyboard. But, not every game supports a
controller out of the box.

So, when I first heard about the Steam Controller, I was intrigued. It promised
to work with "games from all genres" including titles typically bound to a
keyboard and mouse. When I saw some prototypes, I knew I'd have to end up
trying one of these things.

## Novelty

I've long been a fan of unusual input devices, the more fiddly the better. It's
been a little over 15 years since I last used a standard 104-key keyboard on a
PC, having been a Happy Hacking Keyboard enthusiast ever since I first read
about them on Slashdot. And now, the notion of building my own keyboard -
possibly even smaller than the HHKB - has really taken root in my brain.
 
And, as the gaming world has invested in increasingly complex gaming mice over
the years, I've been solidly in the trackball camp ever since the days of Quake
2 and Unreal Tournament. The [Mad Catz Panther XL][pantherxl] trackball-and-joystick combo
was my favorite for flight & space sims like Freespace. I used a Microsoft
Sidewinder Strategic Commander to play Everquest almost one-handed.

More recently, when I was playing a space trucker in EVE Online, I would often
ride a recumbent exercise bike and use a [One Finger Mouse][ofm] (actually a
thumb-trackball) on my laptop to align and warp between stations.

Given all the above, the Steam Controller looked completely relevant to my
interests. I managed to wait a month or so after it was released, watching for
any red flags in early reviews. But, of course, I gave in and had it in time
for my traditional end-of-year holiday gaming binge.

## Ergonomics

The Steam Controller makes my Xbox 360 controller feel tiny: It's wider and
significantly thicker in parts. It reminds me of the original Xbox controller,
though it's really unfair to take that comparison too far - I mean, that
controller was bigger than some actual game consoles.

@@ comparison photos of xbox, steam, and 360 controllers

The Xbox 360 "handles" taper down into rounded points that cover a third of my
palm. But, the Steam Controller bulges out and covers about half of my palm.
It's a bit like the difference between a medium chicken egg and a jumbo.
(Sorry, I've been cooking today.) And where my fingers curl inward toward my
palm with the 360 controller, the Steam Controller has them pointing toward my
chest.

The Xbox 360 controller tends to feel like handlebars gripped between my palms
and the last three fingers, leaving my index fingers and thumbs free. It feels
like it just naturally falls into my relaxed hands. With the Steam Controller,
though, the grip feels like it involves more participation from my arms to
wedge it between the upper edges of my hands from first knuckles to the bases of
my thumbs, with a bit of stabilization from my pinkies. That makes sense,
considering my first three fingers fall on triggers and buttons found on the
back of the device - this grip leaves more fingers free to move.

The face of the Xbox 360 controller follows a convex curve. The pads of my
extended thumbs rest on the left stick and right button cluster. The face of
the Steam Controller forms a concave bowl. My bent thumbs hover over a pair of
circular trackpads, which are far better controlled with strokes from thumb
tips than pads.

Overall, I can't say I'm entirely comfortable with the Steam Controller in my
hands yet. After years with the Xbox 360 controller, the general grip just
feels a bit awkward. Keeping my thumbs bent and positioned *just so* seems more
fatiguing than I'd expect. I'm still kind of adjusting my grip on the thing,
though, so maybe I'll get used to it after awhile.

And, I think this thing is worth getting used to, as I'll
hopefully explain before I'm done here.

## Hardware

It's fair to say that, in terms of input hardware, the Steam Controller
offers a few interesting improvements over my trusty old Xbox 360 controller.

On the back, there are shoulder buttons and two analog triggers that bottom out
in clicks. Along the handgrips, there are two more wide buttons under the
middle & ring fingers.

On the inside, there are gyroscopic and accelerometer sensors to detect motion
and orientation of the controller as a whole. I haven't used these much, yet,
but I've read that they're handy for vehicle controls or fine tuning aim in an
FPS.

On the front, there's the "Valve" button flanked by a back & start buttons.
There's also an analog clicky joystick and an X/Y/A/B button cluster. But,
where the Steam Controller most radically departs from game controller history
is in the pair of trackpads under the thumbs at the top of the controller.

Beneath these trackpads are the linear resonant actuators used for haptic
feedback: In the past, "rumble" motors in controllers used motors spinning
off-center weights to affect vibration. Linear resonant actuators are more like
speakers, and offer more precise control over the exact feel.

The controller can run tethered via a micro-USB cable, or wirelessly using an
included a USB dongle and a pair of AA batteries. You can use rechargeable AA
batteries, but the controller itself does not charge them while plugged in. I
kind of hope Valve comes up with a rechargeable pack for this thing at some
point, but I haven't yet used up the first pair of batteries out of the box.

## Software

The laundry list of sensors is vaguely interesting. But, what really makes
the Steam Controller shine - and sometimes stink - is the software.

@@ screenshot closeup of big picture mode button

The first thing to know is that the Controller and Big Picture Mode are
inseparable. The only way to configure the controller is via Big Picture mode.
And, as far as I can tell, launching games (even non-Steam games) via Big
Picture is the only way to load game-specific profiles. I consider that to be
the main drawback: I don't play in front of a TV and I'm not really a fan of
Big Picture mode altogether. Switching between desktop Steam and Big Picture
occasionally crashes. A few times, the controller has gone non-responsive or
seems to get loaded with the wrong profile.

I understand that this thing was designed to be paired with a Steam Machine and
played on a TV. Still, I'd love it if Valve (or the community) released an
"expert" configuration tool as an straightforward desktop Windows application.
Just let me quickly assign bindings in a solid, ugly, utilitarian interface and
let me manually save & load profiles.

The awkwardness is frustrating, because configuration is the whole reason the
controller exists: I put up with the annoying UI because the result is usually
worth it. With a little tweaking, it can generate whatever inputs are needed
for any game you want to play.

@@ screenshot of big picture mode configuration

Except for the Valve button, there are 17 other buttons on the device available
to generate any combination of keyboard & mouse signals. That includes the
clicky trackpads & joystick - and I'm counting the analog triggers twice,
because you can set different inputs for both partial and full pulls.

And then, there are the trackpads: These offer a huge range of options and
tweaks. You can configure either or both as button clusters or
directional pads, triggered by touching or clicking in some
sector of the circle. And, of course, analog joysticks can be simulated in
various ways via relative motion or absolute position.
 
For pointer input, there's a mouse mode similar to a laptop trackpad, with
various acceleration and sensitivity settings. To my personal delight, there's
also a trackball mode: the pad signals momentum through haptic rumbles that
trail off after your thumb has lifted from a swipe - and it stops immediately
when your thumb returns to the pad. You can also enable scroll wheel inputs via
the raised outer edges of the trackpads, similar in feel to the old click-wheel
iPods. 

And, finally, if all the above strikes you as overwhelming, Steam offers 
publicly-shared community profiles. So, it's likely that you can find a
ready-made configuration as a starting point.

## Compatibility

In a nutshell, if it accepts mouse, keyboard, joystick, or gamepad - the Steam
Controller is compatible with it. I haven't found a game that doesn't work
with it, yet. The more pressing issue is whether the Controller is compatible
with *me* as an interface to my games.

I've had the most luck in mouse-and-keyboard games like the ponderously-paced
[Sunless Sea][] and even in the more frenetic [Diablo III][]. Of course, at
times, I lose track of the pointer in Diablo when I'm spazzing out with my
thumb and flinging it around between targets and running away to kite things.
That seems to get better as I turn down acceleration and play with
sensitivity.

I didn't have as much luck with [Laserlife][], a surreal twin-stick rhythm
game in the tradition of Rez. Ideally, I should be able to use the two
trackpads as analog sticks, but I did a lot better going back to the physical
sticks on my Xbox 360 controller. I would like to see if I can figure out
workable settings here, though, because I like a lot of twin-stick shooters.

[Rocket League][] worked out pretty well, in that I was equally terrible both
with the Steam Controller and the Xbox 360 controller. But, I had a lot of fun.

[Elite Dangerous][], offers a kind of bottomless pit of customization.
it's a work in progress translating my mouse-and-keyboard controls to a
comfortable scheme on the Controller. For example, it was kind of fun tying
throttle and roll to the motion sensors. I can't see this replacing a
super-immersive HOTAS setup, but I think I can get it to an enjoyable point.

Of course, that said, it should be noted that I'm by no means a pro gamer. I'm
the filthiest of casuals, whatever that means after playing video games avidly
for 30 years.
 
I've seen some folks describe the process a bit like
getting accustomed to a new keyboard layout like Dvorak.

## Hackability

The Controller is a USB HID composite device - in other words, It *is* a mouse
*and* a keyboard *and* a joystick *and* a gamepad, as far as USB is concerned.
When a profile is configured in Steam, it's uploaded to microcontrollers in
the device. I've gotten the sense that Steam does *something* with the
Controller input, but I'm not sure how much is pure USB input from the
controller and how much is Steam taking the place of things like [JoyToKey][]
or [AutoHotKey][] and translating things on the PC side.

As I'm starting to read up on building a custom keyboard, I'm acquainting
myself with the [Teensy line of USB development boards][teensy]. Right now,
I'm playing with the [Teensy 2.0][teensy20], which seems to be popular in the DIY
community for how easy it is to use in implementing custom USB devices.

Well, from [an iFixit teardown][teardown] and [a Reddit thread][reddit-chips],
I learned that the Steam Controller is built around the [ARM
Cortex-M0][cortex-m0]. That happens to be similar to the [ARM
Cortex-M0+][cortex-m0-plus] used in the [Teensy LC][teensylc].  And Valve has
publicly stated early on that "the Steam Controller was designed from the
ground up to be hackable"
