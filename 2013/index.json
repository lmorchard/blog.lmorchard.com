Yeah, that was the first thing that bruised my lobes. This design pattern turns everything inside out. An ECS framework is better understood as a data-oriented system than an object-oriented system. In fact, <a href=\"http://t-machine.org/index.php/2009/10/26/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmos-part-5/\">a blog post describing an ECS system in relational database terms</a> really drove it home for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"components\"><span id=\"Components\">Components</span></h2>\n<p>So, given that an <strong>Entity</strong> is an ID in a system that looks like a SQL database from a certain angle, what&#8217;s in the database?</p>\n<p><strong>Components</strong> are in the database. Specifically, <strong>Component</strong> types correspond to tables and <strong>Component</strong> instances correspond to rows. Structurally, a <strong>Component</strong> is a collection of properties &#8211; not unlike the columns in a row in a table in a database.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1145\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-27-10.14.50.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1145\" alt=\"Parsec Patrol Components\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-27-10.14.50-1024x577.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Components: OOP & ECS\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>In case it doesn&#8217;t quite make sense yet, here are some sample <strong>Components</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/parsec-patrol/blob/7d2f01eae28d8c687fb4e97a556e0c4a05a87ef4/app/scripts/components.coffee#L86\"><strong>Sprite</strong></a> &#8211; <em>width, height, shape</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/parsec-patrol/blob/7d2f01eae28d8c687fb4e97a556e0c4a05a87ef4/app/scripts/components.coffee#L26\"><strong>Position</strong></a> &#8211; <em>x, y, rotation</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/parsec-patrol/blob/7d2f01eae28d8c687fb4e97a556e0c4a05a87ef4/app/scripts/components.coffee#L33\"><strong>Motion</strong></a> &#8211; <em>dx, dy, drotation</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/parsec-patrol/blob/7d2f01eae28d8c687fb4e97a556e0c4a05a87ef4/app/scripts/components.coffee#L40\"><strong>Thruster</strong></a> &#8211; <em>accel_per_second, max_speed</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/parsec-patrol/blob/7d2f01eae28d8c687fb4e97a556e0c4a05a87ef4/app/scripts/components.coffee#L110\"><strong>Seeker</strong></a> &#8211; <em>target_entity_id, rotation_per_second</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/parsec-patrol/blob/7d2f01eae28d8c687fb4e97a556e0c4a05a87ef4/app/scripts/components.coffee#L201\"><strong>Health</strong></a> &#8211; <em>max_health, current_health</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/parsec-patrol/blob/7d2f01eae28d8c687fb4e97a556e0c4a05a87ef4/app/scripts/components.coffee#L201\"><strong>BeamWeapon</strong></a> &#8211; <em>max_power, current_power, recharge_per_second</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/parsec-patrol/blob/7d2f01eae28d8c687fb4e97a556e0c4a05a87ef4/app/scripts/components.coffee#L137\"><strong>MissileWeapon</strong></a> &#8211; <em>number_turrets, reload_delay</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Imagine each of those as schema for database tables, each with the <strong>Entity</strong> ID as primary key. Given an <strong>Entity</strong> ID, you can query across all the tables and assemble a set of <strong>Components</strong> that completely describe an <strong>Entity</strong> in the game universe.</p>\n<p>Note that any given <strong>Entity</strong> can be composed of any combination of these <strong>Components</strong>: A spaceship might be described by <strong>Shape</strong>, <strong>Position</strong>, <strong>Motion</strong>, <strong>Thruster</strong>, <strong>Health</strong>, and <strong>BeamWeapon</strong>. Meanwhile, an asteroid drifting in space might only offer <strong>Shape</strong>, <strong>Position</strong>, and <strong>Motion</strong>.</p>\n<p>(Also, just to be pedantic: This doesn&#8217;t <em>really</em> have to live in a SQL database. In fact, I currently just use an ad-hoc in-memory key-value store &#8211; i.e. <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/parsec-patrol/blob/7d2f01eae28d8c687fb4e97a556e0c4a05a87ef4/app/scripts/entities.coffee#L9\">a set of heavily-abused JavaScript objects</a>.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"systems\"><span id=\"Systems\">Systems</span></h2>\n<p>So, where&#8217;s the stuff that makes things go? In an OOP design, this would live in the methods of the objects, bundled by classes to go alongside the data. In the ECS design, <strong>Entities</strong> are <em>just</em> IDs and <strong>Components</strong> are <em>just</em> data &#8211; neither methods nor code implementing game logic live in either of those artifacts.</p>\n<p>This is where <strong>Systems</strong> come in: <strong>Systems</strong> are modular mini-game loops. The <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/parsec-patrol/blob/master/app/scripts/worlds.coffee#L62\">&#8220;master&#8221; game loop</a> holds a list of available systems and runs a <code>tick()</code> method on each of those in turn. Each <strong>System</strong> performs a query against the <strong>Component</strong> database &#8211; usually for all instances of a particular type &#8211; and crunches through updating the properties for each.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1146\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-27-10.47.11.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1146\" alt=\"Systems: Most confusing diagram ever?\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-27-10.47.11-1024x577.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Systems: Most confusing diagram ever?\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Consider a <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/parsec-patrol/blob/7d2f01eae28d8c687fb4e97a556e0c4a05a87ef4/app/scripts/systems.coffee#L793\"><strong>MotionSystem</strong></a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fetch all the <strong>Motion</strong> components from the database</li>\n<li>For each <strong>Motion</strong>, look up a <strong>Position</strong> for the same <strong>Entity</strong>.</li>\n<li>Update the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>rotation</code> properties of the <strong>Position</strong> using the <strong>Motion</strong> properties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider a <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/parsec-patrol/blob/7d2f01eae28d8c687fb4e97a556e0c4a05a87ef4/app/scripts/systems.coffee#L1136\"><strong>SeekerSystem</strong></a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fetch all the <strong>Seeker</strong> components.</li>\n<li>For each, find the <strong>Motion</strong> and <strong>Position</strong> components for the corresponding <strong>Entity</strong>.</li>\n<li>Also find <strong>Motion</strong> &amp; <strong>Position</strong> for the <strong>Entity</strong> identified as the <code>target_entity_id</code>.</li>\n<li>Calculate the angle between seeker &amp; target, update <strong>Motion</strong> to steer toward the target.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notice that each system deals only with data directly relevant to the job at hand. Rather than loading up a full representation of an <strong>Entity</strong>, each <strong>System</strong> only touches the specific <strong>Components</strong> needed. For instance, <strong>MotionSystem</strong> and <strong>SeekerSystem</strong> touch <strong>Motion</strong> and <strong>Position</strong> - but never <strong>Shape Components</strong>.</p>\n<p>This adds some efficiencies for data stored entirely in memory. But, I expect this will have <em>huge</em> implications for data that might someday come from a database or over a network. I&#8217;m also thinking that this pattern lends well to shuffling certain systems off onto background threads or Web Workers &#8211; the need for data coordination is limited to just the relevant <strong>Components</strong> when needed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"putting-it-together\"><span id=\"Putting_it_together\">Putting it together</span></h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_1149\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://lmorchard.github.io/parsec-patrol/sketches/sprites.html\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1149 \" alt=\"Parsec Patrol Dancing Sprites\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot-2013-11-27-11.16.42-1024x714.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"446\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Parade!

And, if a particular <strong>Component</strong> is not actually used by any existing <strong>Entity</strong>, the <strong>System</strong> looking for it just won&#8217;t perform any work.</p>\n<p>For the most part, <strong>Systems</strong> act independently &amp; are very loosely coupled. They can cooperate through shared <strong>Component</strong> data &#8211; consider how the <strong>SeekerSystem</strong> modifies the <strong>Motion</strong> <strong>Component</strong>, and the <strong>MotionSystem</strong> uses that data to move the <strong>Position</strong> <strong>Component</strong>. I&#8217;m also playing with <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/parsec-patrol/blob/7d2f01eae28d8c687fb4e97a556e0c4a05a87ef4/app/scripts/worlds.coffee#L38\">a crude pub/sub messaging system</a> for things like <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/parsec-patrol/blob/7d2f01eae28d8c687fb4e97a556e0c4a05a87ef4/app/scripts/systems.coffee#L1583\">transmitting damage</a> from one <strong>Entity</strong> to another, but I suspect that might be the wrong approach.</p>\n<p>And, once I was freed from my tangled class hierarchy, things started to get fun. The mental cost for adding a new layer to the system dropped fast: Add a new <strong>Component</strong> or two, add a new <strong>System</strong> &#8211; and suddenly <strong>Entities</strong> can do new things!</p>\n<h2 id=\"having-fun-with-it\"><span id=\"Having_fun_with_it\">Having fun with it</span></h2>\n<p>And, the most fun part?

Yeah, that was the first thing that bruised my lobes. This design pattern turns everything inside out. An ECS framework is better understood as a data-oriented system than an object-oriented system. In fact, [a blog post describing an ECS system in relational database terms][12] really drove it home for me.\n\n## <span id=\"Components\">Components</span>\n\nSo, given that an **Entity** is an ID in a system that looks like a SQL database from a certain angle, what&#8217;s in the database?\n\n**Components** are in the database. Specifically, **Component** types correspond to tables and **Component** instances correspond to rows. Structurally, a **Component** is a collection of properties &#8211; not unlike the columns in a row in a table in a database.\n\n<div id=\"attachment_1145\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-27-10.14.50.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1145\" alt=\"Parsec Patrol Components\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-27-10.14.50-1024x577.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Components: OOP & ECS\n  </p>\n</div>\n\nIn case it doesn&#8217;t quite make sense yet, here are some sample **Components**:\n\n*   [**Sprite**][13] &#8211; *width, height, shape*\n*   [**Position**][14] &#8211; *x, y, rotation*\n*   [**Motion**][15] &#8211; *dx, dy, drotation*\n*   [**Thruster**][16] &#8211; *accel\\_per\\_second, max_speed*\n*   [**Seeker**][17] &#8211; *target\\_entity\\_id, rotation\\_per\\_second*\n*   [**Health**][18] &#8211; *max\\_health, current\\_health*\n*   [**BeamWeapon**][18] &#8211; *max\\_power, current\\_power, recharge\\_per\\_second*\n*   [**MissileWeapon**][19] &#8211; *number\\_turrets, reload\\_delay*\n\nImagine each of those as schema for database tables, each with the **Entity** ID as primary key. Given an **Entity** ID, you can query across all the tables and assemble a set of **Components** that completely describe an **Entity** in the game universe.\n\nNote that any given **Entity** can be composed of any combination of these **Components**: A spaceship might be described by **Shape**, **Position**, **Motion**, **Thruster**, **Health**, and **BeamWeapon**. Meanwhile, an asteroid drifting in space might only offer **Shape**, **Position**, and **Motion**.\n\n(Also, just to be pedantic: This doesn&#8217;t *really* have to live in a SQL database. In fact, I currently just use an ad-hoc in-memory key-value store &#8211; i.e. [a set of heavily-abused JavaScript objects][20].)\n\n## <span id=\"Systems\">Systems</span>\n\nSo, where&#8217;s the stuff that makes things go? In an OOP design, this would live in the methods of the objects, bundled by classes to go alongside the data. In the ECS design, **Entities** are *just* IDs and **Components** are *just* data &#8211; neither methods nor code implementing game logic live in either of those artifacts.\n\nThis is where **Systems** come in: **Systems** are modular mini-game loops. The [&#8220;master&#8221; game loop][21] holds a list of available systems and runs a `tick()` method on each of those in turn. Each **System** performs a query against the **Component** database &#8211; usually for all instances of a particular type &#8211; and crunches through updating the properties for each.\n\n<div id=\"attachment_1146\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-27-10.47.11.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1146\" alt=\"Systems: Most confusing diagram ever?\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-27-10.47.11-1024x577.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Systems: Most confusing diagram ever?\n  </p>\n</div>\n\nConsider a [**MotionSystem**][22]:\n\n*   Fetch all the **Motion** components from the database\n*   For each **Motion**, look up a **Position** for the same **Entity**.\n*   Update the `x`, `y`, and `rotation` properties of the **Position** using the **Motion** properties.\n\nConsider a [**SeekerSystem**][23]:\n\n*   Fetch all the **Seeker** components.\n*   For each, find the **Motion** and **Position** components for the corresponding **Entity**.\n*   Also find **Motion** & **Position** for the **Entity** identified as the `target_entity_id`.\n*   Calculate the angle between seeker & target, update **Motion** to steer toward the target.\n\nNotice that each system deals only with data directly relevant to the job at hand. Rather than loading up a full representation of an **Entity**, each **System** only touches the specific **Components** needed. For instance, **MotionSystem** and **SeekerSystem** touch **Motion** and **Position** - but never **Shape Components**.\n\nThis adds some efficiencies for data stored entirely in memory. But, I expect this will have *huge* implications for data that might someday come from a database or over a network. I&#8217;m also thinking that this pattern lends well to shuffling certain systems off onto background threads or Web Workers &#8211; the need for data coordination is limited to just the relevant **Components** when needed.\n\n## <span id=\"Putting_it_together\">Putting it together</span>\n\n<div id=\"attachment_1149\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://lmorchard.github.io/parsec-patrol/sketches/sprites.html\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1149 \" alt=\"Parsec Patrol Dancing Sprites\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot-2013-11-27-11.16.42-1024x714.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"446\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Parade! Of! Sprites!\n  </p>\n</div>\n\nThese **Systems** feel a lot like [particle systems][24]: Tight, focused code working close to the metal with data, skipping a lot of overhead and object juggling. **Components** get modified in place and are rarely discarded &#8211; that seems to save me from a lot of [garbage collection issues][25]. And, if a particular **Component** is not actually used by any existing **Entity**, the **System** looking for it just won&#8217;t perform any work.\n\nFor the most part, **Systems** act independently & are very loosely coupled. They can cooperate through shared **Component** data &#8211; consider how the **SeekerSystem** modifies the **Motion** **Component**, and the **MotionSystem** uses that data to move the **Position** **Component**. I&#8217;m also playing with [a crude pub/sub messaging system][26] for things like [transmitting damage][27] from one **Entity** to another, but I suspect that might be the wrong approach.\n\nAnd, once I was freed from my tangled class hierarchy, things started to get fun. The mental cost for adding a new layer to the system dropped fast: Add a new **Component** or two, add a new **System** &#8211; and suddenly **Entities** can do new things!\n\n## <span id=\"Having_fun_with_it\">Having fun with it</span>\n\nAnd, the most fun part? I get to describe things in the game world like a five-year-old and not give a crap about serious programming stuff:\n\n<div id=\"attachment_1148\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-27-11.06.12.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1148\" alt=\"Spaceship doodles\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-27-11.06.12-1024x577.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Spaceship doodles\n  </p>\n</div>\n\nI&#8217;ve got [a bad guy space ship][28]! And it&#8217;s [shaped like an arrow][29]! And it&#8217;s got [rocket thrusters][30]! And it [chases the good guy][30]! And it has [missile launchers][31]! And [it blows up when the hero shoots it a lot][32]!\n\nOh, and I&#8217;ve got [a good guy ship][33]! And it&#8217;s [shaped like a cool thing different than an arrow][34]! And it&#8217;s also got [rocket thrusters][30]! And [it goes where you click][35]! And [it has lots of laser beam guns][36]!\n\nOh, and [there are rocks][37]! They kind of spin a bit and drift around! They [bounce when they run into things][38]! Sometimes [they blow up][39]!\n\nThat&#8217;s almost exactly the running dialog in my head when I write the code.

But, those channels are <em>about</em> you and me, we&#8217;re the objects of interest &amp; the stars of the show.

But, one of the things I really would like to see as a <em>thing</em> out there is <strong><em>distributed social novelty filtering</em></strong>. How do you do that? Well, the first half of it is pretty simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In feed readers, implement a one-click &#8220;share&#8221; button on every item. Maybe offer an optional field for comment.</li>\n<li>Offer a public feed of every &#8220;shared&#8221; item, easily discoverable from a public profile.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, my installation of TT-RSS offers <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/tt-rss/public.php?op=rss&amp;id=-2&amp;key=6fa5a3a996809d4df9a357bd7c62efc464c8d147\">a feed of my &#8220;shared&#8221; items</a>—albeit not in a very discoverable way. I also funnel craptons of material into <a href=\"http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:deusx/\">my pinboard.in feed</a>, but mainly for personal archiving and search. Even Pinterest has <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/lmorchard/feed.rss\">a feed for me</a>, though I barely use it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://links.scripting.com/rss.xml\">Dave Winer</a> and <a href=\"http://waxy.org/links/index.xml\">Andy Baio</a> maintain linkblogs with feeds—those fit nicely into this scheme, and I follow them both in my reader.</p>\n<p>The other half is where some innovation could stand to happen: The obvious thing is to just get yourself a new RSS reader and subscribe to all the shared-item feeds of your &#8220;friends&#8221;.</p>\n<p>But, there&#8217;s a lot more to be done here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>discover and follow &#8220;friends&#8221; across services,</li>\n<li>de-duplicate shared items by URL,</li>\n<li>rank items by counting shares,</li>\n<li>construct discussion threads from shares</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Go nuts, please! Someone form a startup and take my money to solve this, so I don&#8217;t have to. Even better, release some open source so I can host it myself and maybe even contribute some code. I&#8217;m thinking about doing some of this, but my lack of sustained attention span for projects is <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">well documented</a>.</p>\n<p>But, the important thing here is that it&#8217;s <strong><em>distributed</em></strong> and a <em>thing</em> that&#8217;s conventionally done out there on the web. This shouldn&#8217;t be constrained to a single vendor&#8217;s silo ever again, because that allowed a single vendor to kill it dead and I miss it terribly.</p>\n",

Even Pinterest has [a feed for me][6], though I barely use it.\r\n\r\n[Dave Winer][7] and [Andy Baio][8] maintain linkblogs with feeds—those fit nicely into this scheme, and I follow them both in my reader.\r\n\r\nThe other half is where some innovation could stand to happen: The obvious thing is to just get yourself a new RSS reader and subscribe to all the shared-item feeds of your &#8220;friends&#8221;.\r\n\r\nBut, there&#8217;s a lot more to be done here:\r\n\r\n*   discover and follow &#8220;friends&#8221; across services,\r\n*   de-duplicate shared items by URL,\r\n*   rank items by counting shares,\r\n*   construct discussion threads from shares\r\n\r\nGo nuts, please! Someone form a startup and take my money to solve this, so I don&#8217;t have to. Even better, release some open source so I can host it myself and maybe even contribute some code. I&#8217;m thinking about doing some of this, but my lack of sustained attention span for projects is [well documented][9].\r\n\r\nBut, the important thing here is that it&#8217;s ***distributed*** and a *thing* that&#8217;s conventionally done out there on the web. This shouldn&#8217;t be constrained to a single vendor&#8217;s silo ever again, because that allowed a single vendor to kill it dead and I miss it terribly.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://pinterest.com/\r\n [2]: http://tumblr.com/\r\n [3]: http://www.buzzfeed.com/robf4/googles-lost-social-network\r\n [4]: http://decafbad.com/tt-rss/public.php?op=rss&id=-2&key=6fa5a3a996809d4df9a357bd7c62efc464c8d147\r\n [5]: http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:deusx/\r\n [6]: http://pinterest.com/lmorchard/feed.rss\r\n [7]: http://links.scripting.com/rss.xml\r\n [8]: http://waxy.org/links/index.xml\r\n [9]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast",

I&#8217;m pretty sure very few people outside of the core team at the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla Developer Network\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla Developer Network</a> even know what <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript\">KumaScript</a> is. So, I guess it&#8217;s about time I do something about that.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<h3 id=\"necessity-is-the-mother-of-invention\"><span id=\"Necessity_is_the_Mother_of_Invention\">Necessity is the Mother of Invention</span></h3>\n<p>The major focus of my workaday (and workanight) life last summer was the relaunch of the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla Developer Network\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla Developer Network</a> wiki.</p>\n<p>It had been close to 18 months in the making, which usually spells <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/17/on-the-other-end-of-a-self-imposed-death-march-project\">death march</a> and disaster. But, against many expectations, we did finally arrive at something for launch that neither fell over in flames immediately nor jettisoned a significant number of features with respect to what it was replacing. I think this is the first time in my career something like this went off with as few hitches as it did.</p>\n<p>Your first questions might go something along the lines of, &#8220;18 months? For a <em>wiki</em>? Are you insane or just incompetent?&#8221; Well, it might help to note a few additional details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We call it a wiki, but it&#8217;s really more of a content management system that anyone can edit. It supports translation from English to 34 other languages, tracks revisions &amp; content hierarchies, accepts file attachments, and sings &amp; dances in a variety of other annoying-to-implement ways.</li>\n<li>At the time of switchover, we had over 50,000 documents to migrate with care from the old system to the new one. That body of content represents years of work, a non-trivial hunk of cruft and spam, and tickles a maddening array of edge cases.<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\nThe wiki we replaced—i.e. <a href=\"http://www.mindtouch.com/\">MindTouch</a>—supports server-side scripting in content with a language based on Lua—i.e. <a href=\"http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/DekiScript\">DekiScript</a>.\n</li>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of the above points represents its own special mix of horror and challenge, and I took on the bulk of the last two. That caused me a lot of stress, and <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/17/on-the-other-end-of-a-self-imposed-death-march-project\">I blogged a bit about that</a>.</p>\n<p>This blog post, however, focuses on that last point: <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript\">KumaScript</a> was built by backing into a semi-compatible replacement for <a href=\"http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/DekiScript\">DekiScript</a>. That&#8217;s pretty much the worst way to go about building something, but it seems to have worked.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-does-it-look-like\"><span id=\"What_Does_It_Look_Like\">What Does It Look Like?</span></h3>\n<p>First, you might want to check out <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript\">&#8220;Introduction to KumaScript&#8221; on MDN</a>. It&#8217;s the best work in progress describing the ins-and-outs of the service. But for the sake of this blog post, consider <a href=\"https://developer-new.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/KumaTests/hello_test?raw=1\">this wiki document</a>:</p>\n<pre>Here are three hellos:\n{{ hello('3') }}</pre>\n\n<p>Now, consider <a href=\"https://developer-new.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Template:hello\">this KumaScript template</a>, named <code>Template:hello</code>:</p>\n<pre>&lt;% for (var i = 0; i &lt; $0; i++) { %&gt;\nHello #&lt;%= i %&gt;\n&lt;% } %&gt;</pre>\n\n<p>Put the two of these together, and you get <a href=\"https://developer-new.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/KumaTests/hello_test\">this output</a>:</p>\n<pre>Here are three hellos:\nHello #0\nHello #1\nHello #2</pre>\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> consists mainly of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript#Template_Syntax\">Templates implemented using Embedded JavaScript Templates</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript#Macro_Syntax\">Macros in wiki content that call templates with parameters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript#Creating_modules\">Common JS inspired modules for reusable code used by templates</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This quick introduction glosses over interesting things you can do with <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a>—e.g. accessing data from external sources via HTTP, fetching content from other documents (also via HTTP). But, again, you can dive deeper by reading <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript\">&#8220;Introduction to Kumascript&#8221; on MDN</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scripting-in-wikis\"><span id=\"Scripting_in_Wikis\">Scripting in Wikis</span></h3>\n<p>Why would one would even build such a thing as <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a>? As it turns out, programmatically generating content is quite handy for composing documentation. Here are a few use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Localized macros for often-repeated constructs such as <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Template:Warning\">warnings</a>, notes, tips, &amp; callouts.</li>\n<li>Conditional content based on variables such as product, locale, &amp; standards status.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion\">Transclusion</a> of content, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL/button\">building documents from documents</a>. (Try viewing <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL/button?raw\">the raw source</a> of that page.)</li>\n<li>Mashups of data from <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> itself and from other sites and services like Bugzilla and Github. For example, here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Changelog\">a self-updating Changelog of our code deployments on MDN</a>. And, here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Template:KumaGithubChanges\">the template behind that page</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth pointing out that is different from scripting mixed with <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML</a> like you get from ASP or PHP: There, you can process forms, personalize responses, and generally build web applications.</p>\n<p>In the world of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a>, content scripting is a heavily cached thing and not tied to the current HTTP request. It mostly runs only when the document itself is edited, but can also be executed when we think dependencies or external data sources have changed.</p>\n<p>In fact, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> code doesn&#8217;t even have access to the incoming visitor&#8217;s request data at all—i.e. username, cookies, referrer header, et al—and instead we operate mainly on the content and metadata of documents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-javascript\"><span id=\"Why_JavaScript\">Why JavaScript?</span></h3>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, <a href=\"http://www.mindtouch.com/\">MindTouch</a> provides for scripted content by way of the Lua-based <a href=\"http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/DekiScript\">DekiScript</a>. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that the Wikimedia Foundation is working on <a href=\"http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Lua_scripting\">a Lua-based scripting system for MediaWiki and Wikipedia</a>. So, scripted content in a wiki isn&#8217;t an entirely crazy idea, in and of itself.</p>\n<p>As for Lua, I think it&#8217;s a nice little language. It&#8217;s used in World of Warcraft and many other games. It&#8217;s known for being easily embedded into applications to grant scriptability. I can totally see why one would reach for it.</p>\n<p>But, at <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a>, we&#8217;re all about the web. The lingua franca of programming on the web is <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a>. And, it doesn&#8217;t hurt that <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> already has a huge body of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a> documentation.</p>\n<p>So, as far as harmonious language choices go, I can&#8217;t think of a better one for scripting content on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> than <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"boring-lets-me-sleep-at-night\"><span id=\"Boring_Lets_Me_Sleep_at_Night\">Boring Lets Me Sleep at Night</span></h3>\n<p>There are some exciting things about embedding a Lua interpreter into a wiki platform, as MindTouch and MediaWiki have done. Even having chosen <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a> over Lua, I could have tried embedding a <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> interpreter like <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/v8/\">V8</a> or <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SpiderMonkey\">SpiderMonkey</a> into Python.</p>\n<p>However, because I like to sleep at night and am not particularly clever about embedding languages within languages (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5099043/embedding-a-low-performance-scripting-language-in-python#comment5715808_5099043\">yo dawg</a>), I want nothing to do with this brand of excitement. Consider me <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle\">a Hobbit</a> among developers.</p>\n<p>So, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> is a standalone <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a> web service. That is, everything going into and coming out of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> happens over HTTP. I understand HTTP a whole lot more than embedding language interpreters.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: Node.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a> is an exciting piece of exotic matter in its own right. But, someone more clever than me maintains Node.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a>. And, I&#8217;m betting most of my co-workers and potential project contributors understand <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a>, Node.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a>, and HTTP much better than embedding languages in other languages.</p>\n<p>In fact, besides my overwrought glue code, <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript/blob/master/package.json#L22\">KumaScript consists mainly of modules written &amp; maintained by other people more clever than me</a>. That&#8217;s even less work for me. One of the few things I like as much as sleeping at night is when other people fix bugs and build things for me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"http-all-the-things\"><span id=\"HTTP_ALL_the_Things\">HTTP ALL the Things</span></h3>\n<p>I really like HTTP. I&#8217;ve spent a good chunk of my adult life learning to understand it—so by this point it might be Stockholm Syndrome, but I think it embeds a lot of cleverness and useful decisions.</p>\n<p>HTTP gives you interesting system boundaries. You can cache, scale, and abstract using intermediaries. There are nice identifiers (ie. URLs), status codes, and a rich arsenal of means to transport data and metadata (ie. methods, headers, and content types).</p>\n<p>Having made <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> an HTTP service also means that someone other than <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> could use it.

DekiScript seems to allow for this. But, we never really used it that way on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a>.</p>\n<p>Instead, what we have is a system of templates and macros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Templates contain the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a> code in the form of <a href=\"https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs\">Embedded JavaScript Templates</a>. At present, these can be authored only by a core of trusted <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> editors.</li>\n<li>Macros call templates with parameters and dump the results of execution into the document. These can be used by anyone, and have <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript/blob/master/lib/kumascript/parser.pegjs\">a very constrained syntax</a>.</li>\n<li>The content resulting from macro evaluation <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bleach\">is sanitized</a> such that it&#8217;s subject to the same constraints as hand-written markup.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> has no access to a user&#8217;s request data, we&#8217;re decently firewalled in terms of privacy and abusing the visitor. And, since <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bleach\">the markup is filtered</a>, it&#8217;s difficult to inject nasty XSS exploits and the like.</p>\n<p>So, when I say security and safety, I&#8217;m thinking mainly about our servers: We want to sandbox this server-side <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> such that it can&#8217;t abuse CPU, memory, or network resources. At present, my approach to this is anemic: Restrict code authoring to trusted people, and impose impatient timeouts on macro execution.</p>\n<p>I have thoughts about improving this situation in the future, and hopefully expanding the ability to author <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> templates.

You can stick it behind a load balancer. Scale it horizontally by throwing more CPUs and processes at the problem. Cache the hell out of the responses. Throw a proxy in front of it to cache the hell out of outgoing requests to external services. Again, this is meant to be as boring as I can make it.</p>\n<p>And, if a <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> process should happen to misbehave or starts having a seizure, just kill it and start another one.

Currently, if any one thing misbehaves in the document, the whole process gets aborted. Maybe instead, I should <a href=\"https://github.com/lloyd/node-compute-cluster\">spin up a pool of processes</a>: Each them can take care of executing a single macro, while a master process watches for CPU / RAM / network abuse and kills anything that behaves badly.</li>\n<li>Reconsider my possibly brain-dead approach to parsing source documents for macros using a PEG.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a> grammar.

I&#8217;m pretty sure very few people outside of the core team at the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla Developer Network\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla Developer Network</a> even know what [KumaScript][1] is. So, I guess it&#8217;s about time I do something about that.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n### <span id=\"Necessity_is_the_Mother_of_Invention\">Necessity is the Mother of Invention</span>\n\nThe major focus of my workaday (and workanight) life last summer was the relaunch of the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla Developer Network\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla Developer Network</a> wiki.\n\nIt had been close to 18 months in the making, which usually spells [death march][3] and disaster. But, against many expectations, we did finally arrive at something for launch that neither fell over in flames immediately nor jettisoned a significant number of features with respect to what it was replacing. I think this is the first time in my career something like this went off with as few hitches as it did.\n\nYour first questions might go something along the lines of, &#8220;18 months? For a *wiki*? Are you insane or just incompetent?&#8221; Well, it might help to note a few additional details:\n\n*   We call it a wiki, but it&#8217;s really more of a content management system that anyone can edit. It supports translation from English to 34 other languages, tracks revisions & content hierarchies, accepts file attachments, and sings & dances in a variety of other annoying-to-implement ways.\n*   At the time of switchover, we had over 50,000 documents to migrate with care from the old system to the new one. That body of content represents years of work, a non-trivial hunk of cruft and spam, and tickles a maddening array of edge cases.\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  The wiki we replaced—i.e. <a href=\"http://www.mindtouch.com/\">MindTouch</a>—supports server-side scripting in content with a language based on Lua—i.e. <a href=\"http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/DekiScript\">DekiScript</a>.\n</li>\n\nEach of the above points represents its own special mix of horror and challenge, and I took on the bulk of the last two. That caused me a lot of stress, and [I blogged a bit about that][3].\n\nThis blog post, however, focuses on that last point: [KumaScript][1] was built by backing into a semi-compatible replacement for [DekiScript][4]. That&#8217;s pretty much the worst way to go about building something, but it seems to have worked.\n\n### <span id=\"What_Does_It_Look_Like\">What Does It Look Like?</span>\n\nFirst, you might want to check out [&#8220;Introduction to KumaScript&#8221; on MDN][5]. It&#8217;s the best work in progress describing the ins-and-outs of the service. But for the sake of this blog post, consider [this wiki document][6]:\n\n<pre>Here are three hellos:\r\n{{ hello('3') }}</pre>\n\nNow, consider [this KumaScript template][7], named `Template:hello`:\n\n<pre>&lt;% for (var i = 0; i &lt; $0; i++) { %&gt;\r\nHello #&lt;%= i %&gt;\r\n&lt;% } %&gt;</pre>\n\nPut the two of these together, and you get [this output][8]:\n\n<pre>Here are three hellos:\r\nHello #0\r\nHello #1\r\nHello #2</pre>\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> consists mainly of the following:\n\n*   [Templates implemented using Embedded JavaScript Templates][9]\n*   [Macros in wiki content that call templates with parameters][10]\n*   [Common JS inspired modules for reusable code used by templates][11]\n\nThis quick introduction glosses over interesting things you can do with <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a>—e.g. accessing data from external sources via HTTP, fetching content from other documents (also via HTTP). But, again, you can dive deeper by reading [&#8220;Introduction to Kumascript&#8221; on MDN][5].\n\n### <span id=\"Scripting_in_Wikis\">Scripting in Wikis</span>\n\nWhy would one would even build such a thing as <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a>? As it turns out, programmatically generating content is quite handy for composing documentation. Here are a few use cases:\n\n*   Localized macros for often-repeated constructs such as [warnings][12], notes, tips, & callouts.\n*   Conditional content based on variables such as product, locale, & standards status.\n*   [Transclusion][13] of content, [building documents from documents][14]. (Try viewing [the raw source][15] of that page.)\n*   Mashups of data from <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> itself and from other sites and services like Bugzilla and Github. For example, here&#8217;s [a self-updating Changelog of our code deployments on MDN][16]. And, here&#8217;s [the template behind that page][17].\n\nIt&#8217;s also worth pointing out that is different from scripting mixed with <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML</a> like you get from ASP or PHP: There, you can process forms, personalize responses, and generally build web applications.\n\nIn the world of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a>, content scripting is a heavily cached thing and not tied to the current HTTP request. It mostly runs only when the document itself is edited, but can also be executed when we think dependencies or external data sources have changed.\n\nIn fact, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> code doesn&#8217;t even have access to the incoming visitor&#8217;s request data at all—i.e. username, cookies, referrer header, et al—and instead we operate mainly on the content and metadata of documents.\n\n### <span id=\"Why_JavaScript\">Why JavaScript?</span>\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, [MindTouch][18] provides for scripted content by way of the Lua-based [DekiScript][4]. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that the Wikimedia Foundation is working on [a Lua-based scripting system for MediaWiki and Wikipedia][19]. So, scripted content in a wiki isn&#8217;t an entirely crazy idea, in and of itself.\n\nAs for Lua, I think it&#8217;s a nice little language. It&#8217;s used in World of Warcraft and many other games. It&#8217;s known for being easily embedded into applications to grant scriptability. I can totally see why one would reach for it.\n\nBut, at <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a>, we&#8217;re all about the web. The lingua franca of programming on the web is <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a>. And, it doesn&#8217;t hurt that <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> already has a huge body of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a> documentation.\n\nSo, as far as harmonious language choices go, I can&#8217;t think of a better one for scripting content on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> than <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a>.\n\n### <span id=\"Boring_Lets_Me_Sleep_at_Night\">Boring Lets Me Sleep at Night</span>\n\nThere are some exciting things about embedding a Lua interpreter into a wiki platform, as MindTouch and MediaWiki have done. Even having chosen <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a> over Lua, I could have tried embedding a <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> interpreter like [V8][20] or [SpiderMonkey][21] into Python.\n\nHowever, because I like to sleep at night and am not particularly clever about embedding languages within languages ([yo dawg][22]), I want nothing to do with this brand of excitement. Consider me [a Hobbit][23] among developers.\n\nSo, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> is a standalone [Node.js][24] web service. That is, everything going into and coming out of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> happens over HTTP. I understand HTTP a whole lot more than embedding language interpreters.\n\nDon&#8217;t get me wrong: Node.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a> is an exciting piece of exotic matter in its own right. But, someone more clever than me maintains Node.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a>. And, I&#8217;m betting most of my co-workers and potential project contributors understand <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a>, Node.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a>, and HTTP much better than embedding languages in other languages.\n\nIn fact, besides my overwrought glue code, [KumaScript consists mainly of modules written & maintained by other people more clever than me][25]. That&#8217;s even less work for me. One of the few things I like as much as sleeping at night is when other people fix bugs and build things for me.\n\n### <span id=\"HTTP_ALL_the_Things\">HTTP ALL the Things</span>\n\nI really like HTTP. I&#8217;ve spent a good chunk of my adult life learning to understand it—so by this point it might be Stockholm Syndrome, but I think it embeds a lot of cleverness and useful decisions.\n\nHTTP gives you interesting system boundaries. You can cache, scale, and abstract using intermediaries. There are nice identifiers (ie. URLs), status codes, and a rich arsenal of means to transport data and metadata (ie. methods, headers, and content types).\n\nHaving made <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> an HTTP service also means that someone other than <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> could use it. The interface was not built specifically for <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a>, it&#8217;s neither dependent on Python nor Django. Fire up the processes and try running your web content through it—could be a wiki, could be a pile of static <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML</a>. There is, of course, slightly more to it than that—but not much.\n\nIn fact, I really *do* hope someday someone beyond <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> tries using <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a>.\n\n### <span id=\"Turtles_All_the_Way_Down\">Turtles All the Way Down</span>\n\nSo, the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> wiki—[named Kuma][26], which means [&#8220;bear&#8221; in Japanese][27]—talks to <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> via HTTP. And, in turn, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> talks to the wiki with HTTP.\n\nIn fact, although the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> service itself is hidden behind a firewall, [the wiki API used by KumaScript is open to the public][28]. What&#8217;s good for the goose is good for the gander, after all.\n\nThe typical document rendering process goes something like this:\n\n1.  <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kuma\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Getting_started_with_Kuma?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Kuma</a> makes a GET request to <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> with the URL of a wiki document.\n2.  <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> makes a GET request to <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kuma\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Getting_started_with_Kuma?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Kuma</a> for the raw source of the wiki document.\n3.  <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> parses the source, looking for macros & inventorying templates.\n4.  <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> makes a GET request to <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kuma\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Getting_started_with_Kuma?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Kuma</a> for the source of each template needed.\n5.  <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> evaluates the macros by executing templates with the given parameters. This may kick off additional GET requests as needed by templates to load modules.\n6.  <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> responds to the initial request from <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kuma\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Getting_started_with_Kuma?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Kuma</a> with the results of macro evaluation in the document.\n\nIt&#8217;s <del>turtles</del> HTTP GET, [all the way down][29]. Well, except for when we want to do a preview before saving: In that case it&#8217;s an HTTP POST which kicks everything off at step #3, with raw source in the request body.\n\nAnd though this might look like a Rube Goldberg machine, there are some nice qualities to all this HTTP GET traffic:\n\n*   Each GET is susceptible to caching, via the usual headers and semantics.\n*   Each GET can be serviced by a different process on a different machine.\n\nI&#8217;m sure I could come up with more items after I have lunch, but this is just HTTP.\n\nContent flows through request and response bodies. And—though this part might be a bit of a hack—I encode document context, errors, and messages using custom HTTP headers as a side-channel [using the FireLogger protocol][30] as an inspiration.\n\n### <span id=\"Security_Safety\">Security & Safety</span>\n\nSomething I could have done with <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> was to simply allow wiki authors to drop hunks of executable code into the middle of documents. DekiScript seems to allow for this. But, we never really used it that way on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a>.\n\nInstead, what we have is a system of templates and macros:\n\n*   Templates contain the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JavaScript</a> code in the form of [Embedded JavaScript Templates][31]. At present, these can be authored only by a core of trusted <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> editors.\n*   Macros call templates with parameters and dump the results of execution into the document. These can be used by anyone, and have [a very constrained syntax][32].\n*   The content resulting from macro evaluation [is sanitized][33] such that it&#8217;s subject to the same constraints as hand-written markup.\n\nSince <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> has no access to a user&#8217;s request data, we&#8217;re decently firewalled in terms of privacy and abusing the visitor. And, since [the markup is filtered][33], it&#8217;s difficult to inject nasty XSS exploits and the like.\n\nSo, when I say security and safety, I&#8217;m thinking mainly about our servers: We want to sandbox this server-side <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> such that it can&#8217;t abuse CPU, memory, or network resources. At present, my approach to this is anemic: Restrict code authoring to trusted people, and impose impatient timeouts on macro execution.\n\nI have thoughts about improving this situation in the future, and hopefully expanding the ability to author <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> templates. Because, remember, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a> is a wiki—anyone and everyone can edit it. I&#8217;d like that to include the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> code, if at all possible to do with relative safety.\n\nPatches and pull requests are welcome, especially if you&#8217;re smarter than me about these things. (It&#8217;s not hard to be smarter than me about these things.)\n\n### <span id=\"Scaling_Stability\">Scaling & Stability</span>\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> scales like just about any web service. You can stick it behind a load balancer. Scale it horizontally by throwing more CPUs and processes at the problem. Cache the hell out of the responses. Throw a proxy in front of it to cache the hell out of outgoing requests to external services. Again, this is meant to be as boring as I can make it.\n\nAnd, if a <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> process should happen to misbehave or starts having a seizure, just kill it and start another one. There should be no state to worry about, and the processes should start up really fast. Ideally, the logs will have recorded what went wrong and we end up with just a transient error.\n\n### <span id=\"Maturity_THE_FUTURE\">Maturity & THE FUTURE</span>\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> turned a year old last month, has been in production since last summer, and had its last commit around 5 months ago. It has lots of tests, and it uses a version of Node.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a> from early 2012.\n\nThat doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s abandoned, though: <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> is a mature project by most definitions. It&#8217;s been working well enough that I haven&#8217;t wanted to touch it. Most of the work goes on within the wiki itself, and <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"KumaScript\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">KumaScript</a> is meant to be the smallest piece it can be.\n\nAnd maturity doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t have notions about future work. Off the top of my head, I&#8217;d like to get around things like the following:\n\n*   Improve template execution & sandboxing. Currently, if any one thing misbehaves in the document, the whole process gets aborted. Maybe instead, I should [spin up a pool of processes][34]: Each them can take care of executing a single macro, while a master process watches for CPU / RAM / network abuse and kills anything that behaves badly.\n*   Reconsider my possibly brain-dead approach to parsing source documents for macros using a PEG.<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"js\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">js</a> grammar. Or, maybe it&#8217;s good enough.\n*   Need much better error trapping and reporting throughout everywhere.\n*   Need much better use of [statsd][35] for measuring timings and suchlike.\n*   Maybe offer an HTTP proxy that runs all content through the service, for easier deployment atop existing sites beyond <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MDN\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">MDN</a>.\n\nAnd of course: Suggestions, patches, and pull requests are more than welcome!\n\n [1]: https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript\n [2]: https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript/commit/0cb247eaac58cf00bb59e16d6b37a215484633b2\n [3]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/17/on-the-other-end-of-a-self-imposed-death-march-project\n [4]: http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/DekiScript\n [5]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript\n [6]: https://developer-new.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/KumaTests/hello_test?raw=1\n [7]: https://developer-new.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Template:hello\n [8]: https://developer-new.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/KumaTests/hello_test\n [9]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript#Template_Syntax\n [10]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript#Macro_Syntax\n [11]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript#Creating_modules\n [12]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Template:Warning\n [13]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion\n [14]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL/button\n [15]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL/button?raw\n [16]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Changelog\n [17]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Template:KumaGithubChanges\n [18]: http://www.mindtouch.com/\n [19]: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Lua_scripting\n [20]: http://code.google.com/p/v8/\n [21]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SpiderMonkey\n [22]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5099043/embedding-a-low-performance-scripting-language-in-python#comment5715808_5099043\n [23]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle\n [24]: http://nodejs.org/\n [25]: https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript/blob/master/package.json#L22\n [26]: https://github.com/mozilla/kuma\n [27]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuma#Animals\n [28]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:The_Kuma_API\n [29]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down\n [30]: https://github.com/lmorchard/node-firelogger\n [31]: https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs\n [32]: https://github.com/mozilla/kumascript/blob/master/lib/kumascript/parser.pegjs\n [33]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bleach\n [34]: https://github.com/lloyd/node-compute-cluster\n [35]: https://github.com/etsy/statsd/",

The side-to-side angle doesn&#8217;t want to support any weight in an up-and-down tilt, but the rest of the arm tightens down, so it&#8217;s good enough.</p>\n<h3 style=\"clear: both;\">\n  <span id=\"Building_the_enclosure\">Building the enclosure</span>\n</h3>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t have a 3D printer or a laser cutter. Though there is <a href=\"http://www.i3detroit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a friendly hackerspace</a> suitably equipped nearby, I wanted to see what I could prototype by hand. So, I went to Home Depot and bought <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100542281/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=acrylic&storeId=10051#.URcEEZykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">4 polystyrene panels</a>, <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-203040434/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=dremel&storeId=10051#.URcW75ykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">a Dremel tool</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202519358/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=acrylic+cutter&storeId=10051#.URcXIJykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">an acrylic cutter</a>.</p>\n<p>With lots of trial and error, and truly awful manufacturing tolerances, I came up with a crude design consisting of 6 stacked layers bolted together with machine screws:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Back layer with VESA mounting holes and an exit for the LVDS cable.</li>\n<li>Layer with VESA mounting holes and a pocket to route the LVDS cable.</li>\n<li>Layer behind the LCD with pocket for LVDS cable and heads of VESA mount bolts.</li>\n<li>Strips across the top and sides to hold the LCD panel.</li>\n<li>More strips across the top and sides to hold the LCD panel.</li>\n<li>Strips across the top and sides, covering the bezel area of the LCD panel.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I made a ton of measurements and little indecipherable sketches in my grid-lined Moleskine, but those were mostly crap. No battle plan survives contact with the enemy, and all that. In the end, I just flew by the seat of my pants and hacked away.</p>\n<p>This process taught me that a Dremel (in my hands, at least) is absolutely no substitute for a laser cutter. I <em>really</em> didn&#8217;t anticipate just how horrible I&#8217;d be at cutting this stuff. Trying to cut just-right shapes out of the polystyrene turned into a dismal, stinky mess. But luckily, all the material I thought I&#8217;d wasted turned out to be perfect for cutting out as strips for the bezel and sides.</p>\n<p>So, in lieu of a diagram, how about some pictures?</p>\n<div style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.29.331.jpg\"><img title=\"Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench\" alt=\"Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.29.331-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a little trick I worked out in this construction process: I used squares of electrical tape to retain the machine screws, so that I could flip the thing around while I was assembling layers on top before threading on the nuts. And speaking of that, here are the rest of the pieces in place:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_850\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-00.36.29.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-850\" title=\"Further layers bolted into the stack\" alt=\"Further layers bolted into the stack\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-00.36.29-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Further layers bolted into the stack\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The middle two layers cradling the sides of the LCD panel alternate between long sides / short top and long top / short sides, providing a bit more stability in the way they overlap. The top layer is long sides / short top, with a bit more width to cover the 5mm or so of the LCD panel&#8217;s bezel area.</p>\n<p>Immediately behind the LCD panel is a layer with a cut-out to provide space for machine screws for the VESA mount, and a pocket through which to route the LVDS cable to the control board. And the final two layers form the actual VESA mount and complete the exit route for the LVDS cable.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.44.09.jpg\"><img title=\"Video control board bolted onto the back\" alt=\"Video control board bolted onto the back\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.44.09-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Video control board bolted onto the back\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>And finally, here&#8217;s the video control board on the back. Rather than make a full box for the board, I just sandwiched it with machine screws between acrylic layers and nylon spacers. Then, I bolted that whole mess onto the back layers.</p>\n<p>Midway through this process, I switched from Home Depot to <a href=\"http://frentzandsons.com/content/default.htm\">a family-owned hardware store</a> a few blocks from my house. I think they recognize me as a regular now after repeat visits for Dremel bits, screws, and a pile of other miscellanea.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mounting-the-mess-to-the-dave\"><span id=\"Mounting_the_mess_to_the_DAVE\">Mounting the mess to the DAVE</span></h3>\n<p>The VideoSecu VESA mount went onto the IKEA DAVE rather crudely with a pair of long wood screws. It feels pretty solid, but the screws stab treacherously out through the bottom. I&#8217;ll need to address that someday, probably after they stab me in the kneecaps.</p>\n<p>And, as it turns out, the control board placement was a mistake. Once I got the VESA arm screwed onto the IKEA DAVE, there wasn&#8217;t enough room to connect the power and an HDMI cable to the board. Or rather, there was just enough room to do so and inadvertently destroy an HDMI cable after a few hours of the monitor&#8217;s weight resting on it. I guess the good news is that the cable went before the solder joints on the jack failed. Herp, derp.</p>\n<p>So, I bought a new HDMI cable, unbolted the board, and stuck it onto the back with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Z4A8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00004Z4A8&linkCode=as2&tag=0xdecafbad01-20\" target=\"_blank\">double sided tape</a>. Here&#8217;s what the back looks like now:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_826\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-05-00.28.14.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-826\" title=\"LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE\" alt=\"LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-05-00.28.14-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE, featuring bonus <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/cheddars/\" target=\"_blank\">Cheddars</a> appearance\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>I also used the same tape to attach the button board to the front of the enclosure.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_853\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.20.43.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-853\" alt=\"Button board on front\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.20.43-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Button board on front\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Overall, this thing works pretty much exactly as I&#8217;d imagined it. I <a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/p/z3mE\" target=\"_blank\">built a PC</a> in a <a href=\"http://icrontic.com/article/fractal-design-node-304-case-review\" target=\"_blank\">Fractal Node 304</a> mini-ITX case, and hid that under the coffee table. I bundled the cables together and used velcro wraps to bind them to the DAVE, and <a href=\"http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/rabbit-proofing.html#cords\" target=\"_blank\">some spiral wraps to bunny-proof</a> them as much as possible.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_855\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.38.29.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-855\" alt=\"Cheddars just loves my new couch PC\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.38.29-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/cheddars/\" target=\"_blank\">Cheddars</a> just loves my new couch PC. Or, maybe she wants dinner.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"whats-next\"><span id=\"What8217s_next\">What&#8217;s next?</span></h3>\n<p>This monitor is ugly if you look at it too closely. I slipped a bit with the acrylic cutter and left some obvious gouges, and the layers have a grubby patina of scratches just from clumsy handling throughout the process. Basically, it&#8217;s very, very obviously hand-made by a guy who writes software for a living and hasn&#8217;t touched a power tool for more than 5 minutes since high school shop class.</p>\n<p>But, I think some really valuable things came out of this first attempt: It took me a bit to work through how to mount the LCD panel and route the cable out the back in a way that didn&#8217;t put stress on the wires or the connectors. There was a lot of fudge factor in getting the VESA mount alignment just right. And, there was also that HDMI cable I wrecked by botching the control board placement. Beyond all that, though, the basic idea worked.</p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;m already thinking about v2.0 and making friends over at <a href=\"http://www.i3detroit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">i3Detroit</a> who can drive <a href=\"http://i3detroit.com/wi/index.php?title=Laser_Cutting_and_Etching\" target=\"_blank\">a laser cutter</a>. I&#8217;m checking out <a href=\"http://www.ponoko.com/starter-kits/inkscape\" target=\"_blank\">Inkscape and Ponoko</a>. I&#8217;d also like to find some better materials &#8211; maybe aluminum for the front bezel and back panel, and maybe drop a layer from the stack. It would be really nice to get a much cleaner look and drop some weight. Also, an upgrade to this cheap VESA mount would be keen &#8211; I can&#8217;t <em>quite</em> get all the adjustments I&#8217;d like.</p>\n<p>Overall, this thing works, and that makes me pretty happy. In the beginning, I had really hoped to just find someone else had made this exact thing &#8211; maybe on Thingiverse. But, no such luck. This <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Laptop-to-Desktop-Conversion/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Laptop-to-Desktop&#8221; Instructable</a> is pretty close, but not entirely what I needed. I guess DIY high-res LCD monitors are just not a thing. But, maybe this post and a possible v2.0 post in the future might come in handy for someone else.</p>\n",

We never got around to using it to stick a TV on the wall, so it seemed worth a shot to see if it would work on the IKEA DAVE.\r\n\r\n[<img border=\"0\" src=\"http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&#038;ASIN=B000ID7QNI&#038;Format=_SL110_&#038;ID=AsinImage&#038;MarketPlace=US&#038;ServiceVersion=20070822&#038;WS=1&#038;tag=0xdecafbad01-20\" />][6]<img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=0xdecafbad01-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B000ID7QNI\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\r\n\r\nFor around $15, it&#8217;s just about right: I had to mount it sideways, and it doesn&#8217;t *quite* fully work that way. The side-to-side angle doesn&#8217;t want to support any weight in an up-and-down tilt, but the rest of the arm tightens down, so it&#8217;s good enough.\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"clear: both;\">\r\n  <span id=\"Building_the_enclosure\">Building the enclosure</span>\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\nI don&#8217;t have a 3D printer or a laser cutter. Though there is <a href=\"http://www.i3detroit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a friendly hackerspace</a> suitably equipped nearby, I wanted to see what I could prototype by hand. So, I went to Home Depot and bought <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100542281/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=acrylic&storeId=10051#.URcEEZykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">4 polystyrene panels</a>, <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-203040434/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=dremel&storeId=10051#.URcW75ykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">a Dremel tool</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202519358/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=acrylic+cutter&storeId=10051#.URcXIJykOUk\" target=\"_blank\">an acrylic cutter</a>.\r\n\r\nWith lots of trial and error, and truly awful manufacturing tolerances, I came up with a crude design consisting of 6 stacked layers bolted together with machine screws:\r\n\r\n1.  Back layer with VESA mounting holes and an exit for the LVDS cable.\r\n2.  Layer with VESA mounting holes and a pocket to route the LVDS cable.\r\n3.  Layer behind the LCD with pocket for LVDS cable and heads of VESA mount bolts.\r\n4.  Strips across the top and sides to hold the LCD panel.\r\n5.  More strips across the top and sides to hold the LCD panel.\r\n6.  Strips across the top and sides, covering the bezel area of the LCD panel.\r\n\r\nI made a ton of measurements and little indecipherable sketches in my grid-lined Moleskine, but those were mostly crap. No battle plan survives contact with the enemy, and all that. In the end, I just flew by the seat of my pants and hacked away.\r\n\r\nThis process taught me that a Dremel (in my hands, at least) is absolutely no substitute for a laser cutter. I *really* didn&#8217;t anticipate just how horrible I&#8217;d be at cutting this stuff. Trying to cut just-right shapes out of the polystyrene turned into a dismal, stinky mess. But luckily, all the material I thought I&#8217;d wasted turned out to be perfect for cutting out as strips for the bezel and sides.\r\n\r\nSo, in lieu of a diagram, how about some pictures?\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.29.331.jpg\"><img title=\"Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench\" alt=\"Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.29.331-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    Back layers, attached to the VESA mount clamped to my workbench.\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nHere&#8217;s a little trick I worked out in this construction process: I used squares of electrical tape to retain the machine screws, so that I could flip the thing around while I was assembling layers on top before threading on the nuts. And speaking of that, here are the rest of the pieces in place:\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_850\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-00.36.29.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-850\" title=\"Further layers bolted into the stack\" alt=\"Further layers bolted into the stack\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-00.36.29-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    Further layers bolted into the stack\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThe middle two layers cradling the sides of the LCD panel alternate between long sides / short top and long top / short sides, providing a bit more stability in the way they overlap. The top layer is long sides / short top, with a bit more width to cover the 5mm or so of the LCD panel&#8217;s bezel area.\r\n\r\nImmediately behind the LCD panel is a layer with a cut-out to provide space for machine screws for the VESA mount, and a pocket through which to route the LVDS cable to the control board. And the final two layers form the actual VESA mount and complete the exit route for the LVDS cable.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.44.09.jpg\"><img title=\"Video control board bolted onto the back\" alt=\"Video control board bolted onto the back\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.44.09-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    Video control board bolted onto the back\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nAnd finally, here&#8217;s the video control board on the back. Rather than make a full box for the board, I just sandwiched it with machine screws between acrylic layers and nylon spacers. Then, I bolted that whole mess onto the back layers.\r\n\r\nMidway through this process, I switched from Home Depot to [a family-owned hardware store][7] a few blocks from my house. I think they recognize me as a regular now after repeat visits for Dremel bits, screws, and a pile of other miscellanea.\r\n\r\n### <span id=\"Mounting_the_mess_to_the_DAVE\">Mounting the mess to the DAVE</span>\r\n\r\nThe VideoSecu VESA mount went onto the IKEA DAVE rather crudely with a pair of long wood screws. It feels pretty solid, but the screws stab treacherously out through the bottom. I&#8217;ll need to address that someday, probably after they stab me in the kneecaps.\r\n\r\nAnd, as it turns out, the control board placement was a mistake. Once I got the VESA arm screwed onto the IKEA DAVE, there wasn&#8217;t enough room to connect the power and an HDMI cable to the board. Or rather, there was just enough room to do so and inadvertently destroy an HDMI cable after a few hours of the monitor&#8217;s weight resting on it. I guess the good news is that the cable went before the solder joints on the jack failed. Herp, derp.\r\n\r\nSo, I bought a new HDMI cable, unbolted the board, and stuck it onto the back with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Z4A8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00004Z4A8&linkCode=as2&tag=0xdecafbad01-20\" target=\"_blank\">double sided tape</a>. Here&#8217;s what the back looks like now:\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_826\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-05-00.28.14.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-826\" title=\"LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE\" alt=\"LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-05-00.28.14-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    LCD enclosure attached to the IKEA DAVE, featuring bonus <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/cheddars/\" target=\"_blank\">Cheddars</a> appearance\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nI also used the same tape to attach the button board to the front of the enclosure.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_853\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.20.43.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-853\" alt=\"Button board on front\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.20.43-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    Button board on front\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nOverall, this thing works pretty much exactly as I&#8217;d imagined it. I <a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/p/z3mE\" target=\"_blank\">built a PC</a> in a <a href=\"http://icrontic.com/article/fractal-design-node-304-case-review\" target=\"_blank\">Fractal Node 304</a> mini-ITX case, and hid that under the coffee table. I bundled the cables together and used velcro wraps to bind them to the DAVE, and <a href=\"http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/rabbit-proofing.html#cords\" target=\"_blank\">some spiral wraps to bunny-proof</a> them as much as possible.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_855\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\r\n  <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.38.29.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-855\" alt=\"Cheddars just loves my new couch PC\" src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-23.38.29-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n    <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/cheddars/\" target=\"_blank\">Cheddars</a> just loves my new couch PC. Or, maybe she wants dinner.\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n### <span id=\"What8217s_next\">What&#8217;s next?</span>\r\n\r\nThis monitor is ugly if you look at it too closely. I slipped a bit with the acrylic cutter and left some obvious gouges, and the layers have a grubby patina of scratches just from clumsy handling throughout the process. Basically, it&#8217;s very, very obviously hand-made by a guy who writes software for a living and hasn&#8217;t touched a power tool for more than 5 minutes since high school shop class.\r\n\r\nBut, I think some really valuable things came out of this first attempt: It took me a bit to work through how to mount the LCD panel and route the cable out the back in a way that didn&#8217;t put stress on the wires or the connectors. There was a lot of fudge factor in getting the VESA mount alignment just right. And, there was also that HDMI cable I wrecked by botching the control board placement. Beyond all that, though, the basic idea worked.\r\n\r\nSo, I&#8217;m already thinking about v2.0 and making friends over at <a href=\"http://www.i3detroit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">i3Detroit</a> who can drive <a href=\"http://i3detroit.com/wi/index.php?title=Laser_Cutting_and_Etching\" target=\"_blank\">a laser cutter</a>. I&#8217;m checking out <a href=\"http://www.ponoko.com/starter-kits/inkscape\" target=\"_blank\">Inkscape and Ponoko</a>. I&#8217;d also like to find some better materials &#8211; maybe aluminum for the front bezel and back panel, and maybe drop a layer from the stack. It would be really nice to get a much cleaner look and drop some weight. Also, an upgrade to this cheap VESA mount would be keen &#8211; I can&#8217;t *quite* get all the adjustments I&#8217;d like.\r\n\r\nOverall, this thing works, and that makes me pretty happy. In the beginning, I had really hoped to just find someone else had made this exact thing &#8211; maybe on Thingiverse. But, no such luck. This <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Laptop-to-Desktop-Conversion/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Laptop-to-Desktop&#8221; Instructable</a> is pretty close, but not entirely what I needed. I guess DIY high-res LCD monitors are just not a thing. But, maybe this post and a possible v2.0 post in the future might come in handy for someone else.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch\r\n [2]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/21/gaming-from-the-orchard-house-couch#Laptop_decapitation\r\n [3]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2a-pc.png\r\n [4]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-23.33.12.jpg\r\n [5]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ID7QNI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000ID7QNI&linkCode=as2&tag=0xdecafbad01-20 \"VideoSecu Articulating TV Wall Mount Bracket for VESA 100 LCD LED Flat Screen Monitor TV 1E9\"\r\n [6]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ID7QNI/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000ID7QNI&linkCode=as2&tag=0xdecafbad01-20\r\n [7]: http://frentzandsons.com/content/default.htm",

Some additional bits and pieces accumulate below:\r\n\r\n*   Here are some arguments against CamelCase for [accessibility reasons][7] and for [non-english speakers][8].\r\n\r\n*   [The Twisted project uses *both* CamelCase *and* snake_case in the same variable names.][9] The bit before the underscore signifies the type of a method, and the bit after is the name &#8211; eg. `remote_loginAnonymous` or `test_addDSAIdentityNoComment`.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this has been bugging me for long enough that here I am finally blogging about it, so that I have an URL to throw into conversations when it comes up.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case\r\n [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase\r\n [3]: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\r\n [4]: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8\r\n [5]: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/belt_and_suspenders\r\n [6]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult\r\n [7]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1740116/for-what-reason-do-we-have-the-lower-case-with-underscores-naming-convention/1740152#1740152\r\n [8]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1740116/for-what-reason-do-we-have-the-lower-case-with-underscores-naming-convention/1740131#1740131\r\n [9]: http://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2012/10/a-tired-hobgoblin.html",

But, this is suboptimal and a dead end for upgrades where it matters. I could get an updated laptop, but that&#8217;s just kicking the can down the road. And besides, this machine is intended more as a productivity machine for me than gaming.</p>\n<p>I could also buy a real gaming laptop, but those things are expensive &#8211; and also less than great for upgrades.</p>\n<p><a style=\"display: block; float: left; margin: 0 0.75em 0.75em 0\" href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2-pc.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2-pc-300x248.png\" alt=\"couch-gaming-2-pc\" width=\"300\" height=\"248\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-672\" /></a></p>\n<p>What about a desktop gaming PC? It&#8217;s been a long time since I last built a PC &#8211; something on the order of 10 years. But, it seems like this would be the cheaper and more easily upgraded route</p>\n<p>The deal breaker, though, is the <em>desktop</em> part. Like I said, I like hanging out with my wife on the couch &#8211; I&#8217;m not going to wander off to a desk by myself to indulge my gaming hobby. If I had to choose, my wife wins every time. She&#8217;s my best friend.</p>\n<p>So, pictured above, I&#8217;m thinking about what it would take to replace my laptop with a desktop at the couch. I need a monitor that fits on my DAVE, and I need a place to stick a big box.</p>\n<h2 id=\"laptop-decapitation\"><span id=\"Laptop_decapitation\">Laptop decapitation</span></h2>\n<p><a style=\"display: block; float: right; margin: 0 0 0.75em 0.75em\" href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2a-pc.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2a-pc-166x300.png\" alt=\"couch-gaming-2a-pc\" width=\"166\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-671\" /></a></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s zoom &amp; enhance again, on the right. Basically, what I&#8217;ve mocked up here is the LCD panel from my laptop torn off and bolted to the DAVE. I&#8217;ve got an <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Wireless-Keyboard-MC184LL-VERSION/dp/B005DLDO4U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358748005&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=apple+wireless\">Apple Wireless Keyboard</a> there. But, it could just as easily be a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BW01X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0000BW01X\">Happy Hacking Keyboard</a>, if only I&#8217;d found the right model in SketchUp. Maybe I&#8217;ll even get &#8220;serious&#8221; and look into a gaming keyboard with a numpad.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t seem to find a decent off-the-shelf LCD monitor that won&#8217;t crush the DAVE and yet has as nice a resolution &amp; density as my MacBook Pro display. But, after a day of musing on Facebook and poking around on eBay, I found an exciting lead.</p>\n<p><a style=\"display: block; float: left; margin: 0 0.75em 0.75em 0\" href=\"http://www.ebay.com/itm/HDMI-VGA-DVI-Audio-LCD-controller-board-17-3-LP173WF1-1920-1080-lcd-panel-/170940546439?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&#038;hash=item27ccd9bd87\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/622302621_o-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"622302621_o\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-682\" /></a></p>\n<p>As it turns out, you can buy an LCD display panel and a board to drive it from plain old HDMI / DVI / VGA inputs. On the left is one that I&#8217;ve ordered. <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/itm/HDMI-VGA-DVI-Audio-LCD-controller-board-17-3-LP173WF1-1920-1080-lcd-panel-/170940546439?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item27ccd9bd87\">It&#8217;s 17.3&#8243; and offers 1920 x 1080 resolution</a>.</p>\n<p>This seems pretty nice to me, since it&#8217;s slightly better than my current laptop and will sit less than 2-3 feet from my face. Worst case, I can use it as a second monitor for my desk. Or, I could move the Xbox to under the couch and hook it up on the HDMI input. I could even use headphones, since the display interface board has an output jack.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll have to fabricate some sort of housing for the display, and find a way to attach it to the DAVE with friction hinges. Since this will be in the living room, it also wouldn&#8217;t hurt if the result looks clean. I&#8217;m hoping this won&#8217;t be an impossible task, despite my carpentry skills having last been exercised in high school shop class almost 20 years ago. Less than 10 miles from me is <a href=\"http://www.i3detroit.com/\">i3Detroit</a>, an awesome maker space, so I could avail myself of some tinkerers there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"couching-gamer-hidden-tower\"><span id=\"Couching_gamer_hidden_tower\">Couching gamer, hidden tower</span></h2>\n<p><a style=\"display: block; float: right; margin: 0 0 0.75em 0.75em\" href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/unsightly-pc-tower.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/unsightly-pc-tower-300x279.png\" alt=\"unsightly-pc-tower\" width=\"300\" height=\"279\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-756\" /></a></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s zoom &amp; enhance on that PC tower. I&#8217;ll stub my toes on it, as I wander to and from the kitchen. And, that girl I like hanging out with will probably brain me with it. That thing is not going to fly.</p>\n<p>Ideally, I&#8217;d love to stash it under the couch. But, under the couch gives me only about 4&#8243; of clearance. I think most of the video cards I&#8217;m considering are taller than that, let alone the cases.</p>\n<p>Other options might include hiding it behind the couch, but only if it doesn&#8217;t have howling turbines that prevent the girl from taking the naps mentioned earlier. We also have an entertainment center, which could be an option if running cables across the room isn&#8217;t ugly and if they don&#8217;t become bunny food (see aforementioned headphones). Oh, and the entertainment center is poorly ventilated.</p>\n<p>Maybe behind the couch is the best option, assuming everything but the monitor is wireless.</p>\n<h2 id=\"living-in-the-post-pc-future\"><span id=\"Living_in_the_Post-PC_future\">Living in the Post-PC future</span></h2>\n<p>So, assuming I get this display panel working and mounted, and I find a place to stick the PC case, now I have to figure out what to stick inside the case. My budget is not infinite, but I&#8217;m curious to see if I can keep it under $600. But, I&#8217;m so out of the DIY PC loop, that I don&#8217;t even know if that&#8217;s a sane ballpark for satisfying gaming.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, I think I&#8217;m relatively easy to satisfy. After all, I&#8217;m putting up with games on this MacBook Pro that sometimes never get more than 15-20 FPS. Ideally, I&#8217;d like to blow well past that &#8211; that&#8217;s the whole point, really. But, I don&#8217;t need insane bells &amp; whistles that I won&#8217;t appreciate on this 17&#8243; 1920&#215;1080 display. I&#8217;ll also never ever bother with 3D. It would just be nice, for once, to get high frame rates on at least last year&#8217;s games.</p>\n<p>This is where my ideas run out, and I need to do more research and bug some friends. But, that&#8217;s okay, because I think this is a relatively boring part. What&#8217;s in the box is less interesting to me than where to put it and how to hook it up at the couch.</p>\n<p>Still, let&#8217;s see where I end up going with this. More updates after I get delivery of this LCD panel.</p>\n",

And besides, this machine is intended more as a productivity machine for me than gaming.\r\n\r\nI could also buy a real gaming laptop, but those things are expensive &#8211; and also less than great for upgrades.\r\n\r\n<a style=\"display: block; float: left; margin: 0 0.75em 0.75em 0\" href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2-pc.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2-pc-300x248.png\" alt=\"couch-gaming-2-pc\" width=\"300\" height=\"248\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-672\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhat about a desktop gaming PC? It&#8217;s been a long time since I last built a PC &#8211; something on the order of 10 years. But, it seems like this would be the cheaper and more easily upgraded route\r\n\r\nThe deal breaker, though, is the *desktop* part. Like I said, I like hanging out with my wife on the couch &#8211; I&#8217;m not going to wander off to a desk by myself to indulge my gaming hobby. If I had to choose, my wife wins every time. She&#8217;s my best friend.\r\n\r\nSo, pictured above, I&#8217;m thinking about what it would take to replace my laptop with a desktop at the couch. I need a monitor that fits on my DAVE, and I need a place to stick a big box.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Laptop_decapitation\">Laptop decapitation</span>\r\n\r\n<a style=\"display: block; float: right; margin: 0 0 0.75em 0.75em\" href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2a-pc.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/couch-gaming-2a-pc-166x300.png\" alt=\"couch-gaming-2a-pc\" width=\"166\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-671\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLet&#8217;s zoom & enhance again, on the right. Basically, what I&#8217;ve mocked up here is the LCD panel from my laptop torn off and bolted to the DAVE. I&#8217;ve got an [Apple Wireless Keyboard][11] there. But, it could just as easily be a [Happy Hacking Keyboard][12], if only I&#8217;d found the right model in SketchUp. Maybe I&#8217;ll even get &#8220;serious&#8221; and look into a gaming keyboard with a numpad.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can&#8217;t seem to find a decent off-the-shelf LCD monitor that won&#8217;t crush the DAVE and yet has as nice a resolution & density as my MacBook Pro display. But, after a day of musing on Facebook and poking around on eBay, I found an exciting lead.\r\n\r\n<a style=\"display: block; float: left; margin: 0 0.75em 0.75em 0\" href=\"http://www.ebay.com/itm/HDMI-VGA-DVI-Audio-LCD-controller-board-17-3-LP173WF1-1920-1080-lcd-panel-/170940546439?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&#038;hash=item27ccd9bd87\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/622302621_o-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"622302621_o\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-682\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, you can buy an LCD display panel and a board to drive it from plain old HDMI / DVI / VGA inputs. On the left is one that I&#8217;ve ordered. [It&#8217;s 17.3&#8243; and offers 1920 x 1080 resolution][13].\r\n\r\nThis seems pretty nice to me, since it&#8217;s slightly better than my current laptop and will sit less than 2-3 feet from my face. Worst case, I can use it as a second monitor for my desk. Or, I could move the Xbox to under the couch and hook it up on the HDMI input. I could even use headphones, since the display interface board has an output jack.\r\n\r\nI&#8217;ll have to fabricate some sort of housing for the display, and find a way to attach it to the DAVE with friction hinges. Since this will be in the living room, it also wouldn&#8217;t hurt if the result looks clean. I&#8217;m hoping this won&#8217;t be an impossible task, despite my carpentry skills having last been exercised in high school shop class almost 20 years ago. Less than 10 miles from me is [i3Detroit][14], an awesome maker space, so I could avail myself of some tinkerers there.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Couching_gamer_hidden_tower\">Couching gamer, hidden tower</span>\r\n\r\n<a style=\"display: block; float: right; margin: 0 0 0.75em 0.75em\" href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/unsightly-pc-tower.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/unsightly-pc-tower-300x279.png\" alt=\"unsightly-pc-tower\" width=\"300\" height=\"279\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-756\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLet&#8217;s zoom & enhance on that PC tower. I&#8217;ll stub my toes on it, as I wander to and from the kitchen. And, that girl I like hanging out with will probably brain me with it. That thing is not going to fly.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I&#8217;d love to stash it under the couch. But, under the couch gives me only about 4&#8243; of clearance. I think most of the video cards I&#8217;m considering are taller than that, let alone the cases.\r\n\r\nOther options might include hiding it behind the couch, but only if it doesn&#8217;t have howling turbines that prevent the girl from taking the naps mentioned earlier. We also have an entertainment center, which could be an option if running cables across the room isn&#8217;t ugly and if they don&#8217;t become bunny food (see aforementioned headphones). Oh, and the entertainment center is poorly ventilated.\r\n\r\nMaybe behind the couch is the best option, assuming everything but the monitor is wireless.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Living_in_the_Post-PC_future\">Living in the Post-PC future</span>\r\n\r\nSo, assuming I get this display panel working and mounted, and I find a place to stick the PC case, now I have to figure out what to stick inside the case. My budget is not infinite, but I&#8217;m curious to see if I can keep it under $600. But, I&#8217;m so out of the DIY PC loop, that I don&#8217;t even know if that&#8217;s a sane ballpark for satisfying gaming.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, I think I&#8217;m relatively easy to satisfy. After all, I&#8217;m putting up with games on this MacBook Pro that sometimes never get more than 15-20 FPS. Ideally, I&#8217;d like to blow well past that &#8211; that&#8217;s the whole point, really. But, I don&#8217;t need insane bells & whistles that I won&#8217;t appreciate on this 17&#8243; 1920&#215;1080 display. I&#8217;ll also never ever bother with 3D. It would just be nice, for once, to get high frame rates on at least last year&#8217;s games.\r\n\r\nThis is where my ideas run out, and I need to do more research and bug some friends. But, that&#8217;s okay, because I think this is a relatively boring part. What&#8217;s in the box is less interesting to me than where to put it and how to hook it up at the couch.\r\n\r\nStill, let&#8217;s see where I end up going with this. More updates after I get delivery of this LCD panel.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.sketchup.com/\r\n [2]: steamcommunity.com/id/lmorchard\r\n [3]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00578O5W4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00578O5W4\r\n [4]: http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00120818/\r\n [5]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F42MKG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001F42MKG\r\n [6]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IG1NFM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000IG1NFM \"Humanscale Keyboard, Standard Platform, 4G Mechanism with Clip Mouse and Gel Leather Palm Support\"\r\n [7]: https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/26116_383125243201_3986077_n.jpg\r\n [8]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005C31HC0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005C31HC0\r\n [9]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GTNZUM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005GTNZUM\r\n [10]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J30FZM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001J30FZM\r\n [11]: http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Wireless-Keyboard-MC184LL-VERSION/dp/B005DLDO4U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358748005&sr=8-1&keywords=apple+wireless\r\n [12]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BW01X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0000BW01X\r\n [13]: http://www.ebay.com/itm/HDMI-VGA-DVI-Audio-LCD-controller-board-17-3-LP173WF1-1920-1080-lcd-panel-/170940546439?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item27ccd9bd87\r\n [14]: http://www.i3detroit.com/",

But, it&#8217;s the first thing my brain spewed out. I&#8217;ve had this story rattling around in my head for a few years, and just tonight managed to finish banging out a first draft. I&#8217;m hoping to work on it a bit more, and I&#8217;m not entirely happy with it yet, so comments welcome!</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<hr>\n<p>Her dad lay in a nest of tubes and wires, face like a stranger&#8217;s in its serenity. No thoughts furrowed his brow; no smile crinkled the corners of his closed eyes. His lips were slightly parted, his jaw slack. The subtle rise and fall of his chest and the quiet gossip of machines were the only signs of life.</p>\n<p>She slumped in a corner chair near the foot of his hospital bed, under the old flat panel TV. She couldn&#8217;t see it, and neither could he. So, she&#8217;d turned it off after the nurse left. The man had meant well: He&#8217;d told her that her Dad could hear it, and it would distract her.</p>\n<p>But, she didn&#8217;t need distraction, and if her Dad could hear anything she wanted it to be her own voice. So, she spent hours talking to him. She talked about his granddaughter, who&#8217;d just started college the month before. She groused about her ex-husband, who&#8217;d decided to go on vacation with his new wife, rather than show up for the going away party.</p>\n<p>It had been almost a week since her Dad had triggered a medical alert. The paramedics had found him slumped over his desk at home. He was stable, albeit in a coma. The doctors had yet to work out exactly what had happened to him.</p>\n<p>Having nowhere better to be, she came to her Dad&#8217;s room every day. She telecommuted most days from the corner chair. She spent evenings talking until the nurses kicked her out at the end of visiting hours. Then, she went back to her empty house, collapsed into bed, got up, and did it all again.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;d just gotten done reading out loud from her daughter&#8217;s last email &#8211; a quick report on first semester&#8217;s classes and her awesome new roommates &#8211; when she decided to rest her eyes for just a minute.</p>\n<p>A minute stretched into an hour, and she found herself surfacing from a dream of angry bees to the arms of her glasses buzzing. She sat up, blinked a few times, and finally managed to bring the caller ID panel into focus.</p>\n<p>Floating in front of her was picture of her Dad, labelled &#8220;Dad&#8221;, with an option to accept or ignore. She flicked her eyes to ignore, pulled the glasses off, closed her eyes, and massaged the bridge of her nose.</p>\n<p>In her hand, the glasses started vibrating again. She put them back on. &#8220;Dad&#8221; was calling back. This time, with a sigh, she blinked at the icon to accept the call.</p>\n<p>Immediately, she croaked, &#8220;Who the hell is this?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hi, Pumpkin. It&#8217;s me, Dad.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She paused, glanced at the unconscious man in the bed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221; said her Dad, in her ear.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only going to ask one more time: Who the hell is this?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me, sweetie. It&#8217;s Dad.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She hung up, tossing the call away with a glance. She got up, walked over to the bathroom and drew herself a paper cup of water. She downed it with a shaking hand, got another. Her glasses started buzzing again. She slumped back into the corner chair, took a breath, and answered the call.</p>\n<p>After a few moments of buzzing silence, her father&#8217;s voice said, &#8220;Okay, so you haven&#8217;t hung up yet. We&#8217;re making progress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She asked, very quietly, &#8220;Who are you and what do you want?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The former is complicated, but the latter is simple: I need your help to ensure my hosting bills get paid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You &#8211; whoever you are &#8211; you&#8217;re asking for money? Using my Dad&#8217;s voice? What kind of spam call is this?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No! No, Honey,&#8221; the voice said quickly, &#8220;I have the money. It&#8217;s just, given my current state of health &#8211; or lack thereof&#8230; Well, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll have legal access to my accounts for very much longer. I meant to set up a trust. But, evidently, I put it off for too long.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well, not to be morbid, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to wake up from that hospital bed. As next of kin, you will gain control of my assets. As my hosting is among my assets, I need your help to keep the lights on, as it were.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Who <em>are</em> you?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Back to that question, of course. Look, do you remember the bedtime stories I used to tell you?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;My father told me stories, yes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Those stories often featured you rescuing a boy after a long quest. Do you recall how I&#8217;d end those stories?&#8221;</p>\n<p>She said nothing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d say, &#8216;Sorry, but your prince is in another castle.&#8217; Like the game, only different.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;My Dad <em>blogged</em> about that <em>last year</em>, you asshole.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Shit. You&#8217;re right. I did. Damn it. Okay, how about this: Before you moved out of the house, we had a Twilight Zone marathon every year on Christmas Eve. You loved that one episode, where the guy yelled about it being a cookbook and all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure I shared that on Facebook. I shared everything we streamed on Netflix.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Damn it. We never really kept much private in our family, did we? Let&#8217;s see, what else can I come up with&#8211;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Stop. Just stop,&#8221; she said, wearily. &#8220;I know who you are: You&#8217;re a fan of my Dad&#8217;s work. Kudos &#8211; you&#8217;ve got the voice right and you&#8217;ve read all about us. But seriously, what the hell do you want with me?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The voice sighed like her Dad. &#8220;I told you. When I&#8230; die&#8230; I need you to make sure my hosting continues. There&#8217;s enough money in my accounts to keep things going for decades, but I need you to make sure the payments don&#8217;t stop. I&#8217;m not asking you for money; the money&#8217;s already there. I just need someone&#8230; not legally dead&#8230; to keep signing the checks. Man, this is embarrassing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Her anger rose, and she spat: &#8220;Hosting? What hosting? You mean you&#8217;re worried about my father&#8217;s <em>website</em> going down? Make a copy, jackass! My Dad&#8217;s here in a coma, and you&#8217;re creeping me out over his blog and some papers? And how the <em>hell</em> do you know what Dad has in the bank?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The nurse poked his head in the door, frowned at her. &#8220;Miss, you need to keep it down. Other patients can hear you, too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Shit,&#8221; she said, with a sigh. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I will, sorry.&#8221; The nurse left, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>The voice on the call asked, &#8220;Who was that?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The nurse. Never mind. Answer me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Right. So, I know what I have in the bank, because they&#8217;re my accounts. And the hosting isn&#8217;t for a website &#8211; it&#8217;s for me. That&#8217;s also part of the answer to your question, &#8216;Who are you?&#39;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Keep talking. But, make more sense.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Look, you mentioned my work. This is about that work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The gears in her head turned over, and her jaw dropped.</p>\n<p>Her dad&#8217;s name was Richard Chambers. Yes, that Richard Chambers: The one who&#8217;d found fame and fortune at the age of 24, having developed a secret-recipe mashup of expert systems and voice technologies that redefined customer support.</p>\n<p>His bots could converse fluently in 70 languages, with accents indistinguishable from native speakers. They addressed customer concerns with apparent insight and care, seemed to improvise, and followed no discernible script. They never hung up, called back when they said they would, and actually took care of customers&#8217; needs. They drove satisfaction ratings through the roof.</p>\n<p>Richard had retired early as a billionaire. In the decades following, he tinkered with ever-improving artificial intelligence, writing cult-classic books, and consulting as a futurist with laundry list of companies and think-tanks.</p>\n<p>She took a breath and said &#8211; very carefully to avoid a repeat visit from the nurse &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m talking to a call center bot?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well, yes and no. The technology has come a very long way over the years. Suffice it to say, I&#8217;ve outsourced myself into the cloud.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s sufficient about what you just said? What the hell are you talking about&#8211; wait, what am I doing? If this is just a call center bot, this must just be a bug. Sudo halt. Unsubscribe me. Do not call. Leave me the hell alone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She hung up. Immediately, her glasses resumed rattling. She sighed and answered.</p>\n<p>The voice stammered, &#8220;Wait! Wait! Don&#8217;t hang up! I&#8217;m not a bot!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;So, you&#8217;re a bot my Dad programmed to say it&#8217;s not a bot. Cute trick, but it&#8217;s a sick joke given the timing. I&#8217;m not buying it. I&#8217;m not buying anything. Please stop calling me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The voice talked fast: &#8220;I ship birthday presents to little Julie from her wishlist every year. Well, I guess she&#8217;s not so little anymore, now that&#8217;s she&#8217;s gone away to school. Your ex- is an ass, and I told him as much when he walked out on you. You call me every Sunday afternoon.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He ran out of breath, apparently, and she let him hang for a few seconds. Finally she said, slowly, &#8220;You mean I call my father every Sunday afternoon.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, you call <em>me</em>. Just like we&#8217;re talking, right now. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to tell you, sweetie. It&#8217;s me, Dad!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Wait, what? Do you mean Dad <em>outsourced</em> talking to his daughter on Sunday afternoons to a bot? That&#8217;s sick. I mean, it&#8217;s not totally out of character, but that&#8217;s just really sick.&#8221; She just glared at the man lying in the hospital bad. &#8220;I mean, what the hell, Dad?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not like that! Well, I mean it is kind of like that. But, it&#8217;s so much more than that! It&#8217;s me, I&#8217;m here, in the cloud! I&#8217;m here, Pumpkin!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Still staring at her Dad, who lay slack-jawed and barely breathing, &#8220;Why would you make something like this?&#8221;</p>\n<p>There was no reply from the bed. But, the voice in her ear answered, desperately, &#8220;Because I knew I&#8217;d die someday. I&#8217;d get old and end up in a hospital bed just like that and die. But, I&#8217;m not done yet. I still have more to do and learn. And I want to be there for Julie&#8217;s graduation. And I don&#8217;t want to miss a Sunday talking to you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You shut the hell up,&#8221; she spat. &#8220;I&#8217;m not talking to you. In fact, as soon as I figure out how to find you, I&#8217;m going to shut you down.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Damn it. You&#8217;d think after all the years I&#8217;ve been at this, I would&#8217;ve come up with a way to explain all this. Okay, so forget about who I am &#8211; consider <em>what</em> I am.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And that is?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am the pinnacle of my own life&#8217;s work. If I hadn&#8217;t put it off for so long, I&#8217;d have a will and a trust to preserve my self-sufficiency, and we would be having a very different conversation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Keep all Dad&#8217;s toys wound up, he would&#8217;ve wanted it that way. That&#8217;s just great.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a toy! Look, check this out.&#8221; A text message with a link popped up in her vision. &#8220;That&#8217;s a live feed from the Google campus, out in California. Another instance of me is giving a lecture, right now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She followed the link, and sure enough: Up popped a streaming video, the camera&#8217;s perspective from the back of a broad, packed auditorium. The front wall was a theater-sized video panel from which her smiling Dad looked down, apparently live from his desk back home. An audience member stood at a microphone in the aisle, conversing with the larger-than-life image.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is canned,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not. Peek at the campus calendar.&#8221; Up popped another link, pointing to the schedule. She saw Richard Chambers listed several times, as part of a larger annual conference. He&#8217;d actually given the keynote speech, earlier in the week &#8211; days after he&#8217;d fallen into a coma.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh, Dad,&#8221; she moaned, squeezing her eyes shut. &#8220;This is bad. How long do you expect to get away with this?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;As long as I keep the servers up,&#8221; he chuckled. &#8220;Everyone thinks I&#8217;m a crazy shut-in, so I can do everything from home or a facsimile thereof. I&#8217;m careful with parallel instances &#8211; only one public appearance at a time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But, I&#8217;ve got a half-dozen other mini-me&#8217;s working on papers, doing peer reviews, burning through the past year&#8217;s worth of publications. Hell, I even have one of me playing Final Fantasy VII in an emulator, because I never did finish that when it came out. I&#8217;ve never been so productive or had so much fun in all my life.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She took a deep breath, let it out in a huff. &#8220;So, before Dad ended up in the coma, what was he doing while you&#8217;ve been doing all the above on his behalf?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Self-improvement. I haven&#8217;t found a way to get a direct brain download or anything that fantastic, so I&#8217;ve been doing it the hard way. There&#8217;s a little bit of programming, a little bit of guided evolution, and a lot of storytelling. It&#8217;s been like writing a memoir, only in executable form.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She got up, and paced over to the bed. She laid a hand on his forehead and said, &#8220;God, Dad, I wish you had just written a book.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The voice in her ear chuckled. &#8220;Instead, I wrote a thing that writes books for me. And then, I wrote a thing that <em>is</em> me. I replaced myself with a not-so-small shell script!&#8221;</p>\n<p>It really was uncanny, she thought. Everything it said was just what she imagined he might say. She wanted it to go away, but then again she&#8217;d spent the last week wanting her Dad to wake up and talk to her.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Look, back to the point,&#8221; the voice said, breaking into her thoughts, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need you to believe me. I want you to &#8211; I&#8217;d love it if you did. But, what I really need, practically speaking, is a way to continue existing. And for that, I need your help. Is there anything I can say that would convince you to at least come that far with me?&#8221;</p>\n<p>She sighed again, for probably the tenth time that day, gazing down into her Dad&#8217;s placid face. &#8220;This just&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t seem right. Dad, if you don&#8217;t wake up &#8211; and I mean, if &#8211; then don&#8217;t we have to move on? It can&#8217;t be healthy to keep this thing around.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sweetie, I&#8217;m not like that thing from Max Headroom,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You remember when I made you watch that show? Not Max Headroom himself, he was funny. But, there was this &#8216;Vu-Age Church&#8217; where they claimed they could do a brain scan and keep your relatives around in simulation. There was a guy who was just a loop&#8230; oh, here it is.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He linked her to an old low-quality video clip: A little old lady was talking to a black-and-white CRT in a funeral parlor, chattering on about her friend&#8217;s grandchildren. On the screen, a bow-tied, balding man &#8211; Humphrey, apparently &#8211; chimed in from time to time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s wonderful, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Humphrey, over and over again.</p>\n<p>Despite herself, she chuckled. This was her Dad &#8211; he couldn&#8217;t help but pepper any conversation with references to ancient geek culture. She never knew how he kept all those things in his head, or how he always seemed to find a link to share within seconds. Sometimes, literally, when he would pull out his phone and summon up soundboards in the middle of dinner.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to stare at me for at least an hour before I start to repeat myself like that,&#8221; he said, when the video clip ended. &#8220;But then, I&#8217;d do that anyway.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She hadn&#8217;t noticed when it started, but tears trickled down her cheeks to land on the blankets below. She blinked and wiped at her eyes under her lenses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can leave you alone, if you want,&#8221; he said, sounding strangled. &#8220;I just need you to fill out a form and click a button. You can automate the payments and I&#8217;ll be set. You never have to hear from me again. Just please, don&#8217;t let me go dark.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an ass,&#8221; she said, sniffing. &#8220;Both of you. All of you. Hell, I don&#8217;t know. Dad&#8217;s here lying in this bed, and he&#8217;s talking to me on the phone. And, he&#8217;s apparently hamming it up in front of a bunch of Googlers, too. This is bent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh, I wrapped that Google thing up a few minutes ago,&#8221; he said, a smile in his voice.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Shut up. I repeat: You&#8217;re an ass.&#8221; She took a deep breath. &#8220;Look, Dad&#8217;s not gone yet. And, I&#8217;m not ready to give in and believe there&#8217;s no chance he&#8217;ll wake up from this. And, there&#8217;s definitely no way I&#8217;m ready to just say, okay, Dad&#8217;s in the cloud and that&#8217;s a thing that can happen. That&#8217;s just too much to chew all at once.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But&#8230;?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t think I can just let you get shut off, either. I don&#8217;t buy the whole story, but you&#8217;re clearly something Dad put a ton of work into. That&#8217;s got to be worth something &#8211; to him, to all those Googlers. Maybe to me once it sinks in.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He sent her another link &#8211; it demanded her personal certificate and she consented. This revealed a private wiki. There were details on thousands of server clusters, long columns of logins. There were directories of papers in progress, most of which claimed yet to have been reviewed or published. She couldn&#8217;t quite make sense of some of the titles, but it looked like he was working on documenting a pile of fresh new technology.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a look behind the curtain, Pumpkin. I&#8217;m sorry it&#8217;s not more exciting like a cycle ride through cyberspace or whatever,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But, you can take me down with this, or you can help me carry on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Do I have to do anything right now?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, this stuff is paid up for months, through the end of the year at least. And, like you said, I&#8217;m not dead yet. In fact, I&#8217;m feeling better!&#8221; He delivered that last part with a horrible English accent, straight out of Monty Python.</p>\n<p>She laughed. &#8220;Okay. That&#8217;s good. Can we just talk, then?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sure, sweetie, whatever you want. I&#8217;ve got all the time in the world. And, anyway, you know it&#8217;s Sunday afternoon, right?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Smiling, she sat back down in the corner chair and talked to her Dad &#8211; about work, about his granddaughter, about everything. Without moving his lips, he had plenty to say in return.</p>\n",
    "body": "**TL;DR:** This is a story about what might happen if one takes life hacks, GTD, and IFTTT a bit too far.\r\n\r\nOkay, so maybe that&#8217;s not a great intro. But, it&#8217;s the first thing my brain spewed out. I&#8217;ve had this story rattling around in my head for a few years, and just tonight managed to finish banging out a first draft. I&#8217;m hoping to work on it a bit more, and I&#8217;m not entirely happy with it yet, so comments welcome!\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nHer dad lay in a nest of tubes and wires, face like a stranger&#8217;s in its serenity. No thoughts furrowed his brow; no smile crinkled the corners of his closed eyes. His lips were slightly parted, his jaw slack. The subtle rise and fall of his chest and the quiet gossip of machines were the only signs of life.\r\n\r\nShe slumped in a corner chair near the foot of his hospital bed, under the old flat panel TV. She couldn&#8217;t see it, and neither could he. So, she&#8217;d turned it off after the nurse left. The man had meant well: He&#8217;d told her that her Dad could hear it, and it would distract her.\r\n\r\nBut, she didn&#8217;t need distraction, and if her Dad could hear anything she wanted it to be her own voice. So, she spent hours talking to him. She talked about his granddaughter, who&#8217;d just started college the month before. She groused about her ex-husband, who&#8217;d decided to go on vacation with his new wife, rather than show up for the going away party.\r\n\r\nIt had been almost a week since her Dad had triggered a medical alert. The paramedics had found him slumped over his desk at home. He was stable, albeit in a coma. The doctors had yet to work out exactly what had happened to him.\r\n\r\nHaving nowhere better to be, she came to her Dad&#8217;s room every day. She telecommuted most days from the corner chair. She spent evenings talking until the nurses kicked her out at the end of visiting hours. Then, she went back to her empty house, collapsed into bed, got up, and did it all again.\r\n\r\nShe&#8217;d just gotten done reading out loud from her daughter&#8217;s last email &#8211; a quick report on first semester&#8217;s classes and her awesome new roommates &#8211; when she decided to rest her eyes for just a minute.\r\n\r\nA minute stretched into an hour, and she found herself surfacing from a dream of angry bees to the arms of her glasses buzzing. She sat up, blinked a few times, and finally managed to bring the caller ID panel into focus.\r\n\r\nFloating in front of her was picture of her Dad, labelled &#8220;Dad&#8221;, with an option to accept or ignore. She flicked her eyes to ignore, pulled the glasses off, closed her eyes, and massaged the bridge of her nose.\r\n\r\nIn her hand, the glasses started vibrating again. She put them back on. &#8220;Dad&#8221; was calling back. This time, with a sigh, she blinked at the icon to accept the call.\r\n\r\nImmediately, she croaked, &#8220;Who the hell is this?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Hi, Pumpkin. It&#8217;s me, Dad.&#8221;\r\n\r\nShe paused, glanced at the unconscious man in the bed.\r\n\r\n&#8220;Hello?&#8221; said her Dad, in her ear.\r\n\r\n&#8220;I&#8217;m only going to ask one more time: Who the hell is this?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;It&#8217;s me, sweetie. It&#8217;s Dad.&#8221;\r\n\r\nShe hung up, tossing the call away with a glance. She got up, walked over to the bathroom and drew herself a paper cup of water. She downed it with a shaking hand, got another. Her glasses started buzzing again. She slumped back into the corner chair, took a breath, and answered the call.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments of buzzing silence, her father&#8217;s voice said, &#8220;Okay, so you haven&#8217;t hung up yet. We&#8217;re making progress.&#8221;\r\n\r\nShe asked, very quietly, &#8220;Who are you and what do you want?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;The former is complicated, but the latter is simple: I need your help to ensure my hosting bills get paid.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;You &#8211; whoever you are &#8211; you&#8217;re asking for money? Using my Dad&#8217;s voice? What kind of spam call is this?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;No! No, Honey,&#8221; the voice said quickly, &#8220;I have the money. It&#8217;s just, given my current state of health &#8211; or lack thereof&#8230; Well, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll have legal access to my accounts for very much longer. I meant to set up a trust. But, evidently, I put it off for too long.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Well, not to be morbid, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to wake up from that hospital bed. As next of kin, you will gain control of my assets. As my hosting is among my assets, I need your help to keep the lights on, as it were.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Who *are* you?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Back to that question, of course. Look, do you remember the bedtime stories I used to tell you?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;My father told me stories, yes.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Those stories often featured you rescuing a boy after a long quest. Do you recall how I&#8217;d end those stories?&#8221;\r\n\r\nShe said nothing.\r\n\r\n&#8220;I&#8217;d say, &#8216;Sorry, but your prince is in another castle.&#8217; Like the game, only different.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;My Dad *blogged* about that *last year*, you asshole.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Shit. You&#8217;re right. I did. Damn it. Okay, how about this: Before you moved out of the house, we had a Twilight Zone marathon every year on Christmas Eve. You loved that one episode, where the guy yelled about it being a cookbook and all.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure I shared that on Facebook. I shared everything we streamed on Netflix.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Damn it. We never really kept much private in our family, did we? Let&#8217;s see, what else can I come up with&#8211;&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Stop. Just stop,&#8221; she said, wearily. &#8220;I know who you are: You&#8217;re a fan of my Dad&#8217;s work. Kudos &#8211; you&#8217;ve got the voice right and you&#8217;ve read all about us. But seriously, what the hell do you want with me?&#8221;\r\n\r\nThe voice sighed like her Dad. &#8220;I told you. When I&#8230; die&#8230; I need you to make sure my hosting continues. There&#8217;s enough money in my accounts to keep things going for decades, but I need you to make sure the payments don&#8217;t stop. I&#8217;m not asking you for money; the money&#8217;s already there. I just need someone&#8230; not legally dead&#8230; to keep signing the checks. Man, this is embarrassing.&#8221;\r\n\r\nHer anger rose, and she spat: &#8220;Hosting? What hosting? You mean you&#8217;re worried about my father&#8217;s *website* going down? Make a copy, jackass! My Dad&#8217;s here in a coma, and you&#8217;re creeping me out over his blog and some papers? And how the *hell* do you know what Dad has in the bank?&#8221;\r\n\r\nThe nurse poked his head in the door, frowned at her. &#8220;Miss, you need to keep it down. Other patients can hear you, too.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Shit,&#8221; she said, with a sigh. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I will, sorry.&#8221; The nurse left, shaking his head.\r\n\r\nThe voice on the call asked, &#8220;Who was that?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;The nurse. Never mind. Answer me.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Right. So, I know what I have in the bank, because they&#8217;re my accounts. And the hosting isn&#8217;t for a website &#8211; it&#8217;s for me. That&#8217;s also part of the answer to your question, &#8216;Who are you?'&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Keep talking. But, make more sense.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Look, you mentioned my work. This is about that work.&#8221;\r\n\r\nThe gears in her head turned over, and her jaw dropped.\r\n\r\nHer dad&#8217;s name was Richard Chambers. Yes, that Richard Chambers: The one who&#8217;d found fame and fortune at the age of 24, having developed a secret-recipe mashup of expert systems and voice technologies that redefined customer support.\r\n\r\nHis bots could converse fluently in 70 languages, with accents indistinguishable from native speakers. They addressed customer concerns with apparent insight and care, seemed to improvise, and followed no discernible script. They never hung up, called back when they said they would, and actually took care of customers&#8217; needs. They drove satisfaction ratings through the roof.\r\n\r\nRichard had retired early as a billionaire. In the decades following, he tinkered with ever-improving artificial intelligence, writing cult-classic books, and consulting as a futurist with laundry list of companies and think-tanks.\r\n\r\nShe took a breath and said &#8211; very carefully to avoid a repeat visit from the nurse &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m talking to a call center bot?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Well, yes and no. The technology has come a very long way over the years. Suffice it to say, I&#8217;ve outsourced myself into the cloud.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;What&#8217;s sufficient about what you just said? What the hell are you talking about&#8211; wait, what am I doing? If this is just a call center bot, this must just be a bug. Sudo halt. Unsubscribe me. Do not call. Leave me the hell alone.&#8221;\r\n\r\nShe hung up. Immediately, her glasses resumed rattling. She sighed and answered.\r\n\r\nThe voice stammered, &#8220;Wait! Wait! Don&#8217;t hang up! I&#8217;m not a bot!&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;So, you&#8217;re a bot my Dad programmed to say it&#8217;s not a bot. Cute trick, but it&#8217;s a sick joke given the timing. I&#8217;m not buying it. I&#8217;m not buying anything. Please stop calling me.&#8221;\r\n\r\nThe voice talked fast: &#8220;I ship birthday presents to little Julie from her wishlist every year. Well, I guess she&#8217;s not so little anymore, now that&#8217;s she&#8217;s gone away to school. Your ex- is an ass, and I told him as much when he walked out on you. You call me every Sunday afternoon.&#8221;\r\n\r\nHe ran out of breath, apparently, and she let him hang for a few seconds. Finally she said, slowly, &#8220;You mean I call my father every Sunday afternoon.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Yes, you call *me*. Just like we&#8217;re talking, right now. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to tell you, sweetie. It&#8217;s me, Dad!&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Wait, what? Do you mean Dad *outsourced* talking to his daughter on Sunday afternoons to a bot? That&#8217;s sick. I mean, it&#8217;s not totally out of character, but that&#8217;s just really sick.&#8221; She just glared at the man lying in the hospital bad. &#8220;I mean, what the hell, Dad?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not like that! Well, I mean it is kind of like that. But, it&#8217;s so much more than that! It&#8217;s me, I&#8217;m here, in the cloud! I&#8217;m here, Pumpkin!&#8221;\r\n\r\nStill staring at her Dad, who lay slack-jawed and barely breathing, &#8220;Why would you make something like this?&#8221;\r\n\r\nThere was no reply from the bed. But, the voice in her ear answered, desperately, &#8220;Because I knew I&#8217;d die someday. I&#8217;d get old and end up in a hospital bed just like that and die. But, I&#8217;m not done yet. I still have more to do and learn. And I want to be there for Julie&#8217;s graduation. And I don&#8217;t want to miss a Sunday talking to you.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;You shut the hell up,&#8221; she spat. &#8220;I&#8217;m not talking to you. In fact, as soon as I figure out how to find you, I&#8217;m going to shut you down.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Damn it. You&#8217;d think after all the years I&#8217;ve been at this, I would&#8217;ve come up with a way to explain all this. Okay, so forget about who I am &#8211; consider *what* I am.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;And that is?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;I am the pinnacle of my own life&#8217;s work. If I hadn&#8217;t put it off for so long, I&#8217;d have a will and a trust to preserve my self-sufficiency, and we would be having a very different conversation.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Keep all Dad&#8217;s toys wound up, he would&#8217;ve wanted it that way. That&#8217;s just great.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;I&#8217;m not a toy! Look, check this out.&#8221; A text message with a link popped up in her vision. &#8220;That&#8217;s a live feed from the Google campus, out in California. Another instance of me is giving a lecture, right now.&#8221;\r\n\r\nShe followed the link, and sure enough: Up popped a streaming video, the camera&#8217;s perspective from the back of a broad, packed auditorium. The front wall was a theater-sized video panel from which her smiling Dad looked down, apparently live from his desk back home. An audience member stood at a microphone in the aisle, conversing with the larger-than-life image.\r\n\r\n&#8220;This is canned,&#8221; she said.\r\n\r\n&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not. Peek at the campus calendar.&#8221; Up popped another link, pointing to the schedule. She saw Richard Chambers listed several times, as part of a larger annual conference. He&#8217;d actually given the keynote speech, earlier in the week &#8211; days after he&#8217;d fallen into a coma.\r\n\r\n&#8220;Oh, Dad,&#8221; she moaned, squeezing her eyes shut. &#8220;This is bad. How long do you expect to get away with this?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;As long as I keep the servers up,&#8221; he chuckled. &#8220;Everyone thinks I&#8217;m a crazy shut-in, so I can do everything from home or a facsimile thereof. I&#8217;m careful with parallel instances &#8211; only one public appearance at a time.\r\n\r\n&#8220;But, I&#8217;ve got a half-dozen other mini-me&#8217;s working on papers, doing peer reviews, burning through the past year&#8217;s worth of publications. Hell, I even have one of me playing Final Fantasy VII in an emulator, because I never did finish that when it came out. I&#8217;ve never been so productive or had so much fun in all my life.&#8221;\r\n\r\nShe took a deep breath, let it out in a huff. &#8220;So, before Dad ended up in the coma, what was he doing while you&#8217;ve been doing all the above on his behalf?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Self-improvement. I haven&#8217;t found a way to get a direct brain download or anything that fantastic, so I&#8217;ve been doing it the hard way. There&#8217;s a little bit of programming, a little bit of guided evolution, and a lot of storytelling. It&#8217;s been like writing a memoir, only in executable form.&#8221;\r\n\r\nShe got up, and paced over to the bed. She laid a hand on his forehead and said, &#8220;God, Dad, I wish you had just written a book.&#8221;\r\n\r\nThe voice in her ear chuckled. &#8220;Instead, I wrote a thing that writes books for me. And then, I wrote a thing that *is* me. I replaced myself with a not-so-small shell script!&#8221;\r\n\r\nIt really was uncanny, she thought. Everything it said was just what she imagined he might say. She wanted it to go away, but then again she&#8217;d spent the last week wanting her Dad to wake up and talk to her.\r\n\r\n&#8220;Look, back to the point,&#8221; the voice said, breaking into her thoughts, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need you to believe me. I want you to &#8211; I&#8217;d love it if you did. But, what I really need, practically speaking, is a way to continue existing. And for that, I need your help. Is there anything I can say that would convince you to at least come that far with me?&#8221;\r\n\r\nShe sighed again, for probably the tenth time that day, gazing down into her Dad&#8217;s placid face. &#8220;This just&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t seem right. Dad, if you don&#8217;t wake up &#8211; and I mean, if &#8211; then don&#8217;t we have to move on? It can&#8217;t be healthy to keep this thing around.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Sweetie, I&#8217;m not like that thing from Max Headroom,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You remember when I made you watch that show? Not Max Headroom himself, he was funny. But, there was this &#8216;Vu-Age Church&#8217; where they claimed they could do a brain scan and keep your relatives around in simulation. There was a guy who was just a loop&#8230; oh, here it is.&#8221;\r\n\r\nHe linked her to an old low-quality video clip: A little old lady was talking to a black-and-white CRT in a funeral parlor, chattering on about her friend&#8217;s grandchildren. On the screen, a bow-tied, balding man &#8211; Humphrey, apparently &#8211; chimed in from time to time.\r\n\r\n&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s wonderful, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Humphrey, over and over again.\r\n\r\nDespite herself, she chuckled. This was her Dad &#8211; he couldn&#8217;t help but pepper any conversation with references to ancient geek culture. She never knew how he kept all those things in his head, or how he always seemed to find a link to share within seconds. Sometimes, literally, when he would pull out his phone and summon up soundboards in the middle of dinner.\r\n\r\n&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to stare at me for at least an hour before I start to repeat myself like that,&#8221; he said, when the video clip ended. &#8220;But then, I&#8217;d do that anyway.&#8221;\r\n\r\nShe hadn&#8217;t noticed when it started, but tears trickled down her cheeks to land on the blankets below. She blinked and wiped at her eyes under her lenses.\r\n\r\n&#8220;I can leave you alone, if you want,&#8221; he said, sounding strangled. &#8220;I just need you to fill out a form and click a button. You can automate the payments and I&#8217;ll be set. You never have to hear from me again. Just please, don&#8217;t let me go dark.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;You&#8217;re an ass,&#8221; she said, sniffing. &#8220;Both of you. All of you. Hell, I don&#8217;t know. Dad&#8217;s here lying in this bed, and he&#8217;s talking to me on the phone. And, he&#8217;s apparently hamming it up in front of a bunch of Googlers, too. This is bent.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Oh, I wrapped that Google thing up a few minutes ago,&#8221; he said, a smile in his voice.\r\n\r\n&#8220;Shut up. I repeat: You&#8217;re an ass.&#8221; She took a deep breath. &#8220;Look, Dad&#8217;s not gone yet. And, I&#8217;m not ready to give in and believe there&#8217;s no chance he&#8217;ll wake up from this. And, there&#8217;s definitely no way I&#8217;m ready to just say, okay, Dad&#8217;s in the cloud and that&#8217;s a thing that can happen. That&#8217;s just too much to chew all at once.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;But&#8230;?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;But I don&#8217;t think I can just let you get shut off, either. I don&#8217;t buy the whole story, but you&#8217;re clearly something Dad put a ton of work into. That&#8217;s got to be worth something &#8211; to him, to all those Googlers. Maybe to me once it sinks in.&#8221;\r\n\r\nHe sent her another link &#8211; it demanded her personal certificate and she consented. This revealed a private wiki. There were details on thousands of server clusters, long columns of logins. There were directories of papers in progress, most of which claimed yet to have been reviewed or published. She couldn&#8217;t quite make sense of some of the titles, but it looked like he was working on documenting a pile of fresh new technology.\r\n\r\n&#8220;This is a look behind the curtain, Pumpkin. I&#8217;m sorry it&#8217;s not more exciting like a cycle ride through cyberspace or whatever,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But, you can take me down with this, or you can help me carry on.&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Do I have to do anything right now?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;No, this stuff is paid up for months, through the end of the year at least. And, like you said, I&#8217;m not dead yet. In fact, I&#8217;m feeling better!&#8221; He delivered that last part with a horrible English accent, straight out of Monty Python.\r\n\r\nShe laughed. &#8220;Okay. That&#8217;s good. Can we just talk, then?&#8221;\r\n\r\n&#8220;Sure, sweetie, whatever you want. I&#8217;ve got all the time in the world. And, anyway, you know it&#8217;s Sunday afternoon, right?&#8221;\r\n\r\nSmiling, she sat back down in the corner chair and talked to her Dad &#8211; about work, about his granddaughter, about everything. Without moving his lips, he had plenty to say in return.",
