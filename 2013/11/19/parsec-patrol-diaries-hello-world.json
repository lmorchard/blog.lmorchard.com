Last month&#8217;s stuff is boring to write about, though. Meanwhile, today&#8217;s stuff is fresh and exciting. But, since I&#8217;ve told myself that I should write about all the things, I feel obligated to go back and do the chores first. So, nothing gets written.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n  <a href=\"http://www.memecenter.com/search/procrastination\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://global3.memecdn.com/_o_102096.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"407\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    Bah.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>But, wait! It just occurred to me that I can do whatever I want! <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5diMImYIIA\">I can totally have pudding before I have any meat.</a> So, I can go all non-linear and just start writing about whatever seems fun, in whatever order strikes my fancy.</p>\n<p>Take that, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=internal+critic\">internal editor / critic</a>.
