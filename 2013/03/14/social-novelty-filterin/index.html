  So, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">they&#8217;re finally shutting down Google Reader</a>, huh? It&#8217;s sad, but unsurprising. It&#8217;s obvious they didn&#8217;t really have a strategic place for it in the Google+ universe, and it just was just neglected <a href=" http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/11/01/readerpocalypse">since the Sharepocalypse</a>. Kill off the key social synergy of hosting a centralized news reader, and it&#8217;s no wonder you&#8217;ll see usage decline.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I&#8217;ve been running <a href="https://github.com/gothfox/Tiny-Tiny-RSS">Tiny Tiny RSS</a> on my own server since Google killed off in-product sharing. So, I won&#8217;t be too terribly affected by the shutdown personally. I think my wife still uses Google Reader, having moved after the demise of Bloglines. If she likes the looks of TT-RSS, I&#8217;ll set her up with an account too.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  But, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/13/google-reader-sunset">Marco</a> and <a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/goodbyeGoogleReader">Dave</a> have it right: This will probably be a good thing for RSS. The problem has been that Google Reader was <em>just</em> good enough to lull me out of scratching my own itch. This is coming from the guy who wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764597582?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&c%0D%0Areative=9325&creativeASIN=0764597582">a 600 page book on RSS and Atom</a> out of love for the tech. So, I&#8217;m sure I won&#8217;t be the only one poking around code archives and blowing dust off old repositories.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  So, this is the itch I&#8217;d love to scratch in the post-Google-Reader age: Reader-before-Plus offered <strong><em>social novelty filtering</em></strong>. That is, fast sharing within the product fueled reciprocal feeds of novelty, filtered by my &#8220;friends&#8221;, presented in the same news reading interface as my other bazillion feeds from the web at large.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  That feature worked so well, in fact, that <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2010/12/18/less-del-icio-us-than-ever-before">it lured me away from using del.icio.us</a>—a service I liked so much that I wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470037857?ie=UTF8&tag=0xdecafbad01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&%0D%0Acreative=9325&creativeASIN=0470037857">a 350 page book</a> about it and <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/24/go-west-young-man">moved out of state</a> so I could work there.
</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, I know: You can &#8220;share&#8221; to Facebook, to Twitter, even to Google+—that&#8217;s why Google killed in-product sharing on Reader, after all. I do that on occasion, and that&#8217;s how a lot of people get their streams of novelty. But, it&#8217;s nowhere near the same thing, neither in quality nor in quantity.</p>
<p>The thing about these &#8220;friends&#8221; on Google Reader was that we never interacted directly. It was refreshing, it was great. No small talk, no conflicts, no getting in each others&#8217; virtual faces—we just mutually harnessed slices of each others&#8217; minds to build intelligent streams of novelty.</p>
<p>That might sound cold or mechanical or exploitative—but the thing is, there are plenty of other outlets for interpersonal exchange, and I even met up with some of my Reader &#8220;friends&#8221; out-of-band there too. But, those channels are <em>about</em> you and me, we&#8217;re the objects of interest &amp; the stars of the show. There are very few channels that are <em>about</em> shared novelty as the object of interest, where you and I can get ourselves out of the way and conspire to surface cool things.</p>
<p>(And, of those channels that <em>do</em> exist—<a href="http://pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>, for example, maybe <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>—I&#8217;m not a big fan of the UI vs <em>ye olde Reader</em>. Still, magic &amp; strange loops can emerge from recursion &amp; re-entrant flows; your mileage may vary. See also: <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/robf4/googles-lost-social-network">Google&#8217;s Lost Social Network</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="distributed-social-novelty-filtering"><span id="Distributed_social_novelty_filtering">Distributed social novelty filtering</span></h3>
<p>So anyway, I&#8217;m probably going to play around with the machinery of feed aggregation again. But, one of the things I really would like to see as a <em>thing</em> out there is <strong><em>distributed social novelty filtering</em></strong>. How do you do that? Well, the first half of it is pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>In feed readers, implement a one-click &#8220;share&#8221; button on every item. Maybe offer an optional field for comment.</li>
<li>Offer a public feed of every &#8220;shared&#8221; item, easily discoverable from a public profile.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, my installation of TT-RSS offers <a href="http://decafbad.com/tt-rss/public.php?op=rss&amp;id=-2&amp;key=6fa5a3a996809d4df9a357bd7c62efc464c8d147">a feed of my &#8220;shared&#8221; items</a>—albeit not in a very discoverable way. I also funnel craptons of material into <a href="http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:deusx/">my pinboard.in feed</a>, but mainly for personal archiving and search. Even Pinterest has <a href="http://pinterest.com/lmorchard/feed.rss">a feed for me</a>, though I barely use it.</p>
<p><a href="http://links.scripting.com/rss.xml">Dave Winer</a> and <a href="http://waxy.org/links/index.xml">Andy Baio</a> maintain linkblogs with feeds—those fit nicely into this scheme, and I follow them both in my reader.</p>
<p>The other half is where some innovation could stand to happen: The obvious thing is to just get yourself a new RSS reader and subscribe to all the shared-item feeds of your &#8220;friends&#8221;.</p>
<p>But, there&#8217;s a lot more to be done here:</p>
<ul>
<li>discover and follow &#8220;friends&#8221; across services,</li>
<li>de-duplicate shared items by URL,</li>
<li>rank items by counting shares,</li>
<li>construct discussion threads from shares</li>
</ul>
<p>Go nuts, please! Someone form a startup and take my money to solve this, so I don&#8217;t have to. Even better, release some open source so I can host it myself and maybe even contribute some code. I&#8217;m thinking about doing some of this, but my lack of sustained attention span for projects is <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast">well documented</a>.</p>
<p>But, the important thing here is that it&#8217;s <strong><em>distributed</em></strong> and a <em>thing</em> that&#8217;s conventionally done out there on the web. This shouldn&#8217;t be constrained to a single vendor&#8217;s silo ever again, because that allowed a single vendor to kill it dead and I miss it terribly.</p>
