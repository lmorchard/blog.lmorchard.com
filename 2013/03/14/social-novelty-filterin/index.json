But, those channels are <em>about</em> you and me, we&#8217;re the objects of interest &amp; the stars of the show. There are very few channels that are <em>about</em> shared novelty as the object of interest, where you and I can get ourselves out of the way and conspire to surface cool things.</p>\n<p>(And, of those channels that <em>do</em> exist—<a href=\"http://pinterest.com/\">Pinterest</a>, for example, maybe <a href=\"http://tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a>—I&#8217;m not a big fan of the UI vs <em>ye olde Reader</em>.

I also funnel craptons of material into <a href=\"http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:deusx/\">my pinboard.in feed</a>, but mainly for personal archiving and search. Even Pinterest has <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/lmorchard/feed.rss\">a feed for me</a>, though I barely use it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://links.scripting.com/rss.xml\">Dave Winer</a> and <a href=\"http://waxy.org/links/index.xml\">Andy Baio</a> maintain linkblogs with feeds—those fit nicely into this scheme, and I follow them both in my reader.</p>\n<p>The other half is where some innovation could stand to happen: The obvious thing is to just get yourself a new RSS reader and subscribe to all the shared-item feeds of your &#8220;friends&#8221;.</p>\n<p>But, there&#8217;s a lot more to be done here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>discover and follow &#8220;friends&#8221; across services,</li>\n<li>de-duplicate shared items by URL,</li>\n<li>rank items by counting shares,</li>\n<li>construct discussion threads from shares</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Go nuts, please! Someone form a startup and take my money to solve this, so I don&#8217;t have to. Even better, release some open source so I can host it myself and maybe even contribute some code.
