          <p>I like animals, and I&#8217;ve been told that I&#8217;m good with them. I&#8217;d like to think that&#8217;s due to a mix of empathy and respect that I&#8217;ve developed over the years.</p>
<p>It occurred to me the other day that my favorite online services treat me like I imagine my pets like to be treated.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>It might be worth noting we have cats and rabbits, which are both rather independent kinds of critters. That said, being treated like a pet might sound demeaning. But, consider these pointers for being nice to animals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give them a reason to come to you. Don&#8217;t chase after and grab.</li>
<li>If they want to leave, let them. Don&#8217;t hold on and squeeze tight.</li>
<li>If you are allowed to pick them up, hold them gently yet offer enough support to make them feel safe.</li>
<li>Pay attention to their reactions, learn what kind of attention they like. This gives them a reason to come back when you let them leave.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider the above with respect to <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, a service I use more every day:</p>
<ul>
<li>They give me a place to put my files, like a thumb drive installed all the time on all my computers regardless of vendor or OS.</li>
<li>I can quit Dropbox whenever I want &#8211; all my files are safe on multiple hard drives, and won&#8217;t disappear if Dropbox goes away.</li>
<li>Dropbox has never lost a file, never spammed me, never done anything that suggested they&#8217;re spying on me. I mean, they could, but they haven&#8217;t. I also asked a support question once &#8211; they answered it.</li>
<li>The people at Dropbox keep doing more of the above, and releasing things like <a href="https://tech.dropbox.com/2012/08/some-love-for-javascript-applications-2/">the JavaScript API</a> that makes them useful for <a target="_blank" title="web apps" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Apps?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn">web apps</a> I like building.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can tell a similar story about <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>, the service I use for comments here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disqus takes care of my comments and keep spam away. They were easy to set up with a WordPress plugin.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disqus-comment-system/">official WordPress plugin</a> mirrors every comment into my site&#8217;s database. I can turn off the service at any moment without a problem.</li>
<li>Disqus <a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/666278-introducing-promoted-discovery-and-f-a-q-">does run some advertising and off-site recommendations alongside my content</a>. But, even though I could turn it off, I haven&#8217;t because it seems like a genuinely interesting aspect of the service. They&#8217;re also quick to answer questions.</li>
<li>Disqus continues to work well, add features I like, and have yet to disappoint me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, how about <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a>? They&#8217;re neck-and-neck with Dropbox for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>They store all my random thoughts &amp; notes, make them available on all my computers regardless of vendor or OS.</li>
<li>I can backup or export my notes and quit whenever I want, and they&#8217;re stored on all my computers.</li>
<li>Evernote hasn&#8217;t done anything nasty with my notes, and have only ever made gentle suggestions that I pay or use other services.</li>
<li>The Evernote team just keep improving things &#8211; and every time I switch to something like <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/02/19/notational-velocity-simplenote-and-dropbox-bring-child-like-wo/">Notational Velocity on Dropbox</a>, I find myself coming back.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that&#8217;s it: Just a quick handful of thoughts that occurred to me when I was on a walk. I&#8217;m not entirely sure how this translates into execution and a successful business, but I know I like it when it works out this way.</p>
<p>Might be interesting to muse on this further: Sometimes being treated like a pet is a trap. Sometimes it&#8217;s demeaning. I&#8217;m not entirely sure it&#8217;s a good thing all the time, mostly my point in this post is to describe the feeling.</p>
