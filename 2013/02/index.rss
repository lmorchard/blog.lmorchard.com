          <title>Too long? Read anyway.</title>
          <description>Wherein I rant at medium length about functional literacy and language competency in knowledge work and information technology.</description>

          <title>Looking for a Django app to manage Roles within Groups</title>
          <description>I want to add some team-based features to django-badger. I was hoping that someone had already built a reusable app to do most of the work for me. This happens quite a lot when I’m working with Django. Unfortunately, I haven’t quite found what I’m looking for yet. Consider this blog post either the product of my thinking out loud toward a rough spec, or a long-winded lazyweb search query.</description>

          <title>KumaScript: Bringing scripting to the wiki bears</title>
          <description>KumaScript turned one year old back at the end of January, and I’m sad to say no one celebrated its birthday – not even me. I’m pretty sure very few people outside of the core team at the Mozilla Developer Network even know what KumaScript is. So, I guess it’s about time I do something about that.</description>

          <title>Building my couch computing station</title>
          <description>Remember when I posted about gaming from the Orchard House couch? The key part was figuring out how to get a laptop-quality LCD monitor working in the living room, preferably attached to my trusty IKEA DAVE. Well, despite my best attempts at ruining my materials and tools, I managed to get it built!</description>
