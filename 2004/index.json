This is a sort of rough sketch of the loosely-joined architecture I want to explore with this thing.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Data</em>: This is where address book entries live.</li>\n<li><em>Model</em>: A set of objects encapsulating the data, this is how address book entries will be accessed.</li>\n<li><em>REST API</em>: Model objects exposed as resources identified by URI, serialized and deserialized as XML, and manipulated by GET / PUT / POST / DELETE methods.</li>\n<li><em>XSLT Filter</em>: XML data produced by REST API calls can be first passed through XSL at a given URL before being served up as a response.  </li>\n<li><em>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</em>: Thanks to the XSLT filter layer, the XML vocabulary used to describe address book entries can be transformed into user interface presentation.</li>\n<li><em>HTTP</em>: Everything happens via HTTP...</li>\n<li><em>Web Browser Client</em>: ...and everything is viewed in a web browser.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, I call this a loosely-joined architecture because I want to stress that you should be able to swap out just about any part of this whenever you want.  </p>\n<p>Want the <em>Data</em> to be in MySQL?  Fine.  Want it to be in flat files?  Fine.  Just make sure the <em>Model</em> can cope while maintaining a consistent interface for the <em>REST API*.  Want to change the user interface in the browser?  Great-- ideally, all you have to do is change some XSLT files.  I&#39;m writing everything from the *XSLT Filter</em> down to the <em>Model</em> in Python.  Don&#39;t like that?  Fine.  Rewrite it all in Perl, and hopefully everything from the XSLT up to the browser will still be useful to you.</p>\n<p>At some point, you might even want to ditch the browser for a native desktop client.  Fabulous! Just ignore everything past the <em>REST API</em> and <em>HTTP</em>, don&#39;t use any XSLT in the <em>Filter</em>, and use the API and XML directly.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t think any of this is particularly revolutionary-- although I thought it was when I first saw Amazon Web Services doing some of this, and I hope to throw a little GMail in as well.  I hope that this will all be useful as I muddle through explaining what I&#39;m doing.

    "summary": "<img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/12/abook-architecture.jpg\" align=\"right\">\n\n<p>So, in the spirit of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/11/30/picoprojects_and_trepanation\">pico-projects</a>, I&apos;ve started building <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/11/30/nextgenwebapps\">that address book application</a> I mentioned awhile ago and I want to start writing about it as I go.</p>\n<p>First off, hopefully you&apos;ll notice the quick diagram I threw together in OmniGraffle.  This is a sort of rough sketch of the loosely-joined architecture I want to explore with this thing.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Data</em>: This is where address book entries live.</li>\n<li><em>Model</em>: A set of objects encapsulating the data, this is how address book entries will be accessed.</li>\n<li><em>REST API</em>: Model objects exposed as resources identified by URI, serialized and deserialized as XML, and manipulated by GET / PUT / POST / DELETE methods.</li>\n<li><em>XSLT Filter</em>: XML data produced by REST API calls can be first passed through XSL at a given URL before being served up as a response.  </li>\n<li><em>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</em>: Thanks to the XSLT filter layer, the XML vocabulary used to describe address book entries can be transformed into user interface presentation.</li>\n<li><em>HTTP</em>: Everything happens via HTTP...</li>\n<li><em>Web Browser Client</em>: ...and everything is viewed in a web browser.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, I call this a loosely-joined architecture because I want to stress that you should be able to swap out just about any part of this whenever you want.  </p>\n<p>Want the <em>Data</em> to be in MySQL?  Fine.  Want it to be in flat files?  Fine.  Just make sure the <em>Model</em> can cope while maintaining a consistent interface for the <em>REST API*.  Want to change the user interface in the browser?  Great-- ideally, all you have to do is change some XSLT files.  I&apos;m writing everything from the *XSLT Filter</em> down to the <em>Model</em> in Python.  Don&apos;t like that?  Fine.  Rewrite it all in Perl, and hopefully everything from the XSLT up to the browser will still be useful to you.</p>\n<p>At some point, you might even want to ditch the browser for a native desktop client.  Fabulous! Just ignore everything past the <em>REST API</em> and <em>HTTP</em>, don&apos;t use any XSLT in the <em>Filter</em>, and use the API and XML directly.</p>\n<p>I don&apos;t think any of this is particularly revolutionary-- although I thought it was when I first saw Amazon Web Services doing some of this, and I hope to throw a little GMail in as well.  I hope that this will all be useful as I muddle through explaining what I&apos;m doing.  In the meantime, you can see me getting the stage set as I start checking things into my Subversion repository over here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/svn/trunk/hacks/abook/\">http://www.decafbad.com/svn/trunk/hacks/abook/</a></li></ul>"

We had cool ansi-graphic art. We had doors games. Trade Wars, BRE, and some others. We had a download section but not much was on it. And we ran Fidonet (sort of like Usenet but using a different protocol and shared among BBSes), Vnet (RPG-oriented net that used Fido technology), and CandyNet (also RPG-centric net that used Fido tech). This was a great hobby, I had lots of fun. But, it seems like in this day and age, I'd rather just run a web site than try to do a full fledged BBS. What could I really offer using BBS software that I can't do on a website? Other than maybe doors games, but I'd rather play World of Warcraft or Half-Life 2 multi than those.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086442\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c80cacc8feb903332fc8939c80ae495e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">ArcAiN6</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086442\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-05T20:02:16\">2006-09-05T20:02:16</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Synchronet is easy peasy, i'm currently running it, and i love the thing.. :)</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

We had cool ansi-graphic art. We had doors games. Trade Wars, BRE, and some others. We had a download section but not much was on it. And we ran Fidonet (sort of like Usenet but using a different protocol and shared among BBSes), Vnet (RPG-oriented net that used Fido technology), and CandyNet (also RPG-centric net that used Fido tech). This was a great hobby, I had lots of fun. But, it seems like in this day and age, I'd rather just run a web site than try to do a full fledged BBS. What could I really offer using BBS software that I can't do on a website? Other than maybe doors games, but I'd rather play World of Warcraft or Half-Life 2 multi than those.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086442\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c80cacc8feb903332fc8939c80ae495e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">ArcAiN6</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086442\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-05T20:02:16\">2006-09-05T20:02:16</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Synchronet is easy peasy, i'm currently running it, and i love the thing.. :)</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

    "summary": "<blockquote>Synchronet Bulletin Board System Software is a free software package that can turn your personal computer into your own custom online service supporting multiple simultaneous users with hierarchical message and file areas, multi-user chat, and the ever-popular BBS door games.\n<br><br>\n...\n<br><br>\nIn November of 1999, the author found a renewed interest in further developing Synchronet, specifically for the Internet community, embracing and integrating standard Internet protocols such as Telnet, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IRC, NNTP, and HTTP. Synchronet has since been substantially redesigned as an Internet-only BBS package for Win32 and Unix-x86 platforms and is an Open Source project under continuous development.</blockquote>\n<div align=\"right\"><small>Source: <cite><a href=\"http://www.synchro.net/\">Synchronet BBS Software</a></cite></small></div>\n\n<p>This software deserves <em>so</em> much more attention.  It&apos;s like an old-school BBS, complete with ASCII/ANSI menu screens and everything, but it&apos;s been modernized:  It offers a slew of Internet protocols integrated with the message bases and file areas.  It&apos;s got an HTTP daemon with server-side JavaScript.  It works on Win32 and various Unix platforms.  Everything above is true.  And it&apos;s open source.</p>\n<p>In the 90&apos;s, I would have expected software like this to be at the core of a startup company stuffed with superfluous and overpaid code monkeys.  It would have turned into an Enterprise Application Server or Intranet Knowledge Management Solution-- a mini Domino or Lotus Notes.  And, in fact, I seem to remember seeing a few old-school BBS packages get mutated and gigantified by the dot-com radiation in this way.</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/02/15/ooooai\">keep meaning</a> to get a Synchronet BBS up and keep it up, and maybe get a few interested users logging in, if only for the retro-gaming experience for things like <a href=\"http://www.eisonline.com/TradeWars/\">Trade Wars</a>, <a href=\"http://www.johndaileysoftware.com/products/bbsdoors/barrenrealmselite/index.asp\">Barrent Realms Elite</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gameport.com/bbs/lord.html\">Legend of the Red Dragon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.johndaileysoftware.com/products/bbsdoors/globalwar/\">Global War</a>, and anything else I can find.</p>\n<p>I really miss the tidal-pool effect BBSes had back in the day, when in my area they were the first and best gateways to the Internet.  Direct SLIP and PPP access to the net were rare things still and, before the web took off, Usenet and IRC were some of the best things around.  But, anyone who wanted to get the the net had to wander through the local BBS first.  </p>\n<p>It was really neat to see the mish-mash of people all drawn together by geographic areas denoted by telco area codes.  The degree of Aspergers affliction and just plain dysfunctional nerdity gradually decreased as sisters and friends-of-sisters were introduced to terminal programs and teleconference.  It was sad to see all of this gradually die off as more and more callers came in via SLIP/PPP dialers and headed straight for the information superhighway on-ramps.

    "html": "<p>One thing I&#39;m really looking forward to is seeing the PC explode and turn inside out, like the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Home+Motor%22+%248.75+catalog+-domain&#38;btnG=Search\">Home Motor</a>.  The price of processors drops, while their power increases.  So far in computing, the processor has been a pricey central resource, demanding to be shared between programs and peripherals.  But soon, it won&#39;t be too far fetched to think of a processor as the least precious part.  In fact, computers could get so cheap as to be given away, while well-built tools and appliances--more than just <em>software</em> alone--become the valuable thing.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve already ditched a central desktop computer, and sometimes this makes me feel like I&#39;m living in the future.  I used to have a machine that I used for everything-- network services, web browsing, email, IM, file storage, movies, games, et al.  However, slowly but surely, all the things this one machine used to do for me are being split off into simpler, dedicated devices.  It&#39;s like all the internal organs of my old PC are being splattered throughout our apartment.</p>\n<p>At some point, my network services migrated into a dedicated Linux box, and now have gotten swallowed up by a <a href=\"http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=508&#38;scid=35\">Linksys WRT54G</a> wireless router.   It doesn&#39;t do anything other than perform firewall duties and manage my home network.  The Linux box still lives on as a file server, but pretty soon I&#39;ll be migrating those responsibilities onto a <a href=\"http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=33-124-036&#38;catalog=23&#38;manufactory=BROWSE\">Linksys NSLU2</a> Network Storage Link or maybe a <a href=\"http://www.revolutionstore.com/\">Kurobox</a>.  Which ever one I choose, that device will focus on managing my digital <em>stuff</em>.  In our living room, we&#39;ve got a slew of dedicated gaming consoles, including a modded XBox that plays music and movies from the file server in the basement.  </p>\n<p>What&#39;s great about this is that each device generally does just one thing, does it well, and does it without much fuss or interference with the workings of the other devices.  My internet connection or file server never goes down because a game crashed my computer, and maintenance of these focused devices is much simpler than looking after a single overloaded computer.  My primary personal machine at this point is an Apple PowerBook, which I still use for web, email, IM, general geek hackery, and the occasional session with Microsoft Office.  It&#39;s just a start, but I&#39;m sure this trend will continue as I find more things that can each be specialized out into its own separate appliance.  </p>\n<p>For instance, imagine an Office appliance: It wouldn&#39;t have much file storage--that&#39;s what my basement fileserver is for--but it would have more than enough memory and processor to run Office.  The whole Office <em>solution</em> (software, support, etc.) would be more valuable than the hardware to run it, so it might be simpler and easier for everyone involved (ie. the customer <em>and</em> Microsoft) to sell a fully configured and self-contained unit.  The Office user interface would be served up to my tablet display (maybe with a keyboard &#38; mouse) via something akin to X11.  The software would be installed as firmware on flash and would be the only thing running--no danger of DLL hell here.  </p>\n<p>Imagine something like the <a href=\"http://www.aarp.org/computers-hardware/Articles/a2003-05-20-mailstation.html\">MailStation</a>, but imagine it not sucking.  You could have a personal email server that just handles SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and spam filtering, with <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/\">Thunderbird</a> installed, dirt cheap.  </p>\n<p>Imagine other devices entirely devoted to news aggregation, or broadcatching, or pet-watching web cams.  It&#39;s starting to sound like a lot of expensive toys, but a pile of these devices would all cost less than the equivalent software running on a modern PC today.</p>\n<p>Now, think about interactions between appliances.  This isn&#39;t entirely fleshed out in my head, but I think attention here can go a long way toward solving some security issues present in PCs today.  Each appliance should be single-mindedly focused on its task, but if it needs functionality provided by another appliance, it should be able to negotiate for services.  Think of each appliance as having a role, and access to other appliances limited by role.</p>\n<p>What might happen if you pick up a nasty macro in a Word doc?  Say the macro wants to delete all of your files.  Well, you could have a current relationship between the file server and the Office appliance which limits access to only files in your current project.  The Office appliance would have no business pawing through yesterday&#39;s spreadsheets, your TurboTax records, or your home videos.  Maybe not perfect, but exposure could be limited.  </p>\n<p>Say instead the macro wants to fire off a million spam email messages.  Well, let&#39;s assume that email isn&#39;t a service of the Office appliance.  The first response to the macro would be, &quot;Uhh, what&#39;s email?&quot;  Maybe the Office appliance can&#39;t even conceive of a such thing as SMTP or port 25.  But then, say the macro author is smart enough to make Office look for a MailStation to ask for email transmission services.  At this point, the macro is stymied unless it can find a way to exploit a pre-existing relationship between Office and the MailStation to send a million email messages.</p>\n<p>More likely would be someone trying to compromise the MailStation via a maliciously-constructed email message.  But, in this case, maybe the single-task simplicity of the device would make it easier to prevent such exploit availability in the first place.  Avoid scriptable email transmission in a consumer device, watch out for buffer overruns or use managed code and virtual machines, reduce down to zero any possibility of sending an email without direct user input.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s a lot of work that would need to be done here to get the right balance between inter-appliance paranoia and end-user convenience, but I think that simpler task-focused devices isolated from each other but linked by task-centered agreements could go a long way toward killing the free-for-all playground environment spyware and virus authors have today.  Get all of the eggs out of one shared basket.  I expect some of the things I&#39;m thinking could be (and probably are) put in place today on general-purpose computers, but I have a lot of good hunches about benefits imparted by lots of simpler limited-purpose appliances.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086734\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=95ffb2598210ed1959f55d7a53f825dc&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\">Steve</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086734\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T17:27:05\">2004-12-13T17:27:05</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">TOTALLY agree on your thoughts on where computers/appliances will merge.\nI had the NSLU2, but just ordered this guy: http://www.furrygoat.com/2004/12/asus_wlan_hard_.html ..

The Router could swallow up your Linux Box, because the Router is supposed to do work in the background, it doesn't want interaction, this does not work for most of the things a PC is used for. I would say that the most interesting things \"being done\" with a PC actually need interaction (and thus an interface), the \"dumb\" background things are usually just supportive (or secondary) activities that are, well, secondary, and only ever have arisen as sub-tasks while trying to achieve primary purposes (things that require interaction).\nAll those primary purposes of a PC are interaction based, thus need display and input, and I don't think that people are willing to move to different displays and different input devices for every task they want to do. We have a lot of \"legacy devices\", that we are using a lot, because that's what we are used to, but I don't think they are going to multiply further, when we already have all the stuff at our fingertips.\nI would like to note that you are using a hacked X-Box, that is a specialized tool, re-programmed to be a (more) general purpose tool. \nThe fact that all of your machines are doing different things are self-imposed barriers, not hardware/software-limitations, which I think would makes a lot of people very skeptical.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "One thing I'm really looking forward to is seeing the PC explode and turn inside out, like the [Home Motor](http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Home+Motor%22+%248.75+catalog+-domain&#38;btnG=Search).  The price of processors drops, while their power increases.  So far in computing, the processor has been a pricey central resource, demanding to be shared between programs and peripherals.  But soon, it won't be too far fetched to think of a processor as the least precious part.  In fact, computers could get so cheap as to be given away, while well-built tools and appliances--more than just *software* alone--become the valuable thing.  \r\n\r\nI've already ditched a central desktop computer, and sometimes this makes me feel like I'm living in the future.  I used to have a machine that I used for everything-- network services, web browsing, email, IM, file storage, movies, games, et al.  However, slowly but surely, all the things this one machine used to do for me are being split off into simpler, dedicated devices.  It's like all the internal organs of my old PC are being splattered throughout our apartment.\r\n\r\nAt some point, my network services migrated into a dedicated Linux box, and now have gotten swallowed up by a [Linksys WRT54G](http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=508&#38;scid=35) wireless router.   It doesn't do anything other than perform firewall duties and manage my home network.  The Linux box still lives on as a file server, but pretty soon I'll be migrating those responsibilities onto a [Linksys NSLU2](http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=33-124-036&#38;catalog=23&#38;manufactory=BROWSE) Network Storage Link or maybe a [Kurobox](http://www.revolutionstore.com/).  Which ever one I choose, that device will focus on managing my digital *stuff*.  In our living room, we've got a slew of dedicated gaming consoles, including a modded XBox that plays music and movies from the file server in the basement.  \r\n\r\nWhat's great about this is that each device generally does just one thing, does it well, and does it without much fuss or interference with the workings of the other devices.  My internet connection or file server never goes down because a game crashed my computer, and maintenance of these focused devices is much simpler than looking after a single overloaded computer.  My primary personal machine at this point is an Apple PowerBook, which I still use for web, email, IM, general geek hackery, and the occasional session with Microsoft Office.  It's just a start, but I'm sure this trend will continue as I find more things that can each be specialized out into its own separate appliance.  \r\n\r\nFor instance, imagine an Office appliance: It wouldn't have much file storage--that's what my basement fileserver is for--but it would have more than enough memory and processor to run Office.  The whole Office *solution* (software, support, etc.) would be more valuable than the hardware to run it, so it might be simpler and easier for everyone involved (ie. the customer *and* Microsoft) to sell a fully configured and self-contained unit.  The Office user interface would be served up to my tablet display (maybe with a keyboard &#38; mouse) via something akin to X11.  The software would be installed as firmware on flash and would be the only thing running--no danger of DLL hell here.  \r\n\r\nImagine something like the [MailStation](http://www.aarp.org/computers-hardware/Articles/a2003-05-20-mailstation.html), but imagine it not sucking.  You could have a personal email server that just handles SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and spam filtering, with [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/) installed, dirt cheap.  \r\n\r\nImagine other devices entirely devoted to news aggregation, or broadcatching, or pet-watching web cams.  It's starting to sound like a lot of expensive toys, but a pile of these devices would all cost less than the equivalent software running on a modern PC today.\r\n\r\nNow, think about interactions between appliances.  This isn't entirely fleshed out in my head, but I think attention here can go a long way toward solving some security issues present in PCs today.  Each appliance should be single-mindedly focused on its task, but if it needs functionality provided by another appliance, it should be able to negotiate for services.  Think of each appliance as having a role, and access to other appliances limited by role.\r\n\r\nWhat might happen if you pick up a nasty macro in a Word doc?  Say the macro wants to delete all of your files.  Well, you could have a current relationship between the file server and the Office appliance which limits access to only files in your current project.  The Office appliance would have no business pawing through yesterday's spreadsheets, your TurboTax records, or your home videos.  Maybe not perfect, but exposure could be limited.  \r\n\r\nSay instead the macro wants to fire off a million spam email messages.  Well, let's assume that email isn't a service of the Office appliance.  The first response to the macro would be, \"Uhh, what's email?\"  Maybe the Office appliance can't even conceive of a such thing as SMTP or port 25.  But then, say the macro author is smart enough to make Office look for a MailStation to ask for email transmission services.  At this point, the macro is stymied unless it can find a way to exploit a pre-existing relationship between Office and the MailStation to send a million email messages.\r\n\r\nMore likely would be someone trying to compromise the MailStation via a maliciously-constructed email message.  But, in this case, maybe the single-task simplicity of the device would make it easier to prevent such exploit availability in the first place.  Avoid scriptable email transmission in a consumer device, watch out for buffer overruns or use managed code and virtual machines, reduce down to zero any possibility of sending an email without direct user input.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of work that would need to be done here to get the right balance between inter-appliance paranoia and end-user convenience, but I think that simpler task-focused devices isolated from each other but linked by task-centered agreements could go a long way toward killing the free-for-all playground environment spyware and virus authors have today.  Get all of the eggs out of one shared basket.  I expect some of the things I'm thinking could be (and probably are) put in place today on general-purpose computers, but I have a lot of good hunches about benefits imparted by lots of simpler limited-purpose appliances.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086734\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=95ffb2598210ed1959f55d7a53f825dc&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\">Steve</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086734\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T17:27:05\">2004-12-13T17:27:05</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">TOTALLY agree on your thoughts on where computers/appliances will merge.\r\n\r\nI had the NSLU2, but just ordered this guy: http://www.furrygoat.com/2004/12/asus_wlan_hard_.html ..

If my Office data was in a locked box, accessible only through its network API, it would be even less useful.\nIt would be nice to make all our \"stuff\" (data, software, hardware) available to us from whatever device we are using, or which is best suited to the task. However, the way to achieve this is not to get rid of the general-purpose computers. A better approach would be to improve the interoperability between the applications in the computer and the devices in the outside world.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085929\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.thok.org/bloggery\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2545d4ff0ba72eb5d5979186f4b02d85&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.thok.org/bloggery\">Mark Eichin</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085929\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-15T00:03:32\">2004-12-15T00:03:32</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Of course, these days, you probably don't want the home lathe either, just an account with emachineshop or some other easy cad-to-fab-to-fedex service :-)  I can't quite bring myself to stretch that into a Web Services metaphor, though...</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

However, these users didn't want meta lathes--they didn't even know what meta lathes were--they just wanted VisiCalc and WordStar and you needed one of these weird boxes to run them.  \r\n\r\nProblem is, the modern descendants of VisiCalc and WordStar have yet to be separated from the meta lathe platforms on which they were crafted.  It's like you've made a bracelet or a ring on the lathe--but instead of unclamping it and taking it off the machine, you just wear it: bracelet, lathe, and all.  Wouldn't it suck if someone accidentally plugged that thing in and turned it on while you were wearing it?\r\n\r\n[pacman]: http://www.geocities.jp/nchikada/pac/\r\n[visicalc]: http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1978.htm\r\n[homebrew]: http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1976.htm\r\n[embeddedlinux]: http://www.linuxdevices.com/\r\n[imovie]: http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/\r\n[garageband]: http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/\r\n[metallathe]: http://www.baileycraft.com/spsd400.htm\r\n[geb]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465026567/qid=1102711352/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-2224698-6674213?v=glance&#38;s=books&#38;n=507846\r\n[invisiblecomputer]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262640414/0xdecafbad-20\r\n[metallathepic]: http://www.baileycraft.com/sd400pic.htm\r\n[yinyang]: http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000356.html\r\n[laptops]: http://my.webmd.com/content/article/98/104676.htm?z=1728_00000_1000_nb_01\r\n[homeappliances]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/10/homebrew_entertainment_appliances_cheap_open_and_embattled\r\n[wherepcheaded]: http://www.fortune.com/fortune/fastforward/0,15704,955951,00.html\r\n[endofpcnigh]: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/01/15/the_end_of_the_pc/\r\n[kurobox]: http://www.revolutionstore.com/\r\n[linkstation]: http://www.buffalotech.com/wireless/products/NetworkProducts/HDH120LAN.html\r\n[linksys_nslu2]: http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Sections-article85-page1.php\r\n[gumstix]: http://www.gumstix.com/sys_tinycomp.html\r\n[jini_endofdesktop]: http://www.artima.com/jini/jiniology/vision2.html\r\n[home_motor]: http://gc.sfc.keio.ac.jp/class/2003_gc00001/slides/15/15.html\r\n[home_motor_search]: http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Home+Motor%22+%248.75+catalog+-domain&#38;btnG=Search\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085925\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085925\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T14:03:16\">2004-12-13T14:03:16</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">You know, it's a tough call.

I have over 100 applications on my personal computer. Would I want to replace them with a rack of 100 devices? No! We don't all have basements where we can hide this stuff.\r\n\r\nExchanging Microsoft Office data with other applications is hard enough as it is. If my Office data was in a locked box, accessible only through its network API, it would be even less useful.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to make all our \"stuff\" (data, software, hardware) available to us from whatever device we are using, or which is best suited to the task. However, the way to achieve this is not to get rid of the general-purpose computers. A better approach would be to improve the interoperability between the applications in the computer and the devices in the outside world.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085929\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.thok.org/bloggery\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2545d4ff0ba72eb5d5979186f4b02d85&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.thok.org/bloggery\">Mark Eichin</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085929\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-15T00:03:32\">2004-12-15T00:03:32</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Of course, these days, you probably don't want the home lathe either, just an account with emachineshop or some other easy cad-to-fab-to-fedex service :-)  I can't quite bring myself to stretch that into a Web Services metaphor, though...</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

Just look at where the Mobile-Industry is heading. They are moving from special-narrow-feature-set to wide-feature-set that more and more equal regular PCs.\nI think what could happen, is what we are starting to see with VCRs, that have streaming capability, and \"CD-Players\" for your stereo that can be connected to a PC and stream MP3s and radio. So what we might eventually see is more and more electronic gadgets becoming \"specialized clients\" for a Home-PC. But I don't see the Home-PC completely disappearing, because people won't like to give that \"power and control\" away, even if 1 out of 3 times they try to use it they end up hurting themselves.\nAn interesting questions is, wether we'll see functionality that was born in the PC move to external \"gadgets/clients\". \"Web/E-Mail\" seemed to have been the ideal candidates, and several companies promised and sold the idea, be it integrated in telephones or into TV-sets, but eventually none of those caught on.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082834\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://husk.org/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f1b0c8dfe96dad2606c99535803d12b8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://husk.org/blog/\">Paul Mison</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082834\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-14T03:43:25\">2004-12-14T03:43:25</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">The commentary at The Register about the \"Post PC Era\" may interest you: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/06/post_pc_era/</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

But, I've got more in my head demanding to be let out-- here's hoping it's interesting enough to tell me how ill-informed I am!\r\n\r\n\r\n[pacman]: http://www.geocities.jp/nchikada/pac/\r\n[visicalc]: http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1978.htm\r\n[homebrew]: http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1976.htm\r\n[embeddedlinux]: http://www.linuxdevices.com/\r\n[imovie]: http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/\r\n[garageband]: http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/\r\n[metallathe]: http://www.baileycraft.com/spsd400.htm\r\n[geb]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465026567/qid=1102711352/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-2224698-6674213?v=glance&#38;s=books&#38;n=507846\r\n[invisiblecomputer]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262640414/0xdecafbad-20\r\n\r\n[metallathepic]: http://www.baileycraft.com/sd400pic.htm\r\n[yinyang]: http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000356.html\r\n\r\n\r\n[laptops]: http://my.webmd.com/content/article/98/104676.htm?z=1728_00000_1000_nb_01\r\n\r\n[homeappliances]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/10/homebrew_entertainment_appliances_cheap_open_and_embattled\r\n[wherepcheaded]: http://www.fortune.com/fortune/fastforward/0,15704,955951,00.html\r\n[endofpcnigh]: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/01/15/the_end_of_the_pc/\r\n[kurobox]: http://www.revolutionstore.com/\r\n[linkstation]: http://www.buffalotech.com/wireless/products/NetworkProducts/HDH120LAN.html\r\n[linksys_nslu2]: http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Sections-article85-page1.php\r\n[gumstix]: http://www.gumstix.com/sys_tinycomp.html\r\n[jini_endofdesktop]: http://www.artima.com/jini/jiniology/vision2.html\r\n[home_motor]: http://gc.sfc.keio.ac.jp/class/2003_gc00001/slides/15/15.html\r\n[home_motor_search]: http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Home+Motor%22+%248.75+catalog+-domain&#38;btnG=Search\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082829\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://talideon.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=283c1cbec588d84ff9d37aa82e697110&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://talideon.com/\">Keith Gaughan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082829\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T14:03:55\">2004-12-13T14:03:55</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Wasn't this part of the idea behind Ellison's Network Computer?</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082832\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://trikuare.cx/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7d3d1e46aae8ca19855a6026d404b91d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://trikuare.cx/\">fluffy</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082832\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T16:02:17\">2004-12-13T16:02:17</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I know from personal experience now that UNIX underpinnings do not necessarily mean immunity.

Just look at where the Mobile-Industry is heading. They are moving from special-narrow-feature-set to wide-feature-set that more and more equal regular PCs.\r\n\r\nI think what could happen, is what we are starting to see with VCRs, that have streaming capability, and \"CD-Players\" for your stereo that can be connected to a PC and stream MP3s and radio. So what we might eventually see is more and more electronic gadgets becoming \"specialized clients\" for a Home-PC. But I don't see the Home-PC completely disappearing, because people won't like to give that \"power and control\" away, even if 1 out of 3 times they try to use it they end up hurting themselves.\r\n\r\nAn interesting questions is, wether we'll see functionality that was born in the PC move to external \"gadgets/clients\". \"Web/E-Mail\" seemed to have been the ideal candidates, and several companies promised and sold the idea, be it integrated in telephones or into TV-sets, but eventually none of those caught on.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082834\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://husk.org/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f1b0c8dfe96dad2606c99535803d12b8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://husk.org/blog/\">Paul Mison</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082834\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-14T03:43:25\">2004-12-14T03:43:25</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">The commentary at The Register about the \"Post PC Era\" may interest you: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/06/post_pc_era/</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

    "html": "<p>I&#39;m a complete neophyte when it comes to machine learning, but I&#39;d like to get into learning more about the field in general.  In particular, I&#39;d like to make my news aggregator smarter.  I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/08/16/bayes_agg_one\">already tried using SpamBayes</a>, but that didn&#39;t make me happy.  Whether it was my approach or whether it was that Bayes itself is not suited toward this task, I&#39;m not sure, though I suspect it&#39;s a little of both.</p>\n<p>It seems like the magic Bayesian pixie dust works well for spam-vs-ham in my email box, so why shouldn&#39;t the magic for interesting-vs-yawn work for my aggregator firehose?    Well, here are the issues I&#39;m guessing at:</p>\n<p>In the case of spam-vs-ham, you want to classify things into this or that-- that which is kept, and that which is tossed away.  But in the case of items in my aggregator, I want a relative sort order or a score.  I want a fuzzy guess toward my interest with which to inform presentation of items.  Interesting-vs-yawn is more of a continuum than a pair of buckets.</p>\n<p>And then, there&#39;s the passive gathering of behavioral data from my interactions with the aggregator, because I&#39;m sure as hell not going to click ratings or thumbs-up/down all day.  In spam-vs-ham, I could build up two clean mailboxes for training the categorizer, with one containing all spam and the other all ham.  But, in the case of my aggregator, the only thing I&#39;m tracking are items in which I showed interest by revealing more information or by clicking through.  </p>\n<p>So, I can say that a particular pile of items are all interesting.  But, my interest level for the rest of the items received is a complete unknown-- maybe I&#39;m vehemently disinterested in those 50 items, but maybe I just never got around to looking at those other 20 and just let them fall off my date range for display.  Thus, I have a pile of ham, and a pile of undifferentiated unknown.  I&#39;m not bothering to provide any cues as to whether I <em>don&#39;t</em> like something, because that&#39;d be boring work-- I mean, I <em>am</em> disinterested in those items, after all.  So, I&#39;d like to leverage what the system knows from what I care to provide, but not jump to any conclusions about the items in the unknown pile.  There is no spam, only various flavors of ham.</p>\n<p>Given all this, then, is there anyone out there who knows more about machine learning than me who could maybe point me toward a better approach or algorithm that fits this profile?</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=further_smart_aggregator_musings</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088785\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088785\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-07T17:52:19\">2004-12-07T17:52:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">There's a package called Reverend out there, which is a Bayesian filter not specialized for spam.  It might be worth looking at.\nAlso, in training the system should tell you what it thinks you'll think, and then you'll correct it if it's wrong.  Without this you can overtrain, creating a continual positive feedback, where all you want is a corrective feedback.\nOTOH, there's rating systems, like (I think) on Amazon.  There they correlate your ratings to  other people's ratings.  There you can usefully rate anything, because determining your correlated users is separate from the rating it actually presents you -- it's not determining your preference, simply your demographic.  Bloglines could do this (and they try a little), but you couldn't in isolation.

    "body": "I'm a complete neophyte when it comes to machine learning, but I'd like to get into learning more about the field in general.  In particular, I'd like to make my news aggregator smarter.  I've [already tried using SpamBayes](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/08/16/bayes_agg_one), but that didn't make me happy.  Whether it was my approach or whether it was that Bayes itself is not suited toward this task, I'm not sure, though I suspect it's a little of both.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the magic Bayesian pixie dust works well for spam-vs-ham in my email box, so why shouldn't the magic for interesting-vs-yawn work for my aggregator firehose?    Well, here are the issues I'm guessing at:\r\n\r\nIn the case of spam-vs-ham, you want to classify things into this or that-- that which is kept, and that which is tossed away.  But in the case of items in my aggregator, I want a relative sort order or a score.  I want a fuzzy guess toward my interest with which to inform presentation of items.  Interesting-vs-yawn is more of a continuum than a pair of buckets.\r\n\r\nAnd then, there's the passive gathering of behavioral data from my interactions with the aggregator, because I'm sure as hell not going to click ratings or thumbs-up/down all day.  In spam-vs-ham, I could build up two clean mailboxes for training the categorizer, with one containing all spam and the other all ham.  But, in the case of my aggregator, the only thing I'm tracking are items in which I showed interest by revealing more information or by clicking through.  \r\n\r\nSo, I can say that a particular pile of items are all interesting.  But, my interest level for the rest of the items received is a complete unknown-- maybe I'm vehemently disinterested in those 50 items, but maybe I just never got around to looking at those other 20 and just let them fall off my date range for display.  Thus, I have a pile of ham, and a pile of undifferentiated unknown.  I'm not bothering to provide any cues as to whether I *don't* like something, because that'd be boring work-- I mean, I *am* disinterested in those items, after all.  So, I'd like to leverage what the system knows from what I care to provide, but not jump to any conclusions about the items in the unknown pile.  There is no spam, only various flavors of ham.\r\n\r\nGiven all this, then, is there anyone out there who knows more about machine learning than me who could maybe point me toward a better approach or algorithm that fits this profile?\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=further_smart_aggregator_musings\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088785\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088785\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-07T17:52:19\">2004-12-07T17:52:19</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">There's a package called Reverend out there, which is a Bayesian filter not specialized for spam.  It might be worth looking at.\r\n\r\nAlso, in training the system should tell you what it thinks you'll think, and then you'll correct it if it's wrong.  Without this you can overtrain, creating a continual positive feedback, where all you want is a corrective feedback.\r\n\r\nOTOH, there's rating systems, like (I think) on Amazon.  There they correlate your ratings to  other people's ratings.  There you can usefully rate anything, because determining your correlated users is separate from the rating it actually presents you -- it's not determining your preference, simply your demographic.  Bloglines could do this (and they try a little), but you couldn't in isolation.

    "html": "<blockquote>I got my results a few minutes ago. They confirm that I do indeed have sleep apnea. While sleeping normally, I got zero REM sleep - the really refreshing sleep that rejuvenates the mind and body. Zero. I stopped breathing on average 38 times an hour - at one time for thirty seconds continuously. The oxygen saturation of my red blood cells dropped to worrying levels. When I was put on the machine, 13 percent of my sleep was REM sleep, and I didn't stop breathing once. No wonder I felt better the next day. My doc is now ordering the C-PAP machine. The best Christmas present I'll ever have. </blockquote>\n<div align=\"right\"><small>Source: <cite><a href=\"http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_11_28_dish_archive.html#110185277960812670\">Andrew Sullivan, Apnea</a></cite></small></div>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/features_pro.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/images/exploded_humid.gif\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\" border=\"0\" /></a>\nIf anyone ever wants to start doing public service announcements for Sleep Apnea for geeks, give me a call.  I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/07/23/sleep_apnea\">blogged about my sleep apnea</a> quite awhile back, and haven&#39;t gotten around to writing about it since, but this disease and my subsequent treatment have been some of the most significant events in my life.</p>\n<p>Whenever I read <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008028.html\">someone else</a> writing about snoring, I now have this <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008028.html#1009895\">instant zealotous reaction</a> to run-don&#39;t-walk to that person and shanghai them off to a sleep clinic.  All apologies to anyone this has ever annoyed, since I have a personal furor over this issue akin to rabid various cult leaders pushing their radical agendas about the necessity of marriage to potted ferns.  That is to say, it makes me nutty that anyone&#39;s left on the planet not breathing during sleep.</p>\n<p>I cannot overestimate the positive effect this CPAP machine has had on me.  I believe that it has clearly been responsible for reversing a downward spiral of anxiety, depression, and stymied productivity that increasingly gripped me over the last few years.  Granted there have been other causes and events involved, but this sleep apnea was literally robbing me of my brain.  </p>\n<p>As my condition worsened, I lost my ability to think and to grasp big pictures-- the things I so consider part of <em>being me*-- but it happened so gradually that I didn&#39;t even realize it was happening until I reached the point where I *literally</em> couldn&#39;t add 2 and 2 in my head, couldn&#39;t write more than 3 lines of code at a time, and I couldn&#39;t drive a car by myself for longer than 5 minutes at a time without nodding off.</p>\n<p>And due to a strange mixture of lethargy, social anxiety, and perceived helplessness, it took me way too long (and far too many proddings by the people I love) to finally get my ass tested.  If I could gain access to a time machine, I&#39;d personally march up to my past self years ago, assault him with a baseball bat, and strap a CPAP mask on him as he recovered in bed-- and damn the consequences of time paradox even if it threatened the very fabric of space-time.</p>\n<p>So, if you have a heavy snore, suffer often from daily exhaustion and lethargy, can&#39;t seem to think as well as you remember you had in the past...  <strong>SEE A DOCTOR!!!</strong> </p>\n<p>(Don&#39;t make me have to come over there and threaten your space-time fabric.)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083919\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083919\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-04T20:18:31\">2004-12-04T20:18:31</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Thanks for bringing this up.

Taken it around the world on work trips. Been tested a few times in a sleep clinic since my initial diagnosis. Things appear to be getting better. More energy. Started a solid exercise program as well. All helps. Looking for a smaller machine these days. All new ones seem over engineered. Looking for the most compact one I can find that works. Suggestions welcomed. What's worked for me - heated humidifier, nose pillow (not the mask) and over the counter \"salt spray\" on those days when I get plugged up. Have had colds and can still use the machine. Get to a sleep clinic if you have any problems sleeping. Easy to set up. Easy to use. Makes a world of difference.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083929\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb7f2a3ba74af37415ab7df101a86c75&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083929\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-07T16:38:49\">2005-03-07T16:38:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">sleepsLikeABaby:  Hey - thanks for the comment.

Snoring is fairly common.  Sleep Apnea is the opposite of snoring, you stop breathing and wake up, most of the time.  People who snore sleep right thru the snoring, it's a LOUD form of breathing.  If you wake up repeatedly, taking a gasping breath because you're out of air, you should be concerned.  If you wake up because your snoring was so loud the neighbors called the police for disturbance of the peace, there's another cause.  Maybe your body is water deprived and your nasal passages aren't moist, your lungs are using your saliva to moisten your breath.  Your lungs, like you, need water and they prefer air with water mixed in.  Your blood, your brain, and your digestive system get first dibs on the water you drink, your vital organs get seconds, and your other systems like vision, sweat glands, and your nose get thirds, if any is left over, your skin might get some.  When you don't drink enough water, your nose dries out, your lungs switch over the mouth backup system, unfortunately it doesn't work very well and it makes a lot of noise.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083946\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083946\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-09T12:22:21\">2005-12-09T12:22:21</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>While it's true that snoring is common, really <em>loud</em> snoring is often a symptom that accompanies sleep apnea.

People with untreated sleep apnea stop breathing repeatedly during their sleep, sometimes hundreds of times during the night.</p>\n<p>Sleep apnea is a true breathing obstruction, which requires the sleeper to awaken to begin breathing again. A person with sleep apnea wakes up many times a night to regain breathing, but usually remembers nothing at all about the awakenings.</p>\n<p>The sleep partner of a person with sleep apnea remembers a great deal about the awakenings and is generally a good witness of the incidents. Sleep apnea is a dangerous and progressive sleep disorder (it gets worse as you age). </p>\n<p>Not only does sleep apnea result in sleep deprivation, but it also can threaten your life. Sleep apnea is a period of time during which breathing stops or is markedly reduced. In simplified terms, a sleep apnea occurs when a person stops breathing for 10 seconds or more. </p>\n<p>So, if normal breath airflow is 70% to 100%, a sleep apnea is if you stop breathing completely, or take less than 25% of a normal breath (for a period that lasts 10 seconds or more).</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083950\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ef0a2bf39ddb68f1f9e73fc9b5256ab&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">PJ Hogue</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083950\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-13T20:19:45\">2006-03-13T20:19:45</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I was diagnosed with sleep apnea 3 years ago when the testing showed I either stopped breathing or did very shallow breathing 169 during the night.  Since that time I have only used the CPAP consecutively for the last 6 months because I had difficulty using a mask.  Last October I discovered the Mirage Swift Nasal pillow system and have been using it every night since.  The only problem I have is with the \"elvis\" type sideburn headgear, it can dig into my cheeks leaving a horrific imprint.  AND... no, it isn't on too tightly.  I use a pressure setting of 13 right now but recently have been having serious allergy type issues with nasal congestion, etc., and have been told that it may be due to the delivery system of the nasal pillow and the high air setting.  I am going to be re-evaluated to see if a reduction in pressure is feasible for me.</p>\n<p>Of concern to me is the noise of my machine.  I use a Fisher &amp; Paykel HC220 with humidifier.  Are all machines with humidifiers noisey?  I know that the RemStar machine they tested me on was very quiet... but it didn't have a humidifier which may be the noise culprit.  Any advice would be welcome.  I am not adverse to buying another machine even if they are pricey.  I bought my machine online and yes, they are so much cheaper that way.  If you can go to a local DME (durable medical provider) to test them you will find that they are marked up about 3 times as much.  I bought my Mirage Swift Nasal pillow system for $114 online and my local DME sells it for $480!  Outrageous.  </p>\n<p>If anyone knows of another nasal pillow type headgear that is comfortable for side sleeping and does not tear up your face... I'm interested.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083957\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=49a5f0c2d73be7382d71695cb5e82917&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jonathan Payne</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083957\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-29T02:46:40\">2006-03-29T02:46:40</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I, too, was diagnosed with sleep apnea, arousing 30 times an hour and not getting any REM sleep. Unfortunately the CPAP machine was worse than the disease itself, for me. I have always been a light sleeper even when I was younger and slept no problem so I think it's just part of that. I am also a slim guy, which is rare for people with sleep apnea, which means that relatively sharp angles on my face made it hard for me to maintain a proper seal with the mask. So I often moved just a little and woke to the sound of escaping air. Finally I fell asleep one night and then my mouth got blown open by the CPAP. So then I got a chin strap ... but even that didn't help.</p>\n<p>So it's not a miracle cure for everyone, just almost everyone. Whenever I hear about people with sleeping problems I think \"Get a sleep study\" because I had no expectations that I would be diagnosed with apnea. I don't snore all that much at all but I still have it and I am aroused 30 times an hour.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083959\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.sleepdisordersguide.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2b71ad14229f7292ebb02487e29b23c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.sleepdisordersguide.com\">Sleep Disorders</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083959\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-29T13:27:56\">2006-03-29T13:27:56</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>One-third of all adult Americans--about 50 million people--complain about their sleep.

I se the REMStar Plus. I'm one of the lucky ones in that I adapted almost instantly to the mask. My sleep was so interrupted (46 wakings/hr in the test) and the benefits were so dramatic that I would have found a way to adapt to wearing a volkswagon on my face if thet was what it took. I too have had some sinus issues occasonally but find that if I clean the mask, tube and water chamber regularly and use nasal spray sparingly (I emphasize sparingly - that stuff can be addictive and do more damage than good if used continuously) the side effects are dwarfed by the benefits. My life was in a serious downward spiral before CPAP and I can tell you that if you have only mild symptoms now they will likely get worse with age. When they get really bad you will likely lack the clear judgement to understand what's happening to you. So if you're wrestling with sleep problems keep working with the doctor until you find a workable treatment for you.</p>\n<p>If CPAP is problematic for you, try a heated humidified unit (as opposed to non-humidified or pass over humidified) and try different masks or nasal pillows. If none of that works, talk to the doctor about surgery. Surgery is only effective in a limited percentage of patients, but when it does work I'm told it is a true cure sans machines and masks. Also note that in recent years the technology has advanced a lot. There are now machines that continuously vary pressure to remove exhale resistance and also vary inhale pressure based on breathing patterns. These can help with many patients who have problems tolerating generic CPAP. </p>\n<p>I saw one person asking about self adjusting a REMStar Plus pressure. You can trick it out a bit by changing the altitude setting but there is a reason this is set by the physician. You can do more harm than good tinkering with the pressure without understanding the factors involved. You might want to try one of the new REMStar M Auto units which monitor your breathing patterns and adjust pressure accordingly. I've never used one of these, but I've read reviews that speak highly of them.</p>\n<p>Sleep Well!</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083982\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f49d4e4e86836705f160a406aa9d980&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jill Stoffel</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083982\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-31T19:34:58\">2006-12-31T19:34:58</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Does anyone know the best/fastest way of getting rid of the \"imprints\" left on the face in the morning?

I was diagnosed with sleep apnea in November and I am still waiting for my CPAP machine.  My insurance has denied it and I have appealed it.  I am to the point of being somewhat scared with the following symptoms that I am having.  I would be interested in knowing if anyone else has them.\nEverytime I wake up my whole body is numb, my mouth is so dry I I have no saliva in it.  This makes me try to gasp for air. Another thing is my body sometimes gets so weak I feel like I can barely walk or even lift my arms up.  Are these symptoms familiar?  My oxygen level goes down to 70 and I also, get no REM sleep.  I am bi-polar and thought my clinical depression was caused by that until I found out sleep apnea also causes it.  My memory is so bad that I can't even finish a sentence without forgetting what I was saying and I have gained a tremendous amount of weight, which my DR. said could also be caused by sleep apnea.\nWill check back for any responses that may be helpful.  Please don't suggest that I buy a CPAP machine due my difficulties with the insurance company, I am on disability and receive only $700.00 a month, so, that is out of the question.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083988\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f0d2b43356700a805eef4a1015d77e44&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Evan</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083988\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-16T18:09:10\">2007-03-16T18:09:10</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>thanks for that.

I [blogged about my sleep apnea](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/07/23/sleep_apnea) quite awhile back, and haven't gotten around to writing about it since, but this disease and my subsequent treatment have been some of the most significant events in my life.\r\n\r\nWhenever I read [someone else](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008028.html) writing about snoring, I now have this [instant zealotous reaction](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008028.html#1009895) to run-don't-walk to that person and shanghai them off to a sleep clinic.  All apologies to anyone this has ever annoyed, since I have a personal furor over this issue akin to rabid various cult leaders pushing their radical agendas about the necessity of marriage to potted ferns.  That is to say, it makes me nutty that anyone's left on the planet not breathing during sleep.\r\n\r\nI cannot overestimate the positive effect this CPAP machine has had on me.  I believe that it has clearly been responsible for reversing a downward spiral of anxiety, depression, and stymied productivity that increasingly gripped me over the last few years.  Granted there have been other causes and events involved, but this sleep apnea was literally robbing me of my brain.  \r\n\r\nAs my condition worsened, I lost my ability to think and to grasp big pictures-- the things I so consider part of *being me*-- but it happened so gradually that I didn't even realize it was happening until I reached the point where I *literally* couldn't add 2 and 2 in my head, couldn't write more than 3 lines of code at a time, and I couldn't drive a car by myself for longer than 5 minutes at a time without nodding off.\r\n\r\nAnd due to a strange mixture of lethargy, social anxiety, and perceived helplessness, it took me way too long (and far too many proddings by the people I love) to finally get my ass tested.  If I could gain access to a time machine, I'd personally march up to my past self years ago, assault him with a baseball bat, and strap a CPAP mask on him as he recovered in bed-- and damn the consequences of time paradox even if it threatened the very fabric of space-time.\r\n\r\nSo, if you have a heavy snore, suffer often from daily exhaustion and lethargy, can't seem to think as well as you remember you had in the past...  **SEE A DOCTOR!!!** \r\n\r\n(Don't make me have to come over there and threaten your space-time fabric.)\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083919\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083919\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-04T20:18:31\">2004-12-04T20:18:31</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Thanks for bringing this up.

Taken it around the world on work trips. Been tested a few times in a sleep clinic since my initial diagnosis. Things appear to be getting better. More energy. Started a solid exercise program as well. All helps. Looking for a smaller machine these days. All new ones seem over engineered. Looking for the most compact one I can find that works. Suggestions welcomed. What's worked for me - heated humidifier, nose pillow (not the mask) and over the counter \"salt spray\" on those days when I get plugged up. Have had colds and can still use the machine. Get to a sleep clinic if you have any problems sleeping. Easy to set up. Easy to use.

Snoring is fairly common.  Sleep Apnea is the opposite of snoring, you stop breathing and wake up, most of the time.  People who snore sleep right thru the snoring, it's a LOUD form of breathing.  If you wake up repeatedly, taking a gasping breath because you're out of air, you should be concerned.  If you wake up because your snoring was so loud the neighbors called the police for disturbance of the peace, there's another cause.  Maybe your body is water deprived and your nasal passages aren't moist, your lungs are using your saliva to moisten your breath.  Your lungs, like you, need water and they prefer air with water mixed in.  Your blood, your brain, and your digestive system get first dibs on the water you drink, your vital organs get seconds, and your other systems like vision, sweat glands, and your nose get thirds, if any is left over, your skin might get some.  When you don't drink enough water, your nose dries out, your lungs switch over the mouth backup system, unfortunately it doesn't work very well and it makes a lot of noise.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083946\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083946\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-09T12:22:21\">2005-12-09T12:22:21</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>While it's true that snoring is common, really <em>loud</em> snoring is often a symptom that accompanies sleep apnea.

My Dad and my Grandfather have had freight-train level snoring for years and never remembered actually waking up.

People with untreated sleep apnea stop breathing repeatedly during their sleep, sometimes hundreds of times during the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sleep apnea is a true breathing obstruction, which requires the sleeper to awaken to begin breathing again. A person with sleep apnea wakes up many times a night to regain breathing, but usually remembers nothing at all about the awakenings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sleep partner of a person with sleep apnea remembers a great deal about the awakenings and is generally a good witness of the incidents. Sleep apnea is a dangerous and progressive sleep disorder (it gets worse as you age). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only does sleep apnea result in sleep deprivation, but it also can threaten your life. Sleep apnea is a period of time during which breathing stops or is markedly reduced. In simplified terms, a sleep apnea occurs when a person stops breathing for 10 seconds or more. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if normal breath airflow is 70% to 100%, a sleep apnea is if you stop breathing completely, or take less than 25% of a normal breath (for a period that lasts 10 seconds or more).</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083950\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ef0a2bf39ddb68f1f9e73fc9b5256ab&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">PJ Hogue</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083950\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-13T20:19:45\">2006-03-13T20:19:45</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I was diagnosed with sleep apnea 3 years ago when the testing showed I either stopped breathing or did very shallow breathing 169 during the night.  Since that time I have only used the CPAP consecutively for the last 6 months because I had difficulty using a mask.  Last October I discovered the Mirage Swift Nasal pillow system and have been using it every night since.  The only problem I have is with the \"elvis\" type sideburn headgear, it can dig into my cheeks leaving a horrific imprint.  AND... no, it isn't on too tightly.  I use a pressure setting of 13 right now but recently have been having serious allergy type issues with nasal congestion, etc., and have been told that it may be due to the delivery system of the nasal pillow and the high air setting.  I am going to be re-evaluated to see if a reduction in pressure is feasible for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of concern to me is the noise of my machine.  I use a Fisher &amp; Paykel HC220 with humidifier.  Are all machines with humidifiers noisey?  I know that the RemStar machine they tested me on was very quiet... but it didn't have a humidifier which may be the noise culprit.  Any advice would be welcome.  I am not adverse to buying another machine even if they are pricey.  I bought my machine online and yes, they are so much cheaper that way.  If you can go to a local DME (durable medical provider) to test them you will find that they are marked up about 3 times as much.  I bought my Mirage Swift Nasal pillow system for $114 online and my local DME sells it for $480!  Outrageous.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If anyone knows of another nasal pillow type headgear that is comfortable for side sleeping and does not tear up your face... I'm interested.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083957\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=49a5f0c2d73be7382d71695cb5e82917&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Jonathan Payne</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083957\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-29T02:46:40\">2006-03-29T02:46:40</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I, too, was diagnosed with sleep apnea, arousing 30 times an hour and not getting any REM sleep. Unfortunately the CPAP machine was worse than the disease itself, for me. I have always been a light sleeper even when I was younger and slept no problem so I think it's just part of that. I am also a slim guy, which is rare for people with sleep apnea, which means that relatively sharp angles on my face made it hard for me to maintain a proper seal with the mask. So I often moved just a little and woke to the sound of escaping air. Finally I fell asleep one night and then my mouth got blown open by the CPAP. So then I got a chin strap ... but even that didn't help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it's not a miracle cure for everyone, just almost everyone. Whenever I hear about people with sleeping problems I think \"Get a sleep study\" because I had no expectations that I would be diagnosed with apnea. I don't snore all that much at all but I still have it and I am aroused 30 times an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good luck!</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083959\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.sleepdisordersguide.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2b71ad14229f7292ebb02487e29b23c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.sleepdisordersguide.com\">Sleep Disorders</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083959\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-29T13:27:56\">2006-03-29T13:27:56</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>One-third of all adult Americans--about 50 million people--complain about their sleep.

I had been told many, many times that I snore really, really loud. Wake myself up sometimes too! And people also tell me that \"all the sudden you stopped snoring and got completely quiet\" ... well that was when i stopped breathing. Not good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During my test I stopped breathing some 54 times during a six hour test and once for a full 45 seconds. That is quite a while. Try holding your breath now for that long ... just kidding ... BREATHE!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I agree. Get a sleep test. Find out what is up.

Which usually results in that classic snoring / gasping for breath.\r\nThis cycle repeats itself - ALL THRU THE NIGHT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After using a CPAP maching for 4-5 weeks now, I notice a big improvement.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083979\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b5449300debe868fa024c4611bfae5f0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">David</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083979\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-27T07:09:58\">2006-12-27T07:09:58</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I've been on CPAP now for about 3 years. I se the REMStar Plus. I'm one of the lucky ones in that I adapted almost instantly to the mask. My sleep was so interrupted (46 wakings/hr in the test) and the benefits were so dramatic that I would have found a way to adapt to wearing a volkswagon on my face if thet was what it took. I too have had some sinus issues occasonally but find that if I clean the mask, tube and water chamber regularly and use nasal spray sparingly (I emphasize sparingly - that stuff can be addictive and do more damage than good if used continuously) the side effects are dwarfed by the benefits. My life was in a serious downward spiral before CPAP and I can tell you that if you have only mild symptoms now they will likely get worse with age. When they get really bad you will likely lack the clear judgement to understand what's happening to you. So if you're wrestling with sleep problems keep working with the doctor until you find a workable treatment for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If CPAP is problematic for you, try a heated humidified unit (as opposed to non-humidified or pass over humidified) and try different masks or nasal pillows. If none of that works, talk to the doctor about surgery. Surgery is only effective in a limited percentage of patients, but when it does work I'm told it is a true cure sans machines and masks. Also note that in recent years the technology has advanced a lot. There are now machines that continuously vary pressure to remove exhale resistance and also vary inhale pressure based on breathing patterns. These can help with many patients who have problems tolerating generic CPAP. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I saw one person asking about self adjusting a REMStar Plus pressure. You can trick it out a bit by changing the altitude setting but there is a reason this is set by the physician. You can do more harm than good tinkering with the pressure without understanding the factors involved. You might want to try one of the new REMStar M Auto units which monitor your breathing patterns and adjust pressure accordingly. I've never used one of these, but I've read reviews that speak highly of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sleep Well!</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083982\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f49d4e4e86836705f160a406aa9d980&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Jill Stoffel</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083982\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-31T19:34:58\">2006-12-31T19:34:58</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Does anyone know the best/fastest way of getting rid of the \"imprints\" left on the face in the morning?

I was diagnosed with sleep apnea in November and I am still waiting for my CPAP machine.  My insurance has denied it and I have appealed it.  I am to the point of being somewhat scared with the following symptoms that I am having.  I would be interested in knowing if anyone else has them.\r\nEverytime I wake up my whole body is numb, my mouth is so dry I I have no saliva in it.  This makes me try to gasp for air. Another thing is my body sometimes gets so weak I feel like I can barely walk or even lift my arms up.  Are these symptoms familiar?  My oxygen level goes down to 70 and I also, get no REM sleep.  I am bi-polar and thought my clinical depression was caused by that until I found out sleep apnea also causes it.  My memory is so bad that I can't even finish a sentence without forgetting what I was saying and I have gained a tremendous amount of weight, which my DR. said could also be caused by sleep apnea.\r\nWill check back for any responses that may be helpful.  Please don't suggest that I buy a CPAP machine due my difficulties with the insurance company, I am on disability and receive only $700.00 a month, so, that is out of the question.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083988\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f0d2b43356700a805eef4a1015d77e44&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Evan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083988\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-16T18:09:10\">2007-03-16T18:09:10</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>thanks for that.

    "html": "<p>I&#39;ve recently been doing some side work involving Zope and, along with the rest of the suite of technologies it offers, I&#39;ve been happy to be working with <a href=\"http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/FrontPage\">Zope Page Templates</a> again.  I dabbled with them a bit when they first came out, and a Zope-free implementation named <a href=\"http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/\">SimpleTAL</a> was one of the core components of the iteration of my news aggregator which came before FeedReactor.</p>\n<p>Out of all the templating and content generation approaches I&#39;ve used, Zope Page Templates are my favorite yet.  Pretty expressive, yet unobtrusive; nicely powerful, yet not quite something with which you&#39;d want to write an entire application (<a href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2004/12/02/a-note-on-template-design\">and that&#39;s a feature, not a bug</a>).  </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve yet to be in a work-a-day team that uses ZPT-- but I can see where a lot of production, delegation, and integration issues would have gone much smoother had I used ZPT instead of <a href=\"http://www.template-toolkit.org/\">Template Toolkit</a> for the web app framework I created at a previous company.  (Though I do have to say TT2 is <em>very</em> nicely done!)  And where I am now, I spend most of my days trying to pummel ASP 3.0 pages into some semblance of logic/presentation separation-- I would certainly dive at the chance to dump VBScript and <code>&lt;% cruft %&gt;</code> for a bit of Python and ZPT.  (But, you know, <em>it&#39;s a living</em>.)</p>\n<p>A close second favorite is XSLT.  I&#39;ve really been hot on it lately, having worked it into the core of FeedReactor in place of SimpleTAL.  And in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/02/xsl_scraper\">other</a> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1\">hacks</a>, I&#39;ve really come to appreciate it&#39;s role as a filter segment in pipelines between REST web services and <a href=\"http://udell.roninhouse.com/bytecols/2001-08-15.html\">URL-as-command-line</a> invocations.</p>\n<p>Granted, both ZPT and XSLT very different technologies, but they are often used in similar contexts.  More than once, I&#39;ve wished that XSLT was as simple as ZPT (i.e. less verbose and intrusive, more document centered), and I&#39;ve wished that ZPT had some of the features of XSLT (i.e. ability to be used as a transforming filter).</p>\n<p>Reading <a href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2004/11/30/pythonic-xml-based-templating-language\">Ryan Tomayko&#39;s description of Kid</a> got me thinking, and googling.  One thing I turned up from a mailing list archive asked about an &#8220;<a href=\"http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zpt/2002-January/002651.html\">XSL implementation of TAL?</a>&#8221;  It struck me as a tad nutty at first, but then I started having inklings that just maybe it could be done.  (Whether it <em>should</em> be done, well...)  But the kernel of the idea grabbed me: Instead of using <a href=\"http://zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/TALES%20Specification%201.3\">TALES path expressions</a> to look up values in Pythonic space, why not use XPath expressions to look up values from a supplied XML document?</p>\n<p>This strikes me as such an obvious idea that someone has to already have done it and possibly rejected it for good reason.  On the other hand, maybe this is the sort of thing Ryan&#39;s thinking about-- I wonder how hard it would be to hack this into Kid?  It would give only a subset of XSLT&#39;s capabilities in trade for simplicity, and would only offer the &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/pushpull.html\">pull</a>&#8221; approach, but it would give XML-pipelining to a ZPT-ish technology.</p>\n<p>I think this is something I want to look into a bit further at some point.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=crossbreedingxsltzpt</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087930\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087930\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-04T17:16:09\">2004-12-04T17:16:09</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I've been meaning to write about this on my blog, as I've done something similar.\nInstead of using XSLT, I've used ZPT for the transformations.  It was an application where the user created a document in a WYSIWYG editor, then we wanted to pull information out of the content -- like a table of contents, or a title.\nTo do this I parsed the content into a DOM, then put some objects in the ZPT namespace that manipulated it.  For instance, the ToC object took a tag name (through getitem) and returned a list of the content and id of those tags (it created ids if necessary, modifying the content).  Then you could easily create a ToC by looking through and creating anchor tags from, say, all the  tags in the document.  It should be easy to expand with other transformations (all coded in Python, of course).  The actual code was only like 20 lines of Python, maybe less, and easy to understand from both sides (ZPT and Python).</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087932\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=14076d6ce3d0e8a0fd751a36d9912df5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Petri Savolainen</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087932\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T05:21:41\">2004-12-13T05:21:41</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">See http://zope.org/Members/DaddyGravity/PT_XPath\nIt would be great to have that in SimpleTAL, too.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087935\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087935\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T11:43:33\">2004-12-13T11:43:33</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Another thing you might want to look at: in the last few days there's been discussion on the ZPT mailing list about an extension to stylesheets (TERSE) for ZPT that introduces transformations.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087937\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d244e495717742bd0776b715a45877eb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand\">Bertrand Delacretaz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087937\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T15:15:55\">2004-12-13T15:15:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">FYI, people from the Apache Cocoon and BXE projects are working on similar stuff, in the opposite direction: we're taking TAL-like templates and converting them to XSLT, adding simple \"match\" templates for declarative rules.

    "body": "I've recently been doing some side work involving Zope and, along with the rest of the suite of technologies it offers, I've been happy to be working with [Zope Page Templates](http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/FrontPage) again.  I dabbled with them a bit when they first came out, and a Zope-free implementation named [SimpleTAL](http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/) was one of the core components of the iteration of my news aggregator which came before FeedReactor.\r\n\r\nOut of all the templating and content generation approaches I've used, Zope Page Templates are my favorite yet.  Pretty expressive, yet unobtrusive; nicely powerful, yet not quite something with which you'd want to write an entire application ([and that's a feature, not a bug](http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2004/12/02/a-note-on-template-design)).  \r\n  \r\nI've yet to be in a work-a-day team that uses ZPT-- but I can see where a lot of production, delegation, and integration issues would have gone much smoother had I used ZPT instead of [Template Toolkit](http://www.template-toolkit.org/) for the web app framework I created at a previous company.  (Though I do have to say TT2 is *very* nicely done!)  And where I am now, I spend most of my days trying to pummel ASP 3.0 pages into some semblance of logic/presentation separation-- I would certainly dive at the chance to dump VBScript and `<% cruft %>` for a bit of Python and ZPT.  (But, you know, *it's a living*.)\r\n   \r\nA close second favorite is XSLT.  I've really been hot on it lately, having worked it into the core of FeedReactor in place of SimpleTAL.  And in [other](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/02/xsl_scraper) [hacks](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1), I've really come to appreciate it's role as a filter segment in pipelines between REST web services and [URL-as-command-line](http://udell.roninhouse.com/bytecols/2001-08-15.html) invocations.\r\n\r\nGranted, both ZPT and XSLT very different technologies, but they are often used in similar contexts.  More than once, I've wished that XSLT was as simple as ZPT (i.e. less verbose and intrusive, more document centered), and I've wished that ZPT had some of the features of XSLT (i.e. ability to be used as a transforming filter).\r\n\r\nReading [Ryan Tomayko's description of Kid](http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2004/11/30/pythonic-xml-based-templating-language) got me thinking, and googling.  One thing I turned up from a mailing list archive asked about an &#8220;[XSL implementation of TAL?](http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zpt/2002-January/002651.html)&#8221;  It struck me as a tad nutty at first, but then I started having inklings that just maybe it could be done.  (Whether it *should* be done, well...)  But the kernel of the idea grabbed me: Instead of using [TALES path expressions](http://zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/TALES%20Specification%201.3) to look up values in Pythonic space, why not use XPath expressions to look up values from a supplied XML document?\r\n\r\nThis strikes me as such an obvious idea that someone has to already have done it and possibly rejected it for good reason.  On the other hand, maybe this is the sort of thing Ryan's thinking about-- I wonder how hard it would be to hack this into Kid?  It would give only a subset of XSLT's capabilities in trade for simplicity, and would only offer the &#8220;[pull](http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/pushpull.html)&#8221; approach, but it would give XML-pipelining to a ZPT-ish technology.\r\n\r\nI think this is something I want to look into a bit further at some point.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=crossbreedingxsltzpt\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087930\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087930\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-04T17:16:09\">2004-12-04T17:16:09</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I've been meaning to write about this on my blog, as I've done something similar.\r\n\r\nInstead of using XSLT, I've used ZPT for the transformations.  It was an application where the user created a document in a WYSIWYG editor, then we wanted to pull information out of the content -- like a table of contents, or a title.\r\n\r\nTo do this I parsed the content into a DOM, then put some objects in the ZPT namespace that manipulated it.  For instance, the ToC object took a tag name (through getitem) and returned a list of the content and id of those tags (it created ids if necessary, modifying the content).  Then you could easily create a ToC by looking through and creating anchor tags from, say, all the  tags in the document.  It should be easy to expand with other transformations (all coded in Python, of course).  The actual code was only like 20 lines of Python, maybe less, and easy to understand from both sides (ZPT and Python).</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087932\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=14076d6ce3d0e8a0fd751a36d9912df5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Petri Savolainen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087932\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T05:21:41\">2004-12-13T05:21:41</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">See http://zope.org/Members/DaddyGravity/PT_XPath\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have that in SimpleTAL, too.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087935\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087935\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T11:43:33\">2004-12-13T11:43:33</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Another thing you might want to look at: in the last few days there's been discussion on the ZPT mailing list about an extension to stylesheets (TERSE) for ZPT that introduces transformations.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087937\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d244e495717742bd0776b715a45877eb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand\">Bertrand Delacretaz</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087937\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T15:15:55\">2004-12-13T15:15:55</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">FYI, people from the Apache Cocoon and BXE projects are working on similar stuff, in the opposite direction: we're taking TAL-like templates and converting them to XSLT, adding simple \"match\" templates for declarative rules.

Making it so that '/mydoc/root/find/.//searchElement' works would be fairly easy, but getting '/mydoc/root/find/.//searchElement/attrib/firstAtt' to work would require more co-operation between ElemenTree and SimpleTAL.\r\n\r\nI'll have a think about this though as it sounds like a promising approach.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087946\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d67eea2ce18dd70f4642cb971c2c5ad2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Paul Everitt</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087946\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-14T00:45:18\">2004-12-14T00:45:18</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Chapter 11 of Jeni Tennison's \"XSLT and XPath On The Edge\" book has a section called \"Using Page Templates\".

    "summary": "<p>I&apos;ve recently been doing some side work involving Zope and, along with the rest of the suite of technologies it offers, I&apos;ve been happy to be working with <a href=\"http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/FrontPage\">Zope Page Templates</a> again.  I dabbled with them a bit when they first came out, and a Zope-free implementation named <a href=\"http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/\">SimpleTAL</a> was one of the core components of the iteration of my news aggregator which came before FeedReactor.</p>\n<p>Out of all the templating and content generation approaches I&apos;ve used, Zope Page Templates are my favorite yet.  Pretty expressive, yet unobtrusive; nicely powerful, yet not quite something with which you&apos;d want to write an entire application (<a href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2004/12/02/a-note-on-template-design\">and that&apos;s a feature, not a bug</a>).  </p>\n<p>I&apos;ve yet to be in a work-a-day team that uses ZPT-- but I can see where a lot of production, delegation, and integration issues would have gone much smoother had I used ZPT instead of <a href=\"http://www.template-toolkit.org/\">Template Toolkit</a> for the web app framework I created at a previous company.  (Though I do have to say TT2 is <em>very</em> nicely done!)  And where I am now, I spend most of my days trying to pummel ASP 3.0 pages into some semblance of logic/presentation separation-- I would certainly dive at the chance to dump VBScript and <code>&lt;% cruft %&gt;</code> for a bit of Python and ZPT.  (But, you know, <em>it&apos;s a living</em>.)</p>\n<p>A close second favorite is XSLT.  I&apos;ve really been hot on it lately, having worked it into the core of FeedReactor in place of SimpleTAL.  And in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/02/xsl_scraper\">other</a> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1\">hacks</a>, I&apos;ve really come to appreciate it&apos;s role as a filter segment in pipelines between REST web services and <a href=\"http://udell.roninhouse.com/bytecols/2001-08-15.html\">URL-as-command-line</a> invocations.</p>\n<p>Granted, both ZPT and XSLT very different technologies, but they are often used in similar contexts.  More than once, I&apos;ve wished that XSLT was as simple as ZPT (i.e. less verbose and intrusive, more document centered), and I&apos;ve wished that ZPT had some of the features of XSLT (i.e. ability to be used as a transforming filter).</p>\n<p>Reading <a href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2004/11/30/pythonic-xml-based-templating-language\">Ryan Tomayko&apos;s description of Kid</a> got me thinking, and googling.  One thing I turned up from a mailing list archive asked about an &#x201C;<a href=\"http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zpt/2002-January/002651.html\">XSL implementation of TAL?</a>&#x201D;  It struck me as a tad nutty at first, but then I started having inklings that just maybe it could be done.  (Whether it <em>should</em> be done, well...)  But the kernel of the idea grabbed me: Instead of using <a href=\"http://zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/TALES%20Specification%201.3\">TALES path expressions</a> to look up values in Pythonic space, why not use XPath expressions to look up values from a supplied XML document?</p>\n<p>This strikes me as such an obvious idea that someone has to already have done it and possibly rejected it for good reason.  On the other hand, maybe this is the sort of thing Ryan&apos;s thinking about-- I wonder how hard it would be to hack this into Kid?  It would give only a subset of XSLT&apos;s capabilities in trade for simplicity, and would only offer the &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/pushpull.html\">pull</a>&#x201D; approach, but it would give XML-pipelining to a ZPT-ish technology.</p>\n<p>I think this is something I want to look into a bit further at some point.</p>\n"

    "html": "<p>So, like I was saying:  I&#39;ve been working on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/kwiki?FeedReactor\">FeedReactor</a> and have been doing some things with it that I find rather interesting, independent of news aggregation.  </p>\n<p>One of the core goals I have for FeedReactor is to explore what it takes to build a web app that exploits <a href=\"http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html\">principles of REST architecture</a>.  Having already <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooccb\">sung the praises</a> of XML-RPC, I wanted to get immersed in REST and see what all the hubbub was about.  I&#39;ve got some ways to go, but I think I understand the major concepts now, and it&#39;s a pretty nifty frame within which to work.</p>\n<p>But, two other things I&#39;ve added to my mix have really made things interesting for me:  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>XSLT filtering</li>\n<li>The XmlHTTPRequest object</li>\n</ol>\n<p>XSLT and REST make a really good pair, as <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1\">Amazon Web Services already demonstrate</a>.  Inspired by that API (<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/02/xsl_scraper\">and earlier experiments</a>), I use XML for all the input and output formats in my API and accept a query string parameter that contains the path to an XSLT file.  When this parameter is supplied, the XML output by the API is first processed using the given XSLT.  (Think of it like piping API output through <code>xsltproc</code>.)</p>\n<p>So, with a properly constructed collection of XSLT, I can present a browser-viewable HTML user interface served up directly from REST API calls.  Links, frame sets, and iframes present in the HTML lead the user from that call to the next XSLT-wrapped REST API call. </p>\n<p>But, once the initial HTML-and-JavaScript payload reaches the browser, it gets better (<a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/10/22/43OPstrategic_1.html\">ala Gmail</a>):  </p>\n<p>On older browsers (if I happen to care about them), I can make new HTTP requests back to the server <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/iframe.html\">from JavaScript using iframes</a>.  In this case, XSLT filtering lets me retrofit the API&#39;s responses to the HTML-and-JavaScript crud I need to serve up to make things happen back in the browser client.  Unfortunately, passing data <em>to</em> the API (which expects XML, not form submissions) is still a bit wonky and requires some hacks and exceptions involving hidden forms and such.</p>\n<p>However, on the newer browsers, it&#39;s all about the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html\">XmlHTTPRequest object</a>.  With this facility, I can make clean asynchronous requests back to the REST API, including XML data in the request body if I feel like it.  Responses are handled by JavaScript callbacks, which twiddle the browser DOM to update the user interface in response.  </p>\n<p>So, after the major initial contact with the API to supply the browser with HTML by way of XSLT, most future interactions take place in the form of direct calls to the REST API using XML.  Although for some things, it&#39;s easier to just reload a page of HTML, it&#39;s nicer for most interactions to be handled via DOM manipulations in-place.  I&#39;ve been amazed at the Gmail-like responsiveness I get from FeedReactor when I&#39;m skimming through news items, marking some as seen or flagged, and popping open the descriptions on others.  </p>\n<p>I suppose I <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be amazed at the responsiveness, since I&#39;m using some of the same techniques as Gmail.  However, my daily-use installation of FeedReactor is presently running on an old 300Mhz Debian Linux PC at home, and it&#39;s taking me through the daily produce of 600 subscribed feeds faster than any desktop aggregator has yet.  Of course, this is partly a product of my familiarity with the UI I&#39;ve cobbled together, but... <em>the server&#39;s running on a 300Mhz PC with 256MB of RAM!</em>  And the client is my 867Mhz G4 PowerBook, running Firefox or Safari, depending on my mood.</p>\n<p>Although I can&#39;t see when I&#39;ll have time for it, I really want to explore this approach further using desktop apps on OS X and accessing the API from Flash movies (maybe using <a href=\"http://openlaszlo.org/\">Laszlo</a>).  I&#39;d also like to see how far I can go toward adapting the interface toward mobile devices like my Treo 600.</p>\n<p>So anyway, this has been where most of my private hacking sessions have been taking me over the past year or so:  combining HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, XML, XSLT, and REST to build what I consider to be a next-generation web app.  </p>\n<p>Now, although I use FeedReactor on a daily basis to keep up with all my feeds, it&#39;s nowhere near any state suitable for public consumption.

    "body": "So, like I was saying:  I've been working on [FeedReactor](http://www.decafbad.com/kwiki?FeedReactor) and have been doing some things with it that I find rather interesting, independent of news aggregation.  \r\n\r\nOne of the core goals I have for FeedReactor is to explore what it takes to build a web app that exploits [principles of REST architecture](http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html).  Having already [sung the praises](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooccb) of XML-RPC, I wanted to get immersed in REST and see what all the hubbub was about.  I've got some ways to go, but I think I understand the major concepts now, and it's a pretty nifty frame within which to work.\r\n\r\nBut, two other things I've added to my mix have really made things interesting for me:  \r\n\r\n1. XSLT filtering\r\n2. The XmlHTTPRequest object\r\n\r\nXSLT and REST make a really good pair, as [Amazon Web Services already demonstrate](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1).  Inspired by that API ([and earlier experiments](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/02/xsl_scraper)), I use XML for all the input and output formats in my API and accept a query string parameter that contains the path to an XSLT file.  When this parameter is supplied, the XML output by the API is first processed using the given XSLT.  (Think of it like piping API output through `xsltproc`.)\r\n\r\nSo, with a properly constructed collection of XSLT, I can present a browser-viewable HTML user interface served up directly from REST API calls.  Links, frame sets, and iframes present in the HTML lead the user from that call to the next XSLT-wrapped REST API call. \r\n\r\nBut, once the initial HTML-and-JavaScript payload reaches the browser, it gets better ([ala Gmail](http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/10/22/43OPstrategic_1.html)):  \r\n\r\nOn older browsers (if I happen to care about them), I can make new HTTP requests back to the server [from JavaScript using iframes](http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/iframe.html).  In this case, XSLT filtering lets me retrofit the API's responses to the HTML-and-JavaScript crud I need to serve up to make things happen back in the browser client.  Unfortunately, passing data *to* the API (which expects XML, not form submissions) is still a bit wonky and requires some hacks and exceptions involving hidden forms and such.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the newer browsers, it's all about the [XmlHTTPRequest object](http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html).  With this facility, I can make clean asynchronous requests back to the REST API, including XML data in the request body if I feel like it.  Responses are handled by JavaScript callbacks, which twiddle the browser DOM to update the user interface in response.  \r\n\r\nSo, after the major initial contact with the API to supply the browser with HTML by way of XSLT, most future interactions take place in the form of direct calls to the REST API using XML.  Although for some things, it's easier to just reload a page of HTML, it's nicer for most interactions to be handled via DOM manipulations in-place.  I've been amazed at the Gmail-like responsiveness I get from FeedReactor when I'm skimming through news items, marking some as seen or flagged, and popping open the descriptions on others.  \r\n\r\nI suppose I *shouldn't* be amazed at the responsiveness, since I'm using some of the same techniques as Gmail.  However, my daily-use installation of FeedReactor is presently running on an old 300Mhz Debian Linux PC at home, and it's taking me through the daily produce of 600 subscribed feeds faster than any desktop aggregator has yet.  Of course, this is partly a product of my familiarity with the UI I've cobbled together, but... *the server's running on a 300Mhz PC with 256MB of RAM!*  And the client is my 867Mhz G4 PowerBook, running Firefox or Safari, depending on my mood.\r\n\r\nAlthough I can't see when I'll have time for it, I really want to explore this approach further using desktop apps on OS X and accessing the API from Flash movies (maybe using [Laszlo](http://openlaszlo.org/)).  I'd also like to see how far I can go toward adapting the interface toward mobile devices like my Treo 600.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, this has been where most of my private hacking sessions have been taking me over the past year or so:  combining HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, XML, XSLT, and REST to build what I consider to be a next-generation web app.  \r\n\r\nNow, although I use FeedReactor on a daily basis to keep up with all my feeds, it's nowhere near any state suitable for public consumption.  I add new subscriptions from a command-line script and still fiddle with the database directly for some operations.  I'd like to have a personal-server version of it ready for use by some alpha geeks before or not long into the new year, but I'd like to share some of the things I've been doing with it before then.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I think I'll wrap up this entry and think about putting together a quick tutorial pico-project to demonstrate some of the concepts.  Maybe an address book, or something equally simple-yet-useful.  \r\n\r\nStay tuned.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=nextgenwebapps\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089601\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.ricebridge.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a57fe535201a5daca9590abd68d490c7&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.ricebridge.com\">Richard Rodger</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089601\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-01T08:14:39\">2004-12-01T08:14:39</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">You should take a look at http://www.json.org which provides a really nice JavaScript-native way to exchange data using XMLHttpRequest.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221089609\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://fiftyfly.mine.nu\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c1e58f891708437e94407f573639094c&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://fiftyfly.mine.nu\">mike</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221089609\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-01T14:23:44\">2004-12-01T14:23:44</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">This is def a powerful set of techniques.

I'm sure there are other possibilities as well.\nThere is no shame in dorking around with cool new tech to get a feel for it, but one must recognize that cool new tech doesn't finish software.  Getting a project out the door means settling for an imperfect design (at least for now) and getting to the boring stuff:  squishing bugs, smoothing out the UI, and writing documentation.  \nI hope I don't sound like I'm scolding you take the later path.  (Who the hell am I, anyway?  Just some former Detroit geek who stumbled onto your blog.)  It's your code, and any goal at all is fine.  It's just good to be clear on what that goal is.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086853\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://geekswithblogs.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ddb0fe6d2ce10e7810caaff6346adff7&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://geekswithblogs.net\">Jason Bentley</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086853\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-21T09:45:25\">2005-06-21T09:45:25</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I have experienced this very problem and here is how I combat it. First, I use a source code control repository that I check into every single day unless I wrote no code that day. Second, I use a bug management system that I always go to when I need to remember what I was working on and problems that I may need to fix. Third, I use a project management solution to track my progress and keep a list of ideas in plain sight.\nToo often, us solo programmers have the tendendancy to allow our habits to grow out of control instead of practicing the very good habits we have at work. Using an approach similar to what I use keeps me from writing a bunch of code, putting it down for two months, and then picking it up again and having to start over.\nIt does require me to keep track of the bugs I discover, have a back-up plan, and be mindful of recording my changes but it saves a lot of time down the road. Oh, and I usually have almost as many lines of comments as code. Can you have too many comments?</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

But then, I eventually get frustrated with something and wander off.  \r\n\r\nI've left dozens of mini- and saddeningly macro-projects in my wake, forgotten on hard drives long since trashed, none of them ever seeing the light of day.  Because, when I just work by myself, I don't get any feedback for having been dumb, and I don't get any gratification for having been clever.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I go out on these long arcs of fiddling, nothing ever in any satisfyingly complete state, and move onto something else before I feel like things are in any shape to share with anyone.  What I really should be doing is documenting things here as I go along, releasing pico-projects demonstrating the little things that make me squeak in geekish joy as I discover them.  Then, when or if I ever release the Big Wonderful Project, all the little pieces will have already been shared and explained.  And if I never do release the beast, no matter-- the pieces and micro-innovations (if I produce any) will survive.  \r\n\r\nAnd then there's the thing I've been missing all along:  feedback.  If I happen to spew out anything that catches anyone's interest, maybe a bit of a give-and-take loop will form that will cause me to *happily* abandon the Big Wonderful thing and regroup around something unexpected and even more fun that sprang from something I thought was just a neat side-effect of something else.\r\n\r\nSee, in abstract, I understand how all this is supposed to work.  I just have to drum it into my mad-scientist skull.  \r\n\r\n(I wonder if [trepanation](http://www.trepanationguide.com/) would help with that?)\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086850\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7d1c8d2b1a7643236a4661e9a974dee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\">George Hotelling</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086850\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-11-30T15:36:17\">2004-11-30T15:36:17</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I saw a really good quote on del.icio.us/tag/gtd - \"You can do anything but you can't do everything.\"  \r\n\r\nI've got a ton of project ideas bouncing around too, but I'm trying to look at them from the perspective \"If I want to do x I can't do y\" which gives me a better way to weigh whether something is a good investment of my time.

I'm sure there are other possibilities as well.\r\n\r\nThere is no shame in dorking around with cool new tech to get a feel for it, but one must recognize that cool new tech doesn't finish software.  Getting a project out the door means settling for an imperfect design (at least for now) and getting to the boring stuff:  squishing bugs, smoothing out the UI, and writing documentation.  \r\n\r\nI hope I don't sound like I'm scolding you take the later path.  (Who the hell am I, anyway?  Just some former Detroit geek who stumbled onto your blog.)  It's your code, and any goal at all is fine.  It's just good to be clear on what that goal is.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086853\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://geekswithblogs.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ddb0fe6d2ce10e7810caaff6346adff7&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://geekswithblogs.net\">Jason Bentley</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086853\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-06-21T09:45:25\">2005-06-21T09:45:25</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I have experienced this very problem and here is how I combat it. First, I use a source code control repository that I check into every single day unless I wrote no code that day. Second, I use a bug management system that I always go to when I need to remember what I was working on and problems that I may need to fix. Third, I use a project management solution to track my progress and keep a list of ideas in plain sight.\r\n\r\nToo often, us solo programmers have the tendendancy to allow our habits to grow out of control instead of practicing the very good habits we have at work. Using an approach similar to what I use keeps me from writing a bunch of code, putting it down for two months, and then picking it up again and having to start over.\r\n\r\nIt does require me to keep track of the bugs I discover, have a back-up plan, and be mindful of recording my changes but it saves a lot of time down the road. Oh, and I usually have almost as many lines of comments as code. Can you have too many comments?</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

I&#39;ve even started tinkering with tagging songs using things like <code>:dreamy</code>, <code>:goofy</code>, <code>:energy</code>, <code>:calm</code> in the comments field for use with Smart Playlists.  (Yeah, I know about <a href=\"http://www.danshockley.com/tunetags.php\">TuneTags</a>, but the psuedo-XML in song comments bugs me, as does the somewhat buggy behavior of the last version of the program I tried.)</p>\n<p>By this point, I&#39;ve managed to cram about 3400 songs from our CD collection into it.  (So much for the marketing!)  With my efforts so far, a &#8220;Good Music&#8221; Smart Playlist selecting for 3-stars and above gives me around 415 songs.  This doesn&#39;t count the songs I&#39;ve rated with 1-star, which get deleted from the iPod periodically.  Also, I&#39;ve yet to get a significant proportion tagged with special comments, so mood-based and concept-based playlists are far off until I get a better tool for letting me quickly and lazily tag songs.</p>\n<p>So, this morning on the way into work I fired up my &#8220;Good Music&#8221; playlist on random for the first time, and I was amazed at how good the selection was.  Yes, I rated these songs, so I should know they&#39;re good--but so far, I&#39;ve had all 3400 songs on shuffle and have been alternating between listening and rating, skipping songs I wasn&#39;t in the mood for, and canning songs right off the bat with a 1-star rating.  So up until now, my rotation has been an <em>okay</em> experience.</p>\n<p>However, hearing that mix of consistently high rated songs was an unexpectedly good experience.  What occurred to me as I rounded the last stretch of I-75 into Detroit this morning is that this metadata and these Smart Playlists on shuffle amount to an attempt to tickle myself.  Ever try that?  For the most part, it doesn&#39;t work.  Sure, you know where you&#39;re ticklish--but if it&#39;s your hand trying to do it, you&#39;re expecting it and the tickle doesn&#39;t happen.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;m probably stepping too far into breathless pretentiousness with this, but it makes me want to think further about machine learning and intelligence.  Yeah, Smart Playlists are a very, very rudimentary form of intelligence, but it&#39;s good enough to tickle me with a music mix--which is a very real bit of value added to my life.  </p>\n<p>I wonder how much further this tickling-myself metaphor can be taken?  That is: take a machine endowed with information I produced, apply some simple or slightly complex logic with a bit of random shuffle, and feed it back to me to see if it makes me experience it with some novelty.  Someone&#39;s got to already be on top of this as a research project.  That, or it&#39;s an idea obvious or dumb enough only to appeal to me.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ipodtickles</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085227\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://home.lucid.net/ac/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=53519627a2eef585cb2e07850b812bee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://home.lucid.net/ac/\">ac</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085227\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-27T18:52:33\">2004-10-27T18:52:33</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">a smart playlist i use is one where it shows me songs that have been played 3+ times and are unrated.  i look at it periodically and then quickly rate those tunes.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085228\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.flashesofpanic.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=90c809f53e4cc380876130343366f974&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.flashesofpanic.com\">pjm</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085228\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-27T19:23:18\">2004-10-27T19:23:18</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">You should see the elaborate, nested, weighted Active Playlist I built to keep the rotation fresh on my iPod... to summarize, every song gets \"rested\" after playing, but the rest is shorter if the rating is higher.

I never thought about the wishlist thing in those terms, but it fits!\nI'm actually starting to think this might be a good way to handle information overload.  Like, establish some rules or set up some learning (ie. bayes or whatnot), toss in a shuffle, and filter a firehose through it.   (ie. 611 RSS feeds I've subscribed to)\nI couldn't possibly process everything from the firehose, so a jug or two from it is better than nothing-- and a swig fuzzily selected from the better parts is better still.  \nThe idea is not to even try to get everything, but make the best of what I can actually use in a particular context.

Wondering how hard it would be to come up with a little assistant that asked at each transition between songs, \"Was that a good transition?\"  You give a thumbs up / thumbs down, or maybe some stars, and after awhile the thing can start building playlists.\nUnfortunately for me, the Party Shuffle mode isn't available for use when playing songs off the iPod in iTunes.

(ie. 611 RSS feeds I've subscribed to)\r\n\r\nI couldn't possibly process everything from the firehose, so a jug or two from it is better than nothing-- and a swig fuzzily selected from the better parts is better still.  \r\n\r\nThe idea is not to even try to get everything, but make the best of what I can actually use in a particular context.

    "summary": "<p>I&apos;ve had an iPod for a little over a week now, and I&apos;ve been working pretty diligently to rate every song I hear and trying to make sure all the metadata is correct.  I&apos;ve even started tinkering with tagging songs using things like <code>:dreamy</code>, <code>:goofy</code>, <code>:energy</code>, <code>:calm</code> in the comments field for use with Smart Playlists.  (Yeah, I know about <a href=\"http://www.danshockley.com/tunetags.php\">TuneTags</a>, but the psuedo-XML in song comments bugs me, as does the somewhat buggy behavior of the last version of the program I tried.)</p>\n<p>By this point, I&apos;ve managed to cram about 3400 songs from our CD collection into it.  (So much for the marketing!)  With my efforts so far, a &#x201C;Good Music&#x201D; Smart Playlist selecting for 3-stars and above gives me around 415 songs.  This doesn&apos;t count the songs I&apos;ve rated with 1-star, which get deleted from the iPod periodically.  Also, I&apos;ve yet to get a significant proportion tagged with special comments, so mood-based and concept-based playlists are far off until I get a better tool for letting me quickly and lazily tag songs.</p>\n<p>So, this morning on the way into work I fired up my &#x201C;Good Music&#x201D; playlist on random for the first time, and I was amazed at how good the selection was.  Yes, I rated these songs, so I should know they&apos;re good--but so far, I&apos;ve had all 3400 songs on shuffle and have been alternating between listening and rating, skipping songs I wasn&apos;t in the mood for, and canning songs right off the bat with a 1-star rating.  So up until now, my rotation has been an <em>okay</em> experience.</p>\n<p>However, hearing that mix of consistently high rated songs was an unexpectedly good experience.  What occurred to me as I rounded the last stretch of I-75 into Detroit this morning is that this metadata and these Smart Playlists on shuffle amount to an attempt to tickle myself.  Ever try that?  For the most part, it doesn&apos;t work.  Sure, you know where you&apos;re ticklish--but if it&apos;s your hand trying to do it, you&apos;re expecting it and the tickle doesn&apos;t happen.  </p>\n<p>I&apos;m probably stepping too far into breathless pretentiousness with this, but it makes me want to think further about machine learning and intelligence.  Yeah, Smart Playlists are a very, very rudimentary form of intelligence, but it&apos;s good enough to tickle me with a music mix--which is a very real bit of value added to my life.  </p>\n<p>I wonder how much further this tickling-myself metaphor can be taken?  That is: take a machine endowed with information I produced, apply some simple or slightly complex logic with a bit of random shuffle, and feed it back to me to see if it makes me experience it with some novelty.  Someone&apos;s got to already be on top of this as a research project.  That, or it&apos;s an idea obvious or dumb enough only to appeal to me.</p>\n"

    "html": "<p>So I finally got myself an iPod, thanks to <a href=\"http://missadroit.livejournal.com\">The Girl</a>.  </p>\n<p>Through various twists of replacement policy and iBook promotional antics, somehow she ended up with two 20GB 4G iPods, both of which she&#39;s been planning to sell off on eBay to end up with some cash and an iPod Mini.  Well, it finally occurred to me this weekend that I needed to buy one of those iPods.</p>\n<p>Lately, I&#39;ve been only been listening to streaming radio at work, since I don&#39;t really have the hard drive space on my PowerBook for music, and loading up the work PC with MP3s is pretty unpalatable.  I miss the days when I had a 40GB library at work, but between company policy where I am now and having lost that whole library in a hard drive crash back then, I&#39;m hesitant to go there again.</p>\n<p>Enter the iPod.  I was reminded of its presence in The Girl&#39;s office, still boxed up and shrink-wrapped, at a moment when I was thinking about podcasting and thinking about my lack of hard drive space.  So, I gave in and snapped it up.  </p>\n<p>Thus far, I&#39;m pretty happy.  Sure, I&#39;d been looking at the larger capacity models that came with a dock and remote, but this one was the right price at the right place and the right time.  I was also lucky that she had an iTrip she was selling that just happened to work satisfactorily for playing MP3s in my car - something that&#39;s been a bit of a quest of mine for years.  While it&#39;s true I do have an in-dash Blaupunkt MP3 CD player in my Ford Focus now, it&#39;s also true that 20GB certainly outweighs 700MB.</p>\n<p>The few snags I&#39;ve run into so far mostly have to do with the fact that it seems like my desired usage pattern of the iPod isn&#39;t <em>quite</em> supported.  See, I don&#39;t want to have a massive library on my PowerBook, to be synched in part onto my iPod.  I have a library on a file server at home, and I want to use the iPod alternately as a music store away from home for iTunes on my PowerBook and as an MP3 player while I&#39;m driving.  I don&#39;t want any music at all on my PowerBook.  Problem is, though, the iPod isn&#39;t <em>quite</em> a first-class citizen in iTunes.  Party Shuffle doesn&#39;t work, and I had a few problems with making sure metadata (like ratings and last played date) made it into iTunes.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and I wish they&#39;d turn down the wheel sensitivity <strong>way</strong> down when setting a song&#39;s rating.  At present, it&#39;s just a bare millimeter of a finger&#39;s twitch to leap from 1 to 5 stars.  Might just be me.</p>\n<p>But, for the most part, I&#39;m very happy to have my own music at work again, and the potential of tinkering with smart playlists and podcasts are exciting to me.  That, and the fourth-generation iPod is just an elegant, slick joy to hold.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=ipodismine</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085752\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085752\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-19T16:34:59\">2004-10-19T16:34:59</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Congrats--if you'd like a free license for PodWorks (http://www.scifihifi.com/podworks), let me know :-).</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085753\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://anal-control-freak.blogspot.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=83a50ab0ae4f845bb1352b56c47e33fd&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://anal-control-freak.blogspot.com/\">C</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085753\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-19T21:35:43\">2004-10-19T21:35:43</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">No, its not just you.\nThe rating sensitivity is way too high, trying to set four stars, while half awake on the morning commute, is a near impossibility.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085755\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jarretthousenorth.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9b8a07841271125f202091afe761e510&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jarretthousenorth.com\">Tim Jarrett</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085755\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-20T09:33:47\">2004-10-20T09:33:47</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Agree about the sensitivity of the wheel in general. Regarding your usage, have you thought about moving your PowerBook's iTunes Library file to your file server? You could then manage the iPod from the file server's library. If you still want to be able to sync the iPod on the go, you might set up a separate account on your PowerBook whose iTunes Library is local and use fast user switching to go back and forth when you want to sync.

Well, it finally occurred to me this weekend that I needed to buy one of those iPods.\r\n\r\nLately, I've been only been listening to streaming radio at work, since I don't really have the hard drive space on my PowerBook for music, and loading up the work PC with MP3s is pretty unpalatable.

I was reminded of its presence in The Girl's office, still boxed up and shrink-wrapped, at a moment when I was thinking about podcasting and thinking about my lack of hard drive space.  So, I gave in and snapped it up.  \r\n\r\nThus far, I'm pretty happy.  Sure, I'd been looking at the larger capacity models that came with a dock and remote, but this one was the right price at the right place and the right time.  I was also lucky that she had an iTrip she was selling that just happened to work satisfactorily for playing MP3s in my car - something that's been a bit of a quest of mine for years.  While it's true I do have an in-dash Blaupunkt MP3 CD player in my Ford Focus now, it's also true that 20GB certainly outweighs 700MB.\r\n\r\nThe few snags I've run into so far mostly have to do with the fact that it seems like my desired usage pattern of the iPod isn't *quite* supported.  See, I don't want to have a massive library on my PowerBook, to be synched in part onto my iPod.  I have a library on a file server at home, and I want to use the iPod alternately as a music store away from home for iTunes on my PowerBook and as an MP3 player while I'm driving.  I don't want any music at all on my PowerBook.  Problem is, though, the iPod isn't *quite* a first-class citizen in iTunes.  Party Shuffle doesn't work, and I had a few problems with making sure metadata (like ratings and last played date) made it into iTunes.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and I wish they'd turn down the wheel sensitivity **way** down when setting a song's rating.  At present, it's just a bare millimeter of a finger's twitch to leap from 1 to 5 stars.  Might just be me.\r\n\r\nBut, for the most part, I'm very happy to have my own music at work again, and the potential of tinkering with smart playlists and podcasts are exciting to me.

Regarding your usage, have you thought about moving your PowerBook's iTunes Library file to your file server? You could then manage the iPod from the file server's library. If you still want to be able to sync the iPod on the go, you might set up a separate account on your PowerBook whose iTunes Library is local and use fast user switching to go back and forth when you want to sync. Not seamless but it should work. At least I hope it does--that's how I want to go when I start converting all my CDs.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085756\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085756\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-20T10:05:30\">2004-10-20T10:05:30</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Tim:  I think I have some more playing to do, but moving my iTunes Library to the network server wasn't quite working.

Danah&#39;s writing about youth and feeds and intimate communication versus institutional communication resonates well with what I&#39;ve been tossing around in my head.</p>\n<p>When I was in high school, around about the time Ross Perot was getting into the presidential race, I remember putting a little item on my to-do list in my brand new day planner:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read the newspaper, watch the news.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I must&#39;ve been, what, 16 years old?  I suppose that would have made me one of the youths Danah&#39;s talking about, albeit of an earlier generation of online communicators.  At the time, the bulk of my disposable income earned as a grocery store bagger was spent on music CDs, gas, and the occasional upgrade to my Commodore Amiga.  I didn&#39;t even know was NPR was, though I knew there was this thing they did with news on the radio.  But newspapers and talk on the radio were things that my grandparents paid attention to, if anything.  </p>\n<p>The only reason I put that item on my to-do list--in fact, the only reason I even had a day planner with a to-do list in the first place--was because, according to the teachers trying to prepare me for college, this was what grownups did.  Planning your days and reading the news were things that adults did, and if I wanted to be an adult, I should get with the program.  And I wanted to get with the program, but I really didn&#39;t see the point yet.</p>\n<p>However, I did live most of my social life online.  Now, that needs a bit of qualification:  Of course, I am a big geek and many of my kind spend their days living in Mom&#39;s basement talking to men pretending to be 14-year-old girls.  But, back when I was first getting online, the main gateway for access was the dial-up BBS, preferably one that was a local call to your area code and prefix.  What that meant is that most of the people I was chatting with online were within a 16-year-old&#39;s parentally condoned driving radius.</p>\n<p>So, I never lived in the basement, and I <em>did</em> actually get out quite a bit.  The only real strange bit was that very few of my social group went to school together--and actually, most of us were misfits in school, some counting the minutes till we could get back to each other.  Having just finished Cory Doctorow&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.craphound.com/est/\"><em>Eastern Standard Tribe</em></a> (read on my Treo 600, my <em>comm</em>, no less), I can totally grok the tribes.  Mine was as small as an area code or two, rather than a time zone, but I had a tribe.  Still do, even though we&#39;ve since dispersed across many, many area codes.  Now there&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com\">LiveJournal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.xanga.com\">Xanga</a>, among other tribe-building technologies.</p>\n<p>But lately, in the past few years, I&#39;ve been changing.  I&#39;m only 29 now, but I&#39;ve learned what a day planner is for and my to-do list is crucial; I know enough about the news on TV not to watch it much, yet I pull in enormous volumes of news from online sources and magazines.  And, as I wrote earlier, NPR is now the only station on my radio dial.</p>\n<p>When I was 16, the presidential race was a curiosity about which I felt vague guilt for not knowing more.

Danah's writing about youth and feeds and intimate communication versus institutional communication resonates well with what I've been tossing around in my head.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in high school, around about the time Ross Perot was getting into the presidential race, I remember putting a little item on my to-do list in my brand new day planner:\r\n\r\n* Read the newspaper, watch the news.\r\n\r\nI must've been, what, 16 years old?  I suppose that would have made me one of the youths Danah's talking about, albeit of an earlier generation of online communicators.  At the time, the bulk of my disposable income earned as a grocery store bagger was spent on music CDs, gas, and the occasional upgrade to my Commodore Amiga.  I didn't even know was NPR was, though I knew there was this thing they did with news on the radio.  But newspapers and talk on the radio were things that my grandparents paid attention to, if anything.  \r\n\r\nThe only reason I put that item on my to-do list--in fact, the only reason I even had a day planner with a to-do list in the first place--was because, according to the teachers trying to prepare me for college, this was what grownups did.  Planning your days and reading the news were things that adults did, and if I wanted to be an adult, I should get with the program.  And I wanted to get with the program, but I really didn't see the point yet.\r\n\r\nHowever, I did live most of my social life online.  Now, that needs a bit of qualification:  Of course, I am a big geek and many of my kind spend their days living in Mom's basement talking to men pretending to be 14-year-old girls.  But, back when I was first getting online, the main gateway for access was the dial-up BBS, preferably one that was a local call to your area code and prefix.  What that meant is that most of the people I was chatting with online were within a 16-year-old's parentally condoned driving radius.\r\n\r\nSo, I never lived in the basement, and I *did* actually get out quite a bit.  The only real strange bit was that very few of my social group went to school together--and actually, most of us were misfits in school, some counting the minutes till we could get back to each other.  Having just finished Cory Doctorow's [*Eastern Standard Tribe*][est] (read on my Treo 600, my *comm*, no less), I can totally grok the tribes.  Mine was as small as an area code or two, rather than a time zone, but I had a tribe.  Still do, even though we've since dispersed across many, many area codes.  Now there's [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com) and [Xanga](http://www.xanga.com), among other tribe-building technologies.\r\n\r\nBut lately, in the past few years, I've been changing.  I'm only 29 now, but I've learned what a day planner is for and my to-do list is crucial; I know enough about the news on TV not to watch it much, yet I pull in enormous volumes of news from online sources and magazines.  And, as I wrote earlier, NPR is now the only station on my radio dial.\r\n\r\nWhen I was 16, the presidential race was a curiosity about which I felt vague guilt for not knowing more. But, this time around I'm giving it an attention and range of emotion akin to a rabid sports fan during playoffs.  I lost sleep over whether or not my voter registration was up to date with my correct address.  I do realize that for many, many reasons this particular presidential race is historic.

Being a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/14/info_freako_or_whos_already_past_arguing_about_syndication_formats\">high-bandwidth Info Freako</a>, a feeling of time wasted comes upon me pretty quickly.  I can speed read and I want to get through this quickly, but I can&#39;t speed listen.  I want to throw a bookmark at <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">del.icio.us</a> if I like it, but I can&#39;t select any text.  Getting a bit bored, I start thinking about how maybe I might want to remix this crap, make a funky beat out of all the utterances of &#8220;um&#8221;, &#8220;ahh&#8221;, and &#8220;err&#8221;.</p>\n<p>So, yeah, this sucks.  Not picking on any particular audio blogger or post -- because they&#39;re almost all like this -- but I want that 4 minutes of my life back.</p>\n<p>But the thing is, I&#39;m a news radio junkie.  I abandoned listening to music over the air almost seven years ago, so when I&#39;m not listening to MP3 CDRs, my car tuner is almost perpetually locked on NPR.  I listen to people jabbering at me at almost all times while I&#39;m driving.  And at work, I mix listening to my MP3s with streaming talk, news, and old sci-fi radio stations.</p>\n<p>The difference here is that radio doesn&#39;t demand much of my attention.  I&#39;m usually doing something else while I&#39;m listening, like driving or working.  I don&#39;t have to navigate to anything, I don&#39;t have to provide any feedback or make any decisions--I just have to let it stream into my head.  The lower mental demands of audio and a lack of necessary interaction dovetail nicely with multitasking.</p>\n<p>So, in come <a href=\"http://ipodderx.com/\">iPodderX</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ipodder.org/directory/4/ipodderSoftware\">friends</a>.  They&#39;re feed aggregators specifically built to slurp down audio enclosures and sync them up to audio players like the iPod.  The idea is that, when you leave home, you take the digital audio player with you, loaded up with your own personal radio programming.  Not having an iPod, I&#39;ve been queuing these aggregated audio posts up in iTunes at work, and I&#39;ve been playing around with burning CDRW&#39;s for use in my car&#39;s in-dash MP3 player.  Once I get a headphone adapter for my Treo 600, maybe I&#39;ll start listening to them on there.</p>\n<p>With this switch of perspective, I think I&#39;m falling for the hype.  The key is to get out of the way: aggregate, queue, and play in the background.  Yeah, there&#39;s going to be a lot of awful crap out there, and lots of dorks eating breakfast and lipsmacking into the microphone as they blab (this is me, shuddering)--but as the number of podcasters expand, we will start to hear some <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/22/bloggingyourbliss\">blissful hams</a> showing up with things worth listening to.</p>\n<p>I&#39;d like to do <em>something</em>, but I doubt I have the time or insight to produce something worth listening to on a regular basis.  <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/categories/dailySourceCode/\">Adam Curry</a> suggested doing things like a daily quote, jokes, or skits--short, good things have value.  (Pete&#39;s encounter with frozen pizza instructions on <a href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/200408.html#08192004073000\">Rasterweb Audio</a> made me snort a bit.)</p>\n<p>The first thing that comes to my mind are these old sci-fi radio broacasts to which I&#39;m addicted.  While I have written stories of my own, I wonder how much public-domain or Creative Commons licensed content is out there available?  Could be fun to do some readings and a maybe do a little low-budget foley work.  Of course, there&#39;s the hosting and bandwidth to worry about, though I suppose BitTorrent could help if the aggregators support it (and they should!)</p>\n<p>In any case, I think the podcasters are on to something here.

    "summary": "<p>So, over the last day or so, I&apos;ve found myself falling for the <a href=\"http://www.ipodder.org/\">Podcasting</a> hype.  </p>\n<p>Yeah, yeah, I know -- I listened to and read <a href=\"http://www.idlewords.com/audio-manifesto.txt\">Maciej&apos;s audioblogging manifesto</a> (and, yes, that&apos;s a link to the <strong>text</strong> version, which kind of helps support the argument therein) but I think the addition of portable digital audio players and RSS feeds with enclosures to the mix changes things.  </p>\n<p>The whole audioblogging thing has seemed incredibly stupid and annoying to me, since my experience of it so far has mostly consisted of this:  I navigate first to a text blog entry, click on a link to an MP3, then stare at the screen as the thing plays.  Being a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/14/info_freako_or_whos_already_past_arguing_about_syndication_formats\">high-bandwidth Info Freako</a>, a feeling of time wasted comes upon me pretty quickly.  I can speed read and I want to get through this quickly, but I can&apos;t speed listen.  I want to throw a bookmark at <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">del.icio.us</a> if I like it, but I can&apos;t select any text.  Getting a bit bored, I start thinking about how maybe I might want to remix this crap, make a funky beat out of all the utterances of &#x201C;um&#x201D;, &#x201C;ahh&#x201D;, and &#x201C;err&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>So, yeah, this sucks.  Not picking on any particular audio blogger or post -- because they&apos;re almost all like this -- but I want that 4 minutes of my life back.</p>\n<p>But the thing is, I&apos;m a news radio junkie.  I abandoned listening to music over the air almost seven years ago, so when I&apos;m not listening to MP3 CDRs, my car tuner is almost perpetually locked on NPR.  I listen to people jabbering at me at almost all times while I&apos;m driving.  And at work, I mix listening to my MP3s with streaming talk, news, and old sci-fi radio stations.</p>\n<p>The difference here is that radio doesn&apos;t demand much of my attention.  I&apos;m usually doing something else while I&apos;m listening, like driving or working.  I don&apos;t have to navigate to anything, I don&apos;t have to provide any feedback or make any decisions--I just have to let it stream into my head.  The lower mental demands of audio and a lack of necessary interaction dovetail nicely with multitasking.</p>\n<p>So, in come <a href=\"http://ipodderx.com/\">iPodderX</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ipodder.org/directory/4/ipodderSoftware\">friends</a>.  They&apos;re feed aggregators specifically built to slurp down audio enclosures and sync them up to audio players like the iPod.  The idea is that, when you leave home, you take the digital audio player with you, loaded up with your own personal radio programming.  Not having an iPod, I&apos;ve been queuing these aggregated audio posts up in iTunes at work, and I&apos;ve been playing around with burning CDRW&apos;s for use in my car&apos;s in-dash MP3 player.  Once I get a headphone adapter for my Treo 600, maybe I&apos;ll start listening to them on there.</p>\n<p>With this switch of perspective, I think I&apos;m falling for the hype.  The key is to get out of the way: aggregate, queue, and play in the background.  Yeah, there&apos;s going to be a lot of awful crap out there, and lots of dorks eating breakfast and lipsmacking into the microphone as they blab (this is me, shuddering)--but as the number of podcasters expand, we will start to hear some <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/22/bloggingyourbliss\">blissful hams</a> showing up with things worth listening to.</p>\n<p>I&apos;d like to do <em>something</em>, but I doubt I have the time or insight to produce something worth listening to on a regular basis.  <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/categories/dailySourceCode/\">Adam Curry</a> suggested doing things like a daily quote, jokes, or skits--short, good things have value.  (Pete&apos;s encounter with frozen pizza instructions on <a href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/200408.html#08192004073000\">Rasterweb Audio</a> made me snort a bit.)</p>\n<p>The first thing that comes to my mind are these old sci-fi radio broacasts to which I&apos;m addicted.  While I have written stories of my own, I wonder how much public-domain or Creative Commons licensed content is out there available?  Could be fun to do some readings and a maybe do a little low-budget foley work.  Of course, there&apos;s the hosting and bandwidth to worry about, though I suppose BitTorrent could help if the aggregators support it (and they should!)</p>\n<p>In any case, I think the podcasters are on to something here.  I&apos;ll be listening.</p>\n"

I&#39;ve gone through phases of wanting this place to be a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/25/i_was_a_preteen_transactor_author_wannabe_and_still_am\">bit of a techie zine</a>, I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/07/14/dork_funk\">been in a funk</a>, and lately I&#39;ve been telling myself that I should <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/29/blogging_without_thought\"><em>blog like no one&#39;s watching</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Funny thing is, between those thoughts and my recent activity on a project, I&#39;ve been posting quite a bit more than I have in a long time.  If I were to critique recent posts, I&#39;d beat myself up for being either far too nerdy and obscure, or being inane.  Yet, oddly enough, I&#39;d gotten comments and emails that demonstrate obvious interest.</p>\n<p>But, it&#39;s not a thing to manipulate like search engine listings.  When I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1\">written something</a> that I expected to get a lot of comments, it didn&#39;t at first.  When I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/15/manipulating_aggregate_resources_in_a_rest_api\">posted something</a> that I expected to float by without much comment, it got eight right away.  I suppose one could carefully monitor and analyze trendy topics in blogs and try to post only things with high buzz factor, but the best thing is just to write like no one&#39;s watching and be pleasantly surprised when you <em>do</em> get attention.</p>\n<p>The way I perceive this whole blogosphere working, long term, is for bloggers to read some Joseph Campbell and <a href=\"http://www.jcf.org/bliss.php\"><strong>&#8220;Follow Your Bliss&#8221;</strong></a>.  You could serve the whims of &#8220;traffic&#8221; for awhile, but if it&#39;s not following your bliss, you&#39;ll get tired of keeping up.  But if you hook into your bliss, there&#39;s bound to be traffic-a-plenty coming just to watch you do your own funky breakdance on that piece of cardboard you threw down on your domain name.</p>\n<p>Maybe I&#39;m a bit too optimistic about <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/\">noospheric homesteading</a>, but I expect that the pressures of this space will eventually leave only two kinds of bloggers: the ones who get paid enough, and the ones who have to be here because their bliss won&#39;t let them do anything else.</p>\n<p>(And I expect the economics to slant in favor of bliss.)</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=bloggingyourbliss</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084985\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084985\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-22T12:48:42\">2004-09-22T12:48:42</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">The number of comments is probably related to the length of the article -- people don't want to comment on an article they don't finish, and if it's long even if they do finish it they might feel a need to move on to something else instead of spending more time to comment.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084986\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084986\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-22T13:00:00\">2004-09-22T13:00:00</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Ian: That's definitely a good point.

But if you hook into your bliss, there&apos;s bound to be traffic-a-plenty coming just to watch you do your own funky breakdance on that piece of cardboard you threw down on your domain name.</p>\n<p>Maybe I&apos;m a bit too optimistic about <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/\">noospheric homesteading</a>, but I expect that the pressures of this space will eventually leave only two kinds of bloggers: the ones who get paid enough, and the ones who have to be here because their bliss won&apos;t let them do anything else.</p>\n<p>(And I expect the economics to slant in favor of bliss.)</p>\n"

You have a business when you make something that someone else wants. Bloglines makes something that lots of people want -- there's probably some way to make money from it, whether it's through advertising or selling some add-on service.\nFeed processors aren't for ordinary people, they are something that services like Bloglines want, or corporate IT groups want. \nThere are two ways to make money in this second category.\n1) Get a business partner, and develop something that can be sold to software and services companies.\n2) Develop a superb open source toolkit, and make money from customizing it. \nThe fact that feed processors will eventually be a part of Bloglines etc. is a plus, because organizations make build-buy decisions. If there's a component that's good, the bigger company may buy, license, or hire.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

You have a business when you make something that someone else wants. Bloglines makes something that lots of people want -- there's probably some way to make money from it, whether it's through advertising or selling some add-on service.\r\n\r\nFeed processors aren't for ordinary people, they are something that services like Bloglines want, or corporate IT groups want. \r\n\r\nThere are two ways to make money in this second category.\r\n\r\n1) Get a business partner, and develop something that can be sold to software and services companies.\r\n\r\n2) Develop a superb open source toolkit, and make money from customizing it. \r\n\r\nThe fact that feed processors will eventually be a part of Bloglines etc. is a plus, because organizations make build-buy decisions. If there's a component that's good, the bigger company may buy, license, or hire.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

They're good, but if you're already worried about your ability to tweak a Linux server, they might not be the right host for you. They'll do basic support quickly and politely--but anything more involved (like figuring out why certain Perl scripts, such as SpamAssassin, occasionally cause my entire server to hang and require a hard reboot) is left up to you. You're the site administrator, and they'll charge extra for any significant degree of assistance--if they're able to provide it at all.\nThat said, if you're willing and able to do it yourself, they're an excellent deal.

I moved a bunch of stuff there almost a year ago, and have been 99% satisfied.

I've got four boxees with them right now, and have nothing but good stories to tell. They seem to do everything right, for a really good price.  As Roger points out, they're definitely very customer focused, to the point they have a one-ring SLA on their NOC phone.  One ring on an 800 number, and you're not only talking to a warm person, but a warm person with a clue.\nI've worked on a lot of ev1 servers, and have many, many horror stories to tell.  I've had to walk noc technicians through using ping, had newly commissioned boxes comprimised before I could even login (I logged in within 12 hours of the box being setup).  And I've heard really, really frightening stories of major security issues (like using one of the four major IM networks to shuttle customer box root passwords around).  They have good prices, and generally don't screw up too bad if nothing goes wrong with your box, but that's about it...</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084275\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cb564795a1912c36f9fa1399fd22ce29&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/\">Bryce</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084275\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-22T09:21:05\">2004-09-22T09:21:05</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Thought I'd toss a few more things out at you:\n0) Stock Apache installations are usually not tuned for low memory utilization.

Typically they do not have fixed RAM allocations because they are not true virtual machines. I know for a fact that the iServer / Verio (ex-employer) VPS platform uses soft limits but their offerings cost more than many dedicated products. You already know that JohnCompanies has a BSD product, and I've heard good things about JVDS.\n3) 1&1 offers managed dedicated servers without root access for $59-$109.

    "body": "Now that I've just moved over to this JohnCompanies hosting, I'm realizing several things:\r\n\r\n* Virtual dedicated hosting on a shared box is not nearly the same as having your own box.\r\n* While I mostly know what I'm doing, I do have a bit to learn about tweaking a linux server.\r\n* I don't know a good deal in hosting when I see it.\r\n\r\nMainly, I think it's that whatever I'm doing with FeedReactor is intermittently killing this box.  But I suspect it's worse than that, though this surprises me since when last I used JohnCompanies, I was used to rock solid service-- so I have to assume the instability is my fault.  (I keep hitting memory limits that result in random failures and malloc denials.)\r\n\r\nI've had several generous offers to host my experiments and I, but eventually, I think I should just rent my own dedicated hardware somewhere.  Anyone have some good advice on where and how much?\r\n\r\nSo far I'm looking at:\r\n\r\n* <http://www.ev1servers.net/> (Thanks to [Imajes](http://imajes.info/))\r\n* <http://www.serverbeach.com/>\r\n\r\nMaybe someday soon I'll come up with something that would justify and fund decent hosting.  In the meantime, I'm hoping for something around US$100 or less that doesn't die all the time.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084260\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.acetylene.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a91cc3f530193ccc9b218cd27bb04fcf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.acetylene.net/\">Nicholas Dunham</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084260\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-20T16:25:07\">2004-09-20T16:25:07</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I've been using ev1 for a couple of years now.

One ring on an 800 number, and you're not only talking to a warm person, but a warm person with a clue.\r\n\r\nI've worked on a lot of ev1 servers, and have many, many horror stories to tell.  I've had to walk noc technicians through using ping, had newly commissioned boxes comprimised before I could even login (I logged in within 12 hours of the box being setup).  And I've heard really, really frightening stories of major security issues (like using one of the four major IM networks to shuttle customer box root passwords around).

I know for a fact that the iServer / Verio (ex-employer) VPS platform uses soft limits but their offerings cost more than many dedicated products. You already know that JohnCompanies has a BSD product, and I've heard good things about JVDS.\r\n\r\n3) 1&1 offers managed dedicated servers without root access for $59-$109. If you're trying not to be a SysAdmin that may be a good option.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084276\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://jm3.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4a0577bc70bd8b9b1b2b2b20820ee4f9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://jm3.net\">jm3</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084276\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-23T11:13:22\">2004-09-23T11:13:22</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">i've always had good service with pair.com, but i'm not sure about their dedicated server programs. only used their shared services. they impress me, tho.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

I haven't put much effort at all into making it fit within my site template, but that should be easy enough once I get the time.\r\n\r\nTo start off, I'm going to work on emptying out my head on [dbagg3 / FeedReactor][feedreactor].\r\n\r\n[feedreactor]: http://www.decafbad.com/kwiki/index.cgi?FeedReactor\r\n[twiki]: http://www.twiki.org\r\n[kwiki]: http://www.kwiki.org\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090689\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.socialtext.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e377f3e2140297d32460ae9a4b38ff98&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.socialtext.com\">Edward Vielmetti</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090689\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-18T18:19:22\">2004-09-18T18:19:22</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Good choice Les - drop me a line if you want to get a personal intro to the project team.

So it looks like there are some people starting to follow to what I&apos;m doing with <code>dbagg3</code>, and they&apos;re showing me how woefully prepared I am for the attention from tinkerers who are actually trying to, you know, <strong>run</strong> my code.  Things have been crazy busy for me at work, so I haven&apos;t been getting done what I&apos;ve planned.  But, I do need to pull a few things together and clean a few things up.  I&apos;ll soon be answering the smattering of email I&apos;ve gotten so far, but until then, a few quick thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>My source control is a bit of a mess at the moment.  Not only have I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/16/moving_time_from_cvs_to_subversion\">switched from CVS to SVN</a>-- but even if you followed me in that migration, I&apos;ve not kept committed code in working order.  I already know that this is a horrible habit, but since no one&apos;s really been looking, I haven&apos;t been called on it until now.  (Heh, heh--d&apos;oh.)  Planning this weekend (but hopefully today) to resolve this, so that moving forward, svn trunk will be (as far as possible) in a working state at any given moment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I&apos;ve hacked one of my dependencies, SQLObject, by applying <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=9122066\">a patch</a> to support SELECT DISTINCT queries.  This has understandably caused problems for some people who have no idea what I did.  This patch has turned out to be essential, though I don&apos;t know if/when it will or would be included in a release of SQLObject.  So...  I wonder if I should dump my working copy of SQLObject into source control?  Otherwise, applying the DISTINCT patch to your SQLObject install should work.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>At some point very soon, I want to change the name of this thing to <strong>feedReactor</strong>.  Yes, I know there&apos;s already a <em>feedparser</em>, and a <em>feeddemon</em>, and a <em>feedburner</em>, and someone&apos;s probably got a <em>feedkitchensink</em> in the works, but I like this name and want to run with it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, in the meantime while I straighten some things out, please excuse the mess and thanks for bearing with me!</p>\n"

I can't remember what they look like, but it's really nothing more than several HTTP requests packaged in XML.  They use it for doing atomic operations on several files/resources.  It's kind of REST, kind of anti-REST.\nOtherwise, of course, the query string is reasonably unordered and allows multiple pieces of data, i.e., /subscriptions/now-12.xml?id=1&id=2&id=3\nAnother option is to somehow define sets.  E.g., something like POST /createset (request body contains the IDs) and then the server responds with an identifier for that set, and then you work with that identifier.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090522\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0d0148e03ff9f1639cab8b35bf625db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Ken Meltsner</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090522\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-16T15:31:28\">2004-09-16T15:31:28</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">You could have the system return an existing identifier as the response to sending it a set of identifiers, if that set has already been defined.\nThat is, treat the GET as more of a \"return existing or create a new one\" operation.  And if you want to be really consistent, allow sets to include other sets.\nPerhaps something like:\nGET /setID/entries/12322,12326,12325,12388,12412\nwould return \n912345678\nthe first time and all following times, and then 912345678 could be used from then on.\nI think this would be idempotent, cache-friendly, etc.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090523\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.markbaker.ca\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=05a5272a087ce9a44bd5f050932d7a28&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.markbaker.ca\">Mark Baker</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090523\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-26T14:03:39\">2004-09-26T14:03:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Yah, REST isn't ideal for dealing with sets of resources since most operations on sets are specific to sets and therefore not uniform.  Consider the equivalent of a \"FILL\" operation, which would be a PUT on everything in a set of resources, where the set was identified by the HTTP Request-URI.\nWebDAV can help with its collections stuff, but sometimes that's overkill.  When I've encountered this, I've simply created a resource for the set and a POST on it changes the state of all the members of the set.  Not RESTful, but so long as you understand the architectural consequences, that's ok.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090524\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ad3bec4560b1c5d0ffddddc497c8b1e0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jeremy Dunck</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090524\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-05T15:17:52\">2004-10-05T15:17:52</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I'm not a well-experienced, RESTian.

It seems like it's a lot like the old saw about pornography: I can't define it, but I know it when I see it :-).</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090520\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090520\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-15T20:55:05\">2004-09-15T20:55:05</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Upon further reading: isn't Jeremy's method wrong per Paul Prescod's \"Common REST Mistakes\" (http://www.prescod.net/rest/mistakes/)?

I can't remember what they look like, but it's really nothing more than several HTTP requests packaged in XML.  They use it for doing atomic operations on several files/resources.  It's kind of REST, kind of anti-REST.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, of course, the query string is reasonably unordered and allows multiple pieces of data, i.e., /subscriptions/now-12.xml?id=1&id=2&id=3\r\n\r\nAnother option is to somehow define sets.  E.g., something like POST /createset (request body contains the IDs) and then the server responds with an identifier for that set, and then you work with that identifier.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090522\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0d0148e03ff9f1639cab8b35bf625db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Ken Meltsner</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090522\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-16T15:31:28\">2004-09-16T15:31:28</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">You could have the system return an existing identifier as the response to sending it a set of identifiers, if that set has already been defined.\r\n\r\nThat is, treat the GET as more of a \"return existing or create a new one\" operation.  And if you want to be really consistent, allow sets to include other sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps something like:\r\n\r\nGET /setID/entries/12322,12326,12325,12388,12412\r\n\r\nwould return \r\n\r\n912345678\r\n\r\nthe first time and all following times, and then 912345678 could be used from then on.\r\n\r\nI think this would be idempotent, cache-friendly, etc.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090523\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.markbaker.ca\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=05a5272a087ce9a44bd5f050932d7a28&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.markbaker.ca\">Mark Baker</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090523\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-26T14:03:39\">2004-09-26T14:03:39</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Yah, REST isn't ideal for dealing with sets of resources since most operations on sets are specific to sets and therefore not uniform.  Consider the equivalent of a \"FILL\" operation, which would be a PUT on everything in a set of resources, where the set was identified by the HTTP Request-URI.\r\n\r\nWebDAV can help with its collections stuff, but sometimes that's overkill.  When I've encountered this, I've simply created a resource for the set and a POST on it changes the state of all the members of the set.  Not RESTful, but so long as you understand the architectural consequences, that's ok.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090524\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ad3bec4560b1c5d0ffddddc497c8b1e0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Jeremy Dunck</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090524\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-10-05T15:17:52\">2004-10-05T15:17:52</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I'm not a well-experienced, RESTian.

But I just have to get this out: I&#39;m easily excited by shiny code and gadgets, but it&#39;s so much easier to get excited when I can see something in working condition before taking a screwdriver to it.  So... remember <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/30/dbagg3_makingprogress\">when I mentioned all those URLs</a>?  They&#39;re working out nicely.</p>\n<p>First, check out a simple two-pane view of news items, ala <a href=\"http://www.bloglines.com/\">Bloglines</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml?xsl=xsl/two-pane/index.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml?xsl=xsl/two-pane/index.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taking this apart, you can see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A user account: <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml</a></li>\n<li>Some XSL: <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/xsl/two-pane/index.xsl\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/xsl/two-pane/index.xsl</a></li>\n<li>... and a specified content type (text/html)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your curiosity is piqued by this, view source and pay attention to link URLs.  It&#39;s more of the same:  XML produced by a REST API, passed through XSL, delivered as HTML.</p>\n<p>Here, take a look at another view on this demo user&#39;s aggregated items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/outliner/index.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/outliner/index.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, this only seems to be working decently with Firefox and Safari.  MSIE seems to be balking at the dynamic stuff, though I&#39;ve had it working there in a previous incarnation of this code.  So hopefully this will be fixed soon.</p>\n<p>At any rate, what you should see is a single-pane outliner-style display of feed entries.  This is the style of aggregator UI I&#39;ve been using for almost 3 years now.  Disclosure triangles open entries up to show summaries and further content.  &#8220;[seen]&#8221; links hide the entries, while &#8220;[queue]&#8221; hides an entry while tossing it into a queue for viewing later.</p>\n<p>Speaking of that, you can see what&#39;s in the queue right now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;show_queued=1\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;show_queued=1</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a display of queued entries, with another stylesheet applied that shows everything in a flat and open blog-like template.  It&#39;s not reverse-chronological, but that&#39;s not hard to accomplish with a flag or a tweak to an &lt;xsl:sort&gt; tag.  </p>\n<p>So that&#39;s just the start of things.  Remember <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/23/slicing_and_dicing_to_make_atom_soup_in_dbagg3\">when I was rambling on about XML storage and query</a>?  A URL like this is one product of that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),'OS%20X')]\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),&#39;OS%20X&#39;)]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This should show you a flat listing of all entries whose titles contain &#8220;OS X&#8221;.  This is far from perfect, but it&#39;s very exciting to me-- it&#39;s got a lot of promise, stuff that first caught my eye when I saw <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/04/15/semanticblog.html\">Jon Udell playing</a> <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/06/10/xpathsearch.html?page=1\">awhile back</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, something that you might not notice until doing a bit more digging, is that all these attributes like &#8220;seen&#8221; and &#8220;query&#8221; are annotations made by the user on entries.  If you take a peek at <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/js/agg.js\">some of the Javascript</a> under the hood, you might notice some XmlHTTPRequest code going on.  To mark something as &#8220;seen&#8221; or &#8220;queued&#8221;, I POST XML to a URL like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The upshot of this is that these attributes are not limited to &#8220;seen&#8221; or &#8220;queued&#8221; flags-- in fact, these annotations can (well, in theory) be any pairing of arbitrary XML and a name.  This annotation then gets injected into the entry, when viewed by the user who owns the annotation, like so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In fact, you could invent a new annotation called &#39;tags&#39; and filter for entries with this annotation with a URL like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;entry%5C_notes%5C_xpath=//dbagg3:note%5B@name=&#39;tags&#39;\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;entry\\_notes\\_xpath=//dbagg3:note[@name=&#39;tags&#39;</a> and contains(text(),&#39;#food#&#39;) and contains(text(),&#39;#odd#&#39;)]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eventually, what I&#39;d <em>really</em> like to see this start doing is something akin to del.icio.us-style tagging while you&#39;re reading.  Then, you can have public queries that pull feeds based on your (and others&#39;) tags and spit things back out as feeds again with the proper XSL stylings.</p>\n<p>So at this point, it&#39;s all URLs and barely working HTML, but it&#39;s exciting to me at least.  And it&#39;s dogfood for me, since I&#39;m using this crud to get my daily (hourly?) fix.  Pretty soon, I&#39;ll be diving into wrapping more of a proper usable web app around this, with user management and stuff that works in MSIE.  Until then, maybe someone else will see this and catch a buzz from it.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=dbagg3alive</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090566\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e1cc8e7103bb0f77a7d7abf91b1a961b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Christopher</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090566\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-14T09:40:02\">2004-09-14T09:40:02</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Very cool!

It's not reverse-chronological, but that's not hard to accomplish with a flag or a tweak to an &lt;xsl:sort&gt; tag.  \r\n\r\nSo that's just the start of things.  Remember [when I was rambling on about XML storage and query][dbagg3storage]?  A URL like this is one product of that:\r\n\r\n* <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),'OS%20X')]\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),'OS%20X')]</a>\r\n\r\nThis should show you a flat listing of all entries whose titles contain &#8220;OS X&#8221;.  This is far from perfect, but it's very exciting to me-- it's got a lot of promise, stuff that first caught my eye when I saw [Jon Udell playing][xpathquery] [awhile back][xpathquery2].\r\n\r\nNow, something that you might not notice until doing a bit more digging, is that all these attributes like &#8220;seen&#8221; and &#8220;query&#8221; are annotations made by the user on entries.  If you take a peek at [some of the Javascript][js] under the hood, you might notice some XmlHTTPRequest code going on.  To mark something as &#8220;seen&#8221; or &#8220;queued&#8221;, I POST XML to a URL like this:\r\n\r\n* http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/\r\n\r\nThe upshot of this is that these attributes are not limited to &#8220;seen&#8221; or &#8220;queued&#8221; flags-- in fact, these annotations can (well, in theory) be any pairing of arbitrary XML and a name.  This annotation then gets injected into the entry, when viewed by the user who owns the annotation, like so:\r\n\r\n* http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml\r\n\r\nIn fact, you could invent a new annotation called 'tags' and filter for entries with this annotation with a URL like this:\r\n\r\n* http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;entry\\_notes\\_xpath=//dbagg3:note[@name='tags' and contains(text(),'#food#') and contains(text(),'#odd#')]\r\n\r\nEventually, what I'd *really* like to see this start doing is something akin to del.icio.us-style tagging while you're reading.  Then, you can have public queries that pull feeds based on your (and others') tags and spit things back out as feeds again with the proper XSL stylings.\r\n\r\nSo at this point, it's all URLs and barely working HTML, but it's exciting to me at least.  And it's dogfood for me, since I'm using this crud to get my daily (hourly?) fix.  Pretty soon, I'll be diving into wrapping more of a proper usable web app around this, with user management and stuff that works in MSIE.  Until then, maybe someone else will see this and catch a buzz from it.\r\n\r\nStay tuned.\r\n\r\n[js]: http://feeds.decafbad.com/js/agg.js\r\n[xpathquery2]: http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/06/10/xpathsearch.html?page=1\r\n[xpathquery]: http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/04/15/semanticblog.html\r\n[johncompanies]: http://www.johncompanies.com\r\n[dbagg3storage]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/23/slicing_and_dicing_to_make_atom_soup_in_dbagg3\r\n[dbagg3urls]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/30/dbagg3_makingprogress\r\n[dbagg3]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg3/\r\n[bloglines]: http://www.bloglines.com/\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=dbagg3alive\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090566\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e1cc8e7103bb0f77a7d7abf91b1a961b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Christopher</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090566\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-14T09:40:02\">2004-09-14T09:40:02</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Very cool!

All this functionality can be accessed elegantly through the REST-API.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nI am looking into integrating dbagg3 into my own feedbox-project (see here).

    "summary": "<p>Got some very good work in this weekend on switching servers and getting <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg3/\"><code>dbagg3</code></a> in some semblance of working order somewhere other than on my overworked and decidedly non-publicly-demonstrable laptop.</p>\n<p>This stuff is so this side of premature, that I&apos;m probably about to cause <a href=\"http://www.johncompanies.com\">JohnCompanies</a> to send hit-men out to cancel <strong>me</strong>, along with my hosting account (have I said that I <em>really</em> appreciate the help so far?).  But I just have to get this out: I&apos;m easily excited by shiny code and gadgets, but it&apos;s so much easier to get excited when I can see something in working condition before taking a screwdriver to it.  So... remember <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/30/dbagg3_makingprogress\">when I mentioned all those URLs</a>?  They&apos;re working out nicely.</p>\n<p>First, check out a simple two-pane view of news items, ala <a href=\"http://www.bloglines.com/\">Bloglines</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml?xsl=xsl/two-pane/index.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml?xsl=xsl/two-pane/index.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taking this apart, you can see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A user account: <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml</a></li>\n<li>Some XSL: <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/xsl/two-pane/index.xsl\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/xsl/two-pane/index.xsl</a></li>\n<li>... and a specified content type (text/html)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your curiosity is piqued by this, view source and pay attention to link URLs.  It&apos;s more of the same:  XML produced by a REST API, passed through XSL, delivered as HTML.</p>\n<p>Here, take a look at another view on this demo user&apos;s aggregated items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/outliner/index.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/outliner/index.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, this only seems to be working decently with Firefox and Safari.  MSIE seems to be balking at the dynamic stuff, though I&apos;ve had it working there in a previous incarnation of this code.  So hopefully this will be fixed soon.</p>\n<p>At any rate, what you should see is a single-pane outliner-style display of feed entries.  This is the style of aggregator UI I&apos;ve been using for almost 3 years now.  Disclosure triangles open entries up to show summaries and further content.  &#x201C;[seen]&#x201D; links hide the entries, while &#x201C;[queue]&#x201D; hides an entry while tossing it into a queue for viewing later.</p>\n<p>Speaking of that, you can see what&apos;s in the queue right now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;show_queued=1\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;show_queued=1</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a display of queued entries, with another stylesheet applied that shows everything in a flat and open blog-like template.

But, it seems to be working out pretty well so far, and it&#39;s so easy to tinker with the API to sketch out ideas in working code.  Eating my own dogfood, my first browser window of the day tends to open on this URL:</p>\n<pre><code>http://localhost/~deusx/dbagg3.5/api/users/default/subscriptions/\nnow-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;#38;content-type=text/html</code></pre>\n<p>This grabs the last 12 hours&#39; worth of items from <code>default</code>&#39;s subscriptions, passing them through the XSL at <code>xsl/full.xsl</code> on the way to my browser with a content type of <code>text/html</code>.  This tends to produce about 1000-1500 entries in about 15 seconds on my PowerBook, which is better than I&#39;d expected.  </p>\n<p>Pretty soon, I&#39;ll be implementing the ability to post metadata onto feed entries under subscriptions.  Then, I can mark items as seen, attach categories, tags, and notes.  From there, I can exclude seen items from queries, produce new aggregate feeds based on my tagging or notes, among a few other ideas I&#39;ve got stewing.</p>\n<p>A little more work, and I think I&#39;ll be able to throw together the beginnings of a <a href=\"http://www.bloglines.com\">Bloglines</a>-style three-pane browser interface, as well as improving the functionality of my own outliner-style display with <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html\">XmlHTTPRequest</a>-based calls to the API to enable refresh-free interaction.  From there, I have some ideas for desktop apps and maybe even some <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/19/flash_agg\">tinkering in Flash</a>.  (Wow... has it really been over a year since I was writing about Flash &#38; REST?)</p>\n<p>And <em>then</em>, I want to implement the Atom API and allow users to create feeds to which they can post their own items and share read-only with others (or share writing with a group).  From there, this thing can turn into a read/write Atom storage tank, serving both as an aggregator and a blog publishing engine, given the appropriate XSL work.</p>\n<p>Lots of ideas stewing.  Now I just have to get the time and possibly a new web server, since I&#39;d like to eventually open up an installation of this to fellow tinkerers, but this poor little box can barely take what it&#39;s tasked with at present...</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and one other thing:  I&#39;ve been thinking about names better than <code>dbagg3</code>.

This tends to produce about 1000-1500 entries in about 15 seconds on my PowerBook, which is better than I'd expected.  \r\n\r\nPretty soon, I'll be implementing the ability to post metadata onto feed entries under subscriptions.  Then, I can mark items as seen, attach categories, tags, and notes.  From there, I can exclude seen items from queries, produce new aggregate feeds based on my tagging or notes, among a few other ideas I've got stewing.\r\n\r\nA little more work, and I think I'll be able to throw together the beginnings of a [Bloglines][bloglines]-style three-pane browser interface, as well as improving the functionality of my own outliner-style display with [XmlHTTPRequest][xmlhttp]-based calls to the API to enable refresh-free interaction.  From there, I have some ideas for desktop apps and maybe even some [tinkering in Flash][flash].  (Wow... has it really been over a year since I was writing about Flash &#38; REST?)\r\n\r\nAnd *then*, I want to implement the Atom API and allow users to create feeds to which they can post their own items and share read-only with others (or share writing with a group).  From there, this thing can turn into a read/write Atom storage tank, serving both as an aggregator and a blog publishing engine, given the appropriate XSL work.\r\n\r\nLots of ideas stewing.  Now I just have to get the time and possibly a new web server, since I'd like to eventually open up an installation of this to fellow tinkerers, but this poor little box can barely take what it's tasked with at present...\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and one other thing:  I've been thinking about names better than `dbagg3`.  The one that's sticking around in my head so far is **feedReactor**.

    "summary": "<p>Work has been insanely busy lately, but I have made some more progress with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg3/\"><code>dbagg3</code></a>.  The code is all in CVS, so feel free to take a gander-- I don&apos;t have a ton of time for a proper write up, but I do want to spew a little bit. </p>\n<p>As per my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/23/slicing_and_dicing_to_make_atom_soup_in_dbagg3\">previous musings on XML in a SQL database</a>, I revamped the database.  Now things are sliced up by feed and entry tables, rows in each containing a few metadata columns and then one big column for an XML dump.  This lets me index on  date and parent feed and such, meanwhile punting on the issue of dicing things like authors or content up further.  And, as extension elements start to show up, this handling is dumb enough to simply store things it doesn&apos;t know about without mangling them.  This is a very good thing and one of my big goals for this beast.</p>\n<p>The other thing that I&apos;m getting excited about is the REST API built atop the Atom store.  Rather than spend time on proper documentation, here&apos;s a quick dump from the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/dbagg3/lib/dbagg3/rest.py\">appropriate module</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>URL: GET /feeds/\nURL: GET /feeds/{id}.xml\nURL: GET /feeds/{id}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hstart}-{hend}.xml\nURL: GET /feeds/{id}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hh}.xml\nURL: GET /feeds/{id}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}.xml\nURL: GET /feeds/{id}/{yyyy}/{mm}.xml\nURL: GET /feeds/{id}/now-{nowoff}.xml\nURL: GET /feeds/{fid}/entries/{eid}.xml\nURL: GET /users/\nURL: GET /users/{uname}.xml\nURL: POST /users/\nURL: DELETE /users/{uname}.xml\nURL: PUT /users/{uname}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/prefs.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/prefs/\nURL: POST /users/{uname}/prefs/{pname}.{type}\nURL: PUT /users/{uname}/prefs/{pname}.{type}\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/prefs/{pname}.{type}\nURL: DELETE /users/{uname}/prefs/{pname}.{type}\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions.{type}\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/\nURL: POST /users/{uname}/subscriptions/\nURL: DELETE /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{id}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{sid}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hstart}-{hend}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{sid}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hh}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{sid}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{sid}/{yyyy}/{mm}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{sid}/now-{hours}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{sid}/now.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hstart}-{hend}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hh}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{yyyy}/{mm}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/now-{hours}.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/now.xml\nURL: GET /users/{uname}/subscriptions/{sid}/entries/{eid}.xml</code></pre>\n<p>Hopefully, the structure of these URL patterns make a little bit of sense.  The too-clever thing about these is that they&apos;re both documentation in the module&apos;s docstrings, and parsed out to register methods with automagically-generated regexes applied to incoming URL requests.  (I may eventually realize just how stupid an idea this is, but not yet.)  </p>\n<p>This list is nowhere near complete or final or even all that well thought out yet.

This article brings two thoughts to mind for me...</p>\n<p>First is this:  Of course, if you&apos;re striving for some semblance of realism in games, the costs will likely approach and exceed the cost to produce movies.  It&apos;ll approach the cost because, eventually, you&apos;ll need either movie-grade animators or real actors.  And then it&apos;ll exceed the cost, because who wants a game that&apos;s as linear as a 2-hour movie?  If you want any replay value out of the thing, you&apos;re going to have to produce the equivalent of a 4-hour movie at least, if not a 20- to 40-hour movie.  And then, you&apos;re going to have to be satisfied that many players will miss most of it.  Once things reach this point, I think in some sense video games will have arrived as a &quot;successor&quot; to movies, as movies were a &quot;successor&quot; to radio plays.</p>\n<p>This brings me to my second thought:  Right now, I&apos;m listening to a streaming radio station that&apos;s playing old sci-fi and drama radio plays, like X Minus One and The Shadow.  These shows are great, and I&apos;m thinking of buying a few box sets of them.  These old radio shows get quite a bit of mileage out of their less technologically advanced medium.  In contrast to this, my consumption of contemporary and popular television, movies, and music has been dropping off from year to year as I get more tired of supremely well-produced yet worthless content.</p>\n<p>Music gets sold on anything but a good tune, movies sold on special effects over plot, and video games head toward technological supremacy over a fun hook or even an engaging story line.  But, I don&apos;t want anything to do with any of these.</p>\n<p>A few days ago, a friend of mine remarked that many &quot;retro&quot; video games were just as horrible as modern video games, but I have to disagree a bit.  There were a lot of horrible games.  But, for games to be successful back when the dazzle factor of the hardware was low, you needed the fun trick or clever twist that addicted players.  The constraints called for ingenuity.  Sometimes this meant pushing the hardware, and sometimes this meant coming up with a brilliant yet simple-to-implement idea.  (Tetris, I&apos;m looking at you.)</p>\n<p>As the hardware platforms progress, we&apos;ll see more and more absolutely dazzling demos of the hardware sold as games that completely fail at being fun.  But they&apos;ll have insane budgets and probably sell very well just because people want to see the pretty sparklies and foobar shaders.  The increased capabilities will offer more expressive ability to interactive storytellers, but I bet it will just give even more excuse for game makers to be distracted from that and keep pumping out stories that suck carried by game play that reeks.</p>\n<p>It all makes me almost wish for a kink in Moore&apos;s Law that stalls the progress of dazzling hardware and forces developers back to being clever with their resources and game ideas.  Maybe we&apos;ll see more and more of an indie games community rise, producing genuinely fun and amusingly ingenious games.  (<a href=\"http://www.chroniclogic.com/gish/\">Gish</a>, I&apos;m looking at you.)</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, my girlfriend and I will be playing massive amounts of <a href=\"http://www.neo-geo.com/reviews/neo-reviews/md3/md3.html\">Magical Drop III</a>.</p>\n"

We would very much appreciate your suggestions/comments on the concept especially because dbagg looks like a nice \"persistent storage\" for aggregating feeds and - together with the tools you showed in the post \"Introducing dbagg3, an Atom-powered client/server aggregator\" should also be usable as a kind of debugger for feed-munching tools ...\r\n\r\nPlease have a look: (the link was not accepted here because of the underscores in the url; but you can find it on the homepage of my webblog \"A simple (but universal) toolbox for building Blogs (and Websites) from RSS-Feeds\")</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

Well, actually I&#39;m getting hung up on the subject of XML storage, query, and retrieval in general-- but at present, I&#39;m trying to cram all this data into MySQL and SQLite databases.  But, my tendencies as an abstraction astronaut and my lack of database savvy are tying me (and my data) in knots.  I kept meaning to write a bit Atom (and XML in general) with regard to database storage and query, so maybe now&#39;s the time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"xml-databases\">XML databases</h3>\n<p>I&#39;m aware of XML-native databases like <a href=\"http://exist.sourceforge.net/\">eXist</a>, <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/xindice/\">Xindice</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.sleepycat.com/products/xml.shtml\">Berkeley DB XML</a>-- but I don&#39;t want to work in Java right now, and I can&#39;t get the Berkeley XML DB compiled and running without segfault under OS X.  This bugs me, though, since the most elegant solution to me is to use something XML-native to store and query piles of Atom feeds and entries.  I&#39;d really like to have <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/04/15/semanticblog.html\">XPath available as a query tool</a>.  And then, though I haven&#39;t heard a ton about it lately, there&#39;s XQuery.</p>\n<p>And, oh yeah, I know there are some commercial solutions (like <a href=\"http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/\">Virtuoso</a>), but umm... no.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rdf-databases\">RDF databases</h3>\n<p>I suppose I could also switch to tossing RDF around internally, maybe use RSS 1.0 under the hood.  This seems to be what the much-similar <a href=\"http://urchin.sourceforge.net/\">Urchin RSS aggregator</a> is doing.  (Maybe I should just dump <code>dbagg3</code> and pitch in with Urchin.)  But, I don&#39;t know the state of RDF art well enough to know whether there&#39;s a database available that can handle 10,000 Atom/RSS entries a week or more for a year without gagging.  (My previous database was up to 500,000 entries when I started working on <code>dbagg3</code>, and I think that was since last November.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"sql-databases\">SQL databases</h3>\n<p>So, I&#39;m screwing around with SQL databases-- MySQL and SQLite in particular.  As compared to XML and RDF databases, I know and understand and trust SQL databases so much more with regards to performance and gotchas and general techniques.  </p>\n<p>In previous incarnations of my aggregator, MySQL and SQLite served me well with pretty simple data models.  But this time around, I want to play with much richer data: I want to include everything in the Atom spec, and try to take in some metadata from extensions.  So I threw together what I thought was a pretty decent relational model onto which I could map Atom XML data.  (If you&#39;re curious, you can check out <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3.sql\">a recent schema dump</a>.)</p>\n<p>The problem is, with the XML sliced and diced and sprinkled into all these separate tables, it&#39;s a <strong>fun</strong> time reassembling the pieces.  I&#39;ve run into this problem many times before, when trying to map object hierarchies into relational databases, and usually things degrade into nasty self-joins and an explosive number of queries.  This kind of inelegance smells really bad, oily like melting plastic caused by the friction of a square peg being driven into a round hole by my forehead as a hammer.</p>\n<p>In the end, what I&#39;ve usually ended up doing is to forget about mapping from objects to the relational model: tables become a set of indices to objects, the objects themselves packed up as BLOBs via some language-dependant pickling or freezing scheme.  Nasty, ugly, fragile, and completely inelegant.  There&#39;s some of that in <code>dbagg3</code> <em>right now</em>, and I want it out.  Though I used to think it was as clever and neat as a digital watch, this smells even worse than melting plastic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"xml-in-sql-databases\">XML in SQL databases</h3>\n<p>My latest thoughts, then, are to accept some bad smells (I <em>do</em> like the smell of burning plastic, actually) and simplify my database:  Instead of pickled binary objects, I&#39;ll store XML in a column (at least that isn&#39;t implementation-tied), and other tables will give me indices to this XML.  Thinking hard about my use cases, I think I can cover 80% of what I need with being able to look things up by feed, by subscription, by user, by date, and a few other useful aspects.  Once I&#39;ve gotten a pile of data out of the database in XML form, I can then attack it with XSL.</p>\n<p>However, what gives me even further enthusiasm for this approach is <a href=\"http://www.throwingbeans.org/tech/postgresql_and_xml.html\">this little XPath extension to PostgreSQL</a>.  This gives you a set of functions to apply XPath to XML-containing columns in SQL queries.  So, you can pull out nodes in a select, or search on the results in a WHERE clause, among other things.  I haven&#39;t tried it yet, but it gives me ideas.</p>\n<p>One idea is that, through <a href=\"http://pysqlite.sourceforge.net/old/documentation/pysqlite/node10.html\">PySQLite&#39;s API additions</a>, I can easily add new SQL functions at will-- oh like, say, some XPath functions using libxml2 under python.</p>\n<p>Granted, there are no indices backing these XPath searches, and using these python functions added to SQLite comes with overhead, the availability of XPath in SQL could give me the 20% I&#39;m missing with simple tables.  It might be worth the price and the smells.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-anyway\">So Anyway...</h3>\n<p>That&#39;s where I&#39;m at right now.  I think I&#39;ve written a bunch, and all this text could use some code examples and some diagrams.  But, I figured I&#39;d think out loud a bit and see if anyone could step in and smack me for being a complete twink.  </p>\n<p>I want to slurp in Atom XML data, with arbitrary extensions, and be able to attack it with some reasonable set of queries to recombine this data into new feeds.</p>\n<p>I know I&#39;m not the only person thinking about this stuff, and I&#39;ve got to assume that I&#39;m nowhere near the smartest about it.  I&#39;m still working on this aggregator thing, and making what I think is some fun progress with a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/dbagg3/lib/dbagg3/web/api.py?rev=HEAD&#38;content-type=text/x-python\">REST interface</a>, but this data stuff has me stalled.</p>\n<p>So... what do you think?</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082837\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://franklinmint.fm\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b9ed774661a22ff8797a1e0e24f0baf3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://franklinmint.fm\">Robert Sayre</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082837\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-08-23T19:23:19\">2004-08-23T19:23:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">FYI: Apple's upcoming SafariRSS uses XQuery to parse feeds.

    "body": "I've been putting more work into [`dbagg3`][dbagg3], but I'm getting hung up on the database.  Well, actually I'm getting hung up on the subject of XML storage, query, and retrieval in general-- but at present, I'm trying to cram all this data into MySQL and SQLite databases.  But, my tendencies as an abstraction astronaut and my lack of database savvy are tying me (and my data) in knots.  I kept meaning to write a bit Atom (and XML in general) with regard to database storage and query, so maybe now's the time.\r\n\r\n### XML databases\r\n\r\nI'm aware of XML-native databases like [eXist][exist], [Xindice][xindice], and [Berkeley DB XML][bdbxml]-- but I don't want to work in Java right now, and I can't get the Berkeley XML DB compiled and running without segfault under OS X.  This bugs me, though, since the most elegant solution to me is to use something XML-native to store and query piles of Atom feeds and entries.  I'd really like to have [XPath available as a query tool][xpathudell].  And then, though I haven't heard a ton about it lately, there's XQuery.\r\n\r\nAnd, oh yeah, I know there are some commercial solutions (like [Virtuoso][virtuoso]), but umm... no.\r\n\r\n### RDF databases\r\n\r\nI suppose I could also switch to tossing RDF around internally, maybe use RSS 1.0 under the hood.  This seems to be what the much-similar [Urchin RSS aggregator][urchin] is doing.  (Maybe I should just dump `dbagg3` and pitch in with Urchin.)  But, I don't know the state of RDF art well enough to know whether there's a database available that can handle 10,000 Atom/RSS entries a week or more for a year without gagging.  (My previous database was up to 500,000 entries when I started working on `dbagg3`, and I think that was since last November.)\r\n\r\n### SQL databases\r\n\r\nSo, I'm screwing around with SQL databases-- MySQL and SQLite in particular.  As compared to XML and RDF databases, I know and understand and trust SQL databases so much more with regards to performance and gotchas and general techniques.  \r\n\r\nIn previous incarnations of my aggregator, MySQL and SQLite served me well with pretty simple data models.  But this time around, I want to play with much richer data: I want to include everything in the Atom spec, and try to take in some metadata from extensions.  So I threw together what I thought was a pretty decent relational model onto which I could map Atom XML data.  (If you're curious, you can check out [a recent schema dump][dbagg3_sql].)\r\n\r\nThe problem is, with the XML sliced and diced and sprinkled into all these separate tables, it's a **fun** time reassembling the pieces.  I've run into this problem many times before, when trying to map object hierarchies into relational databases, and usually things degrade into nasty self-joins and an explosive number of queries.  This kind of inelegance smells really bad, oily like melting plastic caused by the friction of a square peg being driven into a round hole by my forehead as a hammer.\r\n\r\nIn the end, what I've usually ended up doing is to forget about mapping from objects to the relational model: tables become a set of indices to objects, the objects themselves packed up as BLOBs via some language-dependant pickling or freezing scheme.  Nasty, ugly, fragile, and completely inelegant.  There's some of that in `dbagg3` *right now*, and I want it out.  Though I used to think it was as clever and neat as a digital watch, this smells even worse than melting plastic.\r\n\r\n### XML in SQL databases\r\n\r\nMy latest thoughts, then, are to accept some bad smells (I *do* like the smell of burning plastic, actually) and simplify my database:  Instead of pickled binary objects, I'll store XML in a column (at least that isn't implementation-tied), and other tables will give me indices to this XML.  Thinking hard about my use cases, I think I can cover 80% of what I need with being able to look things up by feed, by subscription, by user, by date, and a few other useful aspects.  Once I've gotten a pile of data out of the database in XML form, I can then attack it with XSL.\r\n\r\nHowever, what gives me even further enthusiasm for this approach is [this little XPath extension to PostgreSQL][postxml].  This gives you a set of functions to apply XPath to XML-containing columns in SQL queries.  So, you can pull out nodes in a select, or search on the results in a WHERE clause, among other things.  I haven't tried it yet, but it gives me ideas.\r\n\r\nOne idea is that, through [PySQLite's API additions][pysqliteapi], I can easily add new SQL functions at will-- oh like, say, some XPath functions using libxml2 under python.\r\n\r\nGranted, there are no indices backing these XPath searches, and using these python functions added to SQLite comes with overhead, the availability of XPath in SQL could give me the 20% I'm missing with simple tables.  It might be worth the price and the smells.\r\n\r\n### So Anyway...\r\n\r\nThat's where I'm at right now.  I think I've written a bunch, and all this text could use some code examples and some diagrams.  But, I figured I'd think out loud a bit and see if anyone could step in and smack me for being a complete twink.  \r\n\r\nI want to slurp in Atom XML data, with arbitrary extensions, and be able to attack it with some reasonable set of queries to recombine this data into new feeds.\r\n\r\nI know I'm not the only person thinking about this stuff, and I've got to assume that I'm nowhere near the smartest about it.  I'm still working on this aggregator thing, and making what I think is some fun progress with a [REST interface][dbagg3_api], but this data stuff has me stalled.\r\n\r\nSo... what do you think?\r\n\r\n[virtuoso]: http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/\r\n[dbagg3_api]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/dbagg3/lib/dbagg3/web/api.py?rev=HEAD&#38;content-type=text/x-python\r\n[pysqliteapi]: http://pysqlite.sourceforge.net/old/documentation/pysqlite/node10.html\r\n[postxml]: http://www.throwingbeans.org/tech/postgresql_and_xml.html\r\n[exist]: http://exist.sourceforge.net/\r\n[xindice]: http://xml.apache.org/xindice/\r\n[bdbxml]: http://www.sleepycat.com/products/xml.shtml\r\n[urchin]: http://urchin.sourceforge.net/\r\n[dbagg3]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg3/\r\n[dbagg3_sql]: http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3.sql\r\n[xpathudell]: http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/04/15/semanticblog.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082837\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://franklinmint.fm\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b9ed774661a22ff8797a1e0e24f0baf3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://franklinmint.fm\">Robert Sayre</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082837\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-08-23T19:23:19\">2004-08-23T19:23:19</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">FYI: Apple's upcoming SafariRSS uses XQuery to parse feeds.

Somewhat serendipitously, I just caught Bob DuCharme&#39;s xml.com <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/08/04/tr-xml.html\">article on Amazon.com&#39;s web services</a>, which <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1\">I really like</a> and have drawn inspiration from in thinking about this new aggregator.  Eventually, I want to offer the same sort of XML+XSL style of service that they&#39;ve put together, along with some futher inspiration from the <a href=\"http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/api/atom-api-spec.php\">Atom API</a>.  </p>\n<p>Anyway, as another teaser, check out this early demo involving the XML this thing has been producing, coupled with some experimental XSL:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/demo.xml\">dbagg3 demo page</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You&#39;ll notice that there are three URLs involved here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi\">An XSLT processor service</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl\">An XSLT stylesheet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/demo.xml\">Some aggregated Atom feeds</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The XSLT expects Atom (plus a few extensions of my own), so you can also do things like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.diveintomark.org/xml/atom.xml\">Dive Into Mark</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/index.atom\">Intertwingly</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.decafbad.com/blog/atom.xml\">0xDECAFBAD</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are the sorts of tricks I was looking forward to when I started thinking about things like a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/17/use_atom_for_a_universal_blog_transfer_protocol\">universal blog transfer format</a> and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/03/put_on_your_rsscolored_glasses_and_forget_about_atom\">rose-colored glasses</a>.  XSLT used like this could just as easily produce a blog or RSS 2.0 content.</p>\n<p>Anyway, hoping to get some code into CVS by this weekend that&#39;s not entirely embarassing.  So if you&#39;re interested in this stuff, stay tuned.  I&#39;m hoping that this thing can provide a base for others interested in feed aggregation--if you just want to play with UI, use the scanning and storage as-is and tinker with XSLT; if you want to play with storage and query, leave the scanning and UI alone; if you want to tinker with parsing... er, <a href=\"http://www.feedparser.org/\">talk to Mark Pilgrim</a>.</p>\n<p>More soon!  </p>\n<p>(Oh yeah, and I <em>will</em> be working on coming up with a better name than <code>dbagg3</code>.  Unfortunately, I probably won&#39;t be coming up with a more visually appealing design for the UI, since what you see is the best I can do.  Heh, heh.

It seems that this could be the base, for what I've been dreaming/thinking about the last half year or so. In contrast to you, I haven't come up with any code yet (mostly due to the fact, that I don't python yet, and I found no other reasonably good feed parser, than the Universal Feed Parser), but with a name: Roosster \nFeatures I'd really like to have in such a ClientServerAggregator are:\n(a) search over entries the aggregator has seen to date\n(b) add and arbitrary number of notes to any entry\n(c) add multiple category-tags to entries\n(d) interlink entries (I know this could be solved by some 'Related Entries' stuff, but somtimes I don't trust these \"automatic classifiers\")\nCan't wait, until I can take a look at the code and see if I can extend it. This would finally be a real reason to learn python.\nBy the way, I really like the interface. Might be, that's because I'm a programmer too?!</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084328\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e1cc8e7103bb0f77a7d7abf91b1a961b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Christopher Drake</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084328\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-08-05T18:30:41\">2004-08-05T18:30:41</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Very nice. The demo has me salivating a little.\nOddly enough, I like the UI. If you can slim it down, side-to-side-wise a bit, it would also be a great aggregator to rip whole chunks from and feed to a Palm Pilot or PocketPC, as well. They're not as big as they were in the past, but with decent strides every couple of weeks, they still have a lot of following. Your page-width is dynamic, and that means a lot to me, a Palm user.\nA feature I'd like to see is kind of like Bloglines, where you receive a small box of info from the RSS feed, or what-have-you to give you a taste of an article. If going 1 link deep from any link on the aggregator page linked to a small page with such a tidbit, it would make surfing the articles a lot faster. This would allow a PDA or cellphone to drag an aggregator page 1 link deep with specialised software and get all of the highlights from say, 20 blogs.\nThat could be a major boon, especially for people that connect while at wireless access points on business trips, etc.\nKeep it up, this looks like it'll rock when you are done.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084331\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://b4mad.net/datenbrei/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0038a1e9f4492e2f964f0f39d2d0dc7f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://b4mad.net/datenbrei/\">Christoph Görn</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084331\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-08-08T12:41:08\">2004-08-08T12:41:08</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Hi,\nand I will try to plug an jabber/XMPP bot into it, so it will deliver the aggragated content rigth to my beloved IM app...</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "**Update**: I've just dumped what code I have into my CVS repository.  So, go ahead and poke fun at it:\r\n\r\n   * <http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg3/>\r\n\r\nOr, fetch it from CVS:\r\n\r\n    $ cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@www.decafbad.com:/cvsroot login\r\n    (Logging in to anoncvs@www.decafbad.com)\r\n    CVS password: anoncvs\r\n    $ cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@www.decafbad.com:/cvsroot co dbagg3\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nSo, besides the funk, there's a little project in which I've gotten immersed.  Here's a teaser diagram:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/dbagg3-phase1.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nIt's a feed aggregator, my third attempt at such.  At present, things are roughly close to the diagram above.  Everything is clunky and command-line driven at present--but I've got further plans, like a REST API for feed queries and manipulation of various things such as feed subscriptions and the read/unread state of items.  Pair this with an XSLT-driven browser UI, and the possibility of other clients (not the least of include other Atom-consuming aggregators).\r\n\r\nThe goal is to make a [Client/Server Aggregator][clientserveragg].  Somewhat serendipitously, I just caught Bob DuCharme's xml.com [article on Amazon.com's web services][amazonrest], which [I really like][wishes] and have drawn inspiration from in thinking about this new aggregator.  Eventually, I want to offer the same sort of XML+XSL style of service that they've put together, along with some futher inspiration from the [Atom API][atomapi].  \r\n\r\nAnyway, as another teaser, check out this early demo involving the XML this thing has been producing, coupled with some experimental XSL:\r\n\r\n* [dbagg3 demo page][dbagg3demo]\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that there are three URLs involved here:\r\n\r\n* [An XSLT processor service][dbagg3xsltproc]\r\n* [An XSLT stylesheet][dbagg3xsl]\r\n* [Some aggregated Atom feeds][dbagg3xml]\r\n\r\nThe XSLT expects Atom (plus a few extensions of my own), so you can also do things like this:\r\n\r\n* [Dive Into Mark][mark]\r\n* [Intertwingly][sam]\r\n* [0xDECAFBAD][me]\r\n\r\nThese are the sorts of tricks I was looking forward to when I started thinking about things like a [universal blog transfer format][blogxfer] and [rose-colored glasses][roseglasses].  XSLT used like this could just as easily produce a blog or RSS 2.0 content.\r\n\r\nAnyway, hoping to get some code into CVS by this weekend that's not entirely embarassing.  So if you're interested in this stuff, stay tuned.  I'm hoping that this thing can provide a base for others interested in feed aggregation--if you just want to play with UI, use the scanning and storage as-is and tinker with XSLT; if you want to play with storage and query, leave the scanning and UI alone; if you want to tinker with parsing... er, [talk to Mark Pilgrim][ufp].\r\n\r\nMore soon!  \r\n\r\n(Oh yeah, and I *will* be working on coming up with a better name than `dbagg3`.  Unfortunately, I probably won't be coming up with a more visually appealing design for the UI, since what you see is the best I can do.  Heh, heh.  Don't let your programmers do visual design...)\r\n\r\n[atomapi]: http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/api/atom-api-spec.php\r\n[urchin]: http://urchin.sourceforge.net/\r\n[ufp]: http://www.feedparser.org/\r\n[roseglasses]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/03/put_on_your_rsscolored_glasses_and_forget_about_atom\r\n[blogxfer]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/17/use_atom_for_a_universal_blog_transfer_protocol\r\n[me]: http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.decafbad.com/blog/atom.xml\r\n[sam]: http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/index.atom\r\n[mark]: http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.diveintomark.org/xml/atom.xml\r\n[dbagg3xsltproc]: http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi\r\n[dbagg3xsl]: http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl\r\n[dbagg3xml]: http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/demo.xml\r\n[awsrss]: http://www.decafbad.com/2004/03/xml-rss091.xsl\r\n[dbagg3demo]: http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/demo.xml\r\n[clientserveragg]: http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/ClientServerAggregator\r\n[amazonrest]: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/08/04/tr-xml.html\r\n[wishes]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084326\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.nur-eine-i.de\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e7368d797917d0df7942c26d4ed2e580&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.nur-eine-i.de\">Benjamin</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084326\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-08-05T10:22:30\">2004-08-05T10:22:30</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">This is great.

The demo has me salivating a little.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, I like the UI. If you can slim it down, side-to-side-wise a bit, it would also be a great aggregator to rip whole chunks from and feed to a Palm Pilot or PocketPC, as well. They're not as big as they were in the past, but with decent strides every couple of weeks, they still have a lot of following.

    "html": "<p>I&#39;ve been feeling a strange tangle of writer&#39;s block and identity crisis lately, not to dramatize overmuch.  I&#39;m not really all that sure I&#39;m a blogger anymore, if I ever was.</p>\n<p>As I&#39;ve written before, I slurp down a large amount of reading from sources various and sundry, but it seems like it&#39;s been a long time since last I felt like tapping out a few paragraphs and hitting the post button.  Maybe this is <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64088,00.html\">blogger burnout</a>, but I haven&#39;t been <a href=\"http://rc3.org/cgi-bin/less.pl?arg=6366\">burning all that bright</a> here for quite some time. </p>\n<p>Pretty much all of the micro-blogging I might do--you know, your basic &quot;<em>Hey, check this out!</em>&quot;--has been channeled into del.icio.us and the link blog.  So that leaves me trying to think of <em>Grander Things</em> about which to write.  I feel like there&#39;re a lot of neat ideas floating around in my head, and I could probably be writing about them, but it often seems like someone somewhere else is writing so much more interestingly about things than I ever could.</p>\n<p>Maybe this is a paralysis brought on by just plain reading too damn many feeds.  I know the comparison is not quite apt, but I was reminded of Matt Webb&#39;s excellent <a href=\"http://upsideclown.com/2003_05_29.shtml\">&quot;Extelligence&quot;</a>:  All my thoughts can pretty much already be found out there in the ether, so it feels like I&#39;m already spread out in the web&#39;s distributed intelligence.  Who needs me to rewrite it or rethink with this particular head?</p>\n<p>And, you know, I occasionally feel the urge to toss in with some rant on politics (because you may have <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/deusx/politics\">noticed</a> my top link blog category) or the latest flamewar happening somewhere--but I&#39;ve been restraining myself because, again, someone somewhere else has mostly written up opinions extremely close to my own and &#39;nuff said.</p>\n<p>That, and I just don&#39;t get any jollies out of being a flame warrior.  In a fight, I&#39;d rather drown out the screaming with jokes and the mental equivalent of random balloon animals.  In the end, if there&#39;s nothing really at stake other than a few microns of ego and a census of pinhead-dancing angels, I&#39;d rather <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/14/info_freako_or_whos_already_past_arguing_about_syndication_formats\">move along</a>.</p>\n<p>So then, what the hell&#39;s a blog for anyway, if not for <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/07/oooadb\">ant trails</a> and flamewars?</p>\n<p>Well, I wrote about <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/25/i_was_a_preteen_transactor_author_wannabe_and_still_am\">what I really want to do here</a>.  Mostly I think I&#39;m just in a funk.  I&#39;m in a job with which I&#39;m not entirely enthused or enamored--but hey it pays the bills pretty well and sticks neither cathode nor anode into my soul to power its potato-clock science projects.  (Which <em>can</em> be fun, given the right potato clock.)  Still, though, I&#39;ve got this heavy urge to <em>do things</em> and <em>make stuff</em>, and I&#39;ve intended to make this the place to channel these urges.  Because, to the extent that I&#39;m not learning new things and tinkering and building and being productive, I start feeling useless and unworthy.</p>\n<p>Again, not trying to dramatize overmuch.  I&#39;m not quite sure why, but I&#39;ve dropped into this vicious circle wherein I don&#39;t get much done and don&#39;t start much of anything--and so feel further incapable of doing or starting much in the future.  </p>\n<p>Yeah, it&#39;s a funk, I think.  And the only reason I&#39;m writing here at length about it is because I want to write <em>something</em>, even it it&#39;s only concerning about how I&#39;ve not been writing about anything.  I do this a lot in my moleskine, when I can&#39;t really think of anything grand about which to make a journal entry, but I feel like <em>something</em> might float up if I just keep myself writing in it on a regular basis.

I haven't posted anything in almost three weeks now, for various reasons. At first I felt bad about it, then I rationalized that nobody really wants to hear my angsty whinging, and eventually I just didn't have anything to say that would improve the silence.\nI find that I can't stay away, though. I've got at least two dozen thoughts, ideas, stories and neat discoveries that have been rattling around in my head with nowhere to go. Eventually I'll have to put them up just to exorcize them from my short-term memory.\nI'm looking forward to that time (which I anticipate will be pretty soon) in both your case and mine. Between now and then, though, don't worry about it. It don't mean a thing, after all, if it ain't got that swing.

The number one rule is \"no blogging about blogging.\"  (Obviously, I don't hold myself to that rule when commenting in someone else's weblog)\nmeta-blogging, blogging about blogging, and link blogging all have one thing in common:  they are all intensely boring activities that only the obsessive-compulsive could enjoy.

A frog, who was a philosopher, saw the centipede; he looked at and watched him and became very troubled. It is so difficult to walk even with four legs, but this centipede was walking with one hundred legs - this is a miricle! How did the centipede decide which leg to move first, and then witch one next and tham which one after that? And one hundred legs! So the frog stopped the centipede and asked him a question: \" I'm a philosopher am I am puzzled by you. A problem has arisen which I cannot solve. How do you walk? How do you manage it all? It seems impossible.\"\nThe centipede said: \" I have been walking all my life, but I have not thought about it. Now that you ask, I will think about it and than I will tell you.\"\nFor the first time thought entered the centipede's consciousness. Really, the frog was right - which leg should be moved first? The centipede stood there for a few minutes, couldn't movewobbled, sand felt down. And he said to the frog: \"Please don't ask another centipede this question I have been walking my whole life and it was never a problem, and now you have killed me completely! I cannot move. A hundred legs to move!

My blogroll is one way I try to tap into the flow from that open ten inch informational water main we are supposed to take our sips from, these days.  \nThere was something different and significant in your choices of material and your presentation of technical ideas.  Actually, I put your blog on my top level and looked forward to your new material.  I admit to wondering what was up with you, because I have noticed the obvious dropoff in your posts. So, I do want to let you know that your contributions to the technical blogging aether have at least influenced one senior software architect.\nBlogging, to me, is an opportunity for which a great many people in the past would have given an arm or leg.  To be able to self-publish?  Not to have to wait in line only to be told that your thoughts are not \"commercially acceptable at this time?\"  No incompetent editors or rejection slips?  No censors?  Hmmmmmm.  What is that worth to an active, creative mind?\nAs with any art, the deepest problems come in finding something of worth to say.  Craft without content, technique without point, writing without meaning, playing sounds without feeling the music, blogging without inspiration -- these dull both the art and the creator.\nWhen you have nothing to say, don't blog.  Write or read or think in private to explore the endless well of ideas that will teach you what you, uniquely, should -- and will want to -- communicate.  If blogging is not an art that helps you achieve meaningful contact with other fellow humans, then I suggest finding another art that will.  We humans have a great many arts from which to choose!\nDefinitely, do not feel imposed upon to blog.  This is one possible method to change input into output, adding the value of your mind, heart, and soul in the process.\nMy final advice comes from Zen:\n\"When hungry, eat; when blungry, blog!\"\nPS  Now that you have inspired me to think through this, I'm going to post my answer on my own blog (http://weblogs.asp.net/jtobler/archive/2004/08/14/214728.aspx).  See?  Uour blogging does affect someone.\nThanks!</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084595\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/marnina/635.html\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a12247c13048526fcbb21a599f9ce945&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/marnina/635.html\">Marnina</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084595\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-08-28T18:52:00\">2004-08-28T18:52:00</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Thanks for the centipede story.

    "body": "I've been feeling a strange tangle of writer's block and identity crisis lately, not to dramatize overmuch.  I'm not really all that sure I'm a blogger anymore, if I ever was.\r\n\r\nAs I've written before, I slurp down a large amount of reading from sources various and sundry, but it seems like it's been a long time since last I felt like tapping out a few paragraphs and hitting the post button.  Maybe this is [blogger burnout][burnout], but I haven't been [burning all that bright][rafe] here for quite some time. \r\n\r\nPretty much all of the micro-blogging I might do--you know, your basic \"_Hey, check this out!_\"--has been channeled into del.icio.us and the link blog.  So that leaves me trying to think of _Grander Things_ about which to write.  I feel like there're a lot of neat ideas floating around in my head, and I could probably be writing about them, but it often seems like someone somewhere else is writing so much more interestingly about things than I ever could.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is a paralysis brought on by just plain reading too damn many feeds.  I know the comparison is not quite apt, but I was reminded of Matt Webb's excellent [\"Extelligence\"][extelligence]:  All my thoughts can pretty much already be found out there in the ether, so it feels like I'm already spread out in the web's distributed intelligence.  Who needs me to rewrite it or rethink with this particular head?\r\n\r\nAnd, you know, I occasionally feel the urge to toss in with some rant on politics (because you may have [noticed][politics] my top link blog category) or the latest flamewar happening somewhere--but I've been restraining myself because, again, someone somewhere else has mostly written up opinions extremely close to my own and 'nuff said.\r\n\r\nThat, and I just don't get any jollies out of being a flame warrior.  In a fight, I'd rather drown out the screaming with jokes and the mental equivalent of random balloon animals.  In the end, if there's nothing really at stake other than a few microns of ego and a census of pinhead-dancing angels, I'd rather [move along][infofreako].\r\n\r\nSo then, what the hell's a blog for anyway, if not for [ant trails][trails] and flamewars?\r\n\r\nWell, I wrote about [what I really want to do here][wanttodo].  Mostly I think I'm just in a funk.  I'm in a job with which I'm not entirely enthused or enamored--but hey it pays the bills pretty well and sticks neither cathode nor anode into my soul to power its potato-clock science projects.  (Which *can* be fun, given the right potato clock.)  Still, though, I've got this heavy urge to *do things* and *make stuff*, and I've intended to make this the place to channel these urges.  Because, to the extent that I'm not learning new things and tinkering and building and being productive, I start feeling useless and unworthy.\r\n\r\nAgain, not trying to dramatize overmuch.  I'm not quite sure why, but I've dropped into this vicious circle wherein I don't get much done and don't start much of anything--and so feel further incapable of doing or starting much in the future.  \r\n\r\nYeah, it's a funk, I think.  And the only reason I'm writing here at length about it is because I want to write *something*, even it it's only concerning about how I've not been writing about anything.  I do this a lot in my moleskine, when I can't really think of anything grand about which to make a journal entry, but I feel like *something* might float up if I just keep myself writing in it on a regular basis.  And usually, things do float up eventually.\r\n\r\nOf course, the other thing is that I don't much intend to fill this space with the sort of inane personal material I used to write on my LiveJournal--but hell, I don't even write that stuff there anymore either.  I guess what I need to do is just lay off myself: it's really not a condemnation of my worth as a dork that I don't churn out entries here and elsewhere at a high daily rate.  \r\n\r\nSo anyway, I guess that's somewhat off my chest and about to be posted.

I haven't been blogging for long, so my experience might not count for much, but what I do to keep my motivation high is write series of entries. That way, I have a main topic and I can write smaller entries more frequently.

I haven't posted anything in almost three weeks now, for various reasons. At first I felt bad about it, then I rationalized that nobody really wants to hear my angsty whinging, and eventually I just didn't have anything to say that would improve the silence.\n\nI find that I can't stay away, though. I've got at least two dozen thoughts, ideas, stories and neat discoveries that have been rattling around in my head with nowhere to go. Eventually I'll have to put them up just to exorcize them from my short-term memory.\n\nI'm looking forward to that time (which I anticipate will be pretty soon) in both your case and mine. Between now and then, though, don't worry about it. It don't mean a thing, after all, if it ain't got that swing.

I also, personally, think it's equally important to think of it as \"writing\" rather than \"blogging.\"  I have a link on my site (look for \"philosophy\" in the sidebar) that lists my rules.  The number one rule is \"no blogging about blogging.\"  (Obviously, I don't hold myself to that rule when commenting in someone else's weblog)\n\nmeta-blogging, blogging about blogging, and link blogging all have one thing in common:  they are all intensely boring activities that only the obsessive-compulsive could enjoy.  I've seen you when you're writing something real.  You're better than that.  Write about real things.  If you have nothing to say, then don't say anything for a while.

A frog, who was a philosopher, saw the centipede; he looked at and watched him and became very troubled. It is so difficult to walk even with four legs, but this centipede was walking with one hundred legs - this is a miricle! How did the centipede decide which leg to move first, and then witch one next and tham which one after that? And one hundred legs! So the frog stopped the centipede and asked him a question: \" I'm a philosopher am I am puzzled by you. A problem has arisen which I cannot solve. How do you walk? How do you manage it all? It seems impossible.\"\n\nThe centipede said: \" I have been walking all my life, but I have not thought about it. Now that you ask, I will think about it and than I will tell you.\"\n\nFor the first time thought entered the centipede's consciousness. Really, the frog was right - which leg should be moved first? The centipede stood there for a few minutes, couldn't movewobbled, sand felt down. And he said to the frog: \"Please don't ask another centipede this question I have been walking my whole life and it was never a problem, and now you have killed me completely! I cannot move.

My blogroll is one way I try to tap into the flow from that open ten inch informational water main we are supposed to take our sips from, these days.  \n\nThere was something different and significant in your choices of material and your presentation of technical ideas.  Actually, I put your blog on my top level and looked forward to your new material.  I admit to wondering what was up with you, because I have noticed the obvious dropoff in your posts. So, I do want to let you know that your contributions to the technical blogging aether have at least influenced one senior software architect.\n\nBlogging, to me, is an opportunity for which a great many people in the past would have given an arm or leg.  To be able to self-publish?  Not to have to wait in line only to be told that your thoughts are not \"commercially acceptable at this time?\"  No incompetent editors or rejection slips?  No censors?  Hmmmmmm.  What is that worth to an active, creative mind?\n\nAs with any art, the deepest problems come in finding something of worth to say.  Craft without content, technique without point, writing without meaning, playing sounds without feeling the music, blogging without inspiration -- these dull both the art and the creator.\n\nWhen you have nothing to say, don't blog.  Write or read or think in private to explore the endless well of ideas that will teach you what you, uniquely, should -- and will want to -- communicate.  If blogging is not an art that helps you achieve meaningful contact with other fellow humans, then I suggest finding another art that will.  We humans have a great many arts from which to choose!\n\nDefinitely, do not feel imposed upon to blog.  This is one possible method to change input into output, adding the value of your mind, heart, and soul in the process.\n\nMy final advice comes from Zen:\n\n\"When hungry, eat; when blungry, blog!\"\n\n\n\nPS  Now that you have inspired me to think through this, I'm going to post my answer on my own blog (http://weblogs.asp.net/jtobler/archive/2004/08/14/214728.aspx).  See?  Uour blogging does affect someone.\n\nThanks!</div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084595\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/marnina/635.html\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a12247c13048526fcbb21a599f9ce945&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/marnina/635.html\">Marnina</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084595\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-08-28T18:52:00\">2004-08-28T18:52:00</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Thanks for the centipede story.

Now we just have to present the selections and a link to check out with the shopping cart.</p>\n<p>First, locate the following line toward the end of the stylesheet as we left it in the last section:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;$shopping_cart&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Delete this, and let&#39;s replace it by building some HTML:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;shopping_cart_purchase_url&quot; \n                  select=&quot;exsl:node-set($shopping_cart)//PurchaseUrl&quot; /&gt;\n\n    &lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Wishlist Shopping Cart&lt;/title&gt;\\&lt;/head&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;p class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;\n          Here are your wishlist items\n          &lt;a href=&quot;{$shopping_cart_purchase_url}&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;img src=&quot;http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/detail/shoppingcart-header-02.gif&quot; /&gt;\n          &lt;/a&gt; \n          items:\n        &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>We&#39;re using the <code>exsl:note-set</code> function again to access the contents of <code>$shopping_cart</code> with an XPath expression.  We pluck out the value of the <code>PurchaseUrl</code> in the shopping cart and place it in the variable <code>shopping_cart_purchase_url</code>.  Then, after a bit of HTML preamble, we borrow a shopping cart icon from Amazon itself to construct a link to which we can browse later to purchase the selected items.  This HTML is very simple so far; it&#39;s likely too simple, so eventually you may like to toss some CSS in here to improve the looks of things.  But, I&#39;ll leave that as an exercise for the reader.  </p>\n<p>Next, let&#39;s build a display of the items selected by iterating first through the wishlists:</p>\n<pre><code>        &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;exsl:node-set($random_products)/wishes:wishitem&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;div class=&quot;Detail&quot;&gt;\n\n            &lt;p class=&quot;wishlistLabel&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;wishes:wishlist/@label&quot; /&gt;\n            &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>This begins a block for each wishlist, starting off with a paragraph containing the label we gave each wishlist.  Next, let&#39;s include a few details about the product chosen.  Again, all of the bits of data included for each product are described in the AWS documentation in the <em>Overview</em> under <em>Amazon Web Services Data Model</em>.  Checking that out, we can see that the data includes a URL to images of several sizes representing the product.  Let&#39;s include the medium-sized image as a link to the product&#39;s detail page:</p>\n<pre><code>            &lt;p class=&quot;Product&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;a href=&quot;{Details/@url}&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;img src=&quot;{Details/ImageUrlMedium}&quot; /&gt;\n              &lt;/a&gt;\n              &lt;br /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>We can also include the product&#39;s name as a link:</p>\n<pre><code>              &lt;span class=&quot;ProductName&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a href=&quot;{Details/@url}&quot;&gt;\n                  &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/ProductName&quot; /&gt;\n                &lt;/a&gt;\n              &lt;/span&gt;\n              &lt;br /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>And, it would be nice to provide a listing of people involved in creating the product (ie. the artists and/or authors):</p>\n<pre><code>          &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;./Details/Artists/Artist | \n                                ./Details/Authors/Author&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;span class=&quot;Author&quot;&gt;by &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n          &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Note that here, the XPath selecting the data is just a bit more involved, since this information can be found in both <code>Artist</code> and <code>Author</code> elements.  In another case, we might care to make a distinction, but it really isn&#39;t all that important for this project.  The data model also provides an indication of from which catalog this product came, as well as its date of release.  Let&#39;s include that for good measure:</p>\n<pre><code>          (\n          &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/Catalog&quot; /&gt; -\n          &lt;span class=&quot;ReleaseDate&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/ReleaseDate&quot; /&gt;\n          &lt;/span&gt;\n          )\n          &lt;br /&gt;\n        &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Another thing that would be nice to know is how much this thing costs--we&#39;ve got this information provided in the XML data as well, so let&#39;s include it:</p>\n<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;\n          &lt;span class=&quot;PriceLabel&quot;&gt;List Price:&lt;/span&gt; \n          &lt;span class=&quot;ListPrice&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/ListPrice&quot; /&gt;\n          &lt;/span&gt;\n          &lt;br /&gt;\n\n          &lt;span class=&quot;PriceLabel&quot;&gt;Our Price:&lt;/span&gt;\n          &lt;span class=&quot;OurPrice&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/OurPrice&quot; /&gt;\n          &lt;/span&gt;\n          &lt;br /&gt;\n\n          &lt;span class=&quot;PriceLabel&quot;&gt;Used Price:&lt;/span&gt; \n          &lt;span class=&quot;UsedPrice&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/UsedPrice&quot; /&gt;\n          &lt;/span&gt;\n          &lt;br /&gt;\n        &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Something to note about these prices, too, is that although the used price is listed, the shopping cart will contain new items from Amazon&#39;s shelves.  You might want to compare these prices though, and make a change to the shopping cart when you get there, if a used item is acceptable.  (Another good reason for manual intervention in our Wish-of-the-Month club.)</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and we should include one other bit of information:</p>\n<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;(&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/Availability&quot; /&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>This tells us whether or not this item can actually be bought, at present.  Although we used this data earlier to try to filter out unavailable items, we should still display this information just in case we missed something.</p>\n<p>Finally, let&#39;s clean up and finish the HTML:</p>\n<pre><code>      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Running this stylesheet (<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex5.xsl\">wishes-ex5.xsl</a>) should give you a page that looks something like this in a browser:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes.jpg\" alt=\"Wishlist HTML screenshot\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"scheduling-monthly-emails\">Scheduling Monthly Emails</h3>\n<p>Some ready-made files are available for this section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex6.xsl\"><code>wishes-ex6.xsl</code></a>: The sixth (and final) iteration of the stylesheet in development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That HTML we&#39;re producing is fine, but what we really want to do is get it delivered to us.  We could set up a scheduled run that would periodically generate a page for us to visit, but the whole point of this is laziness.  How about firing off an email with this content?  There are two things to help us with this: <a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1521.html\" title=\"RFC 1521\">RFC 1521</a> shows us how to construct email messages with a variety of content types; and <a href=\"http://www.hmug.org/man/8/sendmail.html\" title=\"man: sendmail\"><code>sendmail</code></a> will let us send these messages out.  And then, with the help of <code>cron</code>, we can fire up this process every month.</p>\n<p>Along with producing XML, XSLT can also construct plain text output--which is just what we need to create MIME email messages.  <a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1521.html\" title=\"RFC 1521\">RFC 1521</a> doesn&#39;t make for the most thrilling reading, but there are a few articles to be found that summarize things (such as <a href=\"http://www.abiglime.com/webmaster/articles/cgi/010698.htm\" title=\"How to encapsulate HTML in an email message\">this article</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wilsonweb.com/wmt5/html-email-multi.htm\" title=\"Sending HTML and Plain Text E-Mail Simultaneously\">this article</a>).   To make a long story short, a basic shell for an email message using MIME to include an HTML part and a plain text part looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>To: someone@example.org\nSubject: Some useful email subject\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=&quot;theBoundaryString&quot;\n\n--theBoundaryString\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nSome plain text representation goes here...\n\n--theBoundaryString\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-Disposition: inline\nContent-Base: &quot;http://www.decafbad.com/&quot;\n\n&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Some HTML representation goes here...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n--theBoundaryString--</code></pre>\n<p>I&#39;ve snuck in the idea of providing both an HTML version (which we&#39;ve already done) and a new plain text version.  Depending on your email program and your preferences, one type might be more useful than the other.  In any case, it&#39;s not all that hard to offer both here.  To start sending these email messages, though, we&#39;ll need an email address.  So, add that as an element in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes.xml\">wishes.xml</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;wishes xmlns=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;email&gt;deus_x@pobox.com&lt;/email&gt;\n  &lt;maxprice&gt;15.00&lt;/maxprice&gt;\n  &lt;associate&gt;0xdecafbad-20&lt;/associate&gt;\n  &lt;devtoken&gt;D8HVH869XA0NP&lt;/devtoken&gt;\n  &lt;wishlists&gt;\n    &lt;wishlist label=&quot;Me&quot;&gt;1QWYI6P2JF3Q5&lt;/wishlist&gt;\n    &lt;wishlist label=&quot;The Girl&quot;&gt;35OIOYWQ9XQAE&lt;/wishlist&gt;\n  &lt;/wishlists&gt;\n&lt;/wishes&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Let&#39;s extract this data into a global variable near the start of the stylesheet:</p>\n<pre><code>  &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;email_to&quot;  select=&quot;/wishes:wishes/wishes:email&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Start editing the final template of the stylesheet, inserting before the start of HTML content:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;!-- Eat all the line breaks generated so far --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:text&gt;To: &lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$email_to&quot; /&gt;   \nSubject: 0xDECAFBAD&#39;s Amazon Wish-of-the-Month Club\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=&quot;theBoundaryString&quot;</code></pre>\n<p>This is the header for the email.  Up until now, we&#39;ve been generating XML with the stylesheet and haven&#39;t cared very much about any extra whitespace or line breaks which might sneak into the output.  However, in an email header, whitespace is important since a blank line is what&#39;s used to separate the headers from the body of the email message.  So, any stray blank lines will cause what we might have meant to be headers to be interpreted as part of the message instead.  Producing the first header in the email with <code>xsl:text</code> tags causes the XSL processor to throw away any leading whitespace which would have appeared before the first header.</p>\n<p>Other than this little twist, the email header looks pretty much like the shell.  We fill in the <code>To</code> address from the global variable <code>$email_to</code> and define a <code>Subject</code> line.  The <code>MIME-Version</code> and <code>Content-Type</code> headers are what enable us to include both text and HTML versions in one email.</p>\n<p>Now we can start into one of the parts:</p>\n<pre><code>--theBoundaryString\nContent-Type: text/plain</code></pre>\n<p>This begins the plain text section of the email, using the <em>boundary string</em> as defined in the headers to delinieate the section&#39;s beginning.  The section can also have its own set of headers, of which we use only one: <code>Content-Type</code>.  Moving along, let&#39;s work on the text content itself.</p>\n<pre><code>Here are your wishlist items:\n\n&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$shopping_cart_purchase_url&quot; /&gt;&lt;xsl:text&gt;\n&lt;/xsl:text&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>No shopping cart image here, but this includes the human-viewable URL which leads to a shopping cart on Amazon.com.  The usage of <code>xsl:text</code> here forces a line break where there otherwise wouldn&#39;t have been one with the usage of <code>xsl:value-of</code>.  Now, let&#39;s iterate through each of the wishlists and list out the product details:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;exsl:node-set($random_products)/wishes:wishitem&quot;&gt;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;wishes:wishlist/@label&quot; \n       disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot; /&gt;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/ProductName&quot; \n       disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot; /&gt;\n\n&lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;./Details/Artists/Artist | \n                      ./Details/Authors/Author&quot;&gt;\nby &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;.&quot;  \n   disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n\nCatalog:      &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/Catalog&quot; \n   disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot; /&gt;\nReleased:     &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/ReleaseDate&quot; \n   disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot; /&gt;\n\nList Price:   &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/ListPrice&quot;  \n     disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt; \nOur  Price:   &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/UsedPrice&quot;  \n     disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt; \nUsed Price:   &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/OurPrice&quot;  \n     disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt; \n\nAvailability: &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/Availability&quot;  \n       disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\n\n&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/@url&quot;  \n       disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\n&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n\n&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Most everything in this stretch should look very similar to the HTML version we just finished.  The biggest difference is that every bit of information pulled in using <code>xsl:value-of</code> is done using the <code>disable-output-escaping</code> option.  When this is <code>yes</code>, things like ampersands are no longer escaped for valid XML output.  Since this bit of the email is plain text, we don&#39;t want to see <code>&amp;amp;</code> in album titles, so this will cause ampersands to appear unmolested.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s the plain text version finished.  Now let&#39;s create the HTML version:</p>\n<pre><code>--theBoundaryString\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-Disposition: inline\nContent-Base: &quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;</code></pre>\n<p>The boundary string appears again, signifying the end of the plain text section and the start of the HTML section.  Headers appear here which specify that what follows is HTML; that it&#39;s encoded in 7-bit characters; that it should be included in the message display itself (rather than presented as an attachment to be saved); and that all relative URLs which might appear in the HTML should be treated as having a base URL as specified.  This last part allows HTML in email to refer to images and other pages on another site without making all the URLs absolute.</p>\n<p>We don&#39;t need to make any modifications to the HTML as we built it in the last iteration of the stylesheet, so we can just include it unchanged:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;\n...\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n--theBoundaryString--</code></pre>\n<p>This final appearance of the boundary string is bracketed on both sides by dashes, which indicates the end of the final section of the document.  We should be ready to try this in combination with <code>sendmail</code> in a shell:</p>\n<pre><code>$ xsltproc wishes-ex6.xsl wishes.xml | sendmail -it</code></pre>\n<p>If everything has worked correctly, there should be an email arriving in your mailbox sometime soon.  (Or in my inbox, if you followed the directions literally and didn&#39;t supply your own email address.)  The options supplied to <code>sendmail</code> are fairly basic: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>-i</code> causes lines consisting solely of <code>.</code> <em>not</em> to be treated as an end-of-input signal.</li>\n<li><code>-t</code> causes <code>sendmail</code> to look in the message headers (ie. <code>To:</code>) for a list of recipients.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you don&#39;t happen to have have <code>sendmail</code> available, you might want to look into what local mail programs you have available which can accept the output from the stylesheet.</p>\n<p>Once you have this working, the final task is to schedule its monthly execution with your local <code>cron</code> installation.  If you haven&#39;t played with <code>cron</code> before, there are many resources and tutorials available (<a href=\"http://www.lysator.liu.se/~forsberg/linux/cron.html\" title=\"Doing things periodically - Using CRON\">here&#39;s one</a> and <a href=\"http://www.itworld.com/Comp/2378/swol-0825-unix101/\" title=\"Using cron basics\">here&#39;s another</a>).  You should add something like the following to your user account&#39;s <code>crontab</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>0 0 * 1 *  (cd /your/working/path; xsltproc wishes.xsl wishes.xml | sendmail -it)</code></pre>\n<p>The &quot;<code>0 0 * 1 *</code>&quot; indicates to <code>cron</code> that this set of commands should be run at midnight on the first of every months.  Note also that <code>/your/working/path</code> should be replaced by the path to where you&#39;ve been working during this project.  And finally, I&#39;ve renamed the final iteration of the stylesheet file to simply <code>wishes.xsl</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>So that&#39;s it--we have an XSL stylesheet which queries Amazon Web Services for products contained in multiple wishlists; selects a random item from each; prepares a shopping cart containing those items; and finally generates an email message containing both plain text and HTML presentations of the shopping cart and selected items.</p>\n<p>Though this implementation serves the purpose I wrote about at the start of this article, there are definitely many areas where this can be improved upon or expanded:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Many people think Amazon is an evil company for their use of patents.  I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m entirely happy with them for this myself, but their AWS offering is just too nice to resist tinkering with.  It might be interesting to investigate other retailers&#39; wishlist offerings, where they exist, and to see how this idea might be made to work with other (or even multiple) retailers.  Even better, come up with your own wishlist system, and a cross-retailer shopping cart.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I chose XSLT as the implementation technology because I thought it would be more natural to deal with Amazon&#39;s XML this way.  There are, admittedly, a few awkward parts in the resulting stylesheet however.  Sometimes it&#39;s good to see a project like this through, just to get a sense for where things do go awkward with a technology or my understanding of it.  It could be interesting to transliterate this into a scripting language like Python or Perl, perhaps using the <a href=\"http://xmlsoft.org/python.html\">libxml bindings</a> to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The error and failure handling in this implementation are all but non-existent.  Should anything unexpected happen while dealing with Amazon Web Services, the results aren&#39;t likely to be very pretty.  You may want to consider improving in this area.  One instance I identified was to report when the sanity limit was hit in looping through wishlist pages, versus an actual end of pages.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you play around with making more wishlist queries using the techniques here, you might want to consider caching the full set of data pulled in by the multiple-page calls to AWS, in order to prevent hammering Amazon&#39;s servers with repeated requests for the same data, likely unchanged.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I still don&#39;t know why <code>exsl:random</code> doesn&#39;t work for me.  Although I thought using a web service for random numbers was intereting, it would be very nice if I didn&#39;t have to use it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The HTML presentation could certainly use some good CSS to make it more attractive.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feel free to send me any suggestions, criticisms, or complaints related to this article!</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=wishofthemonthclub3</p>\n",
    "body": "<i>This is the exciting conclusion of the Wish-of-the-Month Club.  Before continuing on, you may want to catch up with parts [one][part1] and [two][part2].</i>\r\n\r\n### Presenting the Results\r\n\r\nSome ready-made files are available for this section:\r\n* [`wishes-ex5.xsl`][wishes-ex5.xsl]: The fifth iteration of the stylesheet in development.\r\n* [`wishes.html`][wishes.html]: Sample output in HTML\r\n\r\nWe've finally gotten together all the bits of information we need--wishlists have been queried; random items have been selected; and a shopping cart has been prepared.  Now we just have to present the selections and a link to check out with the shopping cart.\r\n\r\nFirst, locate the following line toward the end of the stylesheet as we left it in the last section:\r\n\r\n        <xsl:copy-of select=\"$shopping_cart\" />\r\n\r\nDelete this, and let's replace it by building some HTML:\r\n\r\n        <xsl:variable name=\"shopping_cart_purchase_url\" \r\n                      select=\"exsl:node-set($shopping_cart)//PurchaseUrl\" />\r\n        \r\n        <html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n          <head><title>Wishlist Shopping Cart</title>\\</head>\r\n          <body>\r\n            <p class=\"title\">\r\n              Here are your wishlist items\r\n              <a href=\"{$shopping_cart_purchase_url}\">\r\n                <img src=\"http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/detail/shoppingcart-header-02.gif\" />\r\n              </a> \r\n              items:\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\nWe're using the `exsl:note-set` function again to access the contents of `$shopping_cart` with an XPath expression.  We pluck out the value of the `PurchaseUrl` in the shopping cart and place it in the variable `shopping_cart_purchase_url`.  Then, after a bit of HTML preamble, we borrow a shopping cart icon from Amazon itself to construct a link to which we can browse later to purchase the selected items.  This HTML is very simple so far; it's likely too simple, so eventually you may like to toss some CSS in here to improve the looks of things.  But, I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.  \r\n\r\nNext, let's build a display of the items selected by iterating first through the wishlists:\r\n        \r\n            <xsl:for-each select=\"exsl:node-set($random_products)/wishes:wishitem\">\r\n              <div class=\"Detail\">\r\n\r\n                <p class=\"wishlistLabel\">\r\n                  <xsl:value-of select=\"wishes:wishlist/@label\" />\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\nThis begins a block for each wishlist, starting off with a paragraph containing the label we gave each wishlist.  Next, let's include a few details about the product chosen.  Again, all of the bits of data included for each product are described in the AWS documentation in the *Overview* under *Amazon Web Services Data Model*.  Checking that out, we can see that the data includes a URL to images of several sizes representing the product.  Let's include the medium-sized image as a link to the product's detail page:\r\n\r\n                <p class=\"Product\">\r\n                  <a href=\"{Details/@url}\">\r\n                    <img src=\"{Details/ImageUrlMedium}\" />\r\n                  </a>\r\n                  <br />\r\n\r\nWe can also include the product's name as a link:\r\n\r\n                  <span class=\"ProductName\">\r\n                    <a href=\"{Details/@url}\">\r\n                      <xsl:value-of select=\"Details/ProductName\" />\r\n                    </a>\r\n                  </span>\r\n                  <br />\r\n\r\nAnd, it would be nice to provide a listing of people involved in creating the product (ie. the artists and/or authors):\r\n\r\n              <xsl:for-each select=\"./Details/Artists/Artist | \r\n                                    ./Details/Authors/Author\">\r\n                <span class=\"Author\">by <xsl:value-of select=\".\" /></span><br />\r\n              </xsl:for-each>\r\n\r\nNote that here, the XPath selecting the data is just a bit more involved, since this information can be found in both `Artist` and `Author` elements.  In another case, we might care to make a distinction, but it really isn't all that important for this project.  The data model also provides an indication of from which catalog this product came, as well as its date of release.  Let's include that for good measure:\r\n              \r\n              (\r\n              <xsl:value-of select=\"Details/Catalog\" /> -\r\n              <span class=\"ReleaseDate\">\r\n                <xsl:value-of select=\"Details/ReleaseDate\" />\r\n              </span>\r\n              )\r\n              <br />\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\nAnother thing that would be nice to know is how much this thing costs--we've got this information provided in the XML data as well, so let's include it:\r\n            \r\n            <p>\r\n              <span class=\"PriceLabel\">List Price:</span> \r\n              <span class=\"ListPrice\">\r\n                <xsl:value-of select=\"Details/ListPrice\" />\r\n              </span>\r\n              <br />\r\n              \r\n              <span class=\"PriceLabel\">Our Price:</span>\r\n              <span class=\"OurPrice\">\r\n                <xsl:value-of select=\"Details/OurPrice\" />\r\n              </span>\r\n              <br />\r\n\r\n              <span class=\"PriceLabel\">Used Price:</span> \r\n              <span class=\"UsedPrice\">\r\n                <xsl:value-of select=\"Details/UsedPrice\" />\r\n              </span>\r\n              <br />\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\nSomething to note about these prices, too, is that although the used price is listed, the shopping cart will contain new items from Amazon's shelves.  You might want to compare these prices though, and make a change to the shopping cart when you get there, if a used item is acceptable.  (Another good reason for manual intervention in our Wish-of-the-Month club.)\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and we should include one other bit of information:\r\n            \r\n            <p>(<xsl:value-of select=\"Details/Availability\" />)</p>\r\n\r\nThis tells us whether or not this item can actually be bought, at present.  Although we used this data earlier to try to filter out unavailable items, we should still display this information just in case we missed something.\r\n\r\nFinally, let's clean up and finish the HTML:\r\n            \r\n          </div>\r\n        </xsl:for-each>\r\n        \r\n      </body>\r\n    </html>\r\n\r\nRunning this stylesheet ([wishes-ex5.xsl][wishes-ex5.xsl]) should give you a page that looks something like this in a browser:\r\n\r\n![Wishlist HTML screenshot][wishes_html_screenshot]\r\n\r\n### Scheduling Monthly Emails\r\n\r\nSome ready-made files are available for this section:\r\n* [`wishes-ex6.xsl`][wishes-ex6.xsl]: The sixth (and final) iteration of the stylesheet in development.\r\n\r\nThat HTML we're producing is fine, but what we really want to do is get it delivered to us.  We could set up a scheduled run that would periodically generate a page for us to visit, but the whole point of this is laziness.  How about firing off an email with this content?  There are two things to help us with this: [RFC 1521][rfc1521] shows us how to construct email messages with a variety of content types; and [`sendmail`][man_sendmail] will let us send these messages out.  And then, with the help of `cron`, we can fire up this process every month.\r\n\r\nAlong with producing XML, XSLT can also construct plain text output--which is just what we need to create MIME email messages.  [RFC 1521][rfc1521] doesn't make for the most thrilling reading, but there are a few articles to be found that summarize things (such as [this article][email_mime_and_html] and [this article][email_html_and_text]).   To make a long story short, a basic shell for an email message using MIME to include an HTML part and a plain text part looks something like this:\r\n\r\n    To: someone@example.org\r\n    Subject: Some useful email subject\r\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\r\n    Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=\"theBoundaryString\"\r\n\r\n    --theBoundaryString\r\n    Content-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\n    Some plain text representation goes here...\r\n\r\n    --theBoundaryString\r\n    Content-Type: text/html\r\n    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n    Content-Disposition: inline\r\n    Content-Base: \"http://www.decafbad.com/\"\r\n\r\n    <html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n        <p>Some HTML representation goes here...</p>\r\n    </html>\r\n\r\n    --theBoundaryString--\r\n\r\nI've snuck in the idea of providing both an HTML version (which we've already done) and a new plain text version.  Depending on your email program and your preferences, one type might be more useful than the other.  In any case, it's not all that hard to offer both here.  To start sending these email messages, though, we'll need an email address.  So, add that as an element in [wishes.xml][wishes.xml]:\r\n\r\n    <wishes xmlns=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes\">\r\n      <email>deus_x@pobox.com</email>\r\n      <maxprice>15.00</maxprice>\r\n      <associate>0xdecafbad-20</associate>\r\n      <devtoken>D8HVH869XA0NP</devtoken>\r\n      <wishlists>\r\n        <wishlist label=\"Me\">1QWYI6P2JF3Q5</wishlist>\r\n        <wishlist label=\"The Girl\">35OIOYWQ9XQAE</wishlist>\r\n      </wishlists>\r\n    </wishes>\r\n\r\nLet's extract this data into a global variable near the start of the stylesheet:\r\n\r\n      <xsl:variable name=\"email_to\"  select=\"/wishes:wishes/wishes:email\" />\r\n\r\nStart editing the final template of the stylesheet, inserting before the start of HTML content:\r\n\r\n        <!-- Eat all the line breaks generated so far -->\r\n        <xsl:text>To: </xsl:text><xsl:value-of select=\"$email_to\" />   \r\n    Subject: 0xDECAFBAD's Amazon Wish-of-the-Month Club\r\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\r\n    Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=\"theBoundaryString\"\r\n\r\nThis is the header for the email.  Up until now, we've been generating XML with the stylesheet and haven't cared very much about any extra whitespace or line breaks which might sneak into the output.  However, in an email header, whitespace is important since a blank line is what's used to separate the headers from the body of the email message.  So, any stray blank lines will cause what we might have meant to be headers to be interpreted as part of the message instead.  Producing the first header in the email with `xsl:text` tags causes the XSL processor to throw away any leading whitespace which would have appeared before the first header.\r\n\r\nOther than this little twist, the email header looks pretty much like the shell.  We fill in the `To` address from the global variable `$email_to` and define a `Subject` line.  The `MIME-Version` and `Content-Type` headers are what enable us to include both text and HTML versions in one email.\r\n\r\nNow we can start into one of the parts:\r\n\r\n    --theBoundaryString\r\n    Content-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\nThis begins the plain text section of the email, using the *boundary string* as defined in the headers to delinieate the section's beginning.  The section can also have its own set of headers, of which we use only one: `Content-Type`.  Moving along, let's work on the text content itself.\r\n\r\n    Here are your wishlist items:\r\n\r\n    <xsl:value-of select=\"$shopping_cart_purchase_url\" /><xsl:text>\r\n    </xsl:text>\r\n\r\nNo shopping cart image here, but this includes the human-viewable URL which leads to a shopping cart on Amazon.com.  The usage of `xsl:text` here forces a line break where there otherwise wouldn't have been one with the usage of `xsl:value-of`.  Now, let's iterate through each of the wishlists and list out the product details:\r\n\r\n    <xsl:for-each select=\"exsl:node-set($random_products)/wishes:wishitem\">\r\n    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    <xsl:value-of select=\"wishes:wishlist/@label\" \r\n           disable-output-escaping=\"yes\" />\r\n    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n    <xsl:value-of select=\"Details/ProductName\" \r\n           disable-output-escaping=\"yes\" />\r\n\r\n    <xsl:for-each select=\"./Details/Artists/Artist | \r\n                          ./Details/Authors/Author\">\r\n    by <xsl:value-of select=\".\"  \r\n       disable-output-escaping=\"yes\"/>\r\n    </xsl:for-each>\r\n\r\n    Catalog:      <xsl:value-of select=\"Details/Catalog\" \r\n       disable-output-escaping=\"yes\" />\r\n    Released:     <xsl:value-of select=\"Details/ReleaseDate\" \r\n       disable-output-escaping=\"yes\" />\r\n\r\n    List Price:   <xsl:value-of select=\"Details/ListPrice\"  \r\n         disable-output-escaping=\"yes\"/> \r\n    Our  Price:   <xsl:value-of select=\"Details/UsedPrice\"  \r\n         disable-output-escaping=\"yes\"/> \r\n    Used Price:   <xsl:value-of select=\"Details/OurPrice\"  \r\n         disable-output-escaping=\"yes\"/> \r\n            \r\n    Availability: <xsl:value-of select=\"Details/Availability\"  \r\n           disable-output-escaping=\"yes\"/>\r\n    <xsl:text>\r\n\r\n    </xsl:text>\r\n    <xsl:value-of select=\"Details/@url\"  \r\n           disable-output-escaping=\"yes\"/>\r\n    <xsl:text>\r\n    </xsl:text>\r\n\r\n    </xsl:for-each>\r\n\r\nMost everything in this stretch should look very similar to the HTML version we just finished.  The biggest difference is that every bit of information pulled in using `xsl:value-of` is done using the `disable-output-escaping` option.  When this is `yes`, things like ampersands are no longer escaped for valid XML output.  Since this bit of the email is plain text, we don't want to see `&amp;` in album titles, so this will cause ampersands to appear unmolested.\r\n\r\nThat's the plain text version finished.  Now let's create the HTML version:\r\n\r\n    --theBoundaryString\r\n    Content-Type: text/html\r\n    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n    Content-Disposition: inline\r\n    Content-Base: \"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes\"\r\n\r\nThe boundary string appears again, signifying the end of the plain text section and the start of the HTML section.  Headers appear here which specify that what follows is HTML; that it's encoded in 7-bit characters; that it should be included in the message display itself (rather than presented as an attachment to be saved); and that all relative URLs which might appear in the HTML should be treated as having a base URL as specified.  This last part allows HTML in email to refer to images and other pages on another site without making all the URLs absolute.\r\n\r\nWe don't need to make any modifications to the HTML as we built it in the last iteration of the stylesheet, so we can just include it unchanged:\r\n\r\n    <html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n    ...\r\n    </html>\r\n\r\n    --theBoundaryString--\r\n    \r\nThis final appearance of the boundary string is bracketed on both sides by dashes, which indicates the end of the final section of the document.  We should be ready to try this in combination with `sendmail` in a shell:\r\n\r\n    $ xsltproc wishes-ex6.xsl wishes.xml | sendmail -it\r\n\r\nIf everything has worked correctly, there should be an email arriving in your mailbox sometime soon.  (Or in my inbox, if you followed the directions literally and didn't supply your own email address.)  The options supplied to `sendmail` are fairly basic: \r\n\r\n* `-i` causes lines consisting solely of `.` *not* to be treated as an end-of-input signal.\r\n* `-t` causes `sendmail` to look in the message headers (ie. `To:`) for a list of recipients.\r\n\r\nIf you don't happen to have have `sendmail` available, you might want to look into what local mail programs you have available which can accept the output from the stylesheet.\r\n\r\nOnce you have this working, the final task is to schedule its monthly execution with your local `cron` installation.  If you haven't played with `cron` before, there are many resources and tutorials available ([here's one][cron1] and [here's another][cron2]).  You should add something like the following to your user account's `crontab`:\r\n\r\n    0 0 * 1 *  (cd /your/working/path; xsltproc wishes.xsl wishes.xml | sendmail -it)\r\n\r\nThe \"`0 0 * 1 *`\" indicates to `cron` that this set of commands should be run at midnight on the first of every months.  Note also that `/your/working/path` should be replaced by the path to where you've been working during this project.  And finally, I've renamed the final iteration of the stylesheet file to simply `wishes.xsl`.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nSo that's it--we have an XSL stylesheet which queries Amazon Web Services for products contained in multiple wishlists; selects a random item from each; prepares a shopping cart containing those items; and finally generates an email message containing both plain text and HTML presentations of the shopping cart and selected items.\r\n\r\nThough this implementation serves the purpose I wrote about at the start of this article, there are definitely many areas where this can be improved upon or expanded:\r\n\r\n* Many people think Amazon is an evil company for their use of patents.  I can't say that I'm entirely happy with them for this myself, but their AWS offering is just too nice to resist tinkering with.  It might be interesting to investigate other retailers' wishlist offerings, where they exist, and to see how this idea might be made to work with other (or even multiple) retailers.  Even better, come up with your own wishlist system, and a cross-retailer shopping cart.\r\n\r\n* I chose XSLT as the implementation technology because I thought it would be more natural to deal with Amazon's XML this way.  There are, admittedly, a few awkward parts in the resulting stylesheet however.  Sometimes it's good to see a project like this through, just to get a sense for where things do go awkward with a technology or my understanding of it.  It could be interesting to transliterate this into a scripting language like Python or Perl, perhaps using the [libxml bindings][python_libxml] to do so.\r\n\r\n* The error and failure handling in this implementation are all but non-existent.  Should anything unexpected happen while dealing with Amazon Web Services, the results aren't likely to be very pretty.  You may want to consider improving in this area.  One instance I identified was to report when the sanity limit was hit in looping through wishlist pages, versus an actual end of pages.\r\n\r\n* If you play around with making more wishlist queries using the techniques here, you might want to consider caching the full set of data pulled in by the multiple-page calls to AWS, in order to prevent hammering Amazon's servers with repeated requests for the same data, likely unchanged.\r\n\r\n* I still don't know why `exsl:random` doesn't work for me.  Although I thought using a web service for random numbers was intereting, it would be very nice if I didn't have to use it.\r\n\r\n* The HTML presentation could certainly use some good CSS to make it more attractive.\r\n\r\nFeel free to send me any suggestions, criticisms, or complaints related to this article!\r\n\r\n[missadroit]: http://missadroit.livejournal.com \"Miss Adroit, my favorite girl in the world\"\r\n[mywishlist]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/1QWYI6P2JF3Q5 \"Buy me something, will ya?\"\r\n[herwishlist]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/35OIOYWQ9XQAE \"Buy her something, will ya?\"\r\n[amazonapi]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/landing.html \"Amazon Web Services\"\r\n[libxml]: http://www.xmlsoft.org/\r\n[xalan]: http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/\r\n[sablotron]: http://www.gingerall.com/charlie/ga/xml/p_sab.xml\r\n[saxon]: http://saxon.sourceforge.net/\r\n[exslt]: http://www.exslt.org/\r\n[libxslt]: http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT.html\r\n[spideringhacks]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596005776/0xdecafbad-20 \"O'Reilly's Spidering Hacks\"\r\n[xslscraper]: http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XslScraper \"Scrape RSS and Atom from HTML using Tidy and XSLT\"\r\n[awsdownload]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_2/002-7899886-3676027?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#38;node=3434641&#38;no=3435361&#38;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA\r\n[awstoken]: https://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/join/developer/application.html\r\n[amazonassociate]: http://associates.amazon.com\r\n[wlsearch]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/search.html/002-7899886-3676027?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#38;type=wishlist\r\n[wlurl]: http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?t=0xdecafbad-20&#38;dev-t=D8HVH869XA0NP&#38;type=lite&#38;WishlistSearch=35OIOYWQ9XQAE&#38;f=xml\r\n[detailsurl]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262133601/0xdecafbad-20?dev-t=D8HVH869XA0NP%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2\r\n[awslite]: http://xml.amazon.com/schemas3/dev-lite.xsd\r\n[fink]: http://fink.sourceforge.net\r\n[testxslt]: http://www.entropy.ch:16080/software/macosx/#testxslt\r\n[darwinports]: http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/\r\n[curl]: http://www.decafbad.com/#TODO\r\n[wget]: http://www.decafbad.com/#TODO\r\n[xpconcat]: http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xquery-operators-20020816/#func-concat\r\n[xpdocument]: http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xquery-operators-20020816/#func-document\r\n[wishescvs]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/hacks/wishes/\r\n[wishes.tar.gz]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/hacks/wishes/wishes.tar.gz?tarball=1 \"All Wish-of-the-Month Club files wrapped up in a tarball\"\r\n[wishes.xml]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes.xml\r\n[wishes.html]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes.html\r\n[wishes-ex1.xsl]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex1.xsl\r\n[wishes-ex2.xsl]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex2.xsl\r\n[wishes-ex3.xsl]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex3.xsl\r\n[wishes-ex4.xsl]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex4.xsl\r\n[wishes-ex5.xsl]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex5.xsl\r\n[wishes-ex6.xsl]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex6.xsl\r\n[random-xml]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/random-xml\r\n[wishes_html_screenshot]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes.jpg\r\n[xslt_iteration]: http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/N4806.html \"Iteration in XSLT\"\r\n[xslt_recursion]: http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-xslrecur/ \"Use recursion effectively in XSL\"\r\n[exsl_random]: http://www.exslt.org/math/functions/random/index.html\r\n[exsl_node_set]: http://www.exslt.org/exsl/functions/node-set/index.html\r\n[rand_url]: http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/random-xml?int=1&#38;min=10&#38;max=20 \"A random integer between 10 and 20, in XML\"\r\n[xslt_result_tree_fragment]: http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#section-Result-Tree-Fragments\r\n\r\n[email_attach_anatomy]: http://www.dpo.uab.edu/Email/attach.html \"Anatomy of an Email Attachment\"\r\n[email_mime_and_html]: http://www.abiglime.com/webmaster/articles/cgi/010698.htm \"How to encapsulate HTML in an email message\"\r\n\r\n[email_html_and_text]: http://www.wilsonweb.com/wmt5/html-email-multi.htm \"Sending HTML and Plain Text E-Mail Simultaneously\"\r\n[man_sendmail]: http://www.hmug.org/man/8/sendmail.html \"man: sendmail\"\r\n[rfc1521]: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1521.html \"RFC 1521\"\r\n[cron1]: http://www.lysator.liu.se/~forsberg/linux/cron.html \"Doing things periodically - Using CRON\"\r\n[cron2]: http://www.itworld.com/Comp/2378/swol-0825-unix101/ \"Using cron basics\"\r\n[python_libxml]: http://xmlsoft.org/python.html \r\n[part2]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/27/wishofthemonthclub2\r\n[part1]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=wishofthemonthclub3\r\n",

Now we just have to present the selections and a link to check out with the shopping cart.</p>\n<p>First, locate the following line toward the end of the stylesheet as we left it in the last section:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;$shopping_cart&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Delete this, and let&apos;s replace it by building some HTML:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;shopping_cart_purchase_url&quot; \n                  select=&quot;exsl:node-set($shopping_cart)//PurchaseUrl&quot; /&gt;\n\n    &lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Wishlist Shopping Cart&lt;/title&gt;\\&lt;/head&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;p class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;\n          Here are your wishlist items\n          &lt;a href=&quot;{$shopping_cart_purchase_url}&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;img src=&quot;http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/detail/shoppingcart-header-02.gif&quot; /&gt;\n          &lt;/a&gt; \n          items:\n        &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>We&apos;re using the <code>exsl:note-set</code> function again to access the contents of <code>$shopping_cart</code> with an XPath expression.  We pluck out the value of the <code>PurchaseUrl</code> in the shopping cart and place it in the variable <code>shopping_cart_purchase_url</code>.  Then, after a bit of HTML preamble, we borrow a shopping cart icon from Amazon itself to construct a link to which we can browse later to purchase the selected items.  This HTML is very simple so far; it&apos;s likely too simple, so eventually you may like to toss some CSS in here to improve the looks of things.  But, I&apos;ll leave that as an exercise for the reader.  </p>\n<p>Next, let&apos;s build a display of the items selected by iterating first through the wishlists:</p>\n<pre><code>        &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;exsl:node-set($random_products)/wishes:wishitem&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;div class=&quot;Detail&quot;&gt;\n\n            &lt;p class=&quot;wishlistLabel&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;wishes:wishlist/@label&quot; /&gt;\n            &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>This begins a block for each wishlist, starting off with a paragraph containing the label we gave each wishlist.  Next, let&apos;s include a few details about the product chosen.  Again, all of the bits of data included for each product are described in the AWS documentation in the <em>Overview</em> under <em>Amazon Web Services Data Model</em>.  Checking that out, we can see that the data includes a URL to images of several sizes representing the product.  Let&apos;s include the medium-sized image as a link to the product&apos;s detail page:</p>\n<pre><code>            &lt;p class=&quot;Product&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;a href=&quot;{Details/@url}&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;img src=&quot;{Details/ImageUrlMedium}&quot; /&gt;\n              &lt;/a&gt;\n              &lt;br /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>We can also include the product&apos;s name as a link:</p>\n<pre><code>              &lt;span class=&quot;ProductName&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a href=&quot;{Details/@url}&quot;&gt;\n                  &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/ProductName&quot; /&gt;\n                &lt;/a&gt;\n              &lt;/span&gt;\n              &lt;br /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>And, it would be nice to provide a listing of people involved in creating the product (ie. the artists and/or authors):</p>\n<pre><code>          &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;./Details/Artists/Artist | \n                                ./Details/Authors/Author&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;span class=&quot;Author&quot;&gt;by &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n          &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Note that here, the XPath selecting the data is just a bit more involved, since this information can be found in both <code>Artist</code> and <code>Author</code> elements.  In another case, we might care to make a distinction, but it really isn&apos;t all that important for this project.  The data model also provides an indication of from which catalog this product came, as well as its date of release.  Let&apos;s include that for good measure:</p>\n<pre><code>          (\n          &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/Catalog&quot; /&gt; -\n          &lt;span class=&quot;ReleaseDate&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/ReleaseDate&quot; /&gt;\n          &lt;/span&gt;\n          )\n          &lt;br /&gt;\n        &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Another thing that would be nice to know is how much this thing costs--we&apos;ve got this information provided in the XML data as well, so let&apos;s include it:</p>\n<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;\n          &lt;span class=&quot;PriceLabel&quot;&gt;List Price:&lt;/span&gt; \n          &lt;span class=&quot;ListPrice&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/ListPrice&quot; /&gt;\n          &lt;/span&gt;\n          &lt;br /&gt;\n\n          &lt;span class=&quot;PriceLabel&quot;&gt;Our Price:&lt;/span&gt;\n          &lt;span class=&quot;OurPrice&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/OurPrice&quot; /&gt;\n          &lt;/span&gt;\n          &lt;br /&gt;\n\n          &lt;span class=&quot;PriceLabel&quot;&gt;Used Price:&lt;/span&gt; \n          &lt;span class=&quot;UsedPrice&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/UsedPrice&quot; /&gt;\n          &lt;/span&gt;\n          &lt;br /&gt;\n        &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Something to note about these prices, too, is that although the used price is listed, the shopping cart will contain new items from Amazon&apos;s shelves.  You might want to compare these prices though, and make a change to the shopping cart when you get there, if a used item is acceptable.  (Another good reason for manual intervention in our Wish-of-the-Month club.)</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and we should include one other bit of information:</p>\n<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;(&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/Availability&quot; /&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>This tells us whether or not this item can actually be bought, at present.  Although we used this data earlier to try to filter out unavailable items, we should still display this information just in case we missed something.</p>\n<p>Finally, let&apos;s clean up and finish the HTML:</p>\n<pre><code>      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Running this stylesheet (<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex5.xsl\">wishes-ex5.xsl</a>) should give you a page that looks something like this in a browser:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes.jpg\" alt=\"Wishlist HTML screenshot\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"scheduling-monthly-emails\">Scheduling Monthly Emails</h3>\n<p>Some ready-made files are available for this section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex6.xsl\"><code>wishes-ex6.xsl</code></a>: The sixth (and final) iteration of the stylesheet in development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That HTML we&apos;re producing is fine, but what we really want to do is get it delivered to us.  We could set up a scheduled run that would periodically generate a page for us to visit, but the whole point of this is laziness.  How about firing off an email with this content?  There are two things to help us with this: <a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1521.html\" title=\"RFC 1521\">RFC 1521</a> shows us how to construct email messages with a variety of content types; and <a href=\"http://www.hmug.org/man/8/sendmail.html\" title=\"man: sendmail\"><code>sendmail</code></a> will let us send these messages out.  And then, with the help of <code>cron</code>, we can fire up this process every month.</p>\n<p>Along with producing XML, XSLT can also construct plain text output--which is just what we need to create MIME email messages.  <a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1521.html\" title=\"RFC 1521\">RFC 1521</a> doesn&apos;t make for the most thrilling reading, but there are a few articles to be found that summarize things (such as <a href=\"http://www.abiglime.com/webmaster/articles/cgi/010698.htm\" title=\"How to encapsulate HTML in an email message\">this article</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wilsonweb.com/wmt5/html-email-multi.htm\" title=\"Sending HTML and Plain Text E-Mail Simultaneously\">this article</a>).   To make a long story short, a basic shell for an email message using MIME to include an HTML part and a plain text part looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>To: someone@example.org\nSubject: Some useful email subject\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=&quot;theBoundaryString&quot;\n\n--theBoundaryString\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nSome plain text representation goes here...\n\n--theBoundaryString\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-Disposition: inline\nContent-Base: &quot;http://www.decafbad.com/&quot;\n\n&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Some HTML representation goes here...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n--theBoundaryString--</code></pre>\n<p>I&apos;ve snuck in the idea of providing both an HTML version (which we&apos;ve already done) and a new plain text version.  Depending on your email program and your preferences, one type might be more useful than the other.  In any case, it&apos;s not all that hard to offer both here.  To start sending these email messages, though, we&apos;ll need an email address.  So, add that as an element in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes.xml\">wishes.xml</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;wishes xmlns=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;email&gt;deus_x@pobox.com&lt;/email&gt;\n  &lt;maxprice&gt;15.00&lt;/maxprice&gt;\n  &lt;associate&gt;0xdecafbad-20&lt;/associate&gt;\n  &lt;devtoken&gt;D8HVH869XA0NP&lt;/devtoken&gt;\n  &lt;wishlists&gt;\n    &lt;wishlist label=&quot;Me&quot;&gt;1QWYI6P2JF3Q5&lt;/wishlist&gt;\n    &lt;wishlist label=&quot;The Girl&quot;&gt;35OIOYWQ9XQAE&lt;/wishlist&gt;\n  &lt;/wishlists&gt;\n&lt;/wishes&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Let&apos;s extract this data into a global variable near the start of the stylesheet:</p>\n<pre><code>  &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;email_to&quot;  select=&quot;/wishes:wishes/wishes:email&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Start editing the final template of the stylesheet, inserting before the start of HTML content:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;!-- Eat all the line breaks generated so far --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:text&gt;To: &lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$email_to&quot; /&gt;   \nSubject: 0xDECAFBAD&apos;s Amazon Wish-of-the-Month Club\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=&quot;theBoundaryString&quot;</code></pre>\n<p>This is the header for the email.  Up until now, we&apos;ve been generating XML with the stylesheet and haven&apos;t cared very much about any extra whitespace or line breaks which might sneak into the output.  However, in an email header, whitespace is important since a blank line is what&apos;s used to separate the headers from the body of the email message.  So, any stray blank lines will cause what we might have meant to be headers to be interpreted as part of the message instead.  Producing the first header in the email with <code>xsl:text</code> tags causes the XSL processor to throw away any leading whitespace which would have appeared before the first header.</p>\n<p>Other than this little twist, the email header looks pretty much like the shell.  We fill in the <code>To</code> address from the global variable <code>$email_to</code> and define a <code>Subject</code> line.  The <code>MIME-Version</code> and <code>Content-Type</code> headers are what enable us to include both text and HTML versions in one email.</p>\n<p>Now we can start into one of the parts:</p>\n<pre><code>--theBoundaryString\nContent-Type: text/plain</code></pre>\n<p>This begins the plain text section of the email, using the <em>boundary string</em> as defined in the headers to delinieate the section&apos;s beginning.  The section can also have its own set of headers, of which we use only one: <code>Content-Type</code>.  Moving along, let&apos;s work on the text content itself.</p>\n<pre><code>Here are your wishlist items:\n\n&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$shopping_cart_purchase_url&quot; /&gt;&lt;xsl:text&gt;\n&lt;/xsl:text&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>No shopping cart image here, but this includes the human-viewable URL which leads to a shopping cart on Amazon.com.  The usage of <code>xsl:text</code> here forces a line break where there otherwise wouldn&apos;t have been one with the usage of <code>xsl:value-of</code>.  Now, let&apos;s iterate through each of the wishlists and list out the product details:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;exsl:node-set($random_products)/wishes:wishitem&quot;&gt;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;wishes:wishlist/@label&quot; \n       disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot; /&gt;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/ProductName&quot; \n       disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot; /&gt;\n\n&lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;./Details/Artists/Artist | \n                      ./Details/Authors/Author&quot;&gt;\nby &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;.&quot;  \n   disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n\nCatalog:      &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/Catalog&quot; \n   disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot; /&gt;\nReleased:     &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/ReleaseDate&quot; \n   disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot; /&gt;\n\nList Price:   &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/ListPrice&quot;  \n     disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt; \nOur  Price:   &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/UsedPrice&quot;  \n     disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt; \nUsed Price:   &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/OurPrice&quot;  \n     disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt; \n\nAvailability: &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/Availability&quot;  \n       disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\n\n&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Details/@url&quot;  \n       disable-output-escaping=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\n&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n\n&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Most everything in this stretch should look very similar to the HTML version we just finished.  The biggest difference is that every bit of information pulled in using <code>xsl:value-of</code> is done using the <code>disable-output-escaping</code> option.  When this is <code>yes</code>, things like ampersands are no longer escaped for valid XML output.  Since this bit of the email is plain text, we don&apos;t want to see <code>&amp;amp;</code> in album titles, so this will cause ampersands to appear unmolested.</p>\n<p>That&apos;s the plain text version finished.  Now let&apos;s create the HTML version:</p>\n<pre><code>--theBoundaryString\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-Disposition: inline\nContent-Base: &quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;</code></pre>\n<p>The boundary string appears again, signifying the end of the plain text section and the start of the HTML section.  Headers appear here which specify that what follows is HTML; that it&apos;s encoded in 7-bit characters; that it should be included in the message display itself (rather than presented as an attachment to be saved); and that all relative URLs which might appear in the HTML should be treated as having a base URL as specified.  This last part allows HTML in email to refer to images and other pages on another site without making all the URLs absolute.</p>\n<p>We don&apos;t need to make any modifications to the HTML as we built it in the last iteration of the stylesheet, so we can just include it unchanged:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;\n...\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n--theBoundaryString--</code></pre>\n<p>This final appearance of the boundary string is bracketed on both sides by dashes, which indicates the end of the final section of the document.  We should be ready to try this in combination with <code>sendmail</code> in a shell:</p>\n<pre><code>$ xsltproc wishes-ex6.xsl wishes.xml | sendmail -it</code></pre>\n<p>If everything has worked correctly, there should be an email arriving in your mailbox sometime soon.  (Or in my inbox, if you followed the directions literally and didn&apos;t supply your own email address.)  The options supplied to <code>sendmail</code> are fairly basic: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>-i</code> causes lines consisting solely of <code>.</code> <em>not</em> to be treated as an end-of-input signal.</li>\n<li><code>-t</code> causes <code>sendmail</code> to look in the message headers (ie. <code>To:</code>) for a list of recipients.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you don&apos;t happen to have have <code>sendmail</code> available, you might want to look into what local mail programs you have available which can accept the output from the stylesheet.</p>\n<p>Once you have this working, the final task is to schedule its monthly execution with your local <code>cron</code> installation.  If you haven&apos;t played with <code>cron</code> before, there are many resources and tutorials available (<a href=\"http://www.lysator.liu.se/~forsberg/linux/cron.html\" title=\"Doing things periodically - Using CRON\">here&apos;s one</a> and <a href=\"http://www.itworld.com/Comp/2378/swol-0825-unix101/\" title=\"Using cron basics\">here&apos;s another</a>).  You should add something like the following to your user account&apos;s <code>crontab</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>0 0 * 1 *  (cd /your/working/path; xsltproc wishes.xsl wishes.xml | sendmail -it)</code></pre>\n<p>The &quot;<code>0 0 * 1 *</code>&quot; indicates to <code>cron</code> that this set of commands should be run at midnight on the first of every months.  Note also that <code>/your/working/path</code> should be replaced by the path to where you&apos;ve been working during this project.  And finally, I&apos;ve renamed the final iteration of the stylesheet file to simply <code>wishes.xsl</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>So that&apos;s it--we have an XSL stylesheet which queries Amazon Web Services for products contained in multiple wishlists; selects a random item from each; prepares a shopping cart containing those items; and finally generates an email message containing both plain text and HTML presentations of the shopping cart and selected items.</p>\n<p>Though this implementation serves the purpose I wrote about at the start of this article, there are definitely many areas where this can be improved upon or expanded:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Many people think Amazon is an evil company for their use of patents.  I can&apos;t say that I&apos;m entirely happy with them for this myself, but their AWS offering is just too nice to resist tinkering with.  It might be interesting to investigate other retailers&apos; wishlist offerings, where they exist, and to see how this idea might be made to work with other (or even multiple) retailers.  Even better, come up with your own wishlist system, and a cross-retailer shopping cart.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I chose XSLT as the implementation technology because I thought it would be more natural to deal with Amazon&apos;s XML this way.  There are, admittedly, a few awkward parts in the resulting stylesheet however.  Sometimes it&apos;s good to see a project like this through, just to get a sense for where things do go awkward with a technology or my understanding of it.  It could be interesting to transliterate this into a scripting language like Python or Perl, perhaps using the <a href=\"http://xmlsoft.org/python.html\">libxml bindings</a> to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The error and failure handling in this implementation are all but non-existent.  Should anything unexpected happen while dealing with Amazon Web Services, the results aren&apos;t likely to be very pretty.  You may want to consider improving in this area.  One instance I identified was to report when the sanity limit was hit in looping through wishlist pages, versus an actual end of pages.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you play around with making more wishlist queries using the techniques here, you might want to consider caching the full set of data pulled in by the multiple-page calls to AWS, in order to prevent hammering Amazon&apos;s servers with repeated requests for the same data, likely unchanged.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I still don&apos;t know why <code>exsl:random</code> doesn&apos;t work for me.  Although I thought using a web service for random numbers was intereting, it would be very nice if I didn&apos;t have to use it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The HTML presentation could certainly use some good CSS to make it more attractive.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feel free to send me any suggestions, criticisms, or complaints related to this article!</p>\n"

Enjoy!</i></p>\n<h3 id=\"paging-through-wishes\">Paging Through Wishes</h3>\n<p>Some ready-made files are available for this section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex2.xsl\"><code>wishes-ex2.xsl</code></a>: The second iteration of the stylesheet in development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now we&#39;ve got a way to make queries against Amazon Web Services, not entirely unlike what you might be used to if you tinker with MySQL databases on a regular basis.  At this point, though, we still have a bit of refining to make to this query.  If you take a look at the data produced by the query in its current state, and compare that to what you see on wishlists in your browser, you should notice some things missing.</p>\n<p>If you look at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/1QWYI6P2JF3Q5\" title=\"Buy me something, will ya?\">my wishlist</a>, you&#39;ll notice that items span several pages when visited by browser.  As it turns out, AWS queries work in a similar fashion--each query returns only a limited number of items (about 10), and an additional parameter supplied to further queries is required to step through further pages of results.  So, using what we&#39;ve built so far will only get us to the first page of wishlist items; to get all of the items, we&#39;ll need a way to step through all of the pages.</p>\n<p>In playing with this, I experienced a bit of hairpulling frustration:  The AWS documentation, under &quot;Generating Additional Product Results&quot;, claims that XML returned by the service will supply a count of the total pages available for a given query.  And although I see this element present in other types of searches, the <code>TotalPages</code> element is absent when querying on wishlists.  This may be a bug, or it may be an undocumented change in the service--either way, it was a surprise and leaves me with no official way to know how many pages I need to ask for in order to have a complete set of data.  </p>\n<p>With some further tinkering, though, I figured out a workaround: If a query is made for a page number beyond the final page, the XML returned will be a duplicate of the final page.  Once I see a duplicate item appear, I know it&#39;s time to stop paging through results.  This is completely undocumented behavior, and could break at any time (ie. if Amazon decided to start issuing an error for a page index out of bounds), but it&#39;ll work for now.</p>\n<p>This calls for reworking the <code>processWishlist</code> template.  For a given wishlist, it will need to iterate through a sequence of page numbers, requesting XML from AWS for each, stopping when the first duplicate page is found.  Since XSLT is heavily steeped in functional programming concepts, this sort of <a href=\"http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/N4806.html\" title=\"Iteration in XSLT\">iteration in XSLT</a> is best done <a href=\"http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-xslrecur/\" title=\"Use recursion effectively in XSL\">with recursion</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>  &lt;xsl:template name=&quot;processWishlist&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;wishlist&quot; /&gt;              &lt;!-- Wishlist ID --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;max&quot;   select=&quot;50&quot; /&gt;     &lt;!-- Arbitrary upper loop limit --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;curr_page&quot; select=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;  &lt;!-- Curr page # --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;prev_first_asin&quot; /&gt;       &lt;!-- Keeping track of repeats --&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The first modification to this template is the addition of three parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>max</code> provides an arbitrary upper limit to the number of pages through which this template will iterate.</li>\n<li><code>curr_page</code> contains the number of the page to be requested in this iteration.</li>\n<li><code>prev_first_asin</code> will contain the ASIN number of the first item from the previous iteration&#39;s page of results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, we modify the URL used to query for wishlist data:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;!-- Fetch the wishlist products --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;details&quot; select=&quot;document(concat(\n                  &#39;http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?&#39;,\n                  &#39;t=&#39;,$associate,&#39;&amp;amp;&#39;,\n                  &#39;dev-t=&#39;,$devtoken,&#39;&amp;amp;&#39;,\n                  &#39;WishlistSearch=&#39;,$wishlist,&#39;&amp;amp;&#39;,\n                  &#39;type=lite&amp;amp;f=xml&amp;amp;&#39;,\n                  &#39;page=&#39;,$curr_page))//Details&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The only addition here beyond the previous version is the <code>page</code> parameter in the URL.  Not much mystery here--this parameter specifies which page of results we want.  Now, let&#39;s build the loop:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;!-- Snag the first item Asin --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;curr_first_asin&quot; select=&quot;$details/Asin/text()&quot; /&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- If we haven&#39;t exceeded the loop limit, and this first Asin isn&#39;t --&gt;\n    &lt;!-- a repeat of the previous loop (indicating we&#39;ve run out of new   --&gt;\n    &lt;!-- pages), then go ahead...                                         --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:if test=&quot;(($curr_page+1) &amp;lt; $max) and\n                  (string-length($curr_first_asin) &amp;gt; 0) and\n                  not($curr_first_asin = $prev_first_asin)&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>We capture the ASIN of the first item in this page of results and check to see if we should continue.  This <code>if</code> conditional first ensures that we&#39;re not past the sanity guard for loop iterations, makes sure that we actually got a non-empty current first ASIN, then checks our current first product&#39;s ASIN against what was passed in as the previous iteration&#39;s first product&#39;s ASIN.  If this was the first time through the loop, this value should be empty and therefore wouldn&#39;t match the current ASIN.  But, if we&#39;ve gone past the end of results, the previous and current ASIN values should match, and the conditional will fail.</p>\n<p>Moving along into the body of the conditional, we copy in wishlist products filtered on a price maximum, just as before:</p>\n<pre><code>      &lt;!-- Copy products, filtering on a maximum price --&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;$details/OurPrice[number(substring(\n                   text(),2)) &amp;lt; $maxprice]/..&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Having done that, we move onto the recursive end of this template:</p>\n<pre><code>      &lt;!-- Loop by recursion to get the next page --&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;processWishlist&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;wishlist&quot;        select=&quot;$wishlist&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;max&quot;             select=&quot;$max&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;curr_page&quot;       select=&quot;$curr_page + 1&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;prev_first_asin&quot; select=&quot;$curr_first_asin&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;\n\n    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;    \n  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Here, the template makes a recursive call back to itself, passing through the wishlist ID and the maximum iteration count.  Since variables in XSLT are immutable, meaning that their values can&#39;t be changed once they&#39;ve been set, we can&#39;t increment <code>$curr_page</code> in-place like a loop counter in other languages--so, the current page count <em>value</em> is incremented and passed to the recursive call as a parameter.  Finally, the current first item&#39;s ASIN is passed along, to become the previous ASIN for the next iteration.</p>\n<p>Note that when the conditional fails--that is, if the loop limit is passed or a duplicate page is detected--the loop ends.  In other words, nothing further happens and execution pops back up out of all the levels of recursion and the top-level template ends.  </p>\n<p>I wrote &quot;<em>when</em> the conditional fails&quot;.  This is a key point: for the loop to eventually end, this conditional <em>must</em> fail (or be made to fail) at some point, else this loop will happily progress through page requests forever.  This is the reason for the <code>$max</code> parameter limiting the number of iterations, in case something goes haywire--like, oh say, a failure of our duplicate-page detection hack as a loop ending condition.  A useful exercise for the reader might be to add some additional diagnostic code to report that the limit was hit versus a natural end to results.</p>\n<h3 id=\"random-numbers\">Random Numbers</h3>\n<p>Some ready-made files are available for this section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex3.xsl\"><code>wishes-ex3.xsl</code></a>: The third iteration of the stylesheet in development.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/random-xml\"><code>random-xml</code></a>: A Perl CGI script used as a web service to generate random numbers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Armed with a template that will query against the full set of items in a wishlist, we&#39;re ready to look into making a random selection from a list of products.  </p>\n<p>But first, we need to pick a random number.  Unfortunately, there doesn&#39;t appear to be any <code>random()</code> function in the XPath or XSLT standards.  There <em>is</em> a <a href=\"http://www.exslt.org/math/functions/random/index.html\"><code>math:random()</code></a> from EXSLT implemented in <code>libxslt</code>, but I seem to be having a bit of a problem getting it to produce anything other than the same sequence of numbers.  I suspect there&#39;s a problem in seeding the random number generator, but I&#39;ve yet to work out how to fix it.  (Suggestions welcome.)</p>\n<p>So, I cheated and made another workaround with a CGI script on my web server that generates random numbers in a simple XML document.  Currently, it&#39;s hosted here:</p>\n<pre><code>http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/random-xml</code></pre>\n<p>And this is what the script looks like:</p>\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl\n\nuse strict;\nuse CGI;\n\nmy $q = new CGI();\n\nmy $min = $q-&gt;param(&#39;min&#39;) or 0;\nmy $max = $q-&gt;param(&#39;max&#39;) or 1;\nmy $int = $q-&gt;param(&#39;int&#39;);\n\nmy $num = $min + ( rand() * ($max - $min));\nif ($int) { $num = int($num); }\n\nprint $q-&gt;header(&#39;text/xml&#39;);\nprint &quot;&lt;rand&gt;$num&lt;/rand&gt;\\n&quot;;</code></pre>\n<p>This is a very simple CGI.  It accepts the parameters <code>max</code>, <code>min</code>, and <code>int</code>.  The values of these parameters determine the maximum and minimum value for the random number returned, and whether or not it should be an integer.  For example, the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/random-xml?int=1&#38;min=10&#38;max=20\" title=\"A random integer between 10 and 20, in XML\">following URL</a> should return an integer between 10 and 20:</p>\n<pre><code>http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/random-xml?\nint=1&amp;#38;min=10&amp;#38;max=20</code></pre>\n<p>Using this as a web service in the stylesheet with the <code>document()</code> function, we can get a random number.  If you&#39;ve got web space where you can host CGI scripts, I suggest you host a copy of this script yourself, since I can&#39;t guarantee how long mine will stick around.  But, for as long at works, feel free to use the service from my server.</p>\n<p>Moving along, let&#39;s add a new named template to the stylesheet, called <code>randomWishlistProduct</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>  &lt;xsl:template name=&quot;randomWishlistProduct&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;wishlist&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- Wishlist ID --&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Gather all the products for the current wishlist --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;products&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;processWishlist&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;wishlist&quot; select=&quot;$wishlist&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Just like the <code>processWishlist</code> template, we start by defining the parameter <code>wishlist</code> to accept a wishlist ID.  Using this ID, we call the <code>processWishlist</code> template itself and store the complete list of products queried from the wishlist into the variable <code>$products</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;!-- Count the products in the wishlist --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;max_products&quot;\n                  select=&quot;count(exsl:node-set($products)/Details)&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>This next step counts the number of products found in the wishlist.  The one tricky bit here is the use of the EXSLT function <a href=\"http://www.exslt.org/exsl/functions/node-set/index.html\"><code>exsl:node-set()</code></a>: The <code>$products</code> variable contains what&#39;s called a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#section-Result-Tree-Fragments\"><em>result tree fragment</em></a>, which is a kind of cross between XML data nodes and a plain old string.  This type of data does not normally allow the full set of XPath operators to be used on it, so first we need to use <code>exsl:node-set()</code> to turn it into a full-fledged node set.  Then we can look up the <code>Details</code> element nodes and count them.  </p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;!-- Conjure up a random index within the list of products --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;rand_product_num&quot;\n                  select=&quot;document(concat(\n                  &#39;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/random-xml?&#39;,\n                  &#39;int=1&amp;amp;&#39;,\n                  &#39;min=1&amp;amp;&#39;,\n                  &#39;max=&#39;,$max_products))/rand&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Here is where the random number service comes in handy.  The <code>concat()</code> function is used to build the URL to the service, with parameters specifying that the number should be an integer, and should fall between 1 and the number of products in the wishlist.  The <code>document()</code> function grabs the XML document from the service, and the value is extracted from the single element the document contains.</p>\n<p>There is an alternative to this last bit, should you happen to have a properly working <code>math:random()</code> function in your XSLT processor:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;rand_product_num&quot; select=&quot;round( math:random() *\n                  $max_products ) + 1&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>If you can use this instead, you&#39;ll have no need for the random number web service.  This version is obviously more concise, and doesn&#39;t require another trip out to a web service.  You might want to try it--but if you find that you keep getting the same wishlist items selected, then you&#39;ve run into the problem I found with the random number generator.</p>\n<p>Now, let&#39;s wrap this template up by selecting an item:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;!-- Copy the product as indexed by the random number --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;exsl:node-set($products)/Details[\n                 position()=$rand_product_num]&quot; /&gt;\n\n  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Again, we need to use the <code>exsl:node-set()</code> function to turn the result tree fragment in the <code>$products</code> variable into a node set, from which we select and copy the <code>Details</code> element whose position in the data is indexed by the random number we just selected.  Just one last tweak needed to wrap up this iteration of our stylesheet.  We need to swap out the call to the <code>processWishlist</code> function at the end and replace it with a call to <code>randomWishlistProduct</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>  &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/wishes:wishes&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;//wishes:wishlist&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;wishes:wishitem&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;randomWishlistProduct&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;wishlist&quot; select=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;\n      &lt;/wishes:wishitem&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n\n  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>After these changes, you should be able to run the stylesheet ([wishes-ex3.xsl][wishes_ex3]) and get something like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;wishes:wishitem xmlns:wishes=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;wishes:wishlist label=&quot;The Girl&quot;&gt;35OIOYWQ9XQAE&lt;/wishes:wishlist&gt;\n    &lt;Details ...&gt;...&lt;/Details&gt;\n&lt;/wishes:wishitem&gt;\n&lt;wishes:wishitem xmlns:wishes=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;wishes:wishlist label=&quot;Me&quot;&gt;1QWYI6P2JF3Q5&lt;/wishes:wishlist&gt;\n    &lt;Details ...&gt;...&lt;/Details&gt;\n&lt;/wishes:wishitem&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>This is similar to the output of the previous iteration of the stylesheet, but this time there&#39;s only one product selected at random for each wishlist.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"shopping-carts\">Shopping Carts</h3>\n<p>Some ready-made files are available for this section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex4.xsl\"><code>wishes-ex4.xsl</code></a>: The fourth iteration of the stylesheet in development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By this point, we&#39;ve been able to query and filter products in Amazon wishlists, and we&#39;ve selected an item at random from each wishlist we&#39;ve queried.  Now, let&#39;s enable some purchases.</p>\n<p>The AWS provides for Remote Shopping Cart functionality, whereby items can be added to an Amazon.com shopping cart programmatically.  This is about as close as we can get to automating the purchase of items selected from the wishlists--there is no API functionality for actually completing the ordering of items.  If you really think about it, this really is a good thing and <em>should</em> demand human intervention; we certainly wouldn&#39;t want this script going crazy and accidentally buying up everything on a wishlist.</p>\n<p>Documentation for the AWS Remote Shopping Cart explains that a shopping cart can be created and items added with a URL like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?\nShoppingCart=add&amp;#38;\nf=xml&amp;#38;\ndev-t=[Developer Token goes here]&amp;#38;\nt=[Associates ID goes here]&amp;#38;\nAsin.[ASIN goes here]=[quantity goes here]&amp;#38;\nsims=true</code></pre>\n<p>Part of this should look familiar, so we already know what to do with the developer token and the associates ID.  The last part, specifying product ASIN and quantity, can be filled out with information contained in the product records selected at random from the wishlists.  </p>\n<p>So, let&#39;s start by revising the template at the end of the stylesheet:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/wishes:wishes&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;random_products&quot;&gt;      \n      &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;//wishes:wishlist&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;wishes:wishitem&gt;\n          &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;\n          &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;randomWishlistProduct&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;wishlist&quot; select=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;\n          &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;\n        &lt;/wishes:wishitem&gt;\n      &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we&#39;ve taken what was the output of the previous iteration of the stylesheet and stuffed it into the variable <code>$random_products</code>.  Next, let&#39;s fill in the blanks and build a Remote Shopping Cart URL:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;shopping_cart_create_url&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;!-- Standard AWS URL --&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:text&gt;http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n\n      &lt;!-- Add in the selected items --&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;exsl:node-set($random_products)\n                            /wishes:wishitem/Details&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:text&gt;Asin.&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Asin&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:text&gt;=1&amp;amp;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n      &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n\n      &lt;!-- Wrap up with the shopping cart function and required tokens --&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:text&gt;ShoppingCart=add&amp;amp;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:text&gt;f=xml&amp;amp;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:text&gt;dev-t=&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$devtoken&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:text&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:text&gt;t=&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$associate&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Since simple XPath doesn&#39;t allow for the looping needed for multiple items, we can&#39;t just concatenate this URL together in a <code>select</code> expression like we did with the wishlist item query.  So, we use <code>xslt:foreach</code> to build this with blocks of text using the <code>xsl:text</code> element.  We iterate though the random products chosen from wishlists and add an ASIN for each to the URL with a quantity of 1. Then, we use the <code>$devtoken</code> and <code>$associate</code> variables to fill in their respective spots.</p>\n<p>Note that this could have been written without using the <code>xsl:text</code> elements like so:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;shopping_cart_create_url&quot;&gt;http://xml.amazon.\n    com/onca/xml3?ShoppingCart=add&amp;amp;f=xml&amp;amp;dev-t=&lt;xsl:value-of \n    select=&quot;$devtoken&quot; /&gt;&amp;amp;t=&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$associate&quot; /&gt;\n    &amp;amp;&lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;exsl:node-set($random_products)/\n    wishes:wishitem/Details&quot;&gt;Asin.&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Asin&quot; /&gt;=1\n    &amp;amp;&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;&lt;/xsl:variable&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>This removes the clutter of all the <code>xsl:text</code> elements, but it would need to be piled all on one line in order to keep undesired whitespace from getting into the URL.  I made a small attempt at wrapping this line here, but line breaks and spaces would leave us with a non-functioning shopping cart URL.  It&#39;s up to you to decide which to use--personally, I prefer the <code>xsl:text</code> clutter for the ability to add in comments and clarify things a bit.</p>\n<p>Finally, having built the shopping cart URL, let&#39;s use it to get a shopping cart and wrap things up:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;shopping_cart&quot;\n                  select=&quot;document($shopping_cart_create_url)&quot; /&gt;\n\n    &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;$shopping_cart&quot; /&gt;\n\n&lt;/xsl:template&gt;  </code></pre>\n<p>As an aside, this part is pushing the concept of a REST web service a bit: In the REST philosophy, requests using the GET method (which is what <code>document()</code> uses) should only return existing resources and not create new resources or cause modifications to happen.  Instead, these sorts of actions should use a POST request.  But, since we&#39;ve already accepted a few rough edges and workarounds in this project so far, we won&#39;t let a point of esoterica like that stop us.  (That and, well, this is the way Amazon designed their web service, so we&#39;ll take what we can get.)</p>\n<p>Once you run this iteration of the stylesheet ([wishes-ex4.xsl][wishes_ex4]), you should get something like this XML as output:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;ShoppingCartResponse ...&gt;\n  ...\n  &lt;ShoppingCart&gt;\n   &lt;CartId&gt;...&lt;/CartId&gt;\n   &lt;HMAC&gt;...&lt;/HMAC&gt;\n   &lt;PurchaseUrl&gt;...&lt;/PurchaseUrl&gt;\n   &lt;Items&gt;\n    &lt;Item&gt;...&lt;/item&gt;\n    &lt;Item&gt;...&lt;/item&gt;\n   &lt;/Items&gt;\n  &lt;/ShoppingCart&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/ShoppingCartResponse&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The AWS documentation describes the vital elements here like so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>CartId</code> - The Cart ID is the unique identifier for a given shopping cart.</li>\n<li><code>HMAC</code> - The HMAC is a security token that must be passed back to Amazon Web Services for using an existing cart.</li>\n<li><code>PurchaseUrl</code> - Use the purchase URL to transfer the remote shopping cart from your application to Amazon so that your application&#39;s users may complete their purchases.&#160; The purchase URL merges the remote shopping cart with the Amazon.com shopping cart. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, in short, whenever we want to do any sort of manipulation on this Remote Shopping Cart via AWS, we&#39;ll need to remember and later supply both the <code>CartId</code> and <code>HMAC</code> found in the XML returned at its creation.  And, once we&#39;re all ready to check out, the <code>PurchaseUrl</code> points to where we&#39;ll need to browse in person.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stay-tuned\">Stay Tuned!</h3>\n<p>This concludes Part 2 of the Wish-of-the-Month Club.

    "body": "<i>Here's the next installment of the Wish-of-the-Month Club.  You can [revisit the first part][part1], too, if you've missed it.  I'd meant to post it within a week of the first part, so apologies all around to anyone who has been tapping a foot waiting for it.  Enjoy!</i>\r\n\r\n### Paging Through Wishes\r\n\r\nSome ready-made files are available for this section:\r\n* [`wishes-ex2.xsl`][wishes-ex2.xsl]: The second iteration of the stylesheet in development.\r\n\r\nNow we've got a way to make queries against Amazon Web Services, not entirely unlike what you might be used to if you tinker with MySQL databases on a regular basis.  At this point, though, we still have a bit of refining to make to this query.  If you take a look at the data produced by the query in its current state, and compare that to what you see on wishlists in your browser, you should notice some things missing.\r\n\r\nIf you look at [my wishlist][mywishlist], you'll notice that items span several pages when visited by browser.  As it turns out, AWS queries work in a similar fashion--each query returns only a limited number of items (about 10), and an additional parameter supplied to further queries is required to step through further pages of results.  So, using what we've built so far will only get us to the first page of wishlist items; to get all of the items, we'll need a way to step through all of the pages.\r\n\r\nIn playing with this, I experienced a bit of hairpulling frustration:  The AWS documentation, under \"Generating Additional Product Results\", claims that XML returned by the service will supply a count of the total pages available for a given query.  And although I see this element present in other types of searches, the `TotalPages` element is absent when querying on wishlists.  This may be a bug, or it may be an undocumented change in the service--either way, it was a surprise and leaves me with no official way to know how many pages I need to ask for in order to have a complete set of data.  \r\n\r\nWith some further tinkering, though, I figured out a workaround: If a query is made for a page number beyond the final page, the XML returned will be a duplicate of the final page.  Once I see a duplicate item appear, I know it's time to stop paging through results.  This is completely undocumented behavior, and could break at any time (ie. if Amazon decided to start issuing an error for a page index out of bounds), but it'll work for now.\r\n\r\nThis calls for reworking the `processWishlist` template.  For a given wishlist, it will need to iterate through a sequence of page numbers, requesting XML from AWS for each, stopping when the first duplicate page is found.  Since XSLT is heavily steeped in functional programming concepts, this sort of [iteration in XSLT][xslt_iteration] is best done [with recursion][xslt_recursion]:\r\n\r\n      <xsl:template name=\"processWishlist\">\r\n\r\n        <xsl:param name=\"wishlist\" />              <!-- Wishlist ID -->\r\n        <xsl:param name=\"max\"   select=\"50\" />     <!-- Arbitrary upper loop limit -->\r\n        <xsl:param name=\"curr_page\" select=\"1\" />  <!-- Curr page # -->\r\n        <xsl:param name=\"prev_first_asin\" />       <!-- Keeping track of repeats -->\r\n\r\nThe first modification to this template is the addition of three parameters:\r\n\r\n* `max` provides an arbitrary upper limit to the number of pages through which this template will iterate.\r\n* `curr_page` contains the number of the page to be requested in this iteration.\r\n* `prev_first_asin` will contain the ASIN number of the first item from the previous iteration's page of results.\r\n\r\nNext, we modify the URL used to query for wishlist data:\r\n\r\n        <!-- Fetch the wishlist products -->\r\n        <xsl:variable name=\"details\" select=\"document(concat(\r\n                      'http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?',\r\n                      't=',$associate,'&amp;',\r\n                      'dev-t=',$devtoken,'&amp;',\r\n                      'WishlistSearch=',$wishlist,'&amp;',\r\n                      'type=lite&amp;f=xml&amp;',\r\n                      'page=',$curr_page))//Details\" />\r\n\r\nThe only addition here beyond the previous version is the `page` parameter in the URL.  Not much mystery here--this parameter specifies which page of results we want.  Now, let's build the loop:\r\n    \r\n        <!-- Snag the first item Asin -->\r\n        <xsl:variable name=\"curr_first_asin\" select=\"$details/Asin/text()\" />\r\n    \r\n        <!-- If we haven't exceeded the loop limit, and this first Asin isn't -->\r\n        <!-- a repeat of the previous loop (indicating we've run out of new   -->\r\n        <!-- pages), then go ahead...                                         -->\r\n        <xsl:if test=\"(($curr_page+1) &lt; $max) and\r\n                      (string-length($curr_first_asin) &gt; 0) and\r\n                      not($curr_first_asin = $prev_first_asin)\">\r\n      \r\nWe capture the ASIN of the first item in this page of results and check to see if we should continue.  This `if` conditional first ensures that we're not past the sanity guard for loop iterations, makes sure that we actually got a non-empty current first ASIN, then checks our current first product's ASIN against what was passed in as the previous iteration's first product's ASIN.  If this was the first time through the loop, this value should be empty and therefore wouldn't match the current ASIN.  But, if we've gone past the end of results, the previous and current ASIN values should match, and the conditional will fail.\r\n\r\nMoving along into the body of the conditional, we copy in wishlist products filtered on a price maximum, just as before:\r\n      \r\n          <!-- Copy products, filtering on a maximum price -->\r\n          <xsl:copy-of select=\"$details/OurPrice[number(substring(\r\n                       text(),2)) &lt; $maxprice]/..\" />\r\n\r\nHaving done that, we move onto the recursive end of this template:\r\n      \r\n          <!-- Loop by recursion to get the next page -->\r\n          <xsl:call-template name=\"processWishlist\">\r\n            <xsl:with-param name=\"wishlist\"        select=\"$wishlist\" />\r\n            <xsl:with-param name=\"max\"             select=\"$max\" />\r\n            <xsl:with-param name=\"curr_page\"       select=\"$curr_page + 1\" />\r\n            <xsl:with-param name=\"prev_first_asin\" select=\"$curr_first_asin\" />\r\n          </xsl:call-template>\r\n\r\n        </xsl:if>    \r\n      </xsl:template>\r\n\r\nHere, the template makes a recursive call back to itself, passing through the wishlist ID and the maximum iteration count.  Since variables in XSLT are immutable, meaning that their values can't be changed once they've been set, we can't increment `$curr_page` in-place like a loop counter in other languages--so, the current page count *value* is incremented and passed to the recursive call as a parameter.  Finally, the current first item's ASIN is passed along, to become the previous ASIN for the next iteration.\r\n\r\nNote that when the conditional fails--that is, if the loop limit is passed or a duplicate page is detected--the loop ends.  In other words, nothing further happens and execution pops back up out of all the levels of recursion and the top-level template ends.  \r\n\r\nI wrote \"*when* the conditional fails\".  This is a key point: for the loop to eventually end, this conditional *must* fail (or be made to fail) at some point, else this loop will happily progress through page requests forever.  This is the reason for the `$max` parameter limiting the number of iterations, in case something goes haywire--like, oh say, a failure of our duplicate-page detection hack as a loop ending condition.  A useful exercise for the reader might be to add some additional diagnostic code to report that the limit was hit versus a natural end to results.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Random Numbers\r\n\r\nSome ready-made files are available for this section:\r\n* [`wishes-ex3.xsl`][wishes-ex3.xsl]: The third iteration of the stylesheet in development.\r\n* [`random-xml`][random-xml]: A Perl CGI script used as a web service to generate random numbers.\r\n\r\nArmed with a template that will query against the full set of items in a wishlist, we're ready to look into making a random selection from a list of products.  \r\n\r\nBut first, we need to pick a random number.  Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be any `random()` function in the XPath or XSLT standards.  There *is* a [`math:random()`][exsl_random] from EXSLT implemented in `libxslt`, but I seem to be having a bit of a problem getting it to produce anything other than the same sequence of numbers.  I suspect there's a problem in seeding the random number generator, but I've yet to work out how to fix it.  (Suggestions welcome.)\r\n\r\nSo, I cheated and made another workaround with a CGI script on my web server that generates random numbers in a simple XML document.  Currently, it's hosted here:\r\n\r\n    http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/random-xml\r\n\r\nAnd this is what the script looks like:\r\n\r\n    #!/usr/bin/perl\r\n\r\n    use strict;\r\n    use CGI;\r\n\r\n    my $q = new CGI();\r\n\r\n    my $min = $q->param('min') or 0;\r\n    my $max = $q->param('max') or 1;\r\n    my $int = $q->param('int');\r\n\r\n    my $num = $min + ( rand() * ($max - $min));\r\n    if ($int) { $num = int($num); }\r\n\r\n    print $q->header('text/xml');\r\n    print \"<rand>$num</rand>\\n\";\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple CGI.  It accepts the parameters `max`, `min`, and `int`.  The values of these parameters determine the maximum and minimum value for the random number returned, and whether or not it should be an integer.  For example, the [following URL][rand_url] should return an integer between 10 and 20:\r\n\r\n    http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/random-xml?\r\n    int=1&#38;min=10&#38;max=20\r\n\r\nUsing this as a web service in the stylesheet with the `document()` function, we can get a random number.  If you've got web space where you can host CGI scripts, I suggest you host a copy of this script yourself, since I can't guarantee how long mine will stick around.  But, for as long at works, feel free to use the service from my server.\r\n\r\nMoving along, let's add a new named template to the stylesheet, called `randomWishlistProduct`:\r\n\r\n      <xsl:template name=\"randomWishlistProduct\">\r\n    \r\n        <xsl:param name=\"wishlist\" /> <!-- Wishlist ID -->\r\n        \r\n        <!-- Gather all the products for the current wishlist -->\r\n        <xsl:variable name=\"products\">\r\n          <xsl:call-template name=\"processWishlist\">\r\n            <xsl:with-param name=\"wishlist\" select=\"$wishlist\" />\r\n          </xsl:call-template>\r\n        </xsl:variable>\r\n\r\nJust like the `processWishlist` template, we start by defining the parameter `wishlist` to accept a wishlist ID.  Using this ID, we call the `processWishlist` template itself and store the complete list of products queried from the wishlist into the variable `$products`.\r\n\r\n        <!-- Count the products in the wishlist -->\r\n        <xsl:variable name=\"max_products\"\r\n                      select=\"count(exsl:node-set($products)/Details)\" />\r\n\r\nThis next step counts the number of products found in the wishlist.  The one tricky bit here is the use of the EXSLT function [`exsl:node-set()`][exsl_node_set]: The `$products` variable contains what's called a [*result tree fragment*][xslt_result_tree_fragment], which is a kind of cross between XML data nodes and a plain old string.  This type of data does not normally allow the full set of XPath operators to be used on it, so first we need to use `exsl:node-set()` to turn it into a full-fledged node set.  Then we can look up the `Details` element nodes and count them.  \r\n\r\n        <!-- Conjure up a random index within the list of products -->\r\n        <xsl:variable name=\"rand_product_num\"\r\n                      select=\"document(concat(\r\n                      'http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/random-xml?',\r\n                      'int=1&amp;',\r\n                      'min=1&amp;',\r\n                      'max=',$max_products))/rand\" />\r\n\r\nHere is where the random number service comes in handy.  The `concat()` function is used to build the URL to the service, with parameters specifying that the number should be an integer, and should fall between 1 and the number of products in the wishlist.  The `document()` function grabs the XML document from the service, and the value is extracted from the single element the document contains.\r\n\r\nThere is an alternative to this last bit, should you happen to have a properly working `math:random()` function in your XSLT processor:\r\n\r\n        <xsl:variable name=\"rand_product_num\" select=\"round( math:random() *\r\n                      $max_products ) + 1\" />\r\n\r\nIf you can use this instead, you'll have no need for the random number web service.  This version is obviously more concise, and doesn't require another trip out to a web service.  You might want to try it--but if you find that you keep getting the same wishlist items selected, then you've run into the problem I found with the random number generator.\r\n\r\nNow, let's wrap this template up by selecting an item:\r\n        \r\n        <!-- Copy the product as indexed by the random number -->\r\n        <xsl:copy-of select=\"exsl:node-set($products)/Details[\r\n                     position()=$rand_product_num]\" />\r\n           \r\n      </xsl:template>\r\n\r\nAgain, we need to use the `exsl:node-set()` function to turn the result tree fragment in the `$products` variable into a node set, from which we select and copy the `Details` element whose position in the data is indexed by the random number we just selected.  Just one last tweak needed to wrap up this iteration of our stylesheet.  We need to swap out the call to the `processWishlist` function at the end and replace it with a call to `randomWishlistProduct`:\r\n\r\n      <xsl:template match=\"/wishes:wishes\">\r\n\r\n        <xsl:for-each select=\"//wishes:wishlist\">\r\n          <wishes:wishitem>\r\n            <xsl:copy-of select=\".\" />\r\n            <xsl:call-template name=\"randomWishlistProduct\">\r\n              <xsl:with-param name=\"wishlist\" select=\".\" />\r\n            </xsl:call-template>\r\n          </wishes:wishitem>\r\n        </xsl:for-each>\r\n    \r\n      </xsl:template>\r\n\r\nAfter these changes, you should be able to run the stylesheet ([wishes-ex3.xsl][wishes_ex3]) and get something like the following:\r\n\r\n    <wishes:wishitem xmlns:wishes=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes\">\r\n        <wishes:wishlist label=\"The Girl\">35OIOYWQ9XQAE</wishes:wishlist>\r\n        <Details ...>...</Details>\r\n    </wishes:wishitem>\r\n    <wishes:wishitem xmlns:wishes=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes\">\r\n        <wishes:wishlist label=\"Me\">1QWYI6P2JF3Q5</wishes:wishlist>\r\n        <Details ...>...</Details>\r\n    </wishes:wishitem>\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the output of the previous iteration of the stylesheet, but this time there's only one product selected at random for each wishlist.  \r\n\r\n### Shopping Carts\r\n\r\nSome ready-made files are available for this section:\r\n* [`wishes-ex4.xsl`][wishes-ex4.xsl]: The fourth iteration of the stylesheet in development.\r\n\r\nBy this point, we've been able to query and filter products in Amazon wishlists, and we've selected an item at random from each wishlist we've queried.  Now, let's enable some purchases.\r\n\r\nThe AWS provides for Remote Shopping Cart functionality, whereby items can be added to an Amazon.com shopping cart programmatically.  This is about as close as we can get to automating the purchase of items selected from the wishlists--there is no API functionality for actually completing the ordering of items.  If you really think about it, this really is a good thing and *should* demand human intervention; we certainly wouldn't want this script going crazy and accidentally buying up everything on a wishlist.\r\n\r\nDocumentation for the AWS Remote Shopping Cart explains that a shopping cart can be created and items added with a URL like the following:\r\n\r\n    http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?\r\n    ShoppingCart=add&#38;\r\n    f=xml&#38;\r\n    dev-t=[Developer Token goes here]&#38;\r\n    t=[Associates ID goes here]&#38;\r\n    Asin.[ASIN goes here]=[quantity goes here]&#38;\r\n    sims=true\r\n\r\nPart of this should look familiar, so we already know what to do with the developer token and the associates ID.  The last part, specifying product ASIN and quantity, can be filled out with information contained in the product records selected at random from the wishlists.  \r\n\r\nSo, let's start by revising the template at the end of the stylesheet:\r\n\r\n    <xsl:template match=\"/wishes:wishes\">\r\n\r\n        <xsl:variable name=\"random_products\">      \r\n          <xsl:for-each select=\"//wishes:wishlist\">\r\n            <wishes:wishitem>\r\n              <xsl:copy-of select=\".\" />\r\n              <xsl:call-template name=\"randomWishlistProduct\">\r\n                <xsl:with-param name=\"wishlist\" select=\".\" />\r\n              </xsl:call-template>\r\n            </wishes:wishitem>\r\n          </xsl:for-each>\r\n        </xsl:variable>\r\n\r\nHere, we've taken what was the output of the previous iteration of the stylesheet and stuffed it into the variable `$random_products`.  Next, let's fill in the blanks and build a Remote Shopping Cart URL:\r\n\r\n        <xsl:variable name=\"shopping_cart_create_url\">\r\n          <!-- Standard AWS URL -->\r\n          <xsl:text>http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?</xsl:text>\r\n\r\n          <!-- Add in the selected items -->\r\n          <xsl:for-each select=\"exsl:node-set($random_products)\r\n                                /wishes:wishitem/Details\">\r\n            <xsl:text>Asin.</xsl:text><xsl:value-of select=\"Asin\" />\r\n            <xsl:text>=1&amp;</xsl:text>\r\n          </xsl:for-each>\r\n\r\n          <!-- Wrap up with the shopping cart function and required tokens -->\r\n          <xsl:text>ShoppingCart=add&amp;</xsl:text>\r\n          <xsl:text>f=xml&amp;</xsl:text>\r\n          <xsl:text>dev-t=</xsl:text><xsl:value-of select=\"$devtoken\" />\r\n          <xsl:text>&amp;</xsl:text>\r\n          <xsl:text>t=</xsl:text><xsl:value-of select=\"$associate\" />\r\n        </xsl:variable>\r\n    \r\nSince simple XPath doesn't allow for the looping needed for multiple items, we can't just concatenate this URL together in a `select` expression like we did with the wishlist item query.  So, we use `xslt:foreach` to build this with blocks of text using the `xsl:text` element.  We iterate though the random products chosen from wishlists and add an ASIN for each to the URL with a quantity of 1. Then, we use the `$devtoken` and `$associate` variables to fill in their respective spots.\r\n\r\nNote that this could have been written without using the `xsl:text` elements like so:\r\n\r\n        <xsl:variable name=\"shopping_cart_create_url\">http://xml.amazon.\r\n        com/onca/xml3?ShoppingCart=add&amp;f=xml&amp;dev-t=<xsl:value-of \r\n        select=\"$devtoken\" />&amp;t=<xsl:value-of select=\"$associate\" />\r\n        &amp;<xsl:for-each select=\"exsl:node-set($random_products)/\r\n        wishes:wishitem/Details\">Asin.<xsl:value-of select=\"Asin\" />=1\r\n        &amp;</xsl:for-each></xsl:variable>\r\n\r\nThis removes the clutter of all the `xsl:text` elements, but it would need to be piled all on one line in order to keep undesired whitespace from getting into the URL.  I made a small attempt at wrapping this line here, but line breaks and spaces would leave us with a non-functioning shopping cart URL.  It's up to you to decide which to use--personally, I prefer the `xsl:text` clutter for the ability to add in comments and clarify things a bit.\r\n\r\nFinally, having built the shopping cart URL, let's use it to get a shopping cart and wrap things up:\r\n\r\n        <xsl:variable name=\"shopping_cart\"\r\n                      select=\"document($shopping_cart_create_url)\" />\r\n    \r\n        <xsl:copy-of select=\"$shopping_cart\" />\r\n    \r\n    </xsl:template>  \r\n\r\nAs an aside, this part is pushing the concept of a REST web service a bit: In the REST philosophy, requests using the GET method (which is what `document()` uses) should only return existing resources and not create new resources or cause modifications to happen.  Instead, these sorts of actions should use a POST request.  But, since we've already accepted a few rough edges and workarounds in this project so far, we won't let a point of esoterica like that stop us.  (That and, well, this is the way Amazon designed their web service, so we'll take what we can get.)\r\n\r\nOnce you run this iteration of the stylesheet ([wishes-ex4.xsl][wishes_ex4]), you should get something like this XML as output:\r\n\r\n    <ShoppingCartResponse ...>\r\n      ...\r\n      <ShoppingCart>\r\n       <CartId>...</CartId>\r\n       <HMAC>...</HMAC>\r\n       <PurchaseUrl>...</PurchaseUrl>\r\n       <Items>\r\n        <Item>...</item>\r\n        <Item>...</item>\r\n       </Items>\r\n      </ShoppingCart>\r\n      ...\r\n    </ShoppingCartResponse>\r\n\r\nThe AWS documentation describes the vital elements here like so:\r\n\r\n* `CartId` - The Cart ID is the unique identifier for a given shopping cart.\r\n* `HMAC` - The HMAC is a security token that must be passed back to Amazon Web Services for using an existing cart.\r\n* `PurchaseUrl` - Use the purchase URL to transfer the remote shopping cart from your application to Amazon so that your application's users may complete their purchases.&#160; The purchase URL merges the remote shopping cart with the Amazon.com shopping cart. \r\n\r\nSo, in short, whenever we want to do any sort of manipulation on this Remote Shopping Cart via AWS, we'll need to remember and later supply both the `CartId` and `HMAC` found in the XML returned at its creation.  And, once we're all ready to check out, the `PurchaseUrl` points to where we'll need to browse in person.\r\n\r\n### Stay Tuned!\r\n\r\nThis concludes Part 2 of the Wish-of-the-Month Club.

I&apos;d meant to post it within a week of the first part, so apologies all around to anyone who has been tapping a foot waiting for it.  Enjoy!</i></p>\n<h3 id=\"paging-through-wishes\">Paging Through Wishes</h3>\n<p>Some ready-made files are available for this section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex2.xsl\"><code>wishes-ex2.xsl</code></a>: The second iteration of the stylesheet in development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now we&apos;ve got a way to make queries against Amazon Web Services, not entirely unlike what you might be used to if you tinker with MySQL databases on a regular basis.  At this point, though, we still have a bit of refining to make to this query.  If you take a look at the data produced by the query in its current state, and compare that to what you see on wishlists in your browser, you should notice some things missing.</p>\n<p>If you look at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/1QWYI6P2JF3Q5\" title=\"Buy me something, will ya?\">my wishlist</a>, you&apos;ll notice that items span several pages when visited by browser.  As it turns out, AWS queries work in a similar fashion--each query returns only a limited number of items (about 10), and an additional parameter supplied to further queries is required to step through further pages of results.  So, using what we&apos;ve built so far will only get us to the first page of wishlist items; to get all of the items, we&apos;ll need a way to step through all of the pages.</p>\n<p>In playing with this, I experienced a bit of hairpulling frustration:  The AWS documentation, under &quot;Generating Additional Product Results&quot;, claims that XML returned by the service will supply a count of the total pages available for a given query.  And although I see this element present in other types of searches, the <code>TotalPages</code> element is absent when querying on wishlists.  This may be a bug, or it may be an undocumented change in the service--either way, it was a surprise and leaves me with no official way to know how many pages I need to ask for in order to have a complete set of data.  </p>\n<p>With some further tinkering, though, I figured out a workaround: If a query is made for a page number beyond the final page, the XML returned will be a duplicate of the final page.  Once I see a duplicate item appear, I know it&apos;s time to stop paging through results.  This is completely undocumented behavior, and could break at any time (ie. if Amazon decided to start issuing an error for a page index out of bounds), but it&apos;ll work for now.</p>\n<p>This calls for reworking the <code>processWishlist</code> template.  For a given wishlist, it will need to iterate through a sequence of page numbers, requesting XML from AWS for each, stopping when the first duplicate page is found.  Since XSLT is heavily steeped in functional programming concepts, this sort of <a href=\"http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/N4806.html\" title=\"Iteration in XSLT\">iteration in XSLT</a> is best done <a href=\"http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-xslrecur/\" title=\"Use recursion effectively in XSL\">with recursion</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>  &lt;xsl:template name=&quot;processWishlist&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;wishlist&quot; /&gt;              &lt;!-- Wishlist ID --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;max&quot;   select=&quot;50&quot; /&gt;     &lt;!-- Arbitrary upper loop limit --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;curr_page&quot; select=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;  &lt;!-- Curr page # --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;prev_first_asin&quot; /&gt;       &lt;!-- Keeping track of repeats --&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The first modification to this template is the addition of three parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>max</code> provides an arbitrary upper limit to the number of pages through which this template will iterate.</li>\n<li><code>curr_page</code> contains the number of the page to be requested in this iteration.</li>\n<li><code>prev_first_asin</code> will contain the ASIN number of the first item from the previous iteration&apos;s page of results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, we modify the URL used to query for wishlist data:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;!-- Fetch the wishlist products --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;details&quot; select=&quot;document(concat(\n                  &apos;http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?&apos;,\n                  &apos;t=&apos;,$associate,&apos;&amp;amp;&apos;,\n                  &apos;dev-t=&apos;,$devtoken,&apos;&amp;amp;&apos;,\n                  &apos;WishlistSearch=&apos;,$wishlist,&apos;&amp;amp;&apos;,\n                  &apos;type=lite&amp;amp;f=xml&amp;amp;&apos;,\n                  &apos;page=&apos;,$curr_page))//Details&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The only addition here beyond the previous version is the <code>page</code> parameter in the URL.  Not much mystery here--this parameter specifies which page of results we want.  Now, let&apos;s build the loop:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;!-- Snag the first item Asin --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;curr_first_asin&quot; select=&quot;$details/Asin/text()&quot; /&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- If we haven&apos;t exceeded the loop limit, and this first Asin isn&apos;t --&gt;\n    &lt;!-- a repeat of the previous loop (indicating we&apos;ve run out of new   --&gt;\n    &lt;!-- pages), then go ahead...                                         --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:if test=&quot;(($curr_page+1) &amp;lt; $max) and\n                  (string-length($curr_first_asin) &amp;gt; 0) and\n                  not($curr_first_asin = $prev_first_asin)&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>We capture the ASIN of the first item in this page of results and check to see if we should continue.  This <code>if</code> conditional first ensures that we&apos;re not past the sanity guard for loop iterations, makes sure that we actually got a non-empty current first ASIN, then checks our current first product&apos;s ASIN against what was passed in as the previous iteration&apos;s first product&apos;s ASIN.  If this was the first time through the loop, this value should be empty and therefore wouldn&apos;t match the current ASIN.  But, if we&apos;ve gone past the end of results, the previous and current ASIN values should match, and the conditional will fail.</p>\n<p>Moving along into the body of the conditional, we copy in wishlist products filtered on a price maximum, just as before:</p>\n<pre><code>      &lt;!-- Copy products, filtering on a maximum price --&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;$details/OurPrice[number(substring(\n                   text(),2)) &amp;lt; $maxprice]/..&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Having done that, we move onto the recursive end of this template:</p>\n<pre><code>      &lt;!-- Loop by recursion to get the next page --&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;processWishlist&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;wishlist&quot;        select=&quot;$wishlist&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;max&quot;             select=&quot;$max&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;curr_page&quot;       select=&quot;$curr_page + 1&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;prev_first_asin&quot; select=&quot;$curr_first_asin&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;\n\n    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;    \n  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Here, the template makes a recursive call back to itself, passing through the wishlist ID and the maximum iteration count.  Since variables in XSLT are immutable, meaning that their values can&apos;t be changed once they&apos;ve been set, we can&apos;t increment <code>$curr_page</code> in-place like a loop counter in other languages--so, the current page count <em>value</em> is incremented and passed to the recursive call as a parameter.  Finally, the current first item&apos;s ASIN is passed along, to become the previous ASIN for the next iteration.</p>\n<p>Note that when the conditional fails--that is, if the loop limit is passed or a duplicate page is detected--the loop ends.  In other words, nothing further happens and execution pops back up out of all the levels of recursion and the top-level template ends.  </p>\n<p>I wrote &quot;<em>when</em> the conditional fails&quot;.  This is a key point: for the loop to eventually end, this conditional <em>must</em> fail (or be made to fail) at some point, else this loop will happily progress through page requests forever.  This is the reason for the <code>$max</code> parameter limiting the number of iterations, in case something goes haywire--like, oh say, a failure of our duplicate-page detection hack as a loop ending condition.  A useful exercise for the reader might be to add some additional diagnostic code to report that the limit was hit versus a natural end to results.</p>\n<h3 id=\"random-numbers\">Random Numbers</h3>\n<p>Some ready-made files are available for this section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex3.xsl\"><code>wishes-ex3.xsl</code></a>: The third iteration of the stylesheet in development.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/random-xml\"><code>random-xml</code></a>: A Perl CGI script used as a web service to generate random numbers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Armed with a template that will query against the full set of items in a wishlist, we&apos;re ready to look into making a random selection from a list of products.  </p>\n<p>But first, we need to pick a random number.  Unfortunately, there doesn&apos;t appear to be any <code>random()</code> function in the XPath or XSLT standards.  There <em>is</em> a <a href=\"http://www.exslt.org/math/functions/random/index.html\"><code>math:random()</code></a> from EXSLT implemented in <code>libxslt</code>, but I seem to be having a bit of a problem getting it to produce anything other than the same sequence of numbers.  I suspect there&apos;s a problem in seeding the random number generator, but I&apos;ve yet to work out how to fix it.  (Suggestions welcome.)</p>\n<p>So, I cheated and made another workaround with a CGI script on my web server that generates random numbers in a simple XML document.  Currently, it&apos;s hosted here:</p>\n<pre><code>http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/random-xml</code></pre>\n<p>And this is what the script looks like:</p>\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl\n\nuse strict;\nuse CGI;\n\nmy $q = new CGI();\n\nmy $min = $q-&gt;param(&apos;min&apos;) or 0;\nmy $max = $q-&gt;param(&apos;max&apos;) or 1;\nmy $int = $q-&gt;param(&apos;int&apos;);\n\nmy $num = $min + ( rand() * ($max - $min));\nif ($int) { $num = int($num); }\n\nprint $q-&gt;header(&apos;text/xml&apos;);\nprint &quot;&lt;rand&gt;$num&lt;/rand&gt;\\n&quot;;</code></pre>\n<p>This is a very simple CGI.  It accepts the parameters <code>max</code>, <code>min</code>, and <code>int</code>.  The values of these parameters determine the maximum and minimum value for the random number returned, and whether or not it should be an integer.  For example, the <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/random-xml?int=1&amp;min=10&amp;max=20\" title=\"A random integer between 10 and 20, in XML\">following URL</a> should return an integer between 10 and 20:</p>\n<pre><code>http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/random-xml?\nint=1&amp;#38;min=10&amp;#38;max=20</code></pre>\n<p>Using this as a web service in the stylesheet with the <code>document()</code> function, we can get a random number.  If you&apos;ve got web space where you can host CGI scripts, I suggest you host a copy of this script yourself, since I can&apos;t guarantee how long mine will stick around.  But, for as long at works, feel free to use the service from my server.</p>\n<p>Moving along, let&apos;s add a new named template to the stylesheet, called <code>randomWishlistProduct</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>  &lt;xsl:template name=&quot;randomWishlistProduct&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;wishlist&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- Wishlist ID --&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Gather all the products for the current wishlist --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;products&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;processWishlist&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;wishlist&quot; select=&quot;$wishlist&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Just like the <code>processWishlist</code> template, we start by defining the parameter <code>wishlist</code> to accept a wishlist ID.  Using this ID, we call the <code>processWishlist</code> template itself and store the complete list of products queried from the wishlist into the variable <code>$products</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;!-- Count the products in the wishlist --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;max_products&quot;\n                  select=&quot;count(exsl:node-set($products)/Details)&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>This next step counts the number of products found in the wishlist.  The one tricky bit here is the use of the EXSLT function <a href=\"http://www.exslt.org/exsl/functions/node-set/index.html\"><code>exsl:node-set()</code></a>: The <code>$products</code> variable contains what&apos;s called a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#section-Result-Tree-Fragments\"><em>result tree fragment</em></a>, which is a kind of cross between XML data nodes and a plain old string.  This type of data does not normally allow the full set of XPath operators to be used on it, so first we need to use <code>exsl:node-set()</code> to turn it into a full-fledged node set.  Then we can look up the <code>Details</code> element nodes and count them.  </p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;!-- Conjure up a random index within the list of products --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;rand_product_num&quot;\n                  select=&quot;document(concat(\n                  &apos;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/random-xml?&apos;,\n                  &apos;int=1&amp;amp;&apos;,\n                  &apos;min=1&amp;amp;&apos;,\n                  &apos;max=&apos;,$max_products))/rand&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Here is where the random number service comes in handy.  The <code>concat()</code> function is used to build the URL to the service, with parameters specifying that the number should be an integer, and should fall between 1 and the number of products in the wishlist.  The <code>document()</code> function grabs the XML document from the service, and the value is extracted from the single element the document contains.</p>\n<p>There is an alternative to this last bit, should you happen to have a properly working <code>math:random()</code> function in your XSLT processor:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;rand_product_num&quot; select=&quot;round( math:random() *\n                  $max_products ) + 1&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>If you can use this instead, you&apos;ll have no need for the random number web service.  This version is obviously more concise, and doesn&apos;t require another trip out to a web service.  You might want to try it--but if you find that you keep getting the same wishlist items selected, then you&apos;ve run into the problem I found with the random number generator.</p>\n<p>Now, let&apos;s wrap this template up by selecting an item:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;!-- Copy the product as indexed by the random number --&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;exsl:node-set($products)/Details[\n                 position()=$rand_product_num]&quot; /&gt;\n\n  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Again, we need to use the <code>exsl:node-set()</code> function to turn the result tree fragment in the <code>$products</code> variable into a node set, from which we select and copy the <code>Details</code> element whose position in the data is indexed by the random number we just selected.  Just one last tweak needed to wrap up this iteration of our stylesheet.  We need to swap out the call to the <code>processWishlist</code> function at the end and replace it with a call to <code>randomWishlistProduct</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>  &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/wishes:wishes&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;//wishes:wishlist&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;wishes:wishitem&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;randomWishlistProduct&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;wishlist&quot; select=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;\n      &lt;/wishes:wishitem&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n\n  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>After these changes, you should be able to run the stylesheet ([wishes-ex3.xsl][wishes_ex3]) and get something like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;wishes:wishitem xmlns:wishes=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;wishes:wishlist label=&quot;The Girl&quot;&gt;35OIOYWQ9XQAE&lt;/wishes:wishlist&gt;\n    &lt;Details ...&gt;...&lt;/Details&gt;\n&lt;/wishes:wishitem&gt;\n&lt;wishes:wishitem xmlns:wishes=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;wishes:wishlist label=&quot;Me&quot;&gt;1QWYI6P2JF3Q5&lt;/wishes:wishlist&gt;\n    &lt;Details ...&gt;...&lt;/Details&gt;\n&lt;/wishes:wishitem&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>This is similar to the output of the previous iteration of the stylesheet, but this time there&apos;s only one product selected at random for each wishlist.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"shopping-carts\">Shopping Carts</h3>\n<p>Some ready-made files are available for this section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex4.xsl\"><code>wishes-ex4.xsl</code></a>: The fourth iteration of the stylesheet in development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By this point, we&apos;ve been able to query and filter products in Amazon wishlists, and we&apos;ve selected an item at random from each wishlist we&apos;ve queried.  Now, let&apos;s enable some purchases.</p>\n<p>The AWS provides for Remote Shopping Cart functionality, whereby items can be added to an Amazon.com shopping cart programmatically.  This is about as close as we can get to automating the purchase of items selected from the wishlists--there is no API functionality for actually completing the ordering of items.  If you really think about it, this really is a good thing and <em>should</em> demand human intervention; we certainly wouldn&apos;t want this script going crazy and accidentally buying up everything on a wishlist.</p>\n<p>Documentation for the AWS Remote Shopping Cart explains that a shopping cart can be created and items added with a URL like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?\nShoppingCart=add&amp;#38;\nf=xml&amp;#38;\ndev-t=[Developer Token goes here]&amp;#38;\nt=[Associates ID goes here]&amp;#38;\nAsin.[ASIN goes here]=[quantity goes here]&amp;#38;\nsims=true</code></pre>\n<p>Part of this should look familiar, so we already know what to do with the developer token and the associates ID.  The last part, specifying product ASIN and quantity, can be filled out with information contained in the product records selected at random from the wishlists.  </p>\n<p>So, let&apos;s start by revising the template at the end of the stylesheet:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/wishes:wishes&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;random_products&quot;&gt;      \n      &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;//wishes:wishlist&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;wishes:wishitem&gt;\n          &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;\n          &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;randomWishlistProduct&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;wishlist&quot; select=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;\n          &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;\n        &lt;/wishes:wishitem&gt;\n      &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we&apos;ve taken what was the output of the previous iteration of the stylesheet and stuffed it into the variable <code>$random_products</code>.  Next, let&apos;s fill in the blanks and build a Remote Shopping Cart URL:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;shopping_cart_create_url&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;!-- Standard AWS URL --&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:text&gt;http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n\n      &lt;!-- Add in the selected items --&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;exsl:node-set($random_products)\n                            /wishes:wishitem/Details&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:text&gt;Asin.&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Asin&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:text&gt;=1&amp;amp;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n      &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n\n      &lt;!-- Wrap up with the shopping cart function and required tokens --&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:text&gt;ShoppingCart=add&amp;amp;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:text&gt;f=xml&amp;amp;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:text&gt;dev-t=&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$devtoken&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:text&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:text&gt;t=&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$associate&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Since simple XPath doesn&apos;t allow for the looping needed for multiple items, we can&apos;t just concatenate this URL together in a <code>select</code> expression like we did with the wishlist item query.  So, we use <code>xslt:foreach</code> to build this with blocks of text using the <code>xsl:text</code> element.  We iterate though the random products chosen from wishlists and add an ASIN for each to the URL with a quantity of 1. Then, we use the <code>$devtoken</code> and <code>$associate</code> variables to fill in their respective spots.</p>\n<p>Note that this could have been written without using the <code>xsl:text</code> elements like so:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;shopping_cart_create_url&quot;&gt;http://xml.amazon.\n    com/onca/xml3?ShoppingCart=add&amp;amp;f=xml&amp;amp;dev-t=&lt;xsl:value-of \n    select=&quot;$devtoken&quot; /&gt;&amp;amp;t=&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$associate&quot; /&gt;\n    &amp;amp;&lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;exsl:node-set($random_products)/\n    wishes:wishitem/Details&quot;&gt;Asin.&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;Asin&quot; /&gt;=1\n    &amp;amp;&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;&lt;/xsl:variable&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>This removes the clutter of all the <code>xsl:text</code> elements, but it would need to be piled all on one line in order to keep undesired whitespace from getting into the URL.  I made a small attempt at wrapping this line here, but line breaks and spaces would leave us with a non-functioning shopping cart URL.  It&apos;s up to you to decide which to use--personally, I prefer the <code>xsl:text</code> clutter for the ability to add in comments and clarify things a bit.</p>\n<p>Finally, having built the shopping cart URL, let&apos;s use it to get a shopping cart and wrap things up:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;shopping_cart&quot;\n                  select=&quot;document($shopping_cart_create_url)&quot; /&gt;\n\n    &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;$shopping_cart&quot; /&gt;\n\n&lt;/xsl:template&gt;  </code></pre>\n<p>As an aside, this part is pushing the concept of a REST web service a bit: In the REST philosophy, requests using the GET method (which is what <code>document()</code> uses) should only return existing resources and not create new resources or cause modifications to happen.  Instead, these sorts of actions should use a POST request.  But, since we&apos;ve already accepted a few rough edges and workarounds in this project so far, we won&apos;t let a point of esoterica like that stop us.  (That and, well, this is the way Amazon designed their web service, so we&apos;ll take what we can get.)</p>\n<p>Once you run this iteration of the stylesheet ([wishes-ex4.xsl][wishes_ex4]), you should get something like this XML as output:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;ShoppingCartResponse ...&gt;\n  ...\n  &lt;ShoppingCart&gt;\n   &lt;CartId&gt;...&lt;/CartId&gt;\n   &lt;HMAC&gt;...&lt;/HMAC&gt;\n   &lt;PurchaseUrl&gt;...&lt;/PurchaseUrl&gt;\n   &lt;Items&gt;\n    &lt;Item&gt;...&lt;/item&gt;\n    &lt;Item&gt;...&lt;/item&gt;\n   &lt;/Items&gt;\n  &lt;/ShoppingCart&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/ShoppingCartResponse&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The AWS documentation describes the vital elements here like so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>CartId</code> - The Cart ID is the unique identifier for a given shopping cart.</li>\n<li><code>HMAC</code> - The HMAC is a security token that must be passed back to Amazon Web Services for using an existing cart.</li>\n<li><code>PurchaseUrl</code> - Use the purchase URL to transfer the remote shopping cart from your application to Amazon so that your application&apos;s users may complete their purchases.&#xA0; The purchase URL merges the remote shopping cart with the Amazon.com shopping cart. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, in short, whenever we want to do any sort of manipulation on this Remote Shopping Cart via AWS, we&apos;ll need to remember and later supply both the <code>CartId</code> and <code>HMAC</code> found in the XML returned at its creation.  And, once we&apos;re all ready to check out, the <code>PurchaseUrl</code> points to where we&apos;ll need to browse in person.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stay-tuned\">Stay Tuned!</h3>\n<p>This concludes Part 2 of the Wish-of-the-Month Club.  Following this will be the final part, where we tie everything together and start firing off monthly emails!</p>\n<!-- links -->\n\n"

Well, I&#39;ve been hard at work since then to turn out the first set and I think I&#39;ve finally got something for you.  I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/13/i_will_do_the_fandango\">mentioned</a> earlier this week that I was taking this seriously, so I hope it shows.  So, with many thanks to <a href=\"http://missadroit.livejournal.com\" title=\"Miss Adroit, my favorite girl in the world\">my girlfriend&#39;s</a> kind editorial help, and with some measure of anxiety, here goes...</i></p>\n<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n<p>For some time now, my girlfriend and I have been accumulating things we want in wishlists on Amazon.com.  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/1QWYI6P2JF3Q5\">Here&#39;s mine</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/35OIOYWQ9XQAE\">here&#39;s hers</a> - if you visit them, you can see we&#39;ve both got quite a few things listed.  Though they have come in handy with relatives at Christmas and on birthdays, neither of us really expects to see a regular flow of gifts from them.  For the most part, they&#39;ve just become holding tanks for things we intend to buy for each other or ourselves.  </p>\n<p>However, I tend to forget we have these lists except for occasional visit to Amazon when I think, &quot;Oh yeah, wishlists.  I should pick up a thing or two, there&#39;s some good stuff piled up in them.&quot;  On one particular visit, though, the notion of a Wish-of-the-Month club popped into my head: We could afford to grab at least one item for each of us from our wishlists on a monthly basis, provided that we remembered to place an order.  It&#39;d be better than signing up for a book or music club, driven by someone else&#39;s idea of what we wanted.  Unfortunately, there&#39;s that problem for busy, absentminded, and people like us: remembering to place an order.</p>\n<p>But wait, isn&#39;t this the sort of thing computers are for?  I should be able to cobble something together that would peruse our wishlists and--given some criteria like a price maximum--select an item at random for each of us and send them on their way.  With this, I could schedule a monthly run and start whittling down those lists.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gathering-tools\">Gathering Tools</h3>\n<p>Before I start working through the project itself, let&#39;s establish some assumptions and then gather some tools and materials:</p>\n<p>I&#39;m going to assume that you&#39;re using a UN*X operating system (ie. Linux, Mac OS X, etc.) and that you&#39;re reasonably familiar with getting around in a shell and editing files.  Things presented here could be adapted for Windows fairly easily, but I&#39;ll leave that as an exercise to the reader.  Also, you may need to build and install a package or two, so know-how in that regard will serve as well.  And finally: some familiarity with XML and XSLT would be useful, but you won&#39;t need to be a guru with either.</p>\n<p>Oh, and all the files I&#39;ll be introducing in this project can be downloaded from my website as a tarball:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/hacks/wishes/wishes.tar.gz?tarball=1\" title=\"All Wish-of-the-Month Club files wrapped up in a tarball\"><code>wishes.tar.gz</code></a>.  If you feel like browsing, you can see these files in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/hacks/wishes/\">CVS repository</a>.  And if you feel like checking out a copy via anonymous CVS, the username is <code>anoncvs</code> and the password is blank--email me for help, if you need it.</p>\n<p>So, how do we get a look at these wishlists?  Lately, I&#39;ve been tinkering a bit with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XslScraper\" title=\"Scrape RSS and Atom from HTML using Tidy and XSLT\">scraping information from</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596005776/0xdecafbad-20\" title=\"O&#39;Reilly&#39;s Spidering Hacks\">automating access to</a> websites.  It&#39;s a bit like a puzzle game, with all the accompanying frustrations and happy breakthroughs.  However, where most puzzle games are designed with a solution in mind, this game isn&#39;t even necessarily meant to be played depending on the intentions of website owners.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the folks at Amazon.com have made things very friendly to tinkerers by providing an API, called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/landing.html\" title=\"Amazon Web Services\">Amazon Web Services</a> (or AWS).  You&#39;ll want to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_2/002-7899886-3676027?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#38;node=3434641&#38;no=3435361&#38;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA\">download</a> the AWS developer&#39;s kit, which contains a wealth of documentation and examples.  After downloading these materials, you should <a href=\"https://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/join/developer/application.html\">apply for a developer&#39;s token</a> for use with the service.  AWS provides both SOAP and REST interfaces to functionality and data at their site; personally, I prefer the HTTP-and-XML approach taken by the REST interface, so that&#39;s what we&#39;ll be using here. </p>\n<p>To handle the XML produced by AWS, we&#39;ll be using the <code>xsltproc</code> command from <a href=\"http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT.html\">the XML C parser and toolkit of Gnome</a>.  There are other XSLT processors--such as <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/\">Xalan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gingerall.com/charlie/ga/xml/p_sab.xml\">Sablotron</a>, and <a href=\"http://saxon.sourceforge.net/\">Saxon</a>--but I&#39;ve found <a href=\"http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT.html\">libxslt</a> easiest to feed and care for on the various platforms with which I tinker.  It also seems to support a very large swath of <a href=\"http://www.exslt.org/\">EXSLT extensions</a>, all of which come in very handy, yet seem to receive uneven support in other XSLT processors.  We&#39;ll be pulling a trick or two out of that bag, so its support is key.</p>\n<p>You may or may not already have <a href=\"http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT.html\">libsxlt</a> installed.  Depending on your variant of Linux, it might be as simple as a single package-management command or it might be a bit more complex if you need to compile from source.  For Mac OS X, I recommend using <a href=\"http://fink.sourceforge.net\">Fink</a> for your packaging needs.  Although, <a href=\"http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/\">DarwinPorts</a> is nice as well, if you&#39;re used to The BSD Way.</p>\n<p>A bonus for OS X users: Marc Liyanage has provided a great Open Source tool named <a href=\"http://www.entropy.ch:16080/software/macosx/#testxslt\">TestXSLT</a> that embeds <a href=\"http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT.html\">libxslt</a>, among other XSLT processors, in a slick GUI for easier use.  This might come in handy for you as things develop.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wishlists-in-xml\">Wishlists in XML</h3>\n<p>Okay, we&#39;ve got a working environment, a head start on accessing Amazon wishlists as XML, and a way to manipulate that XML using <code>xsltproc</code>.  Let&#39;s start playing.  First things first, we need to gain access to Amazon wishlists in XML form.  Reading through the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_2/002-7899886-3676027?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#38;node=3434641&#38;no=3435361&#38;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA\">AWS documentation</a> reveals that wish list searches are available via a URL constructed like so:</p>\n<pre><code>http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?\nt=[Associates ID goes here]&amp;#38;\ndev-t=[Developer Token goes here]&amp;#38;\nWishlistSearch=[wishlist ID goes here]&amp;#38;\ntype=[lite or heavy]&amp;#38;\nf=xml</code></pre>\n<p>I received an ID of <code>0xdecafbad-20</code> when I <a href=\"http://associates.amazon.com\">signed up to be an associate</a> a few years ago.  This will ensure that I get credited for sales made via the API--which isn&#39;t as important for the present project, since I&#39;ll be buying items myself, but it&#39;ll come in handy in later projects.  Also, when I <a href=\"https://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/join/developer/application.html\">signed up for a developer&#39;s token</a>, this is what I was given: <code>D8HVH869XA0NP</code>  I&#39;m disclosing my own here for the sake of example, but you should <a href=\"https://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/join/developer/application.html\">sign up</a> and get your own.</p>\n<p>So, that fills in the first two parts of the URL.  For the purposes of this project, let&#39;s just go with the <code>lite</code> option for type.  As for the wishlist ID, let&#39;s take a look the wishlist URLs to which I linked earlier:</p>\n<pre><code>http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/35OIOYWQ9XQAE\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/1QWYI6P2JF3Q5</code></pre>\n<p>You can discover these wishlist URLs using <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/search.html/002-7899886-3676027?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#38;type=wishlist\">Amazon&#39;s Wish List Search</a> feature, in which case a wishlist URL might appear like so:</p>\n<pre><code>http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/\n002-7899886-3676027?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;#38;\nid=35OIOYWQ9XQAE</code></pre>\n<p>In either case, there is a 13-character ID in each variety of wish list URL: this string is the wish list ID.  So, the ID for my girlfriend&#39;s wishlist is <code> 35OIOYWQ9XQAE</code> and mine is <code>1QWYI6P2JF3Q5</code>.  Given this piece of the puzzle, we can fill in the blanks to come up with the following URL for my girlfriend&#39;s wish list:</p>\n<pre><code>http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?\nt=0xdecafbad-20&amp;#38;\ndev-t=D8HVH869XA0NP&amp;#38;\ntype=lite&amp;#38;\nWishlistSearch=35OIOYWQ9XQAE&amp;#38;\nf=xml</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?t=0xdecafbad-20&#38;dev-t=D8HVH869XA0NP&#38;type=lite&#38;WishlistSearch=35OIOYWQ9XQAE&#38;f=xml\">Check out the XML resulting from this URL</a>--you may want to use a tool such as <code>curl</code> or <code>wget</code> instead of viewing this directly in your browser.  You&#39;ll see some XML that looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;ProductInfo&gt;\n...\n&lt;Details url=&quot;(some long URL)&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;Asin&gt;0262133601&lt;/Asin&gt;\n  &lt;ProductName&gt;Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing&lt;/ProductName&gt;\n  &lt;Catalog&gt;Book&lt;/Catalog&gt;\n  &lt;Authors&gt;\n     &lt;Author&gt;Christopher D. Manning&lt;/Author&gt;\n     &lt;Author&gt;Hinrich Sch&amp;#252;tze&lt;/Author&gt;\n  &lt;/Authors&gt;\n  &lt;ReleaseDate&gt;18 June, 1999&lt;/ReleaseDate&gt;\n  &lt;Manufacturer&gt;MIT Press&lt;/Manufacturer&gt;\n  &lt;ImageUrlSmall&gt;(another long url)&lt;/ImageUrlSmall&gt;\n  &lt;ImageUrlMedium&gt;(yet another long url)&lt;/ImageUrlMedium&gt;\n  &lt;ImageUrlLarge&gt;(one last long url)&lt;/ImageUrlLarge&gt;\n  &lt;Availability&gt;Usually ships within 24 hours&lt;/Availability&gt;\n  &lt;ListPrice&gt;$75.00&lt;/ListPrice&gt;\n  &lt;OurPrice&gt;$63.75&lt;/OurPrice&gt;\n  &lt;UsedPrice&gt;$49.99&lt;/UsedPrice&gt;\n&lt;/Details&gt;\n...\n&lt;/ProductInfo&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262133601/0xdecafbad-20?dev-t=D8HVH869XA0NP%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2\">long URL</a> in the <code>Detail</code> element&#39;s <code>url</code> attribute links to the human-viewable product detail page at Amazon.  I&#39;ve also left a few other things out, such as the URLs to product images; I just thought I&#39;d edit it a bit to be friendlier to your browser at home.  There&#39;s a <a href=\"http://xml.amazon.com/schemas3/dev-lite.xsd\">schema</a> for this XML data, and the ins-and-outs are explained in the AWS documentation under &quot;Amazon Web Services Data Model&quot;.</p>\n<h3 id=\"querying-the-wishes\">Querying The Wishes</h3>\n<p>Some ready-made files are available for this section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex1.xsl\"><code>wishes-ex1.xsl</code></a>: The first iteration of the stylesheet in development.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes.xml\"><code>wishes.xml</code></a>: An XML document used as input with the stylesheet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that we&#39;ve got some XML from Amazon to play with, let&#39;s start tinkering with an XSLT stylesheet to process it.  In the interests of flexibility and reusability, we can parameterize a few things in XML before starting in on the stylesheet:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;wishes xmlns=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;maxprice&gt;15.00&lt;/maxprice&gt;\n  &lt;associate&gt;0xdecafbad-20&lt;/associate&gt;\n  &lt;devtoken&gt;D8HVH869XA0NP&lt;/devtoken&gt;\n  &lt;email&gt;deus_x@pobox.com&lt;/email&gt;\n  &lt;wishlists&gt;\n    &lt;wishlist label=&quot;The Girl&quot;&gt;35OIOYWQ9XQAE&lt;/wishlist&gt;\n    &lt;wishlist label=&quot;Me&quot;&gt;1QWYI6P2JF3Q5&lt;/wishlist&gt;\n  &lt;/wishlists&gt;\n&lt;/wishes&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Hopefully, the data here is fairly self-explanatory:  I&#39;ve established a maximum price for item selection; provided my associate ID and developer token; there&#39;s an email address to which I eventually want to send the results of all this work; and I&#39;ve made a list of wishlist IDs, each with a readable label. Given this, let&#39;s start out simple and  use this to get some data from Amazon:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot;\n            xmlns:wishes=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;\n            xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:output indent=&quot;yes&quot; /&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- Grab our global settings --&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;maxprice&quot;  select=&quot;/wishes:wishes/wishes:maxprice&quot; /&gt;  \n  &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;associate&quot; select=&quot;/wishes:wishes/wishes:associate&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;devtoken&quot;  select=&quot;/wishes:wishes/wishes:devtoken&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>So far so good--things start off by pulling in some of the parameters into variables.  Next, let&#39;s dig into actually querying wishlist data with a reusable template:</p>\n<pre><code>  &lt;xsl:template name=&quot;processWishlist&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;wishlist&quot; /&gt;\n\n    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;details&quot; select=&quot;document(concat(\n        &#39;http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?&#39;,\n        &#39;t=&#39;,$associate,&#39;&amp;amp;&#39;,\n        &#39;dev-t=&#39;,$devtoken,&#39;&amp;amp;&#39;,\n        &#39;WishlistSearch=&#39;,$wishlist,&#39;&amp;amp;&#39;,\n        &#39;type=lite&amp;amp;f=xml&#39;))//Details&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>First thing into this template, we accept a parameter named <code>wishlist</code> which is expected to contain a wishlist ID string.  Next, we build an AWS URL by concatenating together the pieces we have in variables (associate ID, developer&#39;s token, and wishlist ID) using the XPath function <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xquery-operators-20020816/#func-concat\"><code>concat()</code></a>.  Once we have this URL, we use the function <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xquery-operators-20020816/#func-document\"><code>document()</code></a> to make a request and fetch the XML data for that URL.  From this, we select all the <code>Details</code> elements.  </p>\n<p>Then with that data, we can do some filtering on the price and availability.  We want to make sure that not only will we select items that are within our budget, but that they are available to buy in the first place:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;$details[\n      number(substring(OurPrice/text(),2)) &amp;lt; $maxprice\n      and\n      contains(Availability, &#39;Usually ships within&#39;)\n      ]&quot; /&gt;\n\n  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>This code is just a little bit funky, since the price data given by Amazon contains a dollar sign, and we want to make a numerical comparison.  So, we chop the dollar sign off and convert to a number before making the comparison.  Also, there&#39;s an assumption here about what will show up in the <code>Availability</code> element: &quot;Usually ships within&quot;  Other things that might show up will declare that the item is out of stock, discontinued, or otherwise not shipping.  This might need some tweaking someday, but it seems to work for now.</p>\n<p>Taken all together, this template has the effect of a SQL SELECT statement somewhat like this:</p>\n<pre><code>SELECT * \nFROM Amazon.WishlistItems \nWHERE WishlistID = $wishlist AND \n      OurPrice &lt; $maxprice AND\n      Availability like &#39;%Usually ships within%&#39;;</code></pre>\n<p><code>document()</code> is a very useful XPath function.  It allows us to pull in XML from external files and, in our case, from external URLs via HTTP requests.  This gives us the ability to make queries against REST web services like AWS--which, among many other reasons, is why I prefer REST web services over SOAP.  (I don&#39;t even want to think about trying to access a SOAP service from XSLT.)</p>\n<p>Now, let&#39;s wrap up this first iteration of the stylesheet by trying out the query template on each of the wishlist IDs:</p>\n<pre><code>  &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/wishes:wishes&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;//wishes:wishlist&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;wishes:wishitem&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;processWishlist&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;wishlist&quot; \n                              select=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;\n      &lt;/wishes:wishitem&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;\n\n&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>You can get a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex1.xsl\">completed version of this stylesheet</a>, along with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes.xml\">the input XML</a>, in case you haven&#39;t been cutting and pasting together a copy of your own along the way.  Try it out in a shell with:</p>\n<pre><code>$ xsltproc wishes_ex1.xsl wishes.xml</code></pre>\n<p>Alternately, you could check it out using <a href=\"http://www.entropy.ch:16080/software/macosx/#testxslt\">TestXSLT</a> under OS X.  You should get something like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;wishes:wishitem xmlns:wishes=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;wishes:wishlist label=&quot;The Girl&quot;&gt;35OIOYWQ9XQAE&lt;/wishes:wishlist&gt;\n    &lt;Details ...&gt;...&lt;/Details&gt;\n    &lt;Details ...&gt;...&lt;/Details&gt;\n    ...\n&lt;/wishes:wishitem&gt;\n&lt;wishes:wishitem xmlns:wishes=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;wishes:wishlist label=&quot;Me&quot;&gt;1QWYI6P2JF3Q5&lt;/wishes:wishlist&gt;\n    &lt;Details ...&gt;...&lt;/Details&gt;\n    &lt;Details ...&gt;...&lt;/Details&gt;\n    ...\n&lt;/wishes:wishitem&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Obviously, this example XML is much abridged, but hopefully you can get the gist:  For each wishlist ID, there is a containing <code>wishitem</code> element.  It contains a copy of the <code>wishlist</code> element from the input XML, followed by all the <code>Details</code> elements filtered and copied from the Amazon XML with the help of the <code>processWishlist</code> template.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thats-all-for-now\">That&#39;s All for Now!</h3>\n<p>And that&#39;s the end of Part 1.

    "body": "<i>Remember that [I wrote a little while ago][lasttime] about wanting to publish some articles here that I'd want to read?  Well, I've been hard at work since then to turn out the first set and I think I've finally got something for you.  I [mentioned][lasttime2] earlier this week that I was taking this seriously, so I hope it shows.  So, with many thanks to [my girlfriend's][missadroit] kind editorial help, and with some measure of anxiety, here goes...</i>\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\r\nFor some time now, my girlfriend and I have been accumulating things we want in wishlists on Amazon.com.  [Here's mine][mywishlist] and [here's hers][herwishlist] - if you visit them, you can see we've both got quite a few things listed.  Though they have come in handy with relatives at Christmas and on birthdays, neither of us really expects to see a regular flow of gifts from them.  For the most part, they've just become holding tanks for things we intend to buy for each other or ourselves.  \r\n\r\nHowever, I tend to forget we have these lists except for occasional visit to Amazon when I think, \"Oh yeah, wishlists.  I should pick up a thing or two, there's some good stuff piled up in them.\"  On one particular visit, though, the notion of a Wish-of-the-Month club popped into my head: We could afford to grab at least one item for each of us from our wishlists on a monthly basis, provided that we remembered to place an order.  It'd be better than signing up for a book or music club, driven by someone else's idea of what we wanted.  Unfortunately, there's that problem for busy, absentminded, and people like us: remembering to place an order.\r\n\r\nBut wait, isn't this the sort of thing computers are for?  I should be able to cobble something together that would peruse our wishlists and--given some criteria like a price maximum--select an item at random for each of us and send them on their way.  With this, I could schedule a monthly run and start whittling down those lists.\r\n\r\n### Gathering Tools\r\n\r\nBefore I start working through the project itself, let's establish some assumptions and then gather some tools and materials:\r\n\r\nI'm going to assume that you're using a UN*X operating system (ie. Linux, Mac OS X, etc.) and that you're reasonably familiar with getting around in a shell and editing files.  Things presented here could be adapted for Windows fairly easily, but I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader.  Also, you may need to build and install a package or two, so know-how in that regard will serve as well.  And finally: some familiarity with XML and XSLT would be useful, but you won't need to be a guru with either.\r\n\r\nOh, and all the files I'll be introducing in this project can be downloaded from my website as a tarball:  [`wishes.tar.gz`][wishes.tar.gz].  If you feel like browsing, you can see these files in my [CVS repository][wishescvs].  And if you feel like checking out a copy via anonymous CVS, the username is `anoncvs` and the password is blank--email me for help, if you need it.\r\n\r\nSo, how do we get a look at these wishlists?  Lately, I've been tinkering a bit with [scraping information from][xslscraper] and [automating access to][spideringhacks] websites.  It's a bit like a puzzle game, with all the accompanying frustrations and happy breakthroughs.  However, where most puzzle games are designed with a solution in mind, this game isn't even necessarily meant to be played depending on the intentions of website owners.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the folks at Amazon.com have made things very friendly to tinkerers by providing an API, called [Amazon Web Services][amazonapi] (or AWS).  You'll want to [download][awsdownload] the AWS developer's kit, which contains a wealth of documentation and examples.  After downloading these materials, you should [apply for a developer's token][awstoken] for use with the service.  AWS provides both SOAP and REST interfaces to functionality and data at their site; personally, I prefer the HTTP-and-XML approach taken by the REST interface, so that's what we'll be using here. \r\n\r\nTo handle the XML produced by AWS, we'll be using the `xsltproc` command from [the XML C parser and toolkit of Gnome][libxslt].  There are other XSLT processors--such as [Xalan][xalan], [Sablotron][sablotron], and [Saxon][saxon]--but I've found [libxslt][libxslt] easiest to feed and care for on the various platforms with which I tinker.  It also seems to support a very large swath of [EXSLT extensions][exslt], all of which come in very handy, yet seem to receive uneven support in other XSLT processors.  We'll be pulling a trick or two out of that bag, so its support is key.\r\n\r\nYou may or may not already have [libsxlt][libxslt] installed.  Depending on your variant of Linux, it might be as simple as a single package-management command or it might be a bit more complex if you need to compile from source.  For Mac OS X, I recommend using [Fink][fink] for your packaging needs.  Although, [DarwinPorts][darwinports] is nice as well, if you're used to The BSD Way.\r\n\r\nA bonus for OS X users: Marc Liyanage has provided a great Open Source tool named [TestXSLT][testxslt] that embeds [libxslt][libxslt], among other XSLT processors, in a slick GUI for easier use.  This might come in handy for you as things develop.\r\n\r\n### Wishlists in XML\r\n\r\nOkay, we've got a working environment, a head start on accessing Amazon wishlists as XML, and a way to manipulate that XML using `xsltproc`.  Let's start playing.  First things first, we need to gain access to Amazon wishlists in XML form.  Reading through the [AWS documentation][awsdownload] reveals that wish list searches are available via a URL constructed like so:\r\n\r\n    http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?\r\n    t=[Associates ID goes here]&#38;\r\n    dev-t=[Developer Token goes here]&#38;\r\n    WishlistSearch=[wishlist ID goes here]&#38;\r\n    type=[lite or heavy]&#38;\r\n    f=xml\r\n\r\nI received an ID of `0xdecafbad-20` when I [signed up to be an associate][amazonassociate] a few years ago.  This will ensure that I get credited for sales made via the API--which isn't as important for the present project, since I'll be buying items myself, but it'll come in handy in later projects.  Also, when I [signed up for a developer's token][awstoken], this is what I was given: `D8HVH869XA0NP`  I'm disclosing my own here for the sake of example, but you should [sign up][awstoken] and get your own.\r\n\r\nSo, that fills in the first two parts of the URL.  For the purposes of this project, let's just go with the `lite` option for type.  As for the wishlist ID, let's take a look the wishlist URLs to which I linked earlier:\r\n\r\n    http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/35OIOYWQ9XQAE\r\n    http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/1QWYI6P2JF3Q5\r\n\r\nYou can discover these wishlist URLs using [Amazon's Wish List Search][wlsearch] feature, in which case a wishlist URL might appear like so:\r\n\r\n    http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/\r\n    002-7899886-3676027?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#38;\r\n    id=35OIOYWQ9XQAE\r\n\r\nIn either case, there is a 13-character ID in each variety of wish list URL: this string is the wish list ID.  So, the ID for my girlfriend's wishlist is ` 35OIOYWQ9XQAE` and mine is `1QWYI6P2JF3Q5`.  Given this piece of the puzzle, we can fill in the blanks to come up with the following URL for my girlfriend's wish list:\r\n\r\n    http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?\r\n    t=0xdecafbad-20&#38;\r\n    dev-t=D8HVH869XA0NP&#38;\r\n    type=lite&#38;\r\n    WishlistSearch=35OIOYWQ9XQAE&#38;\r\n    f=xml\r\n\r\n[Check out the XML resulting from this URL][wlurl]--you may want to use a tool such as `curl` or `wget` instead of viewing this directly in your browser.  You'll see some XML that looks something like this:\r\n\r\n    <ProductInfo>\r\n    ...\r\n    <Details url=\"(some long URL)\">\r\n      <Asin>0262133601</Asin>\r\n      <ProductName>Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing</ProductName>\r\n      <Catalog>Book</Catalog>\r\n      <Authors>\r\n         <Author>Christopher D. Manning</Author>\r\n         <Author>Hinrich Sch&#252;tze</Author>\r\n      </Authors>\r\n      <ReleaseDate>18 June, 1999</ReleaseDate>\r\n      <Manufacturer>MIT Press</Manufacturer>\r\n      <ImageUrlSmall>(another long url)</ImageUrlSmall>\r\n      <ImageUrlMedium>(yet another long url)</ImageUrlMedium>\r\n      <ImageUrlLarge>(one last long url)</ImageUrlLarge>\r\n      <Availability>Usually ships within 24 hours</Availability>\r\n      <ListPrice>$75.00</ListPrice>\r\n      <OurPrice>$63.75</OurPrice>\r\n      <UsedPrice>$49.99</UsedPrice>\r\n    </Details>\r\n    ...\r\n    </ProductInfo>\r\n\r\nNote that the [long URL][detailsurl] in the `Detail` element's `url` attribute links to the human-viewable product detail page at Amazon.  I've also left a few other things out, such as the URLs to product images; I just thought I'd edit it a bit to be friendlier to your browser at home.  There's a [schema][awslite] for this XML data, and the ins-and-outs are explained in the AWS documentation under \"Amazon Web Services Data Model\".\r\n\r\n### Querying The Wishes\r\n\r\nSome ready-made files are available for this section:\r\n* [`wishes-ex1.xsl`][wishes-ex1.xsl]: The first iteration of the stylesheet in development.\r\n* [`wishes.xml`][wishes.xml]: An XML document used as input with the stylesheet.\r\n\r\nNow that we've got some XML from Amazon to play with, let's start tinkering with an XSLT stylesheet to process it.  In the interests of flexibility and reusability, we can parameterize a few things in XML before starting in on the stylesheet:\r\n\r\n    <wishes xmlns=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes\">\r\n      <maxprice>15.00</maxprice>\r\n      <associate>0xdecafbad-20</associate>\r\n      <devtoken>D8HVH869XA0NP</devtoken>\r\n      <email>deus_x@pobox.com</email>\r\n      <wishlists>\r\n        <wishlist label=\"The Girl\">35OIOYWQ9XQAE</wishlist>\r\n        <wishlist label=\"Me\">1QWYI6P2JF3Q5</wishlist>\r\n      </wishlists>\r\n    </wishes>\r\n\r\nHopefully, the data here is fairly self-explanatory:  I've established a maximum price for item selection; provided my associate ID and developer token; there's an email address to which I eventually want to send the results of all this work; and I've made a list of wishlist IDs, each with a readable label. Given this, let's start out simple and  use this to get some data from Amazon:\r\n\r\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n    <xsl:stylesheet version=\"1.0\"\r\n                xmlns:wishes=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes\"\r\n                xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\">\r\n      <xsl:output indent=\"yes\" />\r\n\r\n      <!-- Grab our global settings -->\r\n      <xsl:variable name=\"maxprice\"  select=\"/wishes:wishes/wishes:maxprice\" />  \r\n      <xsl:variable name=\"associate\" select=\"/wishes:wishes/wishes:associate\" />\r\n      <xsl:variable name=\"devtoken\"  select=\"/wishes:wishes/wishes:devtoken\" />\r\n\r\nSo far so good--things start off by pulling in some of the parameters into variables.  Next, let's dig into actually querying wishlist data with a reusable template:\r\n\r\n      <xsl:template name=\"processWishlist\">\r\n        <xsl:param name=\"wishlist\" />\r\n\r\n        <xsl:variable name=\"details\" select=\"document(concat(\r\n            'http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?',\r\n            't=',$associate,'&amp;',\r\n            'dev-t=',$devtoken,'&amp;',\r\n            'WishlistSearch=',$wishlist,'&amp;',\r\n            'type=lite&amp;f=xml'))//Details\" />\r\n\r\nFirst thing into this template, we accept a parameter named `wishlist` which is expected to contain a wishlist ID string.  Next, we build an AWS URL by concatenating together the pieces we have in variables (associate ID, developer's token, and wishlist ID) using the XPath function [`concat()`][xpconcat].  Once we have this URL, we use the function [`document()`][xpdocument] to make a request and fetch the XML data for that URL.  From this, we select all the `Details` elements.  \r\n\r\nThen with that data, we can do some filtering on the price and availability.  We want to make sure that not only will we select items that are within our budget, but that they are available to buy in the first place:\r\n\r\n        <xsl:copy-of select=\"$details[\r\n          number(substring(OurPrice/text(),2)) &lt; $maxprice\r\n          and\r\n          contains(Availability, 'Usually ships within')\r\n          ]\" />\r\n\r\n      </xsl:template>\r\n\r\nThis code is just a little bit funky, since the price data given by Amazon contains a dollar sign, and we want to make a numerical comparison.  So, we chop the dollar sign off and convert to a number before making the comparison.  Also, there's an assumption here about what will show up in the `Availability` element: \"Usually ships within\"  Other things that might show up will declare that the item is out of stock, discontinued, or otherwise not shipping.  This might need some tweaking someday, but it seems to work for now.\r\n\r\nTaken all together, this template has the effect of a SQL SELECT statement somewhat like this:\r\n\r\n    SELECT * \r\n    FROM Amazon.WishlistItems \r\n    WHERE WishlistID = $wishlist AND \r\n          OurPrice < $maxprice AND\r\n          Availability like '%Usually ships within%';\r\n\r\n`document()` is a very useful XPath function.  It allows us to pull in XML from external files and, in our case, from external URLs via HTTP requests.  This gives us the ability to make queries against REST web services like AWS--which, among many other reasons, is why I prefer REST web services over SOAP.  (I don't even want to think about trying to access a SOAP service from XSLT.)\r\n\r\nNow, let's wrap up this first iteration of the stylesheet by trying out the query template on each of the wishlist IDs:\r\n\r\n      <xsl:template match=\"/wishes:wishes\">\r\n        <xsl:for-each select=\"//wishes:wishlist\">\r\n          <wishes:wishitem>\r\n            <xsl:copy-of select=\".\" />\r\n            <xsl:call-template name=\"processWishlist\">\r\n                  <xsl:with-param name=\"wishlist\" \r\n                                  select=\".\" />\r\n            </xsl:call-template>\r\n          </wishes:wishitem>\r\n        </xsl:for-each>\r\n      </xsl:template>\r\n  \r\n    </xsl:stylesheet>\r\n\r\nYou can get a [completed version of this stylesheet][wishes-ex1.xsl], along with [the input XML][wishes.xml], in case you haven't been cutting and pasting together a copy of your own along the way.  Try it out in a shell with:\r\n\r\n    $ xsltproc wishes_ex1.xsl wishes.xml\r\n\r\nAlternately, you could check it out using [TestXSLT][testxslt] under OS X.  You should get something like the following:\r\n\r\n    <wishes:wishitem xmlns:wishes=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes\">\r\n        <wishes:wishlist label=\"The Girl\">35OIOYWQ9XQAE</wishes:wishlist>\r\n        <Details ...>...</Details>\r\n        <Details ...>...</Details>\r\n        ...\r\n    </wishes:wishitem>\r\n    <wishes:wishitem xmlns:wishes=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes\">\r\n        <wishes:wishlist label=\"Me\">1QWYI6P2JF3Q5</wishes:wishlist>\r\n        <Details ...>...</Details>\r\n        <Details ...>...</Details>\r\n        ...\r\n    </wishes:wishitem>\r\n\r\nObviously, this example XML is much abridged, but hopefully you can get the gist:  For each wishlist ID, there is a containing `wishitem` element.  It contains a copy of the `wishlist` element from the input XML, followed by all the `Details` elements filtered and copied from the Amazon XML with the help of the `processWishlist` template.\r\n\r\n### That's All for Now!\r\n\r\nAnd that's the end of Part 1.  Next up, we'll be delving into a few more wrinkles in the wishlist querying process, selecting random items in XSLT, and the Remote Shopping Cart interface in Amazon Web Services.  Stay tuned!\r\n\r\n<!-- links -->\r\n\r\n[missadroit]: http://missadroit.livejournal.com \"Miss Adroit, my favorite girl in the world\"\r\n[mywishlist]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/1QWYI6P2JF3Q5 \r\n[herwishlist]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/35OIOYWQ9XQAE \r\n[amazonapi]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/landing.html \"Amazon Web Services\"\r\n[libxml]: http://www.xmlsoft.org/\r\n[xalan]: http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/\r\n[sablotron]: http://www.gingerall.com/charlie/ga/xml/p_sab.xml\r\n[saxon]: http://saxon.sourceforge.net/\r\n[exslt]: http://www.exslt.org/\r\n[libxslt]: http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT.html\r\n[spideringhacks]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596005776/0xdecafbad-20 \"O'Reilly's Spidering Hacks\"\r\n[xslscraper]: http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XslScraper \"Scrape RSS and Atom from HTML using Tidy and XSLT\"\r\n[awsdownload]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_2/002-7899886-3676027?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#38;node=3434641&#38;no=3435361&#38;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA\r\n[awstoken]: https://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/join/developer/application.html\r\n[amazonassociate]: http://associates.amazon.com\r\n[wlsearch]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/search.html/002-7899886-3676027?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#38;type=wishlist\r\n[wlurl]: http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?t=0xdecafbad-20&#38;dev-t=D8HVH869XA0NP&#38;type=lite&#38;WishlistSearch=35OIOYWQ9XQAE&#38;f=xml\r\n[detailsurl]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262133601/0xdecafbad-20?dev-t=D8HVH869XA0NP%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2\r\n[awslite]: http://xml.amazon.com/schemas3/dev-lite.xsd\r\n[fink]: http://fink.sourceforge.net\r\n[testxslt]: http://www.entropy.ch:16080/software/macosx/#testxslt\r\n[darwinports]: http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/\r\n[curl]: http://www.decafbad.com/#TODO\r\n[wget]: http://www.decafbad.com/#TODO\r\n[xpconcat]: http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xquery-operators-20020816/#func-concat\r\n[xpdocument]: http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xquery-operators-20020816/#func-document\r\n[wishescvs]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/hacks/wishes/\r\n[wishes.tar.gz]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/hacks/wishes/wishes.tar.gz?tarball=1 \"All Wish-of-the-Month Club files wrapped up in a tarball\"\r\n[wishes.xml]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes.xml\r\n[wishes-ex1.xsl]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex1.xsl\r\n[wishes-ex2.xsl]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex2.xsl\r\n[wishes-ex3.xsl]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex3.xsl\r\n[wishes-ex4.xsl]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex4.xsl\r\n[wishes-ex5.xsl]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex5.xsl\r\n[wishes-ex6.xsl]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex6.xsl\r\n[random-xml]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/random-xml\r\n[wishes_html_screenshot]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes.jpg\r\n[xslt_iteration]: http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/N4806.html \"Iteration in XSLT\"\r\n[xslt_recursion]: http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-xslrecur/ \"Use recursion effectively in XSL\"\r\n[exsl_random]: http://www.exslt.org/math/functions/random/index.html\r\n[exsl_node_set]: http://www.exslt.org/exsl/functions/node-set/index.html\r\n[rand_url]: http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/random-xml?int=1&#38;min=10&#38;max=20 \"A random integer between 10 and 20, in XML\"\r\n[xslt_result_tree_fragment]: http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#section-Result-Tree-Fragments\r\n\r\n[email_attach_anatomy]: http://www.dpo.uab.edu/Email/attach.html \"Anatomy of an Email Attachment\"\r\n[email_mime_and_html]: http://www.abiglime.com/webmaster/articles/cgi/010698.htm \"How to encapsulate HTML in an email message\"\r\n\r\n[email_html_and_text]: http://www.wilsonweb.com/wmt5/html-email-multi.htm \"Sending HTML and Plain Text E-Mail Simultaneously\"\r\n[man_sendmail]: http://www.hmug.org/man/8/sendmail.html \"man: sendmail\"\r\n[rfc1521]: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1521.html \"RFC 1521\"\r\n[cron1]: http://www.lysator.liu.se/~forsberg/linux/cron.html \"Doing things periodically -

Well, I&apos;ve been hard at work since then to turn out the first set and I think I&apos;ve finally got something for you.  I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/13/i_will_do_the_fandango\">mentioned</a> earlier this week that I was taking this seriously, so I hope it shows.  So, with many thanks to <a href=\"http://missadroit.livejournal.com\" title=\"Miss Adroit, my favorite girl in the world\">my girlfriend&apos;s</a> kind editorial help, and with some measure of anxiety, here goes...</i></p>\n<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n<p>For some time now, my girlfriend and I have been accumulating things we want in wishlists on Amazon.com.  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/1QWYI6P2JF3Q5\">Here&apos;s mine</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/35OIOYWQ9XQAE\">here&apos;s hers</a> - if you visit them, you can see we&apos;ve both got quite a few things listed.  Though they have come in handy with relatives at Christmas and on birthdays, neither of us really expects to see a regular flow of gifts from them.  For the most part, they&apos;ve just become holding tanks for things we intend to buy for each other or ourselves.  </p>\n<p>However, I tend to forget we have these lists except for occasional visit to Amazon when I think, &quot;Oh yeah, wishlists.  I should pick up a thing or two, there&apos;s some good stuff piled up in them.&quot;  On one particular visit, though, the notion of a Wish-of-the-Month club popped into my head: We could afford to grab at least one item for each of us from our wishlists on a monthly basis, provided that we remembered to place an order.  It&apos;d be better than signing up for a book or music club, driven by someone else&apos;s idea of what we wanted.  Unfortunately, there&apos;s that problem for busy, absentminded, and people like us: remembering to place an order.</p>\n<p>But wait, isn&apos;t this the sort of thing computers are for?  I should be able to cobble something together that would peruse our wishlists and--given some criteria like a price maximum--select an item at random for each of us and send them on their way.  With this, I could schedule a monthly run and start whittling down those lists.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gathering-tools\">Gathering Tools</h3>\n<p>Before I start working through the project itself, let&apos;s establish some assumptions and then gather some tools and materials:</p>\n<p>I&apos;m going to assume that you&apos;re using a UN*X operating system (ie. Linux, Mac OS X, etc.) and that you&apos;re reasonably familiar with getting around in a shell and editing files.  Things presented here could be adapted for Windows fairly easily, but I&apos;ll leave that as an exercise to the reader.  Also, you may need to build and install a package or two, so know-how in that regard will serve as well.  And finally: some familiarity with XML and XSLT would be useful, but you won&apos;t need to be a guru with either.</p>\n<p>Oh, and all the files I&apos;ll be introducing in this project can be downloaded from my website as a tarball:  <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/hacks/wishes/wishes.tar.gz?tarball=1\" title=\"All Wish-of-the-Month Club files wrapped up in a tarball\"><code>wishes.tar.gz</code></a>.  If you feel like browsing, you can see these files in my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/hacks/wishes/\">CVS repository</a>.  And if you feel like checking out a copy via anonymous CVS, the username is <code>anoncvs</code> and the password is blank--email me for help, if you need it.</p>\n<p>So, how do we get a look at these wishlists?  Lately, I&apos;ve been tinkering a bit with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XslScraper\" title=\"Scrape RSS and Atom from HTML using Tidy and XSLT\">scraping information from</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596005776/0xdecafbad-20\" title=\"O&apos;Reilly&apos;s Spidering Hacks\">automating access to</a> websites.  It&apos;s a bit like a puzzle game, with all the accompanying frustrations and happy breakthroughs.  However, where most puzzle games are designed with a solution in mind, this game isn&apos;t even necessarily meant to be played depending on the intentions of website owners.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the folks at Amazon.com have made things very friendly to tinkerers by providing an API, called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/landing.html\" title=\"Amazon Web Services\">Amazon Web Services</a> (or AWS).  You&apos;ll want to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_2/002-7899886-3676027?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;node=3434641&amp;no=3435361&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA\">download</a> the AWS developer&apos;s kit, which contains a wealth of documentation and examples.  After downloading these materials, you should <a href=\"https://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/join/developer/application.html\">apply for a developer&apos;s token</a> for use with the service.  AWS provides both SOAP and REST interfaces to functionality and data at their site; personally, I prefer the HTTP-and-XML approach taken by the REST interface, so that&apos;s what we&apos;ll be using here. </p>\n<p>To handle the XML produced by AWS, we&apos;ll be using the <code>xsltproc</code> command from <a href=\"http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT.html\">the XML C parser and toolkit of Gnome</a>.  There are other XSLT processors--such as <a href=\"http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/\">Xalan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gingerall.com/charlie/ga/xml/p_sab.xml\">Sablotron</a>, and <a href=\"http://saxon.sourceforge.net/\">Saxon</a>--but I&apos;ve found <a href=\"http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT.html\">libxslt</a> easiest to feed and care for on the various platforms with which I tinker.  It also seems to support a very large swath of <a href=\"http://www.exslt.org/\">EXSLT extensions</a>, all of which come in very handy, yet seem to receive uneven support in other XSLT processors.  We&apos;ll be pulling a trick or two out of that bag, so its support is key.</p>\n<p>You may or may not already have <a href=\"http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT.html\">libsxlt</a> installed.  Depending on your variant of Linux, it might be as simple as a single package-management command or it might be a bit more complex if you need to compile from source.  For Mac OS X, I recommend using <a href=\"http://fink.sourceforge.net\">Fink</a> for your packaging needs.  Although, <a href=\"http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/\">DarwinPorts</a> is nice as well, if you&apos;re used to The BSD Way.</p>\n<p>A bonus for OS X users: Marc Liyanage has provided a great Open Source tool named <a href=\"http://www.entropy.ch:16080/software/macosx/#testxslt\">TestXSLT</a> that embeds <a href=\"http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT.html\">libxslt</a>, among other XSLT processors, in a slick GUI for easier use.  This might come in handy for you as things develop.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wishlists-in-xml\">Wishlists in XML</h3>\n<p>Okay, we&apos;ve got a working environment, a head start on accessing Amazon wishlists as XML, and a way to manipulate that XML using <code>xsltproc</code>.  Let&apos;s start playing.  First things first, we need to gain access to Amazon wishlists in XML form.  Reading through the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_2/002-7899886-3676027?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;node=3434641&amp;no=3435361&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA\">AWS documentation</a> reveals that wish list searches are available via a URL constructed like so:</p>\n<pre><code>http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?\nt=[Associates ID goes here]&amp;#38;\ndev-t=[Developer Token goes here]&amp;#38;\nWishlistSearch=[wishlist ID goes here]&amp;#38;\ntype=[lite or heavy]&amp;#38;\nf=xml</code></pre>\n<p>I received an ID of <code>0xdecafbad-20</code> when I <a href=\"http://associates.amazon.com\">signed up to be an associate</a> a few years ago.  This will ensure that I get credited for sales made via the API--which isn&apos;t as important for the present project, since I&apos;ll be buying items myself, but it&apos;ll come in handy in later projects.  Also, when I <a href=\"https://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/join/developer/application.html\">signed up for a developer&apos;s token</a>, this is what I was given: <code>D8HVH869XA0NP</code>  I&apos;m disclosing my own here for the sake of example, but you should <a href=\"https://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/join/developer/application.html\">sign up</a> and get your own.</p>\n<p>So, that fills in the first two parts of the URL.  For the purposes of this project, let&apos;s just go with the <code>lite</code> option for type.  As for the wishlist ID, let&apos;s take a look the wishlist URLs to which I linked earlier:</p>\n<pre><code>http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/35OIOYWQ9XQAE\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/1QWYI6P2JF3Q5</code></pre>\n<p>You can discover these wishlist URLs using <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/search.html/002-7899886-3676027?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;type=wishlist\">Amazon&apos;s Wish List Search</a> feature, in which case a wishlist URL might appear like so:</p>\n<pre><code>http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/\n002-7899886-3676027?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;#38;\nid=35OIOYWQ9XQAE</code></pre>\n<p>In either case, there is a 13-character ID in each variety of wish list URL: this string is the wish list ID.  So, the ID for my girlfriend&apos;s wishlist is <code> 35OIOYWQ9XQAE</code> and mine is <code>1QWYI6P2JF3Q5</code>.  Given this piece of the puzzle, we can fill in the blanks to come up with the following URL for my girlfriend&apos;s wish list:</p>\n<pre><code>http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?\nt=0xdecafbad-20&amp;#38;\ndev-t=D8HVH869XA0NP&amp;#38;\ntype=lite&amp;#38;\nWishlistSearch=35OIOYWQ9XQAE&amp;#38;\nf=xml</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?t=0xdecafbad-20&amp;dev-t=D8HVH869XA0NP&amp;type=lite&amp;WishlistSearch=35OIOYWQ9XQAE&amp;f=xml\">Check out the XML resulting from this URL</a>--you may want to use a tool such as <code>curl</code> or <code>wget</code> instead of viewing this directly in your browser.  You&apos;ll see some XML that looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;ProductInfo&gt;\n...\n&lt;Details url=&quot;(some long URL)&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;Asin&gt;0262133601&lt;/Asin&gt;\n  &lt;ProductName&gt;Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing&lt;/ProductName&gt;\n  &lt;Catalog&gt;Book&lt;/Catalog&gt;\n  &lt;Authors&gt;\n     &lt;Author&gt;Christopher D.

I&apos;ve also left a few other things out, such as the URLs to product images; I just thought I&apos;d edit it a bit to be friendlier to your browser at home.  There&apos;s a <a href=\"http://xml.amazon.com/schemas3/dev-lite.xsd\">schema</a> for this XML data, and the ins-and-outs are explained in the AWS documentation under &quot;Amazon Web Services Data Model&quot;.</p>\n<h3 id=\"querying-the-wishes\">Querying The Wishes</h3>\n<p>Some ready-made files are available for this section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex1.xsl\"><code>wishes-ex1.xsl</code></a>: The first iteration of the stylesheet in development.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes.xml\"><code>wishes.xml</code></a>: An XML document used as input with the stylesheet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that we&apos;ve got some XML from Amazon to play with, let&apos;s start tinkering with an XSLT stylesheet to process it.  In the interests of flexibility and reusability, we can parameterize a few things in XML before starting in on the stylesheet:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;wishes xmlns=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;maxprice&gt;15.00&lt;/maxprice&gt;\n  &lt;associate&gt;0xdecafbad-20&lt;/associate&gt;\n  &lt;devtoken&gt;D8HVH869XA0NP&lt;/devtoken&gt;\n  &lt;email&gt;deus_x@pobox.com&lt;/email&gt;\n  &lt;wishlists&gt;\n    &lt;wishlist label=&quot;The Girl&quot;&gt;35OIOYWQ9XQAE&lt;/wishlist&gt;\n    &lt;wishlist label=&quot;Me&quot;&gt;1QWYI6P2JF3Q5&lt;/wishlist&gt;\n  &lt;/wishlists&gt;\n&lt;/wishes&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Hopefully, the data here is fairly self-explanatory:  I&apos;ve established a maximum price for item selection; provided my associate ID and developer token; there&apos;s an email address to which I eventually want to send the results of all this work; and I&apos;ve made a list of wishlist IDs, each with a readable label. Given this, let&apos;s start out simple and  use this to get some data from Amazon:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot;\n            xmlns:wishes=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;\n            xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:output indent=&quot;yes&quot; /&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- Grab our global settings --&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;maxprice&quot;  select=&quot;/wishes:wishes/wishes:maxprice&quot; /&gt;  \n  &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;associate&quot; select=&quot;/wishes:wishes/wishes:associate&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;devtoken&quot;  select=&quot;/wishes:wishes/wishes:devtoken&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>So far so good--things start off by pulling in some of the parameters into variables.  Next, let&apos;s dig into actually querying wishlist data with a reusable template:</p>\n<pre><code>  &lt;xsl:template name=&quot;processWishlist&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;wishlist&quot; /&gt;\n\n    &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;details&quot; select=&quot;document(concat(\n        &apos;http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml3?&apos;,\n        &apos;t=&apos;,$associate,&apos;&amp;amp;&apos;,\n        &apos;dev-t=&apos;,$devtoken,&apos;&amp;amp;&apos;,\n        &apos;WishlistSearch=&apos;,$wishlist,&apos;&amp;amp;&apos;,\n        &apos;type=lite&amp;amp;f=xml&apos;))//Details&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>First thing into this template, we accept a parameter named <code>wishlist</code> which is expected to contain a wishlist ID string.  Next, we build an AWS URL by concatenating together the pieces we have in variables (associate ID, developer&apos;s token, and wishlist ID) using the XPath function <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xquery-operators-20020816/#func-concat\"><code>concat()</code></a>.  Once we have this URL, we use the function <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xquery-operators-20020816/#func-document\"><code>document()</code></a> to make a request and fetch the XML data for that URL.  From this, we select all the <code>Details</code> elements.  </p>\n<p>Then with that data, we can do some filtering on the price and availability.  We want to make sure that not only will we select items that are within our budget, but that they are available to buy in the first place:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;$details[\n      number(substring(OurPrice/text(),2)) &amp;lt; $maxprice\n      and\n      contains(Availability, &apos;Usually ships within&apos;)\n      ]&quot; /&gt;\n\n  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>This code is just a little bit funky, since the price data given by Amazon contains a dollar sign, and we want to make a numerical comparison.  So, we chop the dollar sign off and convert to a number before making the comparison.  Also, there&apos;s an assumption here about what will show up in the <code>Availability</code> element: &quot;Usually ships within&quot;  Other things that might show up will declare that the item is out of stock, discontinued, or otherwise not shipping.  This might need some tweaking someday, but it seems to work for now.</p>\n<p>Taken all together, this template has the effect of a SQL SELECT statement somewhat like this:</p>\n<pre><code>SELECT * \nFROM Amazon.WishlistItems \nWHERE WishlistID = $wishlist AND \n      OurPrice &lt; $maxprice AND\n      Availability like &apos;%Usually ships within%&apos;;</code></pre>\n<p><code>document()</code> is a very useful XPath function.  It allows us to pull in XML from external files and, in our case, from external URLs via HTTP requests.  This gives us the ability to make queries against REST web services like AWS--which, among many other reasons, is why I prefer REST web services over SOAP.  (I don&apos;t even want to think about trying to access a SOAP service from XSLT.)</p>\n<p>Now, let&apos;s wrap up this first iteration of the stylesheet by trying out the query template on each of the wishlist IDs:</p>\n<pre><code>  &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/wishes:wishes&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;//wishes:wishlist&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;wishes:wishitem&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;processWishlist&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;wishlist&quot; \n                              select=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;\n      &lt;/wishes:wishitem&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;\n\n&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>You can get a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes-ex1.xsl\">completed version of this stylesheet</a>, along with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/*checkout*/hacks/wishes/wishes.xml\">the input XML</a>, in case you haven&apos;t been cutting and pasting together a copy of your own along the way.  Try it out in a shell with:</p>\n<pre><code>$ xsltproc wishes_ex1.xsl wishes.xml</code></pre>\n<p>Alternately, you could check it out using <a href=\"http://www.entropy.ch:16080/software/macosx/#testxslt\">TestXSLT</a> under OS X.  You should get something like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;wishes:wishitem xmlns:wishes=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;wishes:wishlist label=&quot;The Girl&quot;&gt;35OIOYWQ9XQAE&lt;/wishes:wishlist&gt;\n    &lt;Details ...&gt;...&lt;/Details&gt;\n    &lt;Details ...&gt;...&lt;/Details&gt;\n    ...\n&lt;/wishes:wishitem&gt;\n&lt;wishes:wishitem xmlns:wishes=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/2004/05/wishes&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;wishes:wishlist label=&quot;Me&quot;&gt;1QWYI6P2JF3Q5&lt;/wishes:wishlist&gt;\n    &lt;Details ...&gt;...&lt;/Details&gt;\n    &lt;Details ...&gt;...&lt;/Details&gt;\n    ...\n&lt;/wishes:wishitem&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Obviously, this example XML is much abridged, but hopefully you can get the gist:  For each wishlist ID, there is a containing <code>wishitem</code> element.  It contains a copy of the <code>wishlist</code> element from the input XML, followed by all the <code>Details</code> elements filtered and copied from the Amazon XML with the help of the <code>processWishlist</code> template.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thats-all-for-now\">That&apos;s All for Now!</h3>\n<p>And that&apos;s the end of Part 1.  Next up, we&apos;ll be delving into a few more wrinkles in the wishlist querying process, selecting random items in XSLT, and the Remote Shopping Cart interface in Amazon Web Services.  Stay tuned!</p>\n<!-- links -->\n\n"

At this point, all that seems to happen is that the same old threads get recycled.  No one&#39;s got anything new to bring, except maybe ad hominem grousing or possibly a Yo Mama joke (though I&#39;ve yet to see that particular innovation).  Anyone who cares can do a bit of Googling to catch up on the story.</p>\n<p>The fact is, I no longer care about RSS versus Atom versus $foo.  Mark Pilgrim enables me to do so with his <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/projects/feed_parser/\">feed parser</a>, and most other aggregators I might care about have also implemented support for both Atom and RSS.  And if they don&#39;t, I can <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/03/put_on_your_rsscolored_glasses_and_forget_about_atom\">route around the damage</a> just like I do when I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XslScraper\">scrape sites</a> devoid of any feeds.</p>\n<p>While I do prefer Atom over RSS, almost a year later I still say <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/07/07/syndications_formats\">the magic is in syndication, not the format</a>.  I&#39;ll let the tag-level grumblers foam on without comment and just thank them for their work when a good new spec  bubbles up or when something fun and useful comes out.  I&#39;m circling that whole area of concern and sticking a post-it on it that reads: <em>RSS and Atom both useful, neither perfect, neither going away.</em></p>\n<p>Whew.  That&#39;s a weight off my brain.  Now what is there left to talk about?</p>\n<p>Well, how about let&#39;s talk some more about what to do with the items we get, once we <em>do</em> manage to parse a feed?  (Sheesh, you mean we&#39;re not already fighting over that topic?)  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/2004/06/10.html#a1802\">Rogers Cadenhead wants gluttonous RSS feeders</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With thousands of information sources producing RSS and Atom feeds, we need people like Thauvin [whose linkblog is <a href=\"http://www.thauvin.net/linkblog/\">here</a>] who have integrated weblogging into their daily news-gathering routine. Weblog links are like ant trails -- a lot of people have to link to something good in order to get noticed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I self-identify as such, since my feed list has topped 550 in count.  But I&#39;m happily surprised to find that I&#39;m not even in the <a href=\"http://feeds.scripting.com/prolificSubscribers\">top 10 of prolific subscribers</a>--at least I&#39;m not the biggest Info Freako.  (Yet.)  </p>\n<p>I&#39;m adding between 2-3 feeds to my list daily, so I can see myself approaching 1000 eventually.  But I&#39;m starting to hesitate at adding one more feed now.  Even with my current streamlined multi-pass skimming process, I&#39;m starting to see diminishing returns.  I breeze past screen loads of chaff that I&#39;ll never view, but it still bogs me down.  I can only think that people with twice the subscriptions as I either have more free time, or have a better mousetrap.</p>\n<p>The usual response I get toward my subscriptions is, &quot;Why don&#39;t you cut that list down to about 100 essentials?&quot;  And even that&#39;s said with a smirk, usually by someone with under 50 subscriptions and usually by someone who&#39;s not as obsessive an <a href=\"http://www.jesusjonesarchive.com/lyrics.htm#Info%20Freako\" title=\"Jesus Jones lyrics\">Info Freako</a> as I am.  Thing is, though, good stuff has at one point or another shown up on each and every feed I monitor.  I want to figure out how to scale <em>up</em> from 1 to 10 to 100 to 1000 to 10000 sources and beyond.</p>\n<p>(Singing interlude: &quot;Info Freako / There is no end to what I want to know&quot;)</p>\n<p>Besides, this is an area where I can tinker with and learn about another area I&#39;m interested in: machine intelligence and intelligence amplification.  Rogers says, &quot;I want a Bayesian filter that can guess which new headlines I&#39;m most likely to read&quot;  Though someone else might apply Bayes in a way that works for them, I didn&#39;t find <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/08/16/bayes_agg_one\">my experiments with SpamBayes</a> very satisfying.  I suspect it has something to do with the fact that SpamBayes is geared toward sorting out a quasi-binary world of spam-versus-ham, while I&#39;m interested in a spectrum between must-read and shrugs.</p>\n<p>But, the idea of introducing another pass through items at the head of the process, this one partially or completely automated, has great appeal.  Done right, this could be the bit that adds an order of magnitude to my capacity to monitor feeds.  I need to investigate other machine learning approaches.</p>\n<p>The idea is that, while I freakishly want to catch as much info as possible, I can only handle so much in a day.  For certain, I can&#39;t handle everything that might be interesting to me, so I need some prioritization and some pre-filtering before my attention gets applied to the flow.</p>\n<p>The way I picture this is trying to apply a sort of <a href=\"http://mtsu32.mtsu.edu:11178/171/pyramid.htm\">inverted pyramid</a> approach to the incoming flow of items.</p>\n<p>I started with a few primitive tools in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/08/05/ooobbf\">AmphetaOutlines&#39; adaptivity to reading patterns</a>, limited mostly to just sorting channels by a count of items read historically.  I also introduced some information hiding and exploration aspects:  I tried to hide or de-emphasize older items by use of font size and weight; and I put items into a JavaScript-driven outline where item descriptions and more ancient items could be hidden or revealed via disclosure triangle.</p>\n<p>In my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg2\">latest attempt</a>, I&#39;ve not yet implemented any adaptive sorting, but I&#39;ve kept and improved the outline display (see: <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/06/dbagg2a.jpg\">screenshot #1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/06/dbagg2b.jpg\">screenshot #2</a>).  Also, I can now mark items as seen and/or flag them to be viewed in a queue for later.  I&#39;ve got some lame SpamBayes integration in there, but I&#39;ve let it atrophy in daily use due to a complete lack of usefulness.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m starting to think about next steps now toward a more advanced aggregator.  I&#39;ve still got my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlinesWishList\">wishlist</a> for AmphetaOutlines, and I&#39;ve actually covered quite a few of the items with this new aggregator.  But, I&#39;m thinking things like the following would be useful to pursue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>What do you think is more important?</strong>  Do you value one group of feeds over another?  Personally, I want to see every single web comic that appears in my queue, most items from <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/\">Engadget</a> and <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/\">Boing Boing</a>, and maybe only a few from some of the firehoses I&#39;ve hooked myself up to.  Also, there are <a href=\"http://interconnected.org/home/\">some</a> <a href=\"http://www.ecyrd.com/ButtUgly/Wiki.jsp?page=Main_blogentry_130604_1\">bloggers</a> who post somewhat infrequently, but I don&#39;t want to miss a thing when they <em>do</em> post.  I need to be able to group and prioritize manually.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>What do you <em>demonstrate</em> as important?</strong>  Which feeds&#39; items receive more of your attention, and within those feeds, what topics and phrases appear most frequently?  The machine should be able to make some observations about your history of behavior and give some input into the organization of items presented.  Also, it should give me some way to give feedback to its recommendations with a simple and lazy thumbs up and thumbs down.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Republishing of interesting items to a linkblog is a must.</strong>  On the flip-side, it would be nice to somehow pull in others&#39; linkblogs in a more meaningful way than simply watching their feeds.  I should be able to triangulate some things and get some recommendations based on mutual links predicting future interest in items.  We need to start chasing ant trails unconsciously and automatically.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Time-limited subscriptions which expire after a set time, or request renewal from the user.</strong>  Use these to track comment threads which offer RSS feeds.  (Like <a href=\"http://www.pycs.net/system/comments.py?u=0000001&#38;p=1802&#38;format=rss\">this one</a>.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>More statistics and health monitoring of subscriptions.</strong>  How active are your feeds?  Which are dead &#38; gone, or merely just in hiatus?  Have any moved?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, I haven&#39;t done any sort of comprehensive survey of the aggregator landscape in a long time, so I&#39;d be very intrigued if any existing software implements these sorts of things.  I&#39;ve seen some progress toward monitoring feed health, but I&#39;ve seen next to nothing toward automatic filtering of items and recommendations based on past behavior.  I have seen manually constructed filters, but I&#39;m too lazy to try to figure out how to tell the computer what I want.   I want the machine to ride shotgun, watch and learn.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.johnny-five.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.johnny-five.com/simplenet/Shortcircuit/Pics/Pictures/Misc/jfive.gif\" align=\"right\" alt=\"Need more input!\" hspace=\"10\" /></a> Where&#39;s the state-of-the-art for feed aggregators, and what&#39;s next?

I don't read through my aggregator all day - I spend about an hour per day at lunch and maybe another at home skimming through items and maybe another hour or so reading longer stories.  \nThis isn't handwashing OCD behavior here - I don't read or even linger on more than a small fraction of what ends up on the screen.  It's a lot of quick glancing, page-down, and mass delete.  It's pretty much as much time as I used to spend just between a half-dozen sites like slashdot.org and cnet.com, only now my sources are so much more varied.\nThe challenge is that wanting to squeeze more coverage of more sources into my daily browsing has me wanting to learn more about certain technologies.  That, and just dealing with more volumes of data is kinda fun in a geeky sort of way.\nAnd, no, I don't record all the channels on the TV.  Besides watching 1 or 2 shows, and playing a few video games, this is what I do instead of sitting in front of the tube.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086593\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.reactuate.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=43e4a9fa1d0e5d52a6979ddad94bc483&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.reactuate.com/\">Ron</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086593\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-06-16T19:52:44\">2004-06-16T19:52:44</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">When I wrote that story I wasn't expecting people to jump into a fight about RSS vs Atom.

Moving content to the must-read front burner will always be deliberate, but improving the content we scan can probably be improved mechanically.  I doubt Brother Orchard thinks there&#8217;s an algorithm for the A-list.  We&#8217;re just talking about making more productive use of the proximate cloud.\nScenario #1:  You Google for topics of interest.  The hits returned can&#8217;t be reliably filtered by creation date, and they consider (in general) the entire indexed Web.  It&#8217;s a good thing, if scatter-shot.  Queries can only be refined so much.\nScenario #2:  You amass and manage a list of syndicated feeds in which you have a passing interest.  The feed content is indexed (Bloglines does this; Google does or will, too).  You can query this universe discretely, using Google-like devices and maybe a few new ones.\nWhat&#8217;s different about these two?\nIn #2, you selected (and casually manage) the universe.  Its chunks &#8212; though perhaps truncated or paraphrased by the author &#8212; are reliably date-stamped.  A free-text query of such data would be very different from an identical Google query.\nAdd a few more discriminators and it gets better.  Suppose you could discriminate by\n1. Paragraph length.  That might get you recent topical hits of terse or essay length, as you choose.\n2. Link-text density.  Filter in or out those link-collection posts.\n3. Query-term density or semantic weight.  Is the topic being addressed directly or simply mentioned?\n4. Item weight or image density.  Helps filter noisy or glitzy corporate feeds (think Ziff-Davis).\nThere are plenty more.\nThe main differences, though, are date discrimination and the pre-filter of a confined universe.  Me, I&#8217;m down to thirty feeds and ignore half of those.  Better tools might change that.\nLQ</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086596\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=85232f8499fd6ee91623408fc23835d1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\">Matt Brubeck</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086596\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-06-19T21:06:49\">2004-06-19T21:06:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I love the picture.

At this point, all that seems to happen is that the same old threads get recycled.  No one's got anything new to bring, except maybe ad hominem grousing or possibly a Yo Mama joke (though I've yet to see that particular innovation).  Anyone who cares can do a bit of Googling to catch up on the story.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, I no longer care about RSS versus Atom versus $foo.  Mark Pilgrim enables me to do so with his [feed parser][feedparser], and most other aggregators I might care about have also implemented support for both Atom and RSS.  And if they don't, I can [route around the damage][rss colored glasses] just like I do when I [scrape sites][scrape sites] devoid of any feeds.\r\n\r\nWhile I do prefer Atom over RSS, almost a year later I still say [the magic is in syndication, not the format][syndication magic].  I'll let the tag-level grumblers foam on without comment and just thank them for their work when a good new spec  bubbles up or when something fun and useful comes out.  I'm circling that whole area of concern and sticking a post-it on it that reads: *RSS and Atom both useful, neither perfect, neither going away.*\r\n\r\nWhew.  That's a weight off my brain.  Now what is there left to talk about?\r\n\r\nWell, how about let's talk some more about what to do with the items we get, once we *do* manage to parse a feed?  (Sheesh, you mean we're not already fighting over that topic?)  \r\n\r\n[Rogers Cadenhead wants gluttonous RSS feeders][cadenhead]:\r\n\r\n> With thousands of information sources producing RSS and Atom feeds, we need people like Thauvin [whose linkblog is [here][thauvin]] who have integrated weblogging into their daily news-gathering routine. Weblog links are like ant trails -- a lot of people have to link to something good in order to get noticed.\r\n\r\nI self-identify as such, since my feed list has topped 550 in count.  But I'm happily surprised to find that I'm not even in the [top 10 of prolific subscribers][prolific subs]--at least I'm not the biggest Info Freako.  (Yet.)  \r\n\r\nI'm adding between 2-3 feeds to my list daily, so I can see myself approaching 1000 eventually.  But I'm starting to hesitate at adding one more feed now.  Even with my current streamlined multi-pass skimming process, I'm starting to see diminishing returns.  I breeze past screen loads of chaff that I'll never view, but it still bogs me down.  I can only think that people with twice the subscriptions as I either have more free time, or have a better mousetrap.\r\n\r\nThe usual response I get toward my subscriptions is, \"Why don't you cut that list down to about 100 essentials?\"  And even that's said with a smirk, usually by someone with under 50 subscriptions and usually by someone who's not as obsessive an [Info Freako][info freako] as I am.  Thing is, though, good stuff has at one point or another shown up on each and every feed I monitor.  I want to figure out how to scale *up* from 1 to 10 to 100 to 1000 to 10000 sources and beyond.\r\n\r\n(Singing interlude: \"Info Freako / There is no end to what I want to know\")\r\n\r\nBesides, this is an area where I can tinker with and learn about another area I'm interested in: machine intelligence and intelligence amplification.  Rogers says, \"I want a Bayesian filter that can guess which new headlines I'm most likely to read\"  Though someone else might apply Bayes in a way that works for them, I didn't find [my experiments with SpamBayes][bayes] very satisfying.  I suspect it has something to do with the fact that SpamBayes is geared toward sorting out a quasi-binary world of spam-versus-ham, while I'm interested in a spectrum between must-read and shrugs.\r\n\r\nBut, the idea of introducing another pass through items at the head of the process, this one partially or completely automated, has great appeal.  Done right, this could be the bit that adds an order of magnitude to my capacity to monitor feeds.  I need to investigate other machine learning approaches.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that, while I freakishly want to catch as much info as possible, I can only handle so much in a day.  For certain, I can't handle everything that might be interesting to me, so I need some prioritization and some pre-filtering before my attention gets applied to the flow.\r\n\r\nThe way I picture this is trying to apply a sort of [inverted pyramid][inverted pyramid] approach to the incoming flow of items.\r\n\r\nI started with a few primitive tools in [AmphetaOutlines' adaptivity to reading patterns][amphetaoutlines], limited mostly to just sorting channels by a count of items read historically.  I also introduced some information hiding and exploration aspects:  I tried to hide or de-emphasize older items by use of font size and weight; and I put items into a JavaScript-driven outline where item descriptions and more ancient items could be hidden or revealed via disclosure triangle.\r\n\r\nIn my [latest attempt][dbagg2], I've not yet implemented any adaptive sorting, but I've kept and improved the outline display (see: [screenshot #1][dbagg2 screen1], [screenshot #2][dbagg2 screen2]).  Also, I can now mark items as seen and/or flag them to be viewed in a queue for later.  I've got some lame SpamBayes integration in there, but I've let it atrophy in daily use due to a complete lack of usefulness.\r\n\r\nI'm starting to think about next steps now toward a more advanced aggregator.  I've still got my [wishlist][wishlist] for AmphetaOutlines, and I've actually covered quite a few of the items with this new aggregator.  But, I'm thinking things like the following would be useful to pursue:\r\n\r\n* **What do you think is more important?**  Do you value one group of feeds over another?  Personally, I want to see every single web comic that appears in my queue, most items from [Engadget][engadget] and [Boing Boing][boing boing], and maybe only a few from some of the firehoses I've hooked myself up to.  Also, there are [some][blogger1] [bloggers][blogger2] who post somewhat infrequently, but I don't want to miss a thing when they *do* post.  I need to be able to group and prioritize manually.\r\n\r\n* **What do you *demonstrate* as important?**  Which feeds' items receive more of your attention, and within those feeds, what topics and phrases appear most frequently?  The machine should be able to make some observations about your history of behavior and give some input into the organization of items presented.  Also, it should give me some way to give feedback to its recommendations with a simple and lazy thumbs up and thumbs down.\r\n\r\n* **Republishing of interesting items to a linkblog is a must.**  On the flip-side, it would be nice to somehow pull in others' linkblogs in a more meaningful way than simply watching their feeds.  I should be able to triangulate some things and get some recommendations based on mutual links predicting future interest in items.  We need to start chasing ant trails unconsciously and automatically.\r\n\r\n* **Time-limited subscriptions which expire after a set time, or request renewal from the user.**  Use these to track comment threads which offer RSS feeds.  (Like [this one][comment feed].)\r\n\r\n* **More statistics and health monitoring of subscriptions.**  How active are your feeds?  Which are dead &#38; gone, or merely just in hiatus?  Have any moved?\r\n\r\nNow, I haven't done any sort of comprehensive survey of the aggregator landscape in a long time, so I'd be very intrigued if any existing software implements these sorts of things.  I've seen some progress toward monitoring feed health, but I've seen next to nothing toward automatic filtering of items and recommendations based on past behavior.  I have seen manually constructed filters, but I'm too lazy to try to figure out how to tell the computer what I want.   I want the machine to ride shotgun, watch and learn.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.johnny-five.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.johnny-five.com/simplenet/Shortcircuit/Pics/Pictures/Misc/jfive.gif\" align=\"right\" alt=\"Need more input!\" hspace=\"10\" /></a> Where's the state-of-the-art for feed aggregators, and what's next?

I don't read through my aggregator all day - I spend about an hour per day at lunch and maybe another at home skimming through items and maybe another hour or so reading longer stories.  \r\n\r\nThis isn't handwashing OCD behavior here - I don't read or even linger on more than a small fraction of what ends up on the screen.  It's a lot of quick glancing, page-down, and mass delete.  It's pretty much as much time as I used to spend just between a half-dozen sites like slashdot.org and cnet.com, only now my sources are so much more varied.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is that wanting to squeeze more coverage of more sources into my daily browsing has me wanting to learn more about certain technologies.  That, and just dealing with more volumes of data is kinda fun in a geeky sort of way.\r\n\r\nAnd, no, I don't record all the channels on the TV.  Besides watching 1 or 2 shows, and playing a few video games, this is what I do instead of sitting in front of the tube.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086593\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.reactuate.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=43e4a9fa1d0e5d52a6979ddad94bc483&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.reactuate.com/\">Ron</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086593\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-06-16T19:52:44\">2004-06-16T19:52:44</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">When I wrote that story I wasn't expecting people to jump into a fight about RSS vs Atom.

Moving content to the must-read front burner will always be deliberate, but improving the content we scan can probably be improved mechanically.  I doubt Brother Orchard thinks there&#8217;s an algorithm for the A-list.  We&#8217;re just talking about making more productive use of the proximate cloud.\r\n\r\nScenario #1:  You Google for topics of interest.  The hits returned can&#8217;t be reliably filtered by creation date, and they consider (in general) the entire indexed Web.  It&#8217;s a good thing, if scatter-shot.  Queries can only be refined so much.\r\n\r\nScenario #2:  You amass and manage a list of syndicated feeds in which you have a passing interest.  The feed content is indexed (Bloglines does this; Google does or will, too).  You can query this universe discretely, using Google-like devices and maybe a few new ones.\r\n\r\nWhat&#8217;s different about these two?\r\n\r\nIn #2, you selected (and casually manage) the universe.  Its chunks &#8212; though perhaps truncated or paraphrased by the author &#8212; are reliably date-stamped.  A free-text query of such data would be very different from an identical Google query.\r\n\r\nAdd a few more discriminators and it gets better.  Suppose you could discriminate by\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Paragraph length.  That might get you recent topical hits of terse or essay length, as you choose.\r\n\r\n2. Link-text density.  Filter in or out those link-collection posts.\r\n\r\n3. Query-term density or semantic weight.  Is the topic being addressed directly or simply mentioned?\r\n\r\n4. Item weight or image density.  Helps filter noisy or glitzy corporate feeds (think Ziff-Davis).\r\n\r\nThere are plenty more.\r\n\r\nThe main differences, though, are date discrimination and the pre-filter of a confined universe.  Me, I&#8217;m down to thirty feeds and ignore half of those.  Better tools might change that.\r\n\r\nLQ</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086596\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=85232f8499fd6ee91623408fc23835d1&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://advogato.org/person/mbrubeck/\">Matt Brubeck</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086596\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-06-19T21:06:49\">2004-06-19T21:06:49</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I love the picture.

    "html": "<p>I&#39;ve written before about becoming <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly_digital\">newly digital</a>, and although I had my start an Atari 800, the Commodore 64 is where I really settled in for a self-education in how these machines worked.  That was the first I managed to convince my family to buy, and the first anyone left in my unsupervised hands.  And as I did manage to go through at least 4 of the things, the results were not always pretty.  My mom was still finding &#39;extra&#39; screws and bits of solder in my old room&#39;s carpet years after I&#39;d moved out, until she finally tore it up and replaced it a year or two ago.</p>\n<p>However, with less physically destructive hacking, in software, is how I spent more of my time.

Nibble wasn't the only magazine of that type either, just the biggest. Call-APPLE (the newsletter of the Apple Pugetsound Program Library Exchange, a big Seattle user group) ran a legendary article once on how to make the disk operating system load files about 5 times faster.\nA friend of mine and I submitted several programs to Nibble, but neither of us ever had one accepted. I did later publish some articles in a small assembly language newsletter and wound up editing a couple for the same publisher. This was the start of my writing career. I later slung code and words for a couple of Apple ii and Mac software developers and then switched over to doing just the words, which I've been doing ever since.\nAhh, good times, good times.\nI have a bunch of things (scripts, mostly) kind of half-finished and partially released; maybe i should get serious about cleaning them up and publishing them in some way.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084300\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=702e6eecfa91e5a207315789aa02d7c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Ken Stailey</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084300\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-06-11T04:12:15\">2004-06-11T04:12:15</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">So lucky you could convince your family to buy computers.  I had to use my own savings to buy my Atari 400 -- couldn't afford an 800.\nI did upgrade it peicemeal over '81 - '84 with third party add-on's like a decent keyboard that fit in the place of the orignal McMembrane keyboard and a whopping 48KB of memory.\nWho needed a 2nd cartridge slot anyway :)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "I've written before about becoming [newly digital][newly_digital], and although I had my start an Atari 800, the Commodore 64 is where I really settled in for a self-education in how these machines worked.  That was the first I managed to convince my family to buy, and the first anyone left in my unsupervised hands.  And as I did manage to go through at least 4 of the things, the results were not always pretty.  My mom was still finding 'extra' screws and bits of solder in my old room's carpet years after I'd moved out, until she finally tore it up and replaced it a year or two ago.\r\n\r\nHowever, with less physically destructive hacking, in software, is how I spent more of my time.  I used to love typing in the programs from [Compute!'s Gazette][compute] and [Ahoy][ahoy] magazines.

The first issue I got my hands on featured [the first in a series of articles][transbasic] describing a wedged-in, extensive enhancement to the Microsoft Basic contained in the C64's ROM.

Nibble wasn't the only magazine of that type either, just the biggest. Call-APPLE (the newsletter of the Apple Pugetsound Program Library Exchange, a big Seattle user group) ran a legendary article once on how to make the disk operating system load files about 5 times faster.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine and I submitted several programs to Nibble, but neither of us ever had one accepted. I did later publish some articles in a small assembly language newsletter and wound up editing a couple for the same publisher. This was the start of my writing career. I later slung code and words for a couple of Apple ii and Mac software developers and then switched over to doing just the words, which I've been doing ever since.\r\n\r\nAhh, good times, good times.\r\n\r\nI have a bunch of things (scripts, mostly) kind of half-finished and partially released; maybe i should get serious about cleaning them up and publishing them in some way.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084300\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=702e6eecfa91e5a207315789aa02d7c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Ken Stailey</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084300\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-06-11T04:12:15\">2004-06-11T04:12:15</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">So lucky you could convince your family to buy computers.

Anyway, try again with a different password or two and I finally get to what I want.\r\n\r\nTalk about [surprising the user][surprise]...\r\n\r\n[surprise]: http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch11s01.html\r\n[cdnow]: http://news.com.com/2100-1023-976008.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090382\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=99b77c34a0e26fd04a058f8c2dbab290&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090382\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-05-19T19:27:06\">2004-05-19T19:27:06</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">That would actually be pretty cool if it didn't sound like such a pain in the ass.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090383\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://glinden.blogspot.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8b702a775f458d5c2cf53f1021cb3ac6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://glinden.blogspot.com\">Greg Linden</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090383\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-05-19T20:27:15\">2004-05-19T20:27:15</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">If you're curious, the reason that feature exists is because some people share e-mail addresses.

It wasn't until months later that I realized that you're never done.  After the third upgrade of X11, I realized that the bigger and more important a package is, the more bugs it contains, and the quicker they are found (\"many eyes\" and all that), so you end up recompiling X and Mozilla a lot more often than you'd planned.\nAs for performance, it's the only Linux I've ever installed on my iBook, so I don't have anything to compare it to.

I use Virtual PC for my Linux fix (actually, for GNUCash and some other minor programs that I don't want to buy for Windows). If Valve/Steam ever ported Steam and HL to Linux though... the battle would be on. =)\nMy server, however, is Gentoo (It's been Gentoo, OpenBSD, and Slackware), but I like Gentoo the best.

But, just what *do* you do with a machine entirely devoted to Windows, anyway?\r\n\r\nAnd just why can't I get an [ancient game][subspace] working acceptably on my PowerBook under Virtual PC anyway?! \r\n\r\n[cygwinmysql]: http://anfaenger.de/cygwin-1.5/mysql/\r\n[gentoo]: http://www.gentoo.org/\r\n[dllhell]: http://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Database/DLLHell.aspx\r\n[ext2fsd]: http://ext2.yeah.net\r\n[ext2fs3]: http://www.ext2fs-anywhere.com/\r\n[ut]: http://www.unrealtournament.com/\r\n[subspace]: http://www.subspacehq.com/\r\n[cygwin]: http://www.subspacehq.com/\r\n[colinux]: http://www.colinux.org/\r\n[tv]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/10/homebrew_entertainment_appliances_cheap_open_and_embattled\r\n[account]: http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001962.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088030\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.geocities.com/rschmertz/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=368fade064c39e0034b5dc07782acc41&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.geocities.com/rschmertz/\">Bob S</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088030\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-05-12T10:16:08\">2004-05-12T10:16:08</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Yes, compiling everything does get old.  When I first started out w/ Gentoo, I thought, \"cool, it'll take me maybe a couple of days to build everything, but once I'm done, I'll have a screaming fast system\".  It wasn't until months later that I realized that you're never done.  After the third upgrade of X11, I realized that the bigger and more important a package is, the more bugs it contains, and the quicker they are found (\"many eyes\" and all that), so you end up recompiling X and Mozilla a lot more often than you'd planned.\r\n\r\nAs for performance, it's the only Linux I've ever installed on my iBook, so I don't have anything to compare it to.

    "html": "<p>I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/07/oooach\">been tinkering</a> for years now with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/02/27/ooooch\">TiVO-zing my PC</a>, with varying degrees of success.  But, that&#39;s not what I really want.  Lately, I&#39;ve been reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262640414/0xdecafbad-20\">The Invisible Computer</a> by Donald A. Norman, and it&#39;s gotten me thinking: What I really want is a family of information appliances.  I&#39;d like to have a little Linux box with a capture card or two that just silently whirrs away, filling up a file-server Linux box (maybe like <a href=\"http://gizmodo.net/archives/002007.php\">this one</a>) with recorded video.  And then, I&#39;d like a Linux box in the living room whose sole purpose is to pull content from the file-server and present it on the screen and speakers in our living room.</p>\n<p>So far, I&#39;ve got the file-server Linux box in the basement that can supply the laptops and other devices in the apartment with various forms of audio and visual and other data.  Another fun recent advance is that I&#39;ve modded my XBox, replacing my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/07/30/powerbook_on_tv\">PowerBook as a home entertainment system component</a>.  The XBox isn&#39;t a little Linux box in the current configuration--<a href=\"http://gentoox.shallax.com/\">though it could be</a>--but it&#39;s open enough for my tastes, running the <a href=\"http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/\">XBox Media Center</a>.  </p>\n<p>But, I still just can&#39;t quite seem to get the TV capture end of things working to my satisfaction.  I think it has to do with the ATI All-in-Wonder card I have, and various trials and tribulations involved in trying to get it usable and capturing under Linux.  But now, since I&#39;ve given up on Linux for the moment and reinstalled WinXP, the card isn&#39;t even working the way it <em>used to</em> on <em>Windows</em> using ATI&#39;s own drivers and software.  I&#39;ve been flirting with the idea of picking up <a href=\"http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/prods_pvrs.html\">a WinTV card from Hauppage</a>, since I&#39;ve heard much better noises from that direction.  </p>\n<p>One dim ray of hope for the ATI comes from <a href=\"http://www.snapstream.com/\">SnapStream Media</a> and their <a href=\"http://www.snapstream.com/Products/Products_PVS3.asp\">Beyond TV product</a>.  This thing is very slick and allows complete control via web browser.  It&#39;s quite possibly worth the money if you have a capable computer and don&#39;t feel like tinkering much.  However, this app seems a bit heavyweight for my on-hand equipment.  But, it works, if I don&#39;t ask too much from the PC otherwise.  (I&#39;m really trying to stretch some all-but-obsolete PC hardware here, having not spent a dime on Wintel since I got my iBook a few years ago.)</p>\n<p>But, wait.  Isn&#39;t TiVO actually a little Linux box that whirrs away, filling up a hard drive with recorded video.  If I&#39;m starting down a slippery slope of maybe <em>buying</em> something like Beyond TV, why haven&#39;t I just broken down and gotten one of those?  </p>\n<p>Well, the first thing is that I want to tinker--like <a href=\"http://www-tech.mit.edu/V124/N20/ValentiIntervie.20f.html\">this guy</a>, who said he built his own high-definition television and amazed Jack Valenti.  I modded my XBox, which is certainly not cheerful news to Microsoft, and I know that you can do some tinkering with a TiVO, but that&#39;s certainly not supported either.  Wouldn&#39;t it be interesting if manufacturers of entertainment appliances ran things like video game companies, encouraging and supporting creative modifications and enhancements to their products?

    "body": "I've [been tinkering][homebrewpvr] for years now with [TiVO-zing my PC][tivopc], with varying degrees of success.  But, that's not what I really want.  Lately, I've been reading [The Invisible Computer][invisible computer] by Donald A. Norman, and it's gotten me thinking: What I really want is a family of information appliances.  I'd like to have a little Linux box with a capture card or two that just silently whirrs away, filling up a file-server Linux box (maybe like [this one][martian_storage]) with recorded video.  And then, I'd like a Linux box in the living room whose sole purpose is to pull content from the file-server and present it on the screen and speakers in our living room.\r\n\r\nSo far, I've got the file-server Linux box in the basement that can supply the laptops and other devices in the apartment with various forms of audio and visual and other data.  Another fun recent advance is that I've modded my XBox, replacing my [PowerBook as a home entertainment system component][pbtv].  The XBox isn't a little Linux box in the current configuration--[though it could be][gentoox]--but it's open enough for my tastes, running the [XBox Media Center][xbmc].  \r\n\r\nBut, I still just can't quite seem to get the TV capture end of things working to my satisfaction.  I think it has to do with the ATI All-in-Wonder card I have, and various trials and tribulations involved in trying to get it usable and capturing under Linux.  But now, since I've given up on Linux for the moment and reinstalled WinXP, the card isn't even working the way it *used to* on *Windows* using ATI's own drivers and software.  I've been flirting with the idea of picking up [a WinTV card from Hauppage][wintv], since I've heard much better noises from that direction.  \r\n\r\nOne dim ray of hope for the ATI comes from [SnapStream Media][snapstream] and their [Beyond TV product][beyondtv].  This thing is very slick and allows complete control via web browser.  It's quite possibly worth the money if you have a capable computer and don't feel like tinkering much.  However, this app seems a bit heavyweight for my on-hand equipment.  But, it works, if I don't ask too much from the PC otherwise.  (I'm really trying to stretch some all-but-obsolete PC hardware here, having not spent a dime on Wintel since I got my iBook a few years ago.)\r\n\r\nBut, wait.  Isn't TiVO actually a little Linux box that whirrs away, filling up a hard drive with recorded video.  If I'm starting down a slippery slope of maybe *buying* something like Beyond TV, why haven't I just broken down and gotten one of those?  \r\n\r\nWell, the first thing is that I want to tinker--like [this guy][interview], who said he built his own high-definition television and amazed Jack Valenti.  I modded my XBox, which is certainly not cheerful news to Microsoft, and I know that you can do some tinkering with a TiVO, but that's certainly not supported either.  Wouldn't it be interesting if manufacturers of entertainment appliances ran things like video game companies, encouraging and supporting creative modifications and enhancements to their products?  Imagine that.\r\n\r\nThe second thing is that, at the moment, I'm cheap.  Not that retail appliances like a TiVO are all *that* expensive for what they do, but I know that I can D.I.Y. with much less expensive stuff.  And right now, I'm trying to do it with very old stuff and having a surprising amount of success.\r\n\r\nThe third and most important thing is this: were I to buy something to fit one or all of these functions from someone else, I'd be at the mercy of their whims and the whims of their lawyers and the MPAA/RIAA lawyers talking to their lawyers.  As it is, I'm sure I'm breaking a slew of laws just doing what I have so far with my own equipment.  Oh, and it's always happy times when they turn around an [change their terms on you][itunes] after you've paid to get in the door.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be nice if we had a friendly environment for open experimentation with [information appliances][invisible computer] and cooperative content producers?  I'd love to pay a monthly fee to have shows by Joss Whedon stream on down do my file-server with BitTorrent.  I'd love to subscribe to favorite indie bands' releases and have them show up in the music folder.  I'm cheap, so I'd like the price to be low, but I'll still pay for what I like.  And I'd love to do all this, still being able to tinker, still seeing that people producing things I like get paid, without going to jail or letting them empty my wallet with a wet/dry vac.\r\n\r\n[gentoox]: http://gentoox.shallax.com/\r\n[interview]: http://www-tech.mit.edu/V124/N20/ValentiIntervie.20f.html\r\n[itunes]: http://george.hotelling.net/90percent/itunes_45_good_and_bad.php\r\n[beyondtv]: http://www.snapstream.com/Products/Products_PVS3.asp\r\n[snapstream]: http://www.snapstream.com/\r\n[xbmc]: http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/\r\n[wintv]: http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/prods_pvrs.html\r\n[invisible computer]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262640414/0xdecafbad-20\r\n[martian_storage]: http://gizmodo.net/archives/002007.php\r\n[wireless_storage]: http://www.buffalotech.com/wireless/products/NetworkProducts/HDH120LAN.html\r\n[missadroit]: http://missadroit.livejournal.com\r\n[sp]: http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~john/procrastination.html\r\n[intimidation]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/04/29/_look_its_a_post_about_not_posting\r\n[procrastination]: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001079\r\n[homebrewpvr]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/07/oooach\r\n[tivopc]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/02/27/ooooch\r\n[pbtv]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/07/30/powerbook_on_tv\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082794\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d3520ad50fa42c9319830bd9f0900c5d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">John Burton</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082794\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-05-10T23:46:04\">2004-05-10T23:46:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I couldn't cope without my tivo.

Actually, they&#39;re not my glasses, but this one guy&#39;s <a href=\"http://cavedoni.com/2004/02/rss1\">offering a service</a> and this other guy&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.aaronland.info/xsl/atom/0.3/\">offering some XSLT</a> -- both or either of these can help make all that annoying Atom gibberish look just like RSS to you and your favorite aggregator.  Hooray for the <a href=\"http://udell.roninhouse.com/bytecols/2001-08-15.html\">URL-as-command-line</a>!</p>\n<p>For instance, if you hate that <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/xml/atom.xml\">Mark Pilgrim&#39;s feed</a> is only available in Atom flavor now, screw him and get it <a href=\"http://cavedoni.com/2004/02/rss1?uri=http://diveintomark.org/xml/atom.xml\">RSS flavored</a> anyway!  The feed even <a href=\"http://rss.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcavedoni.com%2F2004%2F02%2Frss1%3Furi%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fdiveintomark.org%2Fxml%2Fatom.xml\">validates as RSS</a>.  (Though, if you&#39;re in the RSS-loving camp, I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;d want to hear from the likes of <em>him</em> anyway.)</p>\n<p>You know what this means?  It means you can forget about Atom.  Whenever you see an Atom feed, just put on your RSS-colored glasses.  Hell, if you&#39;re an aggregator developer, make the RSS-colored glasses built-in.  You don&#39;t even have to embed an XSLT processor in your application: just offer the service from your own web servers and substitute the filter URL automatically when one of your users tries to subscribe to an Atom feed.  </p>\n<p>(Though, you know, it would be awfully nice of you to throw in an XSLT processor.  At least one aggregator author thinks it&#39;s <a href=\"http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/04/new_gray_boxes_.html\">a good idea</a>.  So does <a href=\"http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000454.html\">this user / customer</a>.  But, it&#39;s admittedly an idea bordering on NeatLikeDigitalWatches.)</p>\n<p>Or, get this: borrow a service or a stylesheet hosted by an Atom sympathizer.  If there&#39;s demand and I feel like taking some abuse, I&#39;ll host such a service right here.  (Though I&#39;d likely live to regret doing <em>that</em>!)  In fact, using a set of RSS-colored glasses maintained by an Atom sympathizer is the best thing.  Let that poor altruistic sucker keep up with the rapid pace of change in the Atom world, updating XSLT, while you just happily go on seeing the world in RSS.</p>\n<p>There.  Problem solved.

Just like the way stuff sweeps through dorms or boarding schools where lots of overly open and suggestible people are crammed together, we all notice a bit of a slowdown, so we have less to react to, so then someone writes about it being slow...\nThe nice thing is that every single time, there are even more new people who aren't being infected, and may even still be in their first flush of infatuation with weblogs, posting like rats with a crack dispensing lever. Pick a keyword that you're interested in, and trot it over to Feedster or PubSub or one of the dozens of others, and find some new stuff to read, poke around their blogrolls, basically act like it's 2000 (or whatever your year was) again. Or, look through your referrers (how long has it been?) for people you don't recognize linking to you, and see what they have to say.

Doesn't seem like a lot of interesting public projects are in action right now.

Don't know what the RDF people are into right now.  Can't think of anything cool to do with the Topic Exchange, and I'm running out of disk space and bandwidth anyway.

I'm sure there are still the old wars still raging that I've just managed to quarantine from my scans.  Eh, if so, that's not a bad thing.\r\n\r\nSo now that I'm ostensively back...  what am I missing?\r\n\r\n[io]: http://radio.outliners.com/beta\r\n[mt_beef]: http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/04/wheres_the_beef.shtml\r\n[lazyweb]: http://www.lazyweb.org/\r\n[rest_vs_xmlrpc]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/11/26/oooccb\r\n[rss_wars]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/09/17/ooobgh\r\n[trackback_buzz]: http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/archives/000300.html#000300\r\n[radio_tweaks]: http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/stories/2002/03/06/howToDisplayWhichRssFeedsYoureSubscribedTo.html\r\n[rss_autodetection]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/31/oooago\r\n[dbagg2]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg2/\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082371\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082371\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-30T00:59:12\">2004-04-30T00:59:12</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I've noticed that too.

Pick a keyword that you're interested in, and trot it over to Feedster or PubSub or one of the dozens of others, and find some new stuff to read, poke around their blogrolls, basically act like it's 2000 (or whatever your year was) again. Or, look through your referrers (how long has it been?) for people you don't recognize linking to you, and see what they have to say. Either way, does wonders for me.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082376\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=475a543984769e9890f8dc0091f602c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/\">Phillip Pearson</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082376\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-05-02T05:35:55\">2004-05-02T05:35:55</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Feels quiet to me.  Doesn't seem like a lot of interesting public projects are in action right now.  IMHO the good stuff is going on behind closed doors - Bloglines, Technorati, Six Apart, Google, etc.  UserLand, which always seemed to be at the center of anything new and interesting, is in maintenance mode, and the Atom boys are just quietly doing their stuff.  Don't know what the RDF people are into right now.  Can't think of anything cool to do with the Topic Exchange, and I'm running out of disk space and bandwidth anyway.  Marc Canter et all are going strong with the PeopleAggregator open source SNS project, but I don't exactly know where they're aiming there.\r\n\r\nUmm ...</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

    "html": "<p>So.  It&#39;s been awhile since I spent much time here actually writing.  The <a href=\"/links/\">quick links</a> have been fun, but they&#39;re just not the same as really posting something of my own.  There&#39;ve been numerous reasons for my semi-disappearance, but I think I&#39;d finally like to come back now.  Maybe I&#39;ll even spend a few entries writing about what&#39;s happened over the past year or so.  It&#39;s been a bit of a trip.</p>\n<p>But first, I&#39;ve got to get this new site launched.  By the time you read this, there will have been some changes.  It will have been a little over a year since the last time I did <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/colophon/oooooa.html\">something drastic</a> around here.  In fact, I&#39;d intended this to happen right around <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooooab.html\">this site&#39;s birthday</a>, but I think I needed to read <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2004/04/22.html\">Joel on Software on Perfectionism</a>, and <a href=\"http://mamamusings.net/archives/2004/04/23/you_may_ask_yourself_how_did_i_get_here.php\">mamamusing&#39;s Talking Heads reference</a>, to get me to finally bite the bullet and push the button.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s bound to be bugs and problems galore here, but I&#39;ve got to get past the tinkering and strip away my excuses for not actually writing here.  I actually started putting this new site together back in early December, and have been putzing around since.  Now that it&#39;s just about there, I realize I&#39;m actually afraid to start writing again.  (As if I were any sort of writer worth reading before.  Bah.  Get over it.)</p>\n<p>Here it is, then.  I&#39;m back to using Movable Type, probably just in time to fuss about upgrading to 3.0.  Nothing wrong with <a href=\"http://www.blosxom.com/\">blosxom</a>, or <a href=\"http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/pyblosxom/\">pyblosxom</a> for that matter, but a confluence of available plugins, exasperation, and fiddling brought me back.  I think the result&#39;s turned out rather nifty, so one of my first runs of entries will be a sort of colophon.  Maybe someone else will find something worthwhile in that.  </p>\n<p>This time, I&#39;ve gone from having a wiki and a blog to having a wiki, a blog, and a linkblog.  (There&#39;ve got to be better words for these things.)  The links were mashed up with the rare blog entry, and I got more than one comment wishing they were separate.  Makes sense to me.  So...  three separate parts to this site, each separate for a reason, but all intermingled too.</p>\n<p>Anyway, before I ramble on too much longer about an idea which might just be NeatLikeDigitalWatches instead of <em>actually</em> neat, I should get this thing launched and start using it...</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090195\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090195\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T02:40:22\">2004-04-26T02:40:22</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Welcome back--good to hear from you!</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090196\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7d1c8d2b1a7643236a4661e9a974dee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\">George Hotelling</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090196\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T02:43:54\">2004-04-26T02:43:54</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">As Rands said[1], \"better is the enemy of done.\"  Glad to see you've finally launched!\n1: http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/04/19/heinous.html</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090197\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=99b77c34a0e26fd04a058f8c2dbab290&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090197\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T04:06:32\">2004-04-26T04:06:32</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">it's about friggin time.  :-P</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090199\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.innoq.com/blog/st\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=afd6dc452bc20f8f06612d4792bb8be3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.innoq.com/blog/st\">Stefan Tilkov</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090199\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T11:10:04\">2004-04-26T11:10:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Even the links were good, but this is great.

    "body": "So.  It's been awhile since I spent much time here actually writing.  The [quick links][links] have been fun, but they're just not the same as really posting something of my own.  There've been numerous reasons for my semi-disappearance, but I think I'd finally like to come back now.  Maybe I'll even spend a few entries writing about what's happened over the past year or so.  It's been a bit of a trip.\r\n\r\nBut first, I've got to get this new site launched.  By the time you read this, there will have been some changes.  It will have been a little over a year since the last time I did [something drastic][drastic] around here.  In fact, I'd intended this to happen right around [this site's birthday][birthday], but I think I needed to read [Joel on Software on Perfectionism][perfectionism], and [mamamusing's Talking Heads reference][talkingheads], to get me to finally bite the bullet and push the button.\r\n\r\nThere's bound to be bugs and problems galore here, but I've got to get past the tinkering and strip away my excuses for not actually writing here.  I actually started putting this new site together back in early December, and have been putzing around since.  Now that it's just about there, I realize I'm actually afraid to start writing again.  (As if I were any sort of writer worth reading before.  Bah.  Get over it.)\r\n\r\nHere it is, then.  I'm back to using Movable Type, probably just in time to fuss about upgrading to 3.0.  Nothing wrong with [blosxom][blosxom], or [pyblosxom][pyblosxom] for that matter, but a confluence of available plugins, exasperation, and fiddling brought me back.  I think the result's turned out rather nifty, so one of my first runs of entries will be a sort of colophon.  Maybe someone else will find something worthwhile in that.  \r\n\r\nThis time, I've gone from having a wiki and a blog to having a wiki, a blog, and a linkblog.  (There've got to be better words for these things.)  The links were mashed up with the rare blog entry, and I got more than one comment wishing they were separate.  Makes sense to me.  So...  three separate parts to this site, each separate for a reason, but all intermingled too.\r\n\r\nAnyway, before I ramble on too much longer about an idea which might just be NeatLikeDigitalWatches instead of *actually* neat, I should get this thing launched and start using it...\r\n\r\n[links]: /links/\r\n[drastic]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/colophon/oooooa.html\r\n[birthday]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooooab.html\r\n[perfectionism]: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2004/04/22.html\r\n[talkingheads]: http://mamamusings.net/archives/2004/04/23/you_may_ask_yourself_how_did_i_get_here.php\r\n[blosxom]: http://www.blosxom.com/\r\n[pyblosxom]: http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/pyblosxom/\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090195\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090195\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T02:40:22\">2004-04-26T02:40:22</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Welcome back--good to hear from you!</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090196\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7d1c8d2b1a7643236a4661e9a974dee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\">George Hotelling</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090196\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T02:43:54\">2004-04-26T02:43:54</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">As Rands said[1], \"better is the enemy of done.\"  Glad to see you've finally launched!\r\n\r\n1: http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/04/19/heinous.html</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090197\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=99b77c34a0e26fd04a058f8c2dbab290&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090197\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T04:06:32\">2004-04-26T04:06:32</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">it's about friggin time.  :-P</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090199\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.innoq.com/blog/st\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=afd6dc452bc20f8f06612d4792bb8be3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.innoq.com/blog/st\">Stefan Tilkov</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090199\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T11:10:04\">2004-04-26T11:10:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Even the links were good, but this is great.

When version 2.0 moves past beta status, I will definitely reconsider.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083218\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.lesser-evil.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=849f8815a45832c8f0ae2aba14881eca&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.lesser-evil.com/\">Howard Jones</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083218\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-02-14T17:01:18\">2004-02-14T17:01:18</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Source is right there in the SourceForge CVS repository...</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083223\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c775a4d231ca5311e135a20d5543916b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">paul</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083223\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T08:49:17\">2004-04-26T08:49:17</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I enjoy reading nice things about colloquy because I think its a great client also, but contrary to the above post, it emphatically does support multiple servers.

Styles are simple OS X bundles wraped around a CSS file (at minimum) or a CSS file and a XSL file. Knowing this, the fact that Colloquy uses XML to store chat messages that come in over the network is no surprise to some. Pairing these three technologies gives us great flexibility when processing and displaying a message on screen.\n<br><br>\nThe process of formatting a message follows these steps, start to finish. First, wrap the message in a simple XML envelope, encoding any special characters and representing IRC styling as XHTML. This XML envelope gets transformed with the curent style&apos;s XSL file (or a built-in default XSL file). The resulting transformation from the XSL on the XML should be XHTML that can then be rendered with help from the style&apos;s CSS file. Rendering is done via Apple&apos;s Safari (WebKit) engine -- so the possibilities are endless (evidenced by the built-in iChat like Bubbles style).</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://www.javelin.cc/colloquy/developers.html\">Colloquy: Developers</a></cite></small></div>\n\n<p>\nColloquy is an IRC client for OS X that I just discovered this week,\nvia <a href=\"http://macslash.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/09/1649200&amp;mode=thread\">an article posted on MacSlash</a>.\nI&apos;ve been looking for a decent Cocoa-based app as an alternative\nto my use of <a href=\"http://xchataqua.sourceforge.net/\">X-Chat Aqua</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.conversation.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/\">Conversation</a>, and\n<a href=\"http://www.irssi.org\">irssi</a>.  Having never heard of Colloquy before,\nI figured I&apos;d check it out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nColloquy is a Cocoa app, and the source is available.  It&apos;s the first OS X\nIRC client I&apos;ve played with yet that most resembles what I expect out of a modern\nCocoa app.  Conversation is right there, too, but I don&apos;t see any source (no\noffence to the author) and it doesn&apos;t yet support multiple servers or AppleScript\n(although those are on the planned features list).\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBeyond all that, though, what has sucked me into Colloquy is the way IRC messages are\npresented and styled.  In case the introductory quotes haven&apos;t given you the idea, this\nthing pipelines XML, XSL, CSS, HTML, Javascript, and WebKit to provide\nan immensely flexible user-customizable, modular display style system.\nThere aren&apos;t that many styles yet, but conceivably anything one could\ndo with the pile of technologies above can be employed in presenting IRC\nmessages.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYes, you could make the case that this is an insane example of overkill.\nIf so, Conversation or a shell-based program is likely more your speed.\nAdmittedly, Colloquy is not a featherweight IRC client.\nBut I&apos;ve been thinking about this sort of inversion of web tech for awhile.\nInstead of the browser hosting the app, the app hosts the browser.  I&apos;ve been\ndoing a ton of tinkery UI work with HTML and JavaScript in my\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg2/\">news aggregator</a> and have come\nto appreciate the DOM and various things JavaScript makes possible in modern\nbrowsers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis has lately lead me to consider how a browser canvas\ncould be used as a sort of universal widget inside a native app... not at\nall unlike the way Colloquy uses it.  Apple&apos;s WebKit encapsulation makes it\njust about <a href=\"http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000077.php\">dead simple</a>\nto drop it into an app and integrate it.  In fact,\nfrom a shallow glance at the docs for WebKit, it seems even simpler to use than\nsome other GUI widgets in the Cocoa arsenal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo...  is this the start of more Cocoa apps embedding WebKit views, &quot;just for the\nfun of it&quot;?  Who knows, but it really appeals to my propensity for mixing and\nmatching different tech within the same project.  I suppose it&apos;s a sort of sick\naddiction I&apos;ve picked up from the Tower of Babel web development I&apos;ve been doing\nfor years, but it looks like fun to me!\n</p>\n"
