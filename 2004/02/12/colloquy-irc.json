It is a nice IRC program that makes good use of WebKit to provide easily customisable display.  Its ability to automatically identify yourself with a password to NickServ on the Freenode IRC network saves a lot of time.  It has one or two frustrating bugs that have prevented it from being my main IRC client.  When version 2.0 moves past beta status, I will definitely reconsider.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083218&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.lesser-evil.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=849f8815a45832c8f0ae2aba14881eca&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.lesser-evil.com/&quot;&gt;Howard Jones&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083218&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-02-14T17:01:18&quot;&gt;2004-02-14T17:01:18&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Source is right there in the SourceForge CVS repository...&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083223&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c775a4d231ca5311e135a20d5543916b&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;paul&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083223&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-04-26T08:49:17&quot;&gt;2004-04-26T08:49:17&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;I enjoy reading nice things about colloquy because I think its a great client also, but contrary to the above post, it emphatically does support multiple servers.
