This XML envelope gets transformed with the curent style&apos;s XSL file (or a built-in default XSL file). The resulting transformation from the XSL on the XML should be XHTML that can then be rendered with help from the style&apos;s CSS file. Rendering is done via Apple&apos;s Safari (WebKit) engine -- so the possibilities are endless (evidenced by the built-in iChat like Bubbles style).</blockquote>\n<div class=\"credit\" align=\"right\"><small>Source:<cite><a href=\"http://www.javelin.cc/colloquy/developers.html\">Colloquy: Developers</a></cite></small></div>\n\n<p>\nColloquy is an IRC client for OS X that I just discovered this week,\nvia <a href=\"http://macslash.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/09/1649200&amp;mode=thread\">an article posted on MacSlash</a>.\nI&apos;ve been looking for a decent Cocoa-based app as an alternative\nto my use of <a href=\"http://xchataqua.sourceforge.net/\">X-Chat Aqua</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.conversation.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/\">Conversation</a>, and\n<a href=\"http://www.irssi.org\">irssi</a>.  Having never heard of Colloquy before,\nI figured I&apos;d check it out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nColloquy is a Cocoa app, and the source is available.  It&apos;s the first OS X\nIRC client I&apos;ve played with yet that most resembles what I expect out of a modern\nCocoa app.  Conversation is right there, too, but I don&apos;t see any source (no\noffence to the author) and it doesn&apos;t yet support multiple servers or AppleScript\n(although those are on the planned features list).\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBeyond all that, though, what has sucked me into Colloquy is the way IRC messages are\npresented and styled.  In case the introductory quotes haven&apos;t given you the idea, this\nthing pipelines XML, XSL, CSS, HTML, Javascript, and WebKit to provide\nan immensely flexible user-customizable, modular display style system.\nThere aren&apos;t that many styles yet, but conceivably anything one could\ndo with the pile of technologies above can be employed in presenting IRC\nmessages.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYes, you could make the case that this is an insane example of overkill.\nIf so, Conversation or a shell-based program is likely more your speed.\nAdmittedly, Colloquy is not a featherweight IRC client.\nBut I&apos;ve been thinking about this sort of inversion of web tech for awhile.\nInstead of the browser hosting the app, the app hosts the browser.  I&apos;ve been\ndoing a ton of tinkery UI work with HTML and JavaScript in my\n<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg2/\">news aggregator</a> and have come\nto appreciate the DOM and various things JavaScript makes possible in modern\nbrowsers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis has lately lead me to consider how a browser canvas\ncould be used as a sort of universal widget inside a native app... not at\nall unlike the way Colloquy uses it.  Apple&apos;s WebKit encapsulation makes it\njust about <a href=\"http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000077.php\">dead simple</a>\nto drop it into an app and integrate it.  In fact,\nfrom a shallow glance at the docs for WebKit, it seems even simpler to use than\nsome other GUI widgets in the Cocoa arsenal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo...  is this the start of more Cocoa apps embedding WebKit views, &quot;just for the\nfun of it&quot;?  Who knows, but it really appeals to my propensity for mixing and\nmatching different tech within the same project.  I suppose it&apos;s a sort of sick\naddiction I&apos;ve picked up from the Tower of Babel web development I&apos;ve been doing\nfor years, but it looks like fun to me!\n</p>\n",
