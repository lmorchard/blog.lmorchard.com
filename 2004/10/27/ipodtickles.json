I never thought about the wishlist thing in those terms, but it fits!\n</code></pre><p>I&#39;m actually starting to think this might be a good way to handle information overload.  Like, establish some rules or set up some learning (ie. bayes or whatnot), toss in a shuffle, and filter a firehose through it.   (ie. 611 RSS feeds I&#39;ve subscribed to)</p>\n<p>I couldn&#39;t possibly process everything from the firehose, so a jug or two from it is better than nothing-- and a swig fuzzily selected from the better parts is better still.  </p>\n<p>The idea is not to even try to get everything, but make the best of what I can actually use in a particular context. (like the current song, or a wishlist item, or a few dozen news items)</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085232&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=253a2f7c5fcc1f5e32305e099f61b517&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Michael McCracken&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085232&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-10-28T00:57:50&quot;&gt;2004-10-28T00:57:50&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;I agree - pondering this kind of thing is fun : http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/computers/mac/music/Shuffle.html\n</code></pre><p>I figured that the best way is to have it try to guess based on how you already interact with it instead of making you rate things (I have had iTunes for years and still mostly not rated the songs.)</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085234&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085234&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-10-28T06:56:33&quot;&gt;2004-10-28T06:56:33&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Hmm. although, for info overload that isn&#39;t quite tickling yourself (not with RSS feeds anyway) because not all of the input is your own.\n</code></pre><p>And, Michael:  Yeah, that&#39;s something I&#39;ve started thinking about too.  Wondering how hard it would be to come up with a little assistant that asked at each transition between songs, &quot;Was that a good transition?&quot;  You give a thumbs up / thumbs down, or maybe some stars, and after awhile the thing can start building playlists.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for me, the Party Shuffle mode isn&#39;t available for use when playing songs off the iPod in iTunes.  Otherwise, I&#39;d say that&#39;d be a perfect mode to tinker with a small window of song order</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085235&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.thisisugly.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f00168c288303440de42385307ad045&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.thisisugly.com/&quot;&gt;brian p&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085235&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-10-30T11:50:08&quot;&gt;2004-10-30T11:50:08&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;great idea on the comments, i hadn&#39;t even thought of that. i mostly use the genre to filter, but i&#39;m inspired. the 30k songs are a bit daunting tho.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
