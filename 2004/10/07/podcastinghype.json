I can speed read and I want to get through this quickly, but I can&apos;t speed listen.  I want to throw a bookmark at <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">del.icio.us</a> if I like it, but I can&apos;t select any text.  Getting a bit bored, I start thinking about how maybe I might want to remix this crap, make a funky beat out of all the utterances of &#x201C;um&#x201D;, &#x201C;ahh&#x201D;, and &#x201C;err&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>So, yeah, this sucks.  Not picking on any particular audio blogger or post -- because they&apos;re almost all like this -- but I want that 4 minutes of my life back.</p>\n<p>But the thing is, I&apos;m a news radio junkie.  I abandoned listening to music over the air almost seven years ago, so when I&apos;m not listening to MP3 CDRs, my car tuner is almost perpetually locked on NPR.  I listen to people jabbering at me at almost all times while I&apos;m driving.  And at work, I mix listening to my MP3s with streaming talk, news, and old sci-fi radio stations.</p>\n<p>The difference here is that radio doesn&apos;t demand much of my attention.  I&apos;m usually doing something else while I&apos;m listening, like driving or working.  I don&apos;t have to navigate to anything, I don&apos;t have to provide any feedback or make any decisions--I just have to let it stream into my head.

The idea is that, when you leave home, you take the digital audio player with you, loaded up with your own personal radio programming.  Not having an iPod, I&apos;ve been queuing these aggregated audio posts up in iTunes at work, and I&apos;ve been playing around with burning CDRW&apos;s for use in my car&apos;s in-dash MP3 player.
