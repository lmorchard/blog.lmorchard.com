Regarding your usage, have you thought about moving your PowerBook&#39;s iTunes Library file to your file server? You could then manage the iPod from the file server&#39;s library. If you still want to be able to sync the iPod on the go, you might set up a separate account on your PowerBook whose iTunes Library is local and use fast user switching to go back and forth when you want to sync. Not seamless but it should work. At least I hope it does--that&#39;s how I want to go when I start converting all my CDs.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085756&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8a5273f79cfe7579ad46023f93377aa8&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/&quot;&gt;l.m.orchard&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085756&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-10-20T10:05:30&quot;&gt;2004-10-20T10:05:30&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Tim:  I think I have some more playing to do, but moving my iTunes Library to the network server wasn&#39;t quite working.  There *is* the option to do so in the preferences, but things don&#39;t seem right: CDs still import to the local drive, and it doesn&#39;t seem like any metadata gets saved there.\n</code></pre><p>And then there&#39;s also the issue of how the thing acts when the network share isn&#39;t available, and how I can maybe get the share automounted when I go online at home.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221085757&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.8dot3.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f30594f4e2c18629d6ea60845cf00802&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.8dot3.com&quot;&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221085757&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-10-20T10:27:23&quot;&gt;2004-10-20T10:27:23&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;I&#39;m very jealous Les...I&#39;ve been coveting a iPod for quite some time now..\n</code></pre><p>I&#39;ve promised myself I could get one once I get my MP3 collection squared away and organized.

The way I supported it was to make a smart playlist called &quot;entropy&quot; which is set to only include songs which haven&#39;t been played in the last 6 months (this number goes up if anything sneaks into my iPod which has been played recently when there&#39;s still unplayed stuff which isn&#39;t on it), arranged by album, limited to 25GB (I have a 30GB model).  Then I have a playlist called &quot;currently digging&quot; for the purpose of loading specific albums on.  Finally, I set the iPod to shuffle by album.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
