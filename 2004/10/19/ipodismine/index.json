I was reminded of its presence in The Girl&#39;s office, still boxed up and shrink-wrapped, at a moment when I was thinking about podcasting and thinking about my lack of hard drive space.

Sure, I&#39;d been looking at the larger capacity models that came with a dock and remote, but this one was the right price at the right place and the right time.  I was also lucky that she had an iTrip she was selling that just happened to work satisfactorily for playing MP3s in my car - something that&#39;s been a bit of a quest of mine for years.

I miss the days when I had a 40GB library at work, but between company policy where I am now and having lost that whole library in a hard drive crash back then, I&apos;m hesitant to go there again.</p>\n<p>Enter the iPod.  I was reminded of its presence in The Girl&apos;s office, still boxed up and shrink-wrapped, at a moment when I was thinking about podcasting and thinking about my lack of hard drive space.  So, I gave in and snapped it up.  </p>\n<p>Thus far, I&apos;m pretty happy.  Sure, I&apos;d been looking at the larger capacity models that came with a dock and remote, but this one was the right price at the right place and the right time.  I was also lucky that she had an iTrip she was selling that just happened to work satisfactorily for playing MP3s in my car - something that&apos;s been a bit of a quest of mine for years.  While it&apos;s true I do have an in-dash Blaupunkt MP3 CD player in my Ford Focus now, it&apos;s also true that 20GB certainly outweighs 700MB.</p>\n<p>The few snags I&apos;ve run into so far mostly have to do with the fact that it seems like my desired usage pattern of the iPod isn&apos;t <em>quite</em> supported.  See, I don&apos;t want to have a massive library on my PowerBook, to be synched in part onto my iPod.  I have a library on a file server at home, and I want to use the iPod alternately as a music store away from home for iTunes on my PowerBook and as an MP3 player while I&apos;m driving.  I don&apos;t want any music at all on my PowerBook.  Problem is, though, the iPod isn&apos;t <em>quite</em> a first-class citizen in iTunes.  Party Shuffle doesn&apos;t work, and I had a few problems with making sure metadata (like ratings and last played date) made it into iTunes.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and I wish they&apos;d turn down the wheel sensitivity <strong>way</strong> down when setting a song&apos;s rating.  At present, it&apos;s just a bare millimeter of a finger&apos;s twitch to leap from 1 to 5 stars.  Might just be me.</p>\n<p>But, for the most part, I&apos;m very happy to have my own music at work again, and the potential of tinkering with smart playlists and podcasts are exciting to me.  That, and the fourth-generation iPod is just an elegant, slick joy to hold.</p>\n"
