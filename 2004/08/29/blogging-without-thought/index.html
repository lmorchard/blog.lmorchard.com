Amen, blog brother (with thanks to Quirk Blog for the pointer).  I wonder if I need to go on a Month of Blogging, complete with t-shirts, spewing here daily like a sort of NaBlogWriMo?  
One should never put blogging on a pedestal, really.  I mean, while I do aspire to doing some real writing (when I&#39;m not so busy with work, as I have been of late), my blog-a-day writing shouldn&#39;t be all that painful.  It looks like my server&#39;s on its last legs and the act of posting itself takes forever, so belaboring the actual content so much just puts the last straw on the shaven yak&#39;s back.
So, here goes... posty posty post, as they say on LiveJournal.  (Well, I seem to remember someone saying that anyway.)" />
