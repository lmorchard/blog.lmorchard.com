Here&#39;s a teaser diagram:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/dbagg3-phase1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>It&#39;s a feed aggregator, my third attempt at such.  At present, things are roughly close to the diagram above.  Everything is clunky and command-line driven at present--but I&#39;ve got further plans, like a REST API for feed queries and manipulation of various things such as feed subscriptions and the read/unread state of items.  Pair this with an XSLT-driven browser UI, and the possibility of other clients (not the least of include other Atom-consuming aggregators).</p>\n<p>The goal is to make a <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/ClientServerAggregator\">Client/Server Aggregator</a>.  Somewhat serendipitously, I just caught Bob DuCharme&#39;s xml.com <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/08/04/tr-xml.html\">article on Amazon.com&#39;s web services</a>, which <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1\">I really like</a> and have drawn inspiration from in thinking about this new aggregator.  Eventually, I want to offer the same sort of XML+XSL style of service that they&#39;ve put together, along with some futher inspiration from the <a href=\"http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/api/atom-api-spec.php\">Atom API</a>.  </p>\n<p>Anyway, as another teaser, check out this early demo involving the XML this thing has been producing, coupled with some experimental XSL:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/demo.xml\">dbagg3 demo page</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You&#39;ll notice that there are three URLs involved here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi\">An XSLT processor service</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl\">An XSLT stylesheet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/demo.xml\">Some aggregated Atom feeds</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The XSLT expects Atom (plus a few extensions of my own), so you can also do things like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.diveintomark.org/xml/atom.xml\">Dive Into Mark</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/index.atom\">Intertwingly</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.decafbad.com/blog/atom.xml\">0xDECAFBAD</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are the sorts of tricks I was looking forward to when I started thinking about things like a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/17/use_atom_for_a_universal_blog_transfer_protocol\">universal blog transfer format</a> and <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/03/put_on_your_rsscolored_glasses_and_forget_about_atom\">rose-colored glasses</a>.  XSLT used like this could just as easily produce a blog or RSS 2.0 content.</p>\n<p>Anyway, hoping to get some code into CVS by this weekend that&#39;s not entirely embarassing.  So if you&#39;re interested in this stuff, stay tuned.  I&#39;m hoping that this thing can provide a base for others interested in feed aggregation--if you just want to play with UI, use the scanning and storage as-is and tinker with XSLT; if you want to play with storage and query, leave the scanning and UI alone; if you want to tinker with parsing... er, <a href=\"http://www.feedparser.org/\">talk to Mark Pilgrim</a>.</p>\n<p>More soon!  </p>\n<p>(Oh yeah, and I <em>will</em> be working on coming up with a better name than <code>dbagg3</code>.  Unfortunately, I probably won&#39;t be coming up with a more visually appealing design for the UI, since what you see is the best I can do.  Heh, heh.  Don&#39;t let your programmers do visual design...)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084326\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.nur-eine-i.de\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e7368d797917d0df7942c26d4ed2e580&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://blog.nur-eine-i.de\">Benjamin</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084326\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-08-05T10:22:30\">2004-08-05T10:22:30</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">This is great. It seems that this could be the base, for what I&#39;ve been dreaming/thinking about the last half year or so. In contrast to you, I haven&#39;t come up with any code yet (mostly due to the fact, that I don&#39;t python yet, and I found no other reasonably good feed parser, than the Universal Feed Parser), but with a name: Roosster \n\nFeatures I&#39;d really like to have in such a ClientServerAggregator are:\n(a) search over entries the aggregator has seen to date\n(b) add and arbitrary number of notes to any entry\n(c) add multiple category-tags to entries\n(d) interlink entries (I know this could be solved by some &#39;Related Entries&#39; stuff, but somtimes I don&#39;t trust these &quot;automatic classifiers&quot;)\n\nCan&#39;t wait, until I can take a look at the code and see if I can extend it. This would finally be a real reason to learn python.\n\nBy the way, I really like the interface. Might be, that&#39;s because I&#39;m a programmer too?!</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221084328&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e1cc8e7103bb0f77a7d7abf91b1a961b&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Christopher Drake&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221084328&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-08-05T18:30:41&quot;&gt;2004-08-05T18:30:41&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Very nice. The demo has me salivating a little.\n</code></pre><p>Oddly enough, I like the UI. If you can slim it down, side-to-side-wise a bit, it would also be a great aggregator to rip whole chunks from and feed to a Palm Pilot or PocketPC, as well. They&#39;re not as big as they were in the past, but with decent strides every couple of weeks, they still have a lot of following. Your page-width is dynamic, and that means a lot to me, a Palm user.</p>\n<p>A feature I&#39;d like to see is kind of like Bloglines, where you receive a small box of info from the RSS feed, or what-have-you to give you a taste of an article. If going 1 link deep from any link on the aggregator page linked to a small page with such a tidbit, it would make surfing the articles a lot faster. This would allow a PDA or cellphone to drag an aggregator page 1 link deep with specialised software and get all of the highlights from say, 20 blogs.</p>\n<p>That could be a major boon, especially for people that connect while at wireless access points on business trips, etc.</p>\n<p>Keep it up, this looks like it&#39;ll rock when you are done.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221084331&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://b4mad.net/datenbrei/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0038a1e9f4492e2f964f0f39d2d0dc7f&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://b4mad.net/datenbrei/&quot;&gt;Christoph Görn&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221084331&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-08-08T12:41:08&quot;&gt;2004-08-08T12:41:08&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Hi,\n</code></pre><p> and I will try to plug an jabber/XMPP bot into it, so it will deliver the aggragated content rigth to my beloved IM app...</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
