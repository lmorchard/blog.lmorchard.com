          <p><strong>Update</strong>: I&#39;ve just dumped what code I have into my CVS repository.  So, go ahead and poke fun at it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg3/">http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg3/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Or, fetch it from CVS:</p>
<pre><code>$ cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@www.decafbad.com:/cvsroot login
(Logging in to anoncvs@www.decafbad.com)
CVS password: anoncvs
$ cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@www.decafbad.com:/cvsroot co dbagg3
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>So, besides the funk, there&#39;s a little project in which I&#39;ve gotten immersed.  Here&#39;s a teaser diagram:</p>
<img src="http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/dbagg3-phase1.jpg" />

<p>It&#39;s a feed aggregator, my third attempt at such.  At present, things are roughly close to the diagram above.  Everything is clunky and command-line driven at present--but I&#39;ve got further plans, like a REST API for feed queries and manipulation of various things such as feed subscriptions and the read/unread state of items.  Pair this with an XSLT-driven browser UI, and the possibility of other clients (not the least of include other Atom-consuming aggregators).</p>
<p>The goal is to make a <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/ClientServerAggregator">Client/Server Aggregator</a>.  Somewhat serendipitously, I just caught Bob DuCharme&#39;s xml.com <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/08/04/tr-xml.html">article on Amazon.com&#39;s web services</a>, which <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1">I really like</a> and have drawn inspiration from in thinking about this new aggregator.  Eventually, I want to offer the same sort of XML+XSL style of service that they&#39;ve put together, along with some futher inspiration from the <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/api/atom-api-spec.php">Atom API</a>.  </p>
<p>Anyway, as another teaser, check out this early demo involving the XML this thing has been producing, coupled with some experimental XSL:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/demo.xml">dbagg3 demo page</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You&#39;ll notice that there are three URLs involved here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi">An XSLT processor service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl">An XSLT stylesheet</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/demo.xml">Some aggregated Atom feeds</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The XSLT expects Atom (plus a few extensions of my own), so you can also do things like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.diveintomark.org/xml/atom.xml">Dive Into Mark</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/index.atom">Intertwingly</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/xsltproc.cgi?xsl=http://www.decafbad.com/2004/08/dbagg3-demo/new.xsl&#38;xml=http://www.decafbad.com/blog/atom.xml">0xDECAFBAD</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are the sorts of tricks I was looking forward to when I started thinking about things like a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/17/use_atom_for_a_universal_blog_transfer_protocol">universal blog transfer format</a> and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/03/put_on_your_rsscolored_glasses_and_forget_about_atom">rose-colored glasses</a>.  XSLT used like this could just as easily produce a blog or RSS 2.0 content.</p>
<p>Anyway, hoping to get some code into CVS by this weekend that&#39;s not entirely embarassing.  So if you&#39;re interested in this stuff, stay tuned.  I&#39;m hoping that this thing can provide a base for others interested in feed aggregation--if you just want to play with UI, use the scanning and storage as-is and tinker with XSLT; if you want to play with storage and query, leave the scanning and UI alone; if you want to tinker with parsing... er, <a href="http://www.feedparser.org/">talk to Mark Pilgrim</a>.</p>
<p>More soon!  </p>
<p>(Oh yeah, and I <em>will</em> be working on coming up with a better name than <code>dbagg3</code>.  Unfortunately, I probably won&#39;t be coming up with a more visually appealing design for the UI, since what you see is the best I can do.  Heh, heh.  Don&#39;t let your programmers do visual design...)</p>

<div class="content">This is great. It seems that this could be the base, for what I've been dreaming/thinking about the last half year or so. In contrast to you, I haven't come up with any code yet (mostly due to the fact, that I don't python yet, and I found no other reasonably good feed parser, than the Universal Feed Parser), but with a name: Roosster 
Features I'd really like to have in such a ClientServerAggregator are:
(a) search over entries the aggregator has seen to date
(b) add and arbitrary number of notes to any entry
(c) add multiple category-tags to entries
(d) interlink entries (I know this could be solved by some 'Related Entries' stuff, but somtimes I don't trust these "automatic classifiers")
Can't wait, until I can take a look at the code and see if I can extend it. This would finally be a real reason to learn python.
By the way, I really like the interface. Might be, that's because I'm a programmer too?!</div>

<div class="content">Very nice. The demo has me salivating a little.
Oddly enough, I like the UI. If you can slim it down, side-to-side-wise a bit, it would also be a great aggregator to rip whole chunks from and feed to a Palm Pilot or PocketPC, as well. They're not as big as they were in the past, but with decent strides every couple of weeks, they still have a lot of following. Your page-width is dynamic, and that means a lot to me, a Palm user.
A feature I'd like to see is kind of like Bloglines, where you receive a small box of info from the RSS feed, or what-have-you to give you a taste of an article. If going 1 link deep from any link on the aggregator page linked to a small page with such a tidbit, it would make surfing the articles a lot faster. This would allow a PDA or cellphone to drag an aggregator page 1 link deep with specialised software and get all of the highlights from say, 20 blogs.
That could be a major boon, especially for people that connect while at wireless access points on business trips, etc.
Keep it up, this looks like it'll rock when you are done.</div>
