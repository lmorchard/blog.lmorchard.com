This article brings two thoughts to mind for me...</p>\n<p>First is this:  Of course, if you&#39;re striving for some semblance of realism in games, the costs will likely approach and exceed the cost to produce movies.  It&#39;ll approach the cost because, eventually, you&#39;ll need either movie-grade animators or real actors.  And then it&#39;ll exceed the cost, because who wants a game that&#39;s as linear as a 2-hour movie?  If you want any replay value out of the thing, you&#39;re going to have to produce the equivalent of a 4-hour movie at least, if not a 20- to 40-hour movie.  And then, you&#39;re going to have to be satisfied that many players will miss most of it.

These shows are great, and I&#39;m thinking of buying a few box sets of them.  These old radio shows get quite a bit of mileage out of their less technologically advanced medium.  In contrast to this, my consumption of contemporary and popular television, movies, and music has been dropping off from year to year as I get more tired of supremely well-produced yet worthless content.</p>\n<p>Music gets sold on anything but a good tune, movies sold on special effects over plot, and video games head toward technological supremacy over a fun hook or even an engaging story line.

There were a lot of horrible games.  But, for games to be successful back when the dazzle factor of the hardware was low, you needed the fun trick or clever twist that addicted players.
