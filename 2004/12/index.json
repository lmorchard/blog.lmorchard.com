This is a sort of rough sketch of the loosely-joined architecture I want to explore with this thing.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Data</em>: This is where address book entries live.</li>\n<li><em>Model</em>: A set of objects encapsulating the data, this is how address book entries will be accessed.</li>\n<li><em>REST API</em>: Model objects exposed as resources identified by URI, serialized and deserialized as XML, and manipulated by GET / PUT / POST / DELETE methods.</li>\n<li><em>XSLT Filter</em>: XML data produced by REST API calls can be first passed through XSL at a given URL before being served up as a response.  </li>\n<li><em>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</em>: Thanks to the XSLT filter layer, the XML vocabulary used to describe address book entries can be transformed into user interface presentation.</li>\n<li><em>HTTP</em>: Everything happens via HTTP...</li>\n<li><em>Web Browser Client</em>: ...and everything is viewed in a web browser.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, I call this a loosely-joined architecture because I want to stress that you should be able to swap out just about any part of this whenever you want.  </p>\n<p>Want the <em>Data</em> to be in MySQL?  Fine.  Want it to be in flat files?  Fine.  Just make sure the <em>Model</em> can cope while maintaining a consistent interface for the <em>REST API*.  Want to change the user interface in the browser?  Great-- ideally, all you have to do is change some XSLT files.  I&#39;m writing everything from the *XSLT Filter</em> down to the <em>Model</em> in Python.  Don&#39;t like that?  Fine.  Rewrite it all in Perl, and hopefully everything from the XSLT up to the browser will still be useful to you.</p>\n<p>At some point, you might even want to ditch the browser for a native desktop client.  Fabulous! Just ignore everything past the <em>REST API</em> and <em>HTTP</em>, don&#39;t use any XSLT in the <em>Filter</em>, and use the API and XML directly.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t think any of this is particularly revolutionary-- although I thought it was when I first saw Amazon Web Services doing some of this, and I hope to throw a little GMail in as well.  I hope that this will all be useful as I muddle through explaining what I&#39;m doing.

    "summary": "<img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/12/abook-architecture.jpg\" align=\"right\">\n\n<p>So, in the spirit of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/11/30/picoprojects_and_trepanation\">pico-projects</a>, I&apos;ve started building <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/11/30/nextgenwebapps\">that address book application</a> I mentioned awhile ago and I want to start writing about it as I go.</p>\n<p>First off, hopefully you&apos;ll notice the quick diagram I threw together in OmniGraffle.  This is a sort of rough sketch of the loosely-joined architecture I want to explore with this thing.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Data</em>: This is where address book entries live.</li>\n<li><em>Model</em>: A set of objects encapsulating the data, this is how address book entries will be accessed.</li>\n<li><em>REST API</em>: Model objects exposed as resources identified by URI, serialized and deserialized as XML, and manipulated by GET / PUT / POST / DELETE methods.</li>\n<li><em>XSLT Filter</em>: XML data produced by REST API calls can be first passed through XSL at a given URL before being served up as a response.  </li>\n<li><em>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</em>: Thanks to the XSLT filter layer, the XML vocabulary used to describe address book entries can be transformed into user interface presentation.</li>\n<li><em>HTTP</em>: Everything happens via HTTP...</li>\n<li><em>Web Browser Client</em>: ...and everything is viewed in a web browser.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, I call this a loosely-joined architecture because I want to stress that you should be able to swap out just about any part of this whenever you want.  </p>\n<p>Want the <em>Data</em> to be in MySQL?  Fine.  Want it to be in flat files?  Fine.  Just make sure the <em>Model</em> can cope while maintaining a consistent interface for the <em>REST API*.  Want to change the user interface in the browser?  Great-- ideally, all you have to do is change some XSLT files.  I&apos;m writing everything from the *XSLT Filter</em> down to the <em>Model</em> in Python.  Don&apos;t like that?  Fine.  Rewrite it all in Perl, and hopefully everything from the XSLT up to the browser will still be useful to you.</p>\n<p>At some point, you might even want to ditch the browser for a native desktop client.  Fabulous! Just ignore everything past the <em>REST API</em> and <em>HTTP</em>, don&apos;t use any XSLT in the <em>Filter</em>, and use the API and XML directly.</p>\n<p>I don&apos;t think any of this is particularly revolutionary-- although I thought it was when I first saw Amazon Web Services doing some of this, and I hope to throw a little GMail in as well.  I hope that this will all be useful as I muddle through explaining what I&apos;m doing.  In the meantime, you can see me getting the stage set as I start checking things into my Subversion repository over here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/svn/trunk/hacks/abook/\">http://www.decafbad.com/svn/trunk/hacks/abook/</a></li></ul>"

We had cool ansi-graphic art. We had doors games. Trade Wars, BRE, and some others. We had a download section but not much was on it. And we ran Fidonet (sort of like Usenet but using a different protocol and shared among BBSes), Vnet (RPG-oriented net that used Fido technology), and CandyNet (also RPG-centric net that used Fido tech). This was a great hobby, I had lots of fun. But, it seems like in this day and age, I'd rather just run a web site than try to do a full fledged BBS. What could I really offer using BBS software that I can't do on a website? Other than maybe doors games, but I'd rather play World of Warcraft or Half-Life 2 multi than those.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086442\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c80cacc8feb903332fc8939c80ae495e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">ArcAiN6</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086442\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-05T20:02:16\">2006-09-05T20:02:16</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Synchronet is easy peasy, i'm currently running it, and i love the thing.. :)</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

We had cool ansi-graphic art. We had doors games. Trade Wars, BRE, and some others. We had a download section but not much was on it. And we ran Fidonet (sort of like Usenet but using a different protocol and shared among BBSes), Vnet (RPG-oriented net that used Fido technology), and CandyNet (also RPG-centric net that used Fido tech). This was a great hobby, I had lots of fun. But, it seems like in this day and age, I'd rather just run a web site than try to do a full fledged BBS. What could I really offer using BBS software that I can't do on a website? Other than maybe doors games, but I'd rather play World of Warcraft or Half-Life 2 multi than those.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086442\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c80cacc8feb903332fc8939c80ae495e&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">ArcAiN6</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086442\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-09-05T20:02:16\">2006-09-05T20:02:16</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Synchronet is easy peasy, i'm currently running it, and i love the thing.. :)</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

    "summary": "<blockquote>Synchronet Bulletin Board System Software is a free software package that can turn your personal computer into your own custom online service supporting multiple simultaneous users with hierarchical message and file areas, multi-user chat, and the ever-popular BBS door games.\n<br><br>\n...\n<br><br>\nIn November of 1999, the author found a renewed interest in further developing Synchronet, specifically for the Internet community, embracing and integrating standard Internet protocols such as Telnet, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IRC, NNTP, and HTTP. Synchronet has since been substantially redesigned as an Internet-only BBS package for Win32 and Unix-x86 platforms and is an Open Source project under continuous development.</blockquote>\n<div align=\"right\"><small>Source: <cite><a href=\"http://www.synchro.net/\">Synchronet BBS Software</a></cite></small></div>\n\n<p>This software deserves <em>so</em> much more attention.  It&apos;s like an old-school BBS, complete with ASCII/ANSI menu screens and everything, but it&apos;s been modernized:  It offers a slew of Internet protocols integrated with the message bases and file areas.  It&apos;s got an HTTP daemon with server-side JavaScript.  It works on Win32 and various Unix platforms.  Everything above is true.  And it&apos;s open source.</p>\n<p>In the 90&apos;s, I would have expected software like this to be at the core of a startup company stuffed with superfluous and overpaid code monkeys.  It would have turned into an Enterprise Application Server or Intranet Knowledge Management Solution-- a mini Domino or Lotus Notes.  And, in fact, I seem to remember seeing a few old-school BBS packages get mutated and gigantified by the dot-com radiation in this way.</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/02/15/ooooai\">keep meaning</a> to get a Synchronet BBS up and keep it up, and maybe get a few interested users logging in, if only for the retro-gaming experience for things like <a href=\"http://www.eisonline.com/TradeWars/\">Trade Wars</a>, <a href=\"http://www.johndaileysoftware.com/products/bbsdoors/barrenrealmselite/index.asp\">Barrent Realms Elite</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gameport.com/bbs/lord.html\">Legend of the Red Dragon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.johndaileysoftware.com/products/bbsdoors/globalwar/\">Global War</a>, and anything else I can find.</p>\n<p>I really miss the tidal-pool effect BBSes had back in the day, when in my area they were the first and best gateways to the Internet.  Direct SLIP and PPP access to the net were rare things still and, before the web took off, Usenet and IRC were some of the best things around.  But, anyone who wanted to get the the net had to wander through the local BBS first.  </p>\n<p>It was really neat to see the mish-mash of people all drawn together by geographic areas denoted by telco area codes.  The degree of Aspergers affliction and just plain dysfunctional nerdity gradually decreased as sisters and friends-of-sisters were introduced to terminal programs and teleconference.  It was sad to see all of this gradually die off as more and more callers came in via SLIP/PPP dialers and headed straight for the information superhighway on-ramps.

    "html": "<p>One thing I&#39;m really looking forward to is seeing the PC explode and turn inside out, like the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Home+Motor%22+%248.75+catalog+-domain&#38;btnG=Search\">Home Motor</a>.  The price of processors drops, while their power increases.  So far in computing, the processor has been a pricey central resource, demanding to be shared between programs and peripherals.  But soon, it won&#39;t be too far fetched to think of a processor as the least precious part.  In fact, computers could get so cheap as to be given away, while well-built tools and appliances--more than just <em>software</em> alone--become the valuable thing.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve already ditched a central desktop computer, and sometimes this makes me feel like I&#39;m living in the future.  I used to have a machine that I used for everything-- network services, web browsing, email, IM, file storage, movies, games, et al.  However, slowly but surely, all the things this one machine used to do for me are being split off into simpler, dedicated devices.  It&#39;s like all the internal organs of my old PC are being splattered throughout our apartment.</p>\n<p>At some point, my network services migrated into a dedicated Linux box, and now have gotten swallowed up by a <a href=\"http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=508&#38;scid=35\">Linksys WRT54G</a> wireless router.   It doesn&#39;t do anything other than perform firewall duties and manage my home network.  The Linux box still lives on as a file server, but pretty soon I&#39;ll be migrating those responsibilities onto a <a href=\"http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=33-124-036&#38;catalog=23&#38;manufactory=BROWSE\">Linksys NSLU2</a> Network Storage Link or maybe a <a href=\"http://www.revolutionstore.com/\">Kurobox</a>.  Which ever one I choose, that device will focus on managing my digital <em>stuff</em>.  In our living room, we&#39;ve got a slew of dedicated gaming consoles, including a modded XBox that plays music and movies from the file server in the basement.  </p>\n<p>What&#39;s great about this is that each device generally does just one thing, does it well, and does it without much fuss or interference with the workings of the other devices.  My internet connection or file server never goes down because a game crashed my computer, and maintenance of these focused devices is much simpler than looking after a single overloaded computer.  My primary personal machine at this point is an Apple PowerBook, which I still use for web, email, IM, general geek hackery, and the occasional session with Microsoft Office.  It&#39;s just a start, but I&#39;m sure this trend will continue as I find more things that can each be specialized out into its own separate appliance.  </p>\n<p>For instance, imagine an Office appliance: It wouldn&#39;t have much file storage--that&#39;s what my basement fileserver is for--but it would have more than enough memory and processor to run Office.  The whole Office <em>solution</em> (software, support, etc.) would be more valuable than the hardware to run it, so it might be simpler and easier for everyone involved (ie. the customer <em>and</em> Microsoft) to sell a fully configured and self-contained unit.  The Office user interface would be served up to my tablet display (maybe with a keyboard &#38; mouse) via something akin to X11.  The software would be installed as firmware on flash and would be the only thing running--no danger of DLL hell here.  </p>\n<p>Imagine something like the <a href=\"http://www.aarp.org/computers-hardware/Articles/a2003-05-20-mailstation.html\">MailStation</a>, but imagine it not sucking.  You could have a personal email server that just handles SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and spam filtering, with <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/\">Thunderbird</a> installed, dirt cheap.  </p>\n<p>Imagine other devices entirely devoted to news aggregation, or broadcatching, or pet-watching web cams.  It&#39;s starting to sound like a lot of expensive toys, but a pile of these devices would all cost less than the equivalent software running on a modern PC today.</p>\n<p>Now, think about interactions between appliances.  This isn&#39;t entirely fleshed out in my head, but I think attention here can go a long way toward solving some security issues present in PCs today.  Each appliance should be single-mindedly focused on its task, but if it needs functionality provided by another appliance, it should be able to negotiate for services.  Think of each appliance as having a role, and access to other appliances limited by role.</p>\n<p>What might happen if you pick up a nasty macro in a Word doc?  Say the macro wants to delete all of your files.  Well, you could have a current relationship between the file server and the Office appliance which limits access to only files in your current project.  The Office appliance would have no business pawing through yesterday&#39;s spreadsheets, your TurboTax records, or your home videos.  Maybe not perfect, but exposure could be limited.  </p>\n<p>Say instead the macro wants to fire off a million spam email messages.  Well, let&#39;s assume that email isn&#39;t a service of the Office appliance.  The first response to the macro would be, &quot;Uhh, what&#39;s email?&quot;  Maybe the Office appliance can&#39;t even conceive of a such thing as SMTP or port 25.  But then, say the macro author is smart enough to make Office look for a MailStation to ask for email transmission services.  At this point, the macro is stymied unless it can find a way to exploit a pre-existing relationship between Office and the MailStation to send a million email messages.</p>\n<p>More likely would be someone trying to compromise the MailStation via a maliciously-constructed email message.  But, in this case, maybe the single-task simplicity of the device would make it easier to prevent such exploit availability in the first place.  Avoid scriptable email transmission in a consumer device, watch out for buffer overruns or use managed code and virtual machines, reduce down to zero any possibility of sending an email without direct user input.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s a lot of work that would need to be done here to get the right balance between inter-appliance paranoia and end-user convenience, but I think that simpler task-focused devices isolated from each other but linked by task-centered agreements could go a long way toward killing the free-for-all playground environment spyware and virus authors have today.  Get all of the eggs out of one shared basket.  I expect some of the things I&#39;m thinking could be (and probably are) put in place today on general-purpose computers, but I have a lot of good hunches about benefits imparted by lots of simpler limited-purpose appliances.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086734\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=95ffb2598210ed1959f55d7a53f825dc&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\">Steve</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086734\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T17:27:05\">2004-12-13T17:27:05</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">TOTALLY agree on your thoughts on where computers/appliances will merge.\nI had the NSLU2, but just ordered this guy: http://www.furrygoat.com/2004/12/asus_wlan_hard_.html ..

The Router could swallow up your Linux Box, because the Router is supposed to do work in the background, it doesn't want interaction, this does not work for most of the things a PC is used for. I would say that the most interesting things \"being done\" with a PC actually need interaction (and thus an interface), the \"dumb\" background things are usually just supportive (or secondary) activities that are, well, secondary, and only ever have arisen as sub-tasks while trying to achieve primary purposes (things that require interaction).\nAll those primary purposes of a PC are interaction based, thus need display and input, and I don't think that people are willing to move to different displays and different input devices for every task they want to do. We have a lot of \"legacy devices\", that we are using a lot, because that's what we are used to, but I don't think they are going to multiply further, when we already have all the stuff at our fingertips.\nI would like to note that you are using a hacked X-Box, that is a specialized tool, re-programmed to be a (more) general purpose tool. \nThe fact that all of your machines are doing different things are self-imposed barriers, not hardware/software-limitations, which I think would makes a lot of people very skeptical.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "One thing I'm really looking forward to is seeing the PC explode and turn inside out, like the [Home Motor](http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Home+Motor%22+%248.75+catalog+-domain&#38;btnG=Search).  The price of processors drops, while their power increases.  So far in computing, the processor has been a pricey central resource, demanding to be shared between programs and peripherals.  But soon, it won't be too far fetched to think of a processor as the least precious part.  In fact, computers could get so cheap as to be given away, while well-built tools and appliances--more than just *software* alone--become the valuable thing.  \r\n\r\nI've already ditched a central desktop computer, and sometimes this makes me feel like I'm living in the future.  I used to have a machine that I used for everything-- network services, web browsing, email, IM, file storage, movies, games, et al.  However, slowly but surely, all the things this one machine used to do for me are being split off into simpler, dedicated devices.  It's like all the internal organs of my old PC are being splattered throughout our apartment.\r\n\r\nAt some point, my network services migrated into a dedicated Linux box, and now have gotten swallowed up by a [Linksys WRT54G](http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=508&#38;scid=35) wireless router.   It doesn't do anything other than perform firewall duties and manage my home network.  The Linux box still lives on as a file server, but pretty soon I'll be migrating those responsibilities onto a [Linksys NSLU2](http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=33-124-036&#38;catalog=23&#38;manufactory=BROWSE) Network Storage Link or maybe a [Kurobox](http://www.revolutionstore.com/).  Which ever one I choose, that device will focus on managing my digital *stuff*.  In our living room, we've got a slew of dedicated gaming consoles, including a modded XBox that plays music and movies from the file server in the basement.  \r\n\r\nWhat's great about this is that each device generally does just one thing, does it well, and does it without much fuss or interference with the workings of the other devices.  My internet connection or file server never goes down because a game crashed my computer, and maintenance of these focused devices is much simpler than looking after a single overloaded computer.  My primary personal machine at this point is an Apple PowerBook, which I still use for web, email, IM, general geek hackery, and the occasional session with Microsoft Office.  It's just a start, but I'm sure this trend will continue as I find more things that can each be specialized out into its own separate appliance.  \r\n\r\nFor instance, imagine an Office appliance: It wouldn't have much file storage--that's what my basement fileserver is for--but it would have more than enough memory and processor to run Office.  The whole Office *solution* (software, support, etc.) would be more valuable than the hardware to run it, so it might be simpler and easier for everyone involved (ie. the customer *and* Microsoft) to sell a fully configured and self-contained unit.  The Office user interface would be served up to my tablet display (maybe with a keyboard &#38; mouse) via something akin to X11.  The software would be installed as firmware on flash and would be the only thing running--no danger of DLL hell here.  \r\n\r\nImagine something like the [MailStation](http://www.aarp.org/computers-hardware/Articles/a2003-05-20-mailstation.html), but imagine it not sucking.  You could have a personal email server that just handles SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and spam filtering, with [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/) installed, dirt cheap.  \r\n\r\nImagine other devices entirely devoted to news aggregation, or broadcatching, or pet-watching web cams.  It's starting to sound like a lot of expensive toys, but a pile of these devices would all cost less than the equivalent software running on a modern PC today.\r\n\r\nNow, think about interactions between appliances.  This isn't entirely fleshed out in my head, but I think attention here can go a long way toward solving some security issues present in PCs today.  Each appliance should be single-mindedly focused on its task, but if it needs functionality provided by another appliance, it should be able to negotiate for services.  Think of each appliance as having a role, and access to other appliances limited by role.\r\n\r\nWhat might happen if you pick up a nasty macro in a Word doc?  Say the macro wants to delete all of your files.  Well, you could have a current relationship between the file server and the Office appliance which limits access to only files in your current project.  The Office appliance would have no business pawing through yesterday's spreadsheets, your TurboTax records, or your home videos.  Maybe not perfect, but exposure could be limited.  \r\n\r\nSay instead the macro wants to fire off a million spam email messages.  Well, let's assume that email isn't a service of the Office appliance.  The first response to the macro would be, \"Uhh, what's email?\"  Maybe the Office appliance can't even conceive of a such thing as SMTP or port 25.  But then, say the macro author is smart enough to make Office look for a MailStation to ask for email transmission services.  At this point, the macro is stymied unless it can find a way to exploit a pre-existing relationship between Office and the MailStation to send a million email messages.\r\n\r\nMore likely would be someone trying to compromise the MailStation via a maliciously-constructed email message.  But, in this case, maybe the single-task simplicity of the device would make it easier to prevent such exploit availability in the first place.  Avoid scriptable email transmission in a consumer device, watch out for buffer overruns or use managed code and virtual machines, reduce down to zero any possibility of sending an email without direct user input.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of work that would need to be done here to get the right balance between inter-appliance paranoia and end-user convenience, but I think that simpler task-focused devices isolated from each other but linked by task-centered agreements could go a long way toward killing the free-for-all playground environment spyware and virus authors have today.  Get all of the eggs out of one shared basket.  I expect some of the things I'm thinking could be (and probably are) put in place today on general-purpose computers, but I have a lot of good hunches about benefits imparted by lots of simpler limited-purpose appliances.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086734\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=95ffb2598210ed1959f55d7a53f825dc&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.furrygoat.com\">Steve</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086734\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T17:27:05\">2004-12-13T17:27:05</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">TOTALLY agree on your thoughts on where computers/appliances will merge.\r\n\r\nI had the NSLU2, but just ordered this guy: http://www.furrygoat.com/2004/12/asus_wlan_hard_.html ..

If my Office data was in a locked box, accessible only through its network API, it would be even less useful.\nIt would be nice to make all our \"stuff\" (data, software, hardware) available to us from whatever device we are using, or which is best suited to the task. However, the way to achieve this is not to get rid of the general-purpose computers. A better approach would be to improve the interoperability between the applications in the computer and the devices in the outside world.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085929\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.thok.org/bloggery\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2545d4ff0ba72eb5d5979186f4b02d85&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.thok.org/bloggery\">Mark Eichin</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085929\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-15T00:03:32\">2004-12-15T00:03:32</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Of course, these days, you probably don't want the home lathe either, just an account with emachineshop or some other easy cad-to-fab-to-fedex service :-)  I can't quite bring myself to stretch that into a Web Services metaphor, though...</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

However, these users didn't want meta lathes--they didn't even know what meta lathes were--they just wanted VisiCalc and WordStar and you needed one of these weird boxes to run them.  \r\n\r\nProblem is, the modern descendants of VisiCalc and WordStar have yet to be separated from the meta lathe platforms on which they were crafted.  It's like you've made a bracelet or a ring on the lathe--but instead of unclamping it and taking it off the machine, you just wear it: bracelet, lathe, and all.  Wouldn't it suck if someone accidentally plugged that thing in and turned it on while you were wearing it?\r\n\r\n[pacman]: http://www.geocities.jp/nchikada/pac/\r\n[visicalc]: http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1978.htm\r\n[homebrew]: http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1976.htm\r\n[embeddedlinux]: http://www.linuxdevices.com/\r\n[imovie]: http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/\r\n[garageband]: http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/\r\n[metallathe]: http://www.baileycraft.com/spsd400.htm\r\n[geb]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465026567/qid=1102711352/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-2224698-6674213?v=glance&#38;s=books&#38;n=507846\r\n[invisiblecomputer]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262640414/0xdecafbad-20\r\n[metallathepic]: http://www.baileycraft.com/sd400pic.htm\r\n[yinyang]: http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000356.html\r\n[laptops]: http://my.webmd.com/content/article/98/104676.htm?z=1728_00000_1000_nb_01\r\n[homeappliances]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/10/homebrew_entertainment_appliances_cheap_open_and_embattled\r\n[wherepcheaded]: http://www.fortune.com/fortune/fastforward/0,15704,955951,00.html\r\n[endofpcnigh]: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/01/15/the_end_of_the_pc/\r\n[kurobox]: http://www.revolutionstore.com/\r\n[linkstation]: http://www.buffalotech.com/wireless/products/NetworkProducts/HDH120LAN.html\r\n[linksys_nslu2]: http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Sections-article85-page1.php\r\n[gumstix]: http://www.gumstix.com/sys_tinycomp.html\r\n[jini_endofdesktop]: http://www.artima.com/jini/jiniology/vision2.html\r\n[home_motor]: http://gc.sfc.keio.ac.jp/class/2003_gc00001/slides/15/15.html\r\n[home_motor_search]: http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Home+Motor%22+%248.75+catalog+-domain&#38;btnG=Search\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085925\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085925\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T14:03:16\">2004-12-13T14:03:16</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">You know, it's a tough call.

I have over 100 applications on my personal computer. Would I want to replace them with a rack of 100 devices? No! We don't all have basements where we can hide this stuff.\r\n\r\nExchanging Microsoft Office data with other applications is hard enough as it is. If my Office data was in a locked box, accessible only through its network API, it would be even less useful.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to make all our \"stuff\" (data, software, hardware) available to us from whatever device we are using, or which is best suited to the task. However, the way to achieve this is not to get rid of the general-purpose computers. A better approach would be to improve the interoperability between the applications in the computer and the devices in the outside world.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085929\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.thok.org/bloggery\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2545d4ff0ba72eb5d5979186f4b02d85&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.thok.org/bloggery\">Mark Eichin</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085929\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-15T00:03:32\">2004-12-15T00:03:32</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Of course, these days, you probably don't want the home lathe either, just an account with emachineshop or some other easy cad-to-fab-to-fedex service :-)  I can't quite bring myself to stretch that into a Web Services metaphor, though...</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

Just look at where the Mobile-Industry is heading. They are moving from special-narrow-feature-set to wide-feature-set that more and more equal regular PCs.\nI think what could happen, is what we are starting to see with VCRs, that have streaming capability, and \"CD-Players\" for your stereo that can be connected to a PC and stream MP3s and radio. So what we might eventually see is more and more electronic gadgets becoming \"specialized clients\" for a Home-PC. But I don't see the Home-PC completely disappearing, because people won't like to give that \"power and control\" away, even if 1 out of 3 times they try to use it they end up hurting themselves.\nAn interesting questions is, wether we'll see functionality that was born in the PC move to external \"gadgets/clients\". \"Web/E-Mail\" seemed to have been the ideal candidates, and several companies promised and sold the idea, be it integrated in telephones or into TV-sets, but eventually none of those caught on.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082834\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://husk.org/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f1b0c8dfe96dad2606c99535803d12b8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://husk.org/blog/\">Paul Mison</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082834\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-14T03:43:25\">2004-12-14T03:43:25</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">The commentary at The Register about the \"Post PC Era\" may interest you: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/06/post_pc_era/</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

But, I've got more in my head demanding to be let out-- here's hoping it's interesting enough to tell me how ill-informed I am!\r\n\r\n\r\n[pacman]: http://www.geocities.jp/nchikada/pac/\r\n[visicalc]: http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1978.htm\r\n[homebrew]: http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1976.htm\r\n[embeddedlinux]: http://www.linuxdevices.com/\r\n[imovie]: http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/\r\n[garageband]: http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/\r\n[metallathe]: http://www.baileycraft.com/spsd400.htm\r\n[geb]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465026567/qid=1102711352/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-2224698-6674213?v=glance&#38;s=books&#38;n=507846\r\n[invisiblecomputer]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262640414/0xdecafbad-20\r\n\r\n[metallathepic]: http://www.baileycraft.com/sd400pic.htm\r\n[yinyang]: http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000356.html\r\n\r\n\r\n[laptops]: http://my.webmd.com/content/article/98/104676.htm?z=1728_00000_1000_nb_01\r\n\r\n[homeappliances]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/10/homebrew_entertainment_appliances_cheap_open_and_embattled\r\n[wherepcheaded]: http://www.fortune.com/fortune/fastforward/0,15704,955951,00.html\r\n[endofpcnigh]: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/01/15/the_end_of_the_pc/\r\n[kurobox]: http://www.revolutionstore.com/\r\n[linkstation]: http://www.buffalotech.com/wireless/products/NetworkProducts/HDH120LAN.html\r\n[linksys_nslu2]: http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Sections-article85-page1.php\r\n[gumstix]: http://www.gumstix.com/sys_tinycomp.html\r\n[jini_endofdesktop]: http://www.artima.com/jini/jiniology/vision2.html\r\n[home_motor]: http://gc.sfc.keio.ac.jp/class/2003_gc00001/slides/15/15.html\r\n[home_motor_search]: http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Home+Motor%22+%248.75+catalog+-domain&#38;btnG=Search\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082829\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://talideon.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=283c1cbec588d84ff9d37aa82e697110&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://talideon.com/\">Keith Gaughan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082829\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T14:03:55\">2004-12-13T14:03:55</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Wasn't this part of the idea behind Ellison's Network Computer?</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082832\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://trikuare.cx/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7d3d1e46aae8ca19855a6026d404b91d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://trikuare.cx/\">fluffy</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082832\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T16:02:17\">2004-12-13T16:02:17</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I know from personal experience now that UNIX underpinnings do not necessarily mean immunity.

Just look at where the Mobile-Industry is heading. They are moving from special-narrow-feature-set to wide-feature-set that more and more equal regular PCs.\r\n\r\nI think what could happen, is what we are starting to see with VCRs, that have streaming capability, and \"CD-Players\" for your stereo that can be connected to a PC and stream MP3s and radio. So what we might eventually see is more and more electronic gadgets becoming \"specialized clients\" for a Home-PC. But I don't see the Home-PC completely disappearing, because people won't like to give that \"power and control\" away, even if 1 out of 3 times they try to use it they end up hurting themselves.\r\n\r\nAn interesting questions is, wether we'll see functionality that was born in the PC move to external \"gadgets/clients\". \"Web/E-Mail\" seemed to have been the ideal candidates, and several companies promised and sold the idea, be it integrated in telephones or into TV-sets, but eventually none of those caught on.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082834\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://husk.org/blog/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f1b0c8dfe96dad2606c99535803d12b8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://husk.org/blog/\">Paul Mison</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082834\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-14T03:43:25\">2004-12-14T03:43:25</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">The commentary at The Register about the \"Post PC Era\" may interest you: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/06/post_pc_era/</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

    "html": "<p>I&#39;m a complete neophyte when it comes to machine learning, but I&#39;d like to get into learning more about the field in general.  In particular, I&#39;d like to make my news aggregator smarter.  I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/08/16/bayes_agg_one\">already tried using SpamBayes</a>, but that didn&#39;t make me happy.  Whether it was my approach or whether it was that Bayes itself is not suited toward this task, I&#39;m not sure, though I suspect it&#39;s a little of both.</p>\n<p>It seems like the magic Bayesian pixie dust works well for spam-vs-ham in my email box, so why shouldn&#39;t the magic for interesting-vs-yawn work for my aggregator firehose?    Well, here are the issues I&#39;m guessing at:</p>\n<p>In the case of spam-vs-ham, you want to classify things into this or that-- that which is kept, and that which is tossed away.  But in the case of items in my aggregator, I want a relative sort order or a score.  I want a fuzzy guess toward my interest with which to inform presentation of items.  Interesting-vs-yawn is more of a continuum than a pair of buckets.</p>\n<p>And then, there&#39;s the passive gathering of behavioral data from my interactions with the aggregator, because I&#39;m sure as hell not going to click ratings or thumbs-up/down all day.  In spam-vs-ham, I could build up two clean mailboxes for training the categorizer, with one containing all spam and the other all ham.  But, in the case of my aggregator, the only thing I&#39;m tracking are items in which I showed interest by revealing more information or by clicking through.  </p>\n<p>So, I can say that a particular pile of items are all interesting.  But, my interest level for the rest of the items received is a complete unknown-- maybe I&#39;m vehemently disinterested in those 50 items, but maybe I just never got around to looking at those other 20 and just let them fall off my date range for display.  Thus, I have a pile of ham, and a pile of undifferentiated unknown.  I&#39;m not bothering to provide any cues as to whether I <em>don&#39;t</em> like something, because that&#39;d be boring work-- I mean, I <em>am</em> disinterested in those items, after all.  So, I&#39;d like to leverage what the system knows from what I care to provide, but not jump to any conclusions about the items in the unknown pile.  There is no spam, only various flavors of ham.</p>\n<p>Given all this, then, is there anyone out there who knows more about machine learning than me who could maybe point me toward a better approach or algorithm that fits this profile?</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=further_smart_aggregator_musings</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088785\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088785\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-07T17:52:19\">2004-12-07T17:52:19</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">There's a package called Reverend out there, which is a Bayesian filter not specialized for spam.  It might be worth looking at.\nAlso, in training the system should tell you what it thinks you'll think, and then you'll correct it if it's wrong.  Without this you can overtrain, creating a continual positive feedback, where all you want is a corrective feedback.\nOTOH, there's rating systems, like (I think) on Amazon.  There they correlate your ratings to  other people's ratings.  There you can usefully rate anything, because determining your correlated users is separate from the rating it actually presents you -- it's not determining your preference, simply your demographic.  Bloglines could do this (and they try a little), but you couldn't in isolation.

    "body": "I'm a complete neophyte when it comes to machine learning, but I'd like to get into learning more about the field in general.  In particular, I'd like to make my news aggregator smarter.  I've [already tried using SpamBayes](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/08/16/bayes_agg_one), but that didn't make me happy.  Whether it was my approach or whether it was that Bayes itself is not suited toward this task, I'm not sure, though I suspect it's a little of both.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the magic Bayesian pixie dust works well for spam-vs-ham in my email box, so why shouldn't the magic for interesting-vs-yawn work for my aggregator firehose?    Well, here are the issues I'm guessing at:\r\n\r\nIn the case of spam-vs-ham, you want to classify things into this or that-- that which is kept, and that which is tossed away.  But in the case of items in my aggregator, I want a relative sort order or a score.  I want a fuzzy guess toward my interest with which to inform presentation of items.  Interesting-vs-yawn is more of a continuum than a pair of buckets.\r\n\r\nAnd then, there's the passive gathering of behavioral data from my interactions with the aggregator, because I'm sure as hell not going to click ratings or thumbs-up/down all day.  In spam-vs-ham, I could build up two clean mailboxes for training the categorizer, with one containing all spam and the other all ham.  But, in the case of my aggregator, the only thing I'm tracking are items in which I showed interest by revealing more information or by clicking through.  \r\n\r\nSo, I can say that a particular pile of items are all interesting.  But, my interest level for the rest of the items received is a complete unknown-- maybe I'm vehemently disinterested in those 50 items, but maybe I just never got around to looking at those other 20 and just let them fall off my date range for display.  Thus, I have a pile of ham, and a pile of undifferentiated unknown.  I'm not bothering to provide any cues as to whether I *don't* like something, because that'd be boring work-- I mean, I *am* disinterested in those items, after all.  So, I'd like to leverage what the system knows from what I care to provide, but not jump to any conclusions about the items in the unknown pile.  There is no spam, only various flavors of ham.\r\n\r\nGiven all this, then, is there anyone out there who knows more about machine learning than me who could maybe point me toward a better approach or algorithm that fits this profile?\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=further_smart_aggregator_musings\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088785\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088785\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-07T17:52:19\">2004-12-07T17:52:19</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">There's a package called Reverend out there, which is a Bayesian filter not specialized for spam.  It might be worth looking at.\r\n\r\nAlso, in training the system should tell you what it thinks you'll think, and then you'll correct it if it's wrong.  Without this you can overtrain, creating a continual positive feedback, where all you want is a corrective feedback.\r\n\r\nOTOH, there's rating systems, like (I think) on Amazon.  There they correlate your ratings to  other people's ratings.  There you can usefully rate anything, because determining your correlated users is separate from the rating it actually presents you -- it's not determining your preference, simply your demographic.  Bloglines could do this (and they try a little), but you couldn't in isolation.

    "html": "<blockquote>I got my results a few minutes ago. They confirm that I do indeed have sleep apnea. While sleeping normally, I got zero REM sleep - the really refreshing sleep that rejuvenates the mind and body. Zero. I stopped breathing on average 38 times an hour - at one time for thirty seconds continuously. The oxygen saturation of my red blood cells dropped to worrying levels. When I was put on the machine, 13 percent of my sleep was REM sleep, and I didn't stop breathing once. No wonder I felt better the next day. My doc is now ordering the C-PAP machine. The best Christmas present I'll ever have. </blockquote>\n<div align=\"right\"><small>Source: <cite><a href=\"http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_11_28_dish_archive.html#110185277960812670\">Andrew Sullivan, Apnea</a></cite></small></div>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/features_pro.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.respironicsremstar.com/images/exploded_humid.gif\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\" border=\"0\" /></a>\nIf anyone ever wants to start doing public service announcements for Sleep Apnea for geeks, give me a call.  I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/07/23/sleep_apnea\">blogged about my sleep apnea</a> quite awhile back, and haven&#39;t gotten around to writing about it since, but this disease and my subsequent treatment have been some of the most significant events in my life.</p>\n<p>Whenever I read <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008028.html\">someone else</a> writing about snoring, I now have this <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008028.html#1009895\">instant zealotous reaction</a> to run-don&#39;t-walk to that person and shanghai them off to a sleep clinic.  All apologies to anyone this has ever annoyed, since I have a personal furor over this issue akin to rabid various cult leaders pushing their radical agendas about the necessity of marriage to potted ferns.  That is to say, it makes me nutty that anyone&#39;s left on the planet not breathing during sleep.</p>\n<p>I cannot overestimate the positive effect this CPAP machine has had on me.  I believe that it has clearly been responsible for reversing a downward spiral of anxiety, depression, and stymied productivity that increasingly gripped me over the last few years.  Granted there have been other causes and events involved, but this sleep apnea was literally robbing me of my brain.  </p>\n<p>As my condition worsened, I lost my ability to think and to grasp big pictures-- the things I so consider part of <em>being me*-- but it happened so gradually that I didn&#39;t even realize it was happening until I reached the point where I *literally</em> couldn&#39;t add 2 and 2 in my head, couldn&#39;t write more than 3 lines of code at a time, and I couldn&#39;t drive a car by myself for longer than 5 minutes at a time without nodding off.</p>\n<p>And due to a strange mixture of lethargy, social anxiety, and perceived helplessness, it took me way too long (and far too many proddings by the people I love) to finally get my ass tested.  If I could gain access to a time machine, I&#39;d personally march up to my past self years ago, assault him with a baseball bat, and strap a CPAP mask on him as he recovered in bed-- and damn the consequences of time paradox even if it threatened the very fabric of space-time.</p>\n<p>So, if you have a heavy snore, suffer often from daily exhaustion and lethargy, can&#39;t seem to think as well as you remember you had in the past...  <strong>SEE A DOCTOR!!!</strong> </p>\n<p>(Don&#39;t make me have to come over there and threaten your space-time fabric.)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083919\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083919\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-04T20:18:31\">2004-12-04T20:18:31</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Thanks for bringing this up.

Taken it around the world on work trips. Been tested a few times in a sleep clinic since my initial diagnosis. Things appear to be getting better. More energy. Started a solid exercise program as well. All helps. Looking for a smaller machine these days. All new ones seem over engineered. Looking for the most compact one I can find that works. Suggestions welcomed. What's worked for me - heated humidifier, nose pillow (not the mask) and over the counter \"salt spray\" on those days when I get plugged up. Have had colds and can still use the machine. Get to a sleep clinic if you have any problems sleeping. Easy to set up. Easy to use. Makes a world of difference.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083929\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eb7f2a3ba74af37415ab7df101a86c75&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">l.m. orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083929\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-03-07T16:38:49\">2005-03-07T16:38:49</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">sleepsLikeABaby:  Hey - thanks for the comment.

Snoring is fairly common.  Sleep Apnea is the opposite of snoring, you stop breathing and wake up, most of the time.  People who snore sleep right thru the snoring, it's a LOUD form of breathing.  If you wake up repeatedly, taking a gasping breath because you're out of air, you should be concerned.  If you wake up because your snoring was so loud the neighbors called the police for disturbance of the peace, there's another cause.  Maybe your body is water deprived and your nasal passages aren't moist, your lungs are using your saliva to moisten your breath.  Your lungs, like you, need water and they prefer air with water mixed in.  Your blood, your brain, and your digestive system get first dibs on the water you drink, your vital organs get seconds, and your other systems like vision, sweat glands, and your nose get thirds, if any is left over, your skin might get some.  When you don't drink enough water, your nose dries out, your lungs switch over the mouth backup system, unfortunately it doesn't work very well and it makes a lot of noise.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083946\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083946\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-09T12:22:21\">2005-12-09T12:22:21</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>While it's true that snoring is common, really <em>loud</em> snoring is often a symptom that accompanies sleep apnea.

People with untreated sleep apnea stop breathing repeatedly during their sleep, sometimes hundreds of times during the night.</p>\n<p>Sleep apnea is a true breathing obstruction, which requires the sleeper to awaken to begin breathing again. A person with sleep apnea wakes up many times a night to regain breathing, but usually remembers nothing at all about the awakenings.</p>\n<p>The sleep partner of a person with sleep apnea remembers a great deal about the awakenings and is generally a good witness of the incidents. Sleep apnea is a dangerous and progressive sleep disorder (it gets worse as you age). </p>\n<p>Not only does sleep apnea result in sleep deprivation, but it also can threaten your life. Sleep apnea is a period of time during which breathing stops or is markedly reduced. In simplified terms, a sleep apnea occurs when a person stops breathing for 10 seconds or more. </p>\n<p>So, if normal breath airflow is 70% to 100%, a sleep apnea is if you stop breathing completely, or take less than 25% of a normal breath (for a period that lasts 10 seconds or more).</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083950\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ef0a2bf39ddb68f1f9e73fc9b5256ab&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">PJ Hogue</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083950\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-13T20:19:45\">2006-03-13T20:19:45</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I was diagnosed with sleep apnea 3 years ago when the testing showed I either stopped breathing or did very shallow breathing 169 during the night.  Since that time I have only used the CPAP consecutively for the last 6 months because I had difficulty using a mask.  Last October I discovered the Mirage Swift Nasal pillow system and have been using it every night since.  The only problem I have is with the \"elvis\" type sideburn headgear, it can dig into my cheeks leaving a horrific imprint.  AND... no, it isn't on too tightly.  I use a pressure setting of 13 right now but recently have been having serious allergy type issues with nasal congestion, etc., and have been told that it may be due to the delivery system of the nasal pillow and the high air setting.  I am going to be re-evaluated to see if a reduction in pressure is feasible for me.</p>\n<p>Of concern to me is the noise of my machine.  I use a Fisher &amp; Paykel HC220 with humidifier.  Are all machines with humidifiers noisey?  I know that the RemStar machine they tested me on was very quiet... but it didn't have a humidifier which may be the noise culprit.  Any advice would be welcome.  I am not adverse to buying another machine even if they are pricey.  I bought my machine online and yes, they are so much cheaper that way.  If you can go to a local DME (durable medical provider) to test them you will find that they are marked up about 3 times as much.  I bought my Mirage Swift Nasal pillow system for $114 online and my local DME sells it for $480!  Outrageous.  </p>\n<p>If anyone knows of another nasal pillow type headgear that is comfortable for side sleeping and does not tear up your face... I'm interested.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083957\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=49a5f0c2d73be7382d71695cb5e82917&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jonathan Payne</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083957\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-29T02:46:40\">2006-03-29T02:46:40</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I, too, was diagnosed with sleep apnea, arousing 30 times an hour and not getting any REM sleep. Unfortunately the CPAP machine was worse than the disease itself, for me. I have always been a light sleeper even when I was younger and slept no problem so I think it's just part of that. I am also a slim guy, which is rare for people with sleep apnea, which means that relatively sharp angles on my face made it hard for me to maintain a proper seal with the mask. So I often moved just a little and woke to the sound of escaping air. Finally I fell asleep one night and then my mouth got blown open by the CPAP. So then I got a chin strap ... but even that didn't help.</p>\n<p>So it's not a miracle cure for everyone, just almost everyone. Whenever I hear about people with sleeping problems I think \"Get a sleep study\" because I had no expectations that I would be diagnosed with apnea. I don't snore all that much at all but I still have it and I am aroused 30 times an hour.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083959\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.sleepdisordersguide.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2b71ad14229f7292ebb02487e29b23c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.sleepdisordersguide.com\">Sleep Disorders</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083959\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-29T13:27:56\">2006-03-29T13:27:56</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>One-third of all adult Americans--about 50 million people--complain about their sleep.

I se the REMStar Plus. I'm one of the lucky ones in that I adapted almost instantly to the mask. My sleep was so interrupted (46 wakings/hr in the test) and the benefits were so dramatic that I would have found a way to adapt to wearing a volkswagon on my face if thet was what it took. I too have had some sinus issues occasonally but find that if I clean the mask, tube and water chamber regularly and use nasal spray sparingly (I emphasize sparingly - that stuff can be addictive and do more damage than good if used continuously) the side effects are dwarfed by the benefits. My life was in a serious downward spiral before CPAP and I can tell you that if you have only mild symptoms now they will likely get worse with age. When they get really bad you will likely lack the clear judgement to understand what's happening to you. So if you're wrestling with sleep problems keep working with the doctor until you find a workable treatment for you.</p>\n<p>If CPAP is problematic for you, try a heated humidified unit (as opposed to non-humidified or pass over humidified) and try different masks or nasal pillows. If none of that works, talk to the doctor about surgery. Surgery is only effective in a limited percentage of patients, but when it does work I'm told it is a true cure sans machines and masks. Also note that in recent years the technology has advanced a lot. There are now machines that continuously vary pressure to remove exhale resistance and also vary inhale pressure based on breathing patterns. These can help with many patients who have problems tolerating generic CPAP. </p>\n<p>I saw one person asking about self adjusting a REMStar Plus pressure. You can trick it out a bit by changing the altitude setting but there is a reason this is set by the physician. You can do more harm than good tinkering with the pressure without understanding the factors involved. You might want to try one of the new REMStar M Auto units which monitor your breathing patterns and adjust pressure accordingly. I've never used one of these, but I've read reviews that speak highly of them.</p>\n<p>Sleep Well!</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083982\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f49d4e4e86836705f160a406aa9d980&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Jill Stoffel</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083982\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-31T19:34:58\">2006-12-31T19:34:58</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Does anyone know the best/fastest way of getting rid of the \"imprints\" left on the face in the morning?

I was diagnosed with sleep apnea in November and I am still waiting for my CPAP machine.  My insurance has denied it and I have appealed it.  I am to the point of being somewhat scared with the following symptoms that I am having.  I would be interested in knowing if anyone else has them.\nEverytime I wake up my whole body is numb, my mouth is so dry I I have no saliva in it.  This makes me try to gasp for air. Another thing is my body sometimes gets so weak I feel like I can barely walk or even lift my arms up.  Are these symptoms familiar?  My oxygen level goes down to 70 and I also, get no REM sleep.  I am bi-polar and thought my clinical depression was caused by that until I found out sleep apnea also causes it.  My memory is so bad that I can't even finish a sentence without forgetting what I was saying and I have gained a tremendous amount of weight, which my DR. said could also be caused by sleep apnea.\nWill check back for any responses that may be helpful.  Please don't suggest that I buy a CPAP machine due my difficulties with the insurance company, I am on disability and receive only $700.00 a month, so, that is out of the question.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083988\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f0d2b43356700a805eef4a1015d77e44&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Evan</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083988\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-16T18:09:10\">2007-03-16T18:09:10</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>thanks for that.

I [blogged about my sleep apnea](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/07/23/sleep_apnea) quite awhile back, and haven't gotten around to writing about it since, but this disease and my subsequent treatment have been some of the most significant events in my life.\r\n\r\nWhenever I read [someone else](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008028.html) writing about snoring, I now have this [instant zealotous reaction](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008028.html#1009895) to run-don't-walk to that person and shanghai them off to a sleep clinic.  All apologies to anyone this has ever annoyed, since I have a personal furor over this issue akin to rabid various cult leaders pushing their radical agendas about the necessity of marriage to potted ferns.  That is to say, it makes me nutty that anyone's left on the planet not breathing during sleep.\r\n\r\nI cannot overestimate the positive effect this CPAP machine has had on me.  I believe that it has clearly been responsible for reversing a downward spiral of anxiety, depression, and stymied productivity that increasingly gripped me over the last few years.  Granted there have been other causes and events involved, but this sleep apnea was literally robbing me of my brain.  \r\n\r\nAs my condition worsened, I lost my ability to think and to grasp big pictures-- the things I so consider part of *being me*-- but it happened so gradually that I didn't even realize it was happening until I reached the point where I *literally* couldn't add 2 and 2 in my head, couldn't write more than 3 lines of code at a time, and I couldn't drive a car by myself for longer than 5 minutes at a time without nodding off.\r\n\r\nAnd due to a strange mixture of lethargy, social anxiety, and perceived helplessness, it took me way too long (and far too many proddings by the people I love) to finally get my ass tested.  If I could gain access to a time machine, I'd personally march up to my past self years ago, assault him with a baseball bat, and strap a CPAP mask on him as he recovered in bed-- and damn the consequences of time paradox even if it threatened the very fabric of space-time.\r\n\r\nSo, if you have a heavy snore, suffer often from daily exhaustion and lethargy, can't seem to think as well as you remember you had in the past...  **SEE A DOCTOR!!!** \r\n\r\n(Don't make me have to come over there and threaten your space-time fabric.)\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083919\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083919\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-04T20:18:31\">2004-12-04T20:18:31</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Thanks for bringing this up.

Taken it around the world on work trips. Been tested a few times in a sleep clinic since my initial diagnosis. Things appear to be getting better. More energy. Started a solid exercise program as well. All helps. Looking for a smaller machine these days. All new ones seem over engineered. Looking for the most compact one I can find that works. Suggestions welcomed. What's worked for me - heated humidifier, nose pillow (not the mask) and over the counter \"salt spray\" on those days when I get plugged up. Have had colds and can still use the machine. Get to a sleep clinic if you have any problems sleeping. Easy to set up. Easy to use.

Snoring is fairly common.  Sleep Apnea is the opposite of snoring, you stop breathing and wake up, most of the time.  People who snore sleep right thru the snoring, it's a LOUD form of breathing.  If you wake up repeatedly, taking a gasping breath because you're out of air, you should be concerned.  If you wake up because your snoring was so loud the neighbors called the police for disturbance of the peace, there's another cause.  Maybe your body is water deprived and your nasal passages aren't moist, your lungs are using your saliva to moisten your breath.  Your lungs, like you, need water and they prefer air with water mixed in.  Your blood, your brain, and your digestive system get first dibs on the water you drink, your vital organs get seconds, and your other systems like vision, sweat glands, and your nose get thirds, if any is left over, your skin might get some.  When you don't drink enough water, your nose dries out, your lungs switch over the mouth backup system, unfortunately it doesn't work very well and it makes a lot of noise.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083946\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083946\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2005-12-09T12:22:21\">2005-12-09T12:22:21</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>While it's true that snoring is common, really <em>loud</em> snoring is often a symptom that accompanies sleep apnea.

My Dad and my Grandfather have had freight-train level snoring for years and never remembered actually waking up.

People with untreated sleep apnea stop breathing repeatedly during their sleep, sometimes hundreds of times during the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sleep apnea is a true breathing obstruction, which requires the sleeper to awaken to begin breathing again. A person with sleep apnea wakes up many times a night to regain breathing, but usually remembers nothing at all about the awakenings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sleep partner of a person with sleep apnea remembers a great deal about the awakenings and is generally a good witness of the incidents. Sleep apnea is a dangerous and progressive sleep disorder (it gets worse as you age). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only does sleep apnea result in sleep deprivation, but it also can threaten your life. Sleep apnea is a period of time during which breathing stops or is markedly reduced. In simplified terms, a sleep apnea occurs when a person stops breathing for 10 seconds or more. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if normal breath airflow is 70% to 100%, a sleep apnea is if you stop breathing completely, or take less than 25% of a normal breath (for a period that lasts 10 seconds or more).</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083950\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2ef0a2bf39ddb68f1f9e73fc9b5256ab&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">PJ Hogue</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083950\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-13T20:19:45\">2006-03-13T20:19:45</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I was diagnosed with sleep apnea 3 years ago when the testing showed I either stopped breathing or did very shallow breathing 169 during the night.  Since that time I have only used the CPAP consecutively for the last 6 months because I had difficulty using a mask.  Last October I discovered the Mirage Swift Nasal pillow system and have been using it every night since.  The only problem I have is with the \"elvis\" type sideburn headgear, it can dig into my cheeks leaving a horrific imprint.  AND... no, it isn't on too tightly.  I use a pressure setting of 13 right now but recently have been having serious allergy type issues with nasal congestion, etc., and have been told that it may be due to the delivery system of the nasal pillow and the high air setting.  I am going to be re-evaluated to see if a reduction in pressure is feasible for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of concern to me is the noise of my machine.  I use a Fisher &amp; Paykel HC220 with humidifier.  Are all machines with humidifiers noisey?  I know that the RemStar machine they tested me on was very quiet... but it didn't have a humidifier which may be the noise culprit.  Any advice would be welcome.  I am not adverse to buying another machine even if they are pricey.  I bought my machine online and yes, they are so much cheaper that way.  If you can go to a local DME (durable medical provider) to test them you will find that they are marked up about 3 times as much.  I bought my Mirage Swift Nasal pillow system for $114 online and my local DME sells it for $480!  Outrageous.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If anyone knows of another nasal pillow type headgear that is comfortable for side sleeping and does not tear up your face... I'm interested.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083957\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=49a5f0c2d73be7382d71695cb5e82917&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Jonathan Payne</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083957\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-29T02:46:40\">2006-03-29T02:46:40</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I, too, was diagnosed with sleep apnea, arousing 30 times an hour and not getting any REM sleep. Unfortunately the CPAP machine was worse than the disease itself, for me. I have always been a light sleeper even when I was younger and slept no problem so I think it's just part of that. I am also a slim guy, which is rare for people with sleep apnea, which means that relatively sharp angles on my face made it hard for me to maintain a proper seal with the mask. So I often moved just a little and woke to the sound of escaping air. Finally I fell asleep one night and then my mouth got blown open by the CPAP. So then I got a chin strap ... but even that didn't help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it's not a miracle cure for everyone, just almost everyone. Whenever I hear about people with sleeping problems I think \"Get a sleep study\" because I had no expectations that I would be diagnosed with apnea. I don't snore all that much at all but I still have it and I am aroused 30 times an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good luck!</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083959\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.sleepdisordersguide.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2b71ad14229f7292ebb02487e29b23c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.sleepdisordersguide.com\">Sleep Disorders</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083959\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-03-29T13:27:56\">2006-03-29T13:27:56</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>One-third of all adult Americans--about 50 million people--complain about their sleep.

I had been told many, many times that I snore really, really loud. Wake myself up sometimes too! And people also tell me that \"all the sudden you stopped snoring and got completely quiet\" ... well that was when i stopped breathing. Not good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During my test I stopped breathing some 54 times during a six hour test and once for a full 45 seconds. That is quite a while. Try holding your breath now for that long ... just kidding ... BREATHE!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I agree. Get a sleep test. Find out what is up.

Which usually results in that classic snoring / gasping for breath.\r\nThis cycle repeats itself - ALL THRU THE NIGHT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After using a CPAP maching for 4-5 weeks now, I notice a big improvement.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083979\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b5449300debe868fa024c4611bfae5f0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">David</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083979\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-27T07:09:58\">2006-12-27T07:09:58</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I've been on CPAP now for about 3 years. I se the REMStar Plus. I'm one of the lucky ones in that I adapted almost instantly to the mask. My sleep was so interrupted (46 wakings/hr in the test) and the benefits were so dramatic that I would have found a way to adapt to wearing a volkswagon on my face if thet was what it took. I too have had some sinus issues occasonally but find that if I clean the mask, tube and water chamber regularly and use nasal spray sparingly (I emphasize sparingly - that stuff can be addictive and do more damage than good if used continuously) the side effects are dwarfed by the benefits. My life was in a serious downward spiral before CPAP and I can tell you that if you have only mild symptoms now they will likely get worse with age. When they get really bad you will likely lack the clear judgement to understand what's happening to you. So if you're wrestling with sleep problems keep working with the doctor until you find a workable treatment for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If CPAP is problematic for you, try a heated humidified unit (as opposed to non-humidified or pass over humidified) and try different masks or nasal pillows. If none of that works, talk to the doctor about surgery. Surgery is only effective in a limited percentage of patients, but when it does work I'm told it is a true cure sans machines and masks. Also note that in recent years the technology has advanced a lot. There are now machines that continuously vary pressure to remove exhale resistance and also vary inhale pressure based on breathing patterns. These can help with many patients who have problems tolerating generic CPAP. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I saw one person asking about self adjusting a REMStar Plus pressure. You can trick it out a bit by changing the altitude setting but there is a reason this is set by the physician. You can do more harm than good tinkering with the pressure without understanding the factors involved. You might want to try one of the new REMStar M Auto units which monitor your breathing patterns and adjust pressure accordingly. I've never used one of these, but I've read reviews that speak highly of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sleep Well!</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083982\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f49d4e4e86836705f160a406aa9d980&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Jill Stoffel</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083982\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2006-12-31T19:34:58\">2006-12-31T19:34:58</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Does anyone know the best/fastest way of getting rid of the \"imprints\" left on the face in the morning?

I was diagnosed with sleep apnea in November and I am still waiting for my CPAP machine.  My insurance has denied it and I have appealed it.  I am to the point of being somewhat scared with the following symptoms that I am having.  I would be interested in knowing if anyone else has them.\r\nEverytime I wake up my whole body is numb, my mouth is so dry I I have no saliva in it.  This makes me try to gasp for air. Another thing is my body sometimes gets so weak I feel like I can barely walk or even lift my arms up.  Are these symptoms familiar?  My oxygen level goes down to 70 and I also, get no REM sleep.  I am bi-polar and thought my clinical depression was caused by that until I found out sleep apnea also causes it.  My memory is so bad that I can't even finish a sentence without forgetting what I was saying and I have gained a tremendous amount of weight, which my DR. said could also be caused by sleep apnea.\r\nWill check back for any responses that may be helpful.  Please don't suggest that I buy a CPAP machine due my difficulties with the insurance company, I am on disability and receive only $700.00 a month, so, that is out of the question.</p></div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083988\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f0d2b43356700a805eef4a1015d77e44&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Evan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083988\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-16T18:09:10\">2007-03-16T18:09:10</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>thanks for that.

    "html": "<p>I&#39;ve recently been doing some side work involving Zope and, along with the rest of the suite of technologies it offers, I&#39;ve been happy to be working with <a href=\"http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/FrontPage\">Zope Page Templates</a> again.  I dabbled with them a bit when they first came out, and a Zope-free implementation named <a href=\"http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/\">SimpleTAL</a> was one of the core components of the iteration of my news aggregator which came before FeedReactor.</p>\n<p>Out of all the templating and content generation approaches I&#39;ve used, Zope Page Templates are my favorite yet.  Pretty expressive, yet unobtrusive; nicely powerful, yet not quite something with which you&#39;d want to write an entire application (<a href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2004/12/02/a-note-on-template-design\">and that&#39;s a feature, not a bug</a>).  </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve yet to be in a work-a-day team that uses ZPT-- but I can see where a lot of production, delegation, and integration issues would have gone much smoother had I used ZPT instead of <a href=\"http://www.template-toolkit.org/\">Template Toolkit</a> for the web app framework I created at a previous company.  (Though I do have to say TT2 is <em>very</em> nicely done!)  And where I am now, I spend most of my days trying to pummel ASP 3.0 pages into some semblance of logic/presentation separation-- I would certainly dive at the chance to dump VBScript and <code>&lt;% cruft %&gt;</code> for a bit of Python and ZPT.  (But, you know, <em>it&#39;s a living</em>.)</p>\n<p>A close second favorite is XSLT.  I&#39;ve really been hot on it lately, having worked it into the core of FeedReactor in place of SimpleTAL.  And in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/02/xsl_scraper\">other</a> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1\">hacks</a>, I&#39;ve really come to appreciate it&#39;s role as a filter segment in pipelines between REST web services and <a href=\"http://udell.roninhouse.com/bytecols/2001-08-15.html\">URL-as-command-line</a> invocations.</p>\n<p>Granted, both ZPT and XSLT very different technologies, but they are often used in similar contexts.  More than once, I&#39;ve wished that XSLT was as simple as ZPT (i.e. less verbose and intrusive, more document centered), and I&#39;ve wished that ZPT had some of the features of XSLT (i.e. ability to be used as a transforming filter).</p>\n<p>Reading <a href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2004/11/30/pythonic-xml-based-templating-language\">Ryan Tomayko&#39;s description of Kid</a> got me thinking, and googling.  One thing I turned up from a mailing list archive asked about an &#8220;<a href=\"http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zpt/2002-January/002651.html\">XSL implementation of TAL?</a>&#8221;  It struck me as a tad nutty at first, but then I started having inklings that just maybe it could be done.  (Whether it <em>should</em> be done, well...)  But the kernel of the idea grabbed me: Instead of using <a href=\"http://zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/TALES%20Specification%201.3\">TALES path expressions</a> to look up values in Pythonic space, why not use XPath expressions to look up values from a supplied XML document?</p>\n<p>This strikes me as such an obvious idea that someone has to already have done it and possibly rejected it for good reason.  On the other hand, maybe this is the sort of thing Ryan&#39;s thinking about-- I wonder how hard it would be to hack this into Kid?  It would give only a subset of XSLT&#39;s capabilities in trade for simplicity, and would only offer the &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/pushpull.html\">pull</a>&#8221; approach, but it would give XML-pipelining to a ZPT-ish technology.</p>\n<p>I think this is something I want to look into a bit further at some point.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=crossbreedingxsltzpt</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087930\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087930\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-04T17:16:09\">2004-12-04T17:16:09</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I've been meaning to write about this on my blog, as I've done something similar.\nInstead of using XSLT, I've used ZPT for the transformations.  It was an application where the user created a document in a WYSIWYG editor, then we wanted to pull information out of the content -- like a table of contents, or a title.\nTo do this I parsed the content into a DOM, then put some objects in the ZPT namespace that manipulated it.  For instance, the ToC object took a tag name (through getitem) and returned a list of the content and id of those tags (it created ids if necessary, modifying the content).  Then you could easily create a ToC by looking through and creating anchor tags from, say, all the  tags in the document.  It should be easy to expand with other transformations (all coded in Python, of course).  The actual code was only like 20 lines of Python, maybe less, and easy to understand from both sides (ZPT and Python).</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087932\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=14076d6ce3d0e8a0fd751a36d9912df5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Petri Savolainen</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087932\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T05:21:41\">2004-12-13T05:21:41</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">See http://zope.org/Members/DaddyGravity/PT_XPath\nIt would be great to have that in SimpleTAL, too.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087935\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087935\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T11:43:33\">2004-12-13T11:43:33</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Another thing you might want to look at: in the last few days there's been discussion on the ZPT mailing list about an extension to stylesheets (TERSE) for ZPT that introduces transformations.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087937\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d244e495717742bd0776b715a45877eb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand\">Bertrand Delacretaz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221087937\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T15:15:55\">2004-12-13T15:15:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">FYI, people from the Apache Cocoon and BXE projects are working on similar stuff, in the opposite direction: we're taking TAL-like templates and converting them to XSLT, adding simple \"match\" templates for declarative rules.

    "body": "I've recently been doing some side work involving Zope and, along with the rest of the suite of technologies it offers, I've been happy to be working with [Zope Page Templates](http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/FrontPage) again.  I dabbled with them a bit when they first came out, and a Zope-free implementation named [SimpleTAL](http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/) was one of the core components of the iteration of my news aggregator which came before FeedReactor.\r\n\r\nOut of all the templating and content generation approaches I've used, Zope Page Templates are my favorite yet.  Pretty expressive, yet unobtrusive; nicely powerful, yet not quite something with which you'd want to write an entire application ([and that's a feature, not a bug](http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2004/12/02/a-note-on-template-design)).  \r\n  \r\nI've yet to be in a work-a-day team that uses ZPT-- but I can see where a lot of production, delegation, and integration issues would have gone much smoother had I used ZPT instead of [Template Toolkit](http://www.template-toolkit.org/) for the web app framework I created at a previous company.  (Though I do have to say TT2 is *very* nicely done!)  And where I am now, I spend most of my days trying to pummel ASP 3.0 pages into some semblance of logic/presentation separation-- I would certainly dive at the chance to dump VBScript and `<% cruft %>` for a bit of Python and ZPT.  (But, you know, *it's a living*.)\r\n   \r\nA close second favorite is XSLT.  I've really been hot on it lately, having worked it into the core of FeedReactor in place of SimpleTAL.  And in [other](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/02/xsl_scraper) [hacks](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1), I've really come to appreciate it's role as a filter segment in pipelines between REST web services and [URL-as-command-line](http://udell.roninhouse.com/bytecols/2001-08-15.html) invocations.\r\n\r\nGranted, both ZPT and XSLT very different technologies, but they are often used in similar contexts.  More than once, I've wished that XSLT was as simple as ZPT (i.e. less verbose and intrusive, more document centered), and I've wished that ZPT had some of the features of XSLT (i.e. ability to be used as a transforming filter).\r\n\r\nReading [Ryan Tomayko's description of Kid](http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2004/11/30/pythonic-xml-based-templating-language) got me thinking, and googling.  One thing I turned up from a mailing list archive asked about an &#8220;[XSL implementation of TAL?](http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zpt/2002-January/002651.html)&#8221;  It struck me as a tad nutty at first, but then I started having inklings that just maybe it could be done.  (Whether it *should* be done, well...)  But the kernel of the idea grabbed me: Instead of using [TALES path expressions](http://zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/TALES%20Specification%201.3) to look up values in Pythonic space, why not use XPath expressions to look up values from a supplied XML document?\r\n\r\nThis strikes me as such an obvious idea that someone has to already have done it and possibly rejected it for good reason.  On the other hand, maybe this is the sort of thing Ryan's thinking about-- I wonder how hard it would be to hack this into Kid?  It would give only a subset of XSLT's capabilities in trade for simplicity, and would only offer the &#8220;[pull](http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/pushpull.html)&#8221; approach, but it would give XML-pipelining to a ZPT-ish technology.\r\n\r\nI think this is something I want to look into a bit further at some point.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nshortname=crossbreedingxsltzpt\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087930\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087930\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-04T17:16:09\">2004-12-04T17:16:09</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I've been meaning to write about this on my blog, as I've done something similar.\r\n\r\nInstead of using XSLT, I've used ZPT for the transformations.  It was an application where the user created a document in a WYSIWYG editor, then we wanted to pull information out of the content -- like a table of contents, or a title.\r\n\r\nTo do this I parsed the content into a DOM, then put some objects in the ZPT namespace that manipulated it.  For instance, the ToC object took a tag name (through getitem) and returned a list of the content and id of those tags (it created ids if necessary, modifying the content).  Then you could easily create a ToC by looking through and creating anchor tags from, say, all the  tags in the document.  It should be easy to expand with other transformations (all coded in Python, of course).  The actual code was only like 20 lines of Python, maybe less, and easy to understand from both sides (ZPT and Python).</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087932\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=14076d6ce3d0e8a0fd751a36d9912df5&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Petri Savolainen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087932\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T05:21:41\">2004-12-13T05:21:41</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">See http://zope.org/Members/DaddyGravity/PT_XPath\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have that in SimpleTAL, too.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087935\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://blog.ianbicking.org\">Ian Bicking</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087935\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T11:43:33\">2004-12-13T11:43:33</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Another thing you might want to look at: in the last few days there's been discussion on the ZPT mailing list about an extension to stylesheets (TERSE) for ZPT that introduces transformations.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087937\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d244e495717742bd0776b715a45877eb&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand\">Bertrand Delacretaz</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087937\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-13T15:15:55\">2004-12-13T15:15:55</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">FYI, people from the Apache Cocoon and BXE projects are working on similar stuff, in the opposite direction: we're taking TAL-like templates and converting them to XSLT, adding simple \"match\" templates for declarative rules.

Making it so that '/mydoc/root/find/.//searchElement' works would be fairly easy, but getting '/mydoc/root/find/.//searchElement/attrib/firstAtt' to work would require more co-operation between ElemenTree and SimpleTAL.\r\n\r\nI'll have a think about this though as it sounds like a promising approach.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087946\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d67eea2ce18dd70f4642cb971c2c5ad2&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Paul Everitt</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221087946\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-12-14T00:45:18\">2004-12-14T00:45:18</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Chapter 11 of Jeni Tennison's \"XSLT and XPath On The Edge\" book has a section called \"Using Page Templates\".

    "summary": "<p>I&apos;ve recently been doing some side work involving Zope and, along with the rest of the suite of technologies it offers, I&apos;ve been happy to be working with <a href=\"http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/FrontPage\">Zope Page Templates</a> again.  I dabbled with them a bit when they first came out, and a Zope-free implementation named <a href=\"http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/\">SimpleTAL</a> was one of the core components of the iteration of my news aggregator which came before FeedReactor.</p>\n<p>Out of all the templating and content generation approaches I&apos;ve used, Zope Page Templates are my favorite yet.  Pretty expressive, yet unobtrusive; nicely powerful, yet not quite something with which you&apos;d want to write an entire application (<a href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2004/12/02/a-note-on-template-design\">and that&apos;s a feature, not a bug</a>).  </p>\n<p>I&apos;ve yet to be in a work-a-day team that uses ZPT-- but I can see where a lot of production, delegation, and integration issues would have gone much smoother had I used ZPT instead of <a href=\"http://www.template-toolkit.org/\">Template Toolkit</a> for the web app framework I created at a previous company.  (Though I do have to say TT2 is <em>very</em> nicely done!)  And where I am now, I spend most of my days trying to pummel ASP 3.0 pages into some semblance of logic/presentation separation-- I would certainly dive at the chance to dump VBScript and <code>&lt;% cruft %&gt;</code> for a bit of Python and ZPT.  (But, you know, <em>it&apos;s a living</em>.)</p>\n<p>A close second favorite is XSLT.  I&apos;ve really been hot on it lately, having worked it into the core of FeedReactor in place of SimpleTAL.  And in <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/02/xsl_scraper\">other</a> <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1\">hacks</a>, I&apos;ve really come to appreciate it&apos;s role as a filter segment in pipelines between REST web services and <a href=\"http://udell.roninhouse.com/bytecols/2001-08-15.html\">URL-as-command-line</a> invocations.</p>\n<p>Granted, both ZPT and XSLT very different technologies, but they are often used in similar contexts.  More than once, I&apos;ve wished that XSLT was as simple as ZPT (i.e. less verbose and intrusive, more document centered), and I&apos;ve wished that ZPT had some of the features of XSLT (i.e. ability to be used as a transforming filter).</p>\n<p>Reading <a href=\"http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2004/11/30/pythonic-xml-based-templating-language\">Ryan Tomayko&apos;s description of Kid</a> got me thinking, and googling.  One thing I turned up from a mailing list archive asked about an &#x201C;<a href=\"http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zpt/2002-January/002651.html\">XSL implementation of TAL?</a>&#x201D;  It struck me as a tad nutty at first, but then I started having inklings that just maybe it could be done.  (Whether it <em>should</em> be done, well...)  But the kernel of the idea grabbed me: Instead of using <a href=\"http://zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/TALES%20Specification%201.3\">TALES path expressions</a> to look up values in Pythonic space, why not use XPath expressions to look up values from a supplied XML document?</p>\n<p>This strikes me as such an obvious idea that someone has to already have done it and possibly rejected it for good reason.  On the other hand, maybe this is the sort of thing Ryan&apos;s thinking about-- I wonder how hard it would be to hack this into Kid?  It would give only a subset of XSLT&apos;s capabilities in trade for simplicity, and would only offer the &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/pushpull.html\">pull</a>&#x201D; approach, but it would give XML-pipelining to a ZPT-ish technology.</p>\n<p>I think this is something I want to look into a bit further at some point.</p>\n"
