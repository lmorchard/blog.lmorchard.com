It was an application where the user created a document in a WYSIWYG editor, then we wanted to pull information out of the content -- like a table of contents, or a title.\n\nTo do this I parsed the content into a DOM, then put some objects in the ZPT namespace that manipulated it.  For instance, the ToC object took a tag name (through getitem) and returned a list of the content and id of those tags (it created ids if necessary, modifying the content).  Then you could easily create a ToC by looking through and creating anchor tags from, say, all the  tags in the document.  It should be easy to expand with other transformations (all coded in Python, of course).  The actual code was only like 20 lines of Python, maybe less, and easy to understand from both sides (ZPT and Python).</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221087932&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=14076d6ce3d0e8a0fd751a36d9912df5&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Petri Savolainen&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221087932&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-12-13T05:21:41&quot;&gt;2004-12-13T05:21:41&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;See http://zope.org/Members/DaddyGravity/PT_XPath\n</code></pre><p>It would be great to have that in SimpleTAL, too.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221087935&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://blog.ianbicking.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cc8334869c9d2a9e603017f2da805eb3&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://blog.ianbicking.org&quot;&gt;Ian Bicking&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221087935&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-12-13T11:43:33&quot;&gt;2004-12-13T11:43:33&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Another thing you might want to look at: in the last few days there&#39;s been discussion on the ZPT mailing list about an extension to stylesheets (TERSE) for ZPT that introduces transformations.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221087937&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d244e495717742bd0776b715a45877eb&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand&quot;&gt;Bertrand Delacretaz&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221087937&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-12-13T15:15:55&quot;&gt;2004-12-13T15:15:55&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;FYI, people from the Apache Cocoon and BXE projects are working on similar stuff, in the opposite direction: we&#39;re taking TAL-like templates and converting them to XSLT, adding simple &quot;match&quot; templates for declarative rules.

Which is a pity, I think the world would be much easier if more people used this *standard* way of templating.\n</code></pre><p>One of the bigger problems with it seems to be the verbosity, so I&#39;ve been thinking of a more compact syntax, kind of like RELAX NG has the .rnc compact stuff. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s very feasible, but it seems like that would be not very hard; just have some compact syntax which maps onto a real XSLT-sheet (it could be &quot;compiled&quot; and cached, if need be).</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221087942&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.owlfish.com/weblog/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=377cef4245e0fcbf76e021d9cd253e35&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.owlfish.com/weblog/&quot;&gt;Colin Stewart&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221087942&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-12-13T23:47:18&quot;&gt;2004-12-13T23:47:18&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Integrating an XPATH implementation into SimpleTAL shouldn&#39;t be too hard as the TALES and TAL implementations share a fairly simple interface.  There are 6 methods you&#39;d have to provide to the simpleTAL module and that&#39;s about it.\n</code></pre><p>I don&#39;t know if XPATH is the right approach though - how would things like tal:define work if the paths were pure XPATH instead of TALES?  Being able to mix XPATH and TALES would work better I think.</p>\n<p>A more promising approach would be to integrate ElementTree so that the &#39;find*&#39; methods were usable from within TALES.  Making it so that &#39;/mydoc/root/find/.//searchElement&#39; works would be fairly easy, but getting &#39;/mydoc/root/find/.//searchElement/attrib/firstAtt&#39; to work would require more co-operation between ElemenTree and SimpleTAL.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ll have a think about this though as it sounds like a promising approach.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221087946&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d67eea2ce18dd70f4642cb971c2c5ad2&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Paul Everitt&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221087946&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-12-14T00:45:18&quot;&gt;2004-12-14T00:45:18&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Chapter 11 of Jeni Tennison&#39;s &quot;XSLT and XPath On The Edge&quot; book has a section called &quot;Using Page Templates&quot;.
