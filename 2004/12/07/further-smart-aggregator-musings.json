It might be worth looking at.\n\nAlso, in training the system should tell you what it thinks you&#39;ll think, and then you&#39;ll correct it if it&#39;s wrong.  Without this you can overtrain, creating a continual positive feedback, where all you want is a corrective feedback.\n\nOTOH, there&#39;s rating systems, like (I think) on Amazon.  There they correlate your ratings to  other people&#39;s ratings.  There you can usefully rate anything, because determining your correlated users is separate from the rating it actually presents you -- it&#39;s not determining your preference, simply your demographic.  Bloglines could do this (and they try a little), but you couldn&#39;t in isolation.  Anyway, some ideas.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221088786&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.eighty-twenty.net/blog&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=12405222b80eca06189b246be2e57ef8&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.eighty-twenty.net/blog&quot;&gt;Gordon Weakliem&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221088786&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-12-08T15:51:15&quot;&gt;2004-12-08T15:51:15&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Have you looked at AmphetaRate (http://amphetarate.sf.net)?

Hmmm. The problems with bayes spam/ham sorting for news readers is down to the simplistic stats. The most simplistic statistical measure to take is on individual words.\n</code></pre><p>For normal email spam/ham there are (or moreover, were) words that stood out as good/bad markers. But in something like an rss feed where you have already selected feeds that are reasonably close to your interest set, the individual words are no longer useful for sorting interesting vs yawn. </p>\n<p>As you can probably tell, I had a go at doing this for an AI course I did last semester, and I wound up with a furball that didn&#39;t actually fly. I used python and wxpy to build an aggregator around an IE control with good/bad buttons for marking, my word distributions didn&#39;t wind up correlating. </p>\n<p>Is your aggregator open for hacking? I have a few theories that I&#39;d like to testbed, and now owning a mac, my old code is nigh on useless :-)</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221088788&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.srijith.net/trinetre/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=71daea6c5696489ec1f7dd8efa55e2f2&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.srijith.net/trinetre/&quot;&gt;Srijith&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221088788&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-12-13T11:00:05&quot;&gt;2004-12-13T11:00:05&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Machine learning is not within my list of &quot;do-know-something&quot; areas, but I could suggest a bit of commensense logic to the system to learn from uninterested items. The fact that an item is uninteresting is denoted by the propertiy that you have not clicked on it. While one may not be able to deduce much pattern from a single item as such, it could be used to deduce useful information about the metadata associated with the item. For example, I found that I was reading less and less of items from blogger X&#39;s feed. There were days at a stretch where I would not find anything written by X interesting enough. If a cron job was run that could look through the last time I read any of X&#39;s item, it could have noticed this trend and thus lowered X&#39;s score, thus pushing his item below my &quot;casual-glance-view&quot;. While doing this alone would cause one to miss a very interesting item  that X could write in a blue moon, if one uses other metadata associated with the feed item (like keyworkds etc.), it could be brought within my &quot;casual-glance-view&quot;.\n</code></pre><p>Intellie-Aggie tries to use these logics to filter out items, but I have left the codes untouched for far too long to expect any wonders.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221088789&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.drunkenblog.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=383b6331d8326615511cff5c243873fa&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.drunkenblog.com&quot;&gt;drunkenbatman&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221088789&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-12-13T16:40:49&quot;&gt;2004-12-13T16:40:49&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;I&#39;m hoping that aggregators will get smarter too, because due to the info-glut RSS enables the computer is just going to have to get smarter about having a guess as to what we&#39;re going to be interested in.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221088790&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.oshineye.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=199f0940163b371d85d1b18510e1d53d&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.oshineye.com&quot;&gt;ade&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221088790&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-12-28T17:27:18&quot;&gt;2004-12-28T17:27:18&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Take a look at my Aggrevator: http://www.oshineye.com/software/aggrevator.html\n</code></pre><p>which uses scoring to enable users to deal with very large numbers of feeds.
