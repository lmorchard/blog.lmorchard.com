This is a sort of rough sketch of the loosely-joined architecture I want to explore with this thing.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Data</em>: This is where address book entries live.</li>\n<li><em>Model</em>: A set of objects encapsulating the data, this is how address book entries will be accessed.</li>\n<li><em>REST API</em>: Model objects exposed as resources identified by URI, serialized and deserialized as XML, and manipulated by GET / PUT / POST / DELETE methods.</li>\n<li><em>XSLT Filter</em>: XML data produced by REST API calls can be first passed through XSL at a given URL before being served up as a response.  </li>\n<li><em>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</em>: Thanks to the XSLT filter layer, the XML vocabulary used to describe address book entries can be transformed into user interface presentation.</li>\n<li><em>HTTP</em>: Everything happens via HTTP...</li>\n<li><em>Web Browser Client</em>: ...and everything is viewed in a web browser.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, I call this a loosely-joined architecture because I want to stress that you should be able to swap out just about any part of this whenever you want.  </p>\n<p>Want the <em>Data</em> to be in MySQL?  Fine.  Want it to be in flat files?  Fine.  Just make sure the <em>Model</em> can cope while maintaining a consistent interface for the <em>REST API*.  Want to change the user interface in the browser?  Great-- ideally, all you have to do is change some XSLT files.  I&#39;m writing everything from the *XSLT Filter</em> down to the <em>Model</em> in Python.  Don&#39;t like that?  Fine.  Rewrite it all in Perl, and hopefully everything from the XSLT up to the browser will still be useful to you.</p>\n<p>At some point, you might even want to ditch the browser for a native desktop client.  Fabulous! Just ignore everything past the <em>REST API</em> and <em>HTTP</em>, don&#39;t use any XSLT in the <em>Filter</em>, and use the API and XML directly.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t think any of this is particularly revolutionary-- although I thought it was when I first saw Amazon Web Services doing some of this, and I hope to throw a little GMail in as well.  I hope that this will all be useful as I muddle through explaining what I&#39;m doing.

  "summary": "<img src=\"http://www.decafbad.com/2004/12/abook-architecture.jpg\" align=\"right\">\n\n<p>So, in the spirit of <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/11/30/picoprojects_and_trepanation\">pico-projects</a>, I&apos;ve started building <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/11/30/nextgenwebapps\">that address book application</a> I mentioned awhile ago and I want to start writing about it as I go.</p>\n<p>First off, hopefully you&apos;ll notice the quick diagram I threw together in OmniGraffle.  This is a sort of rough sketch of the loosely-joined architecture I want to explore with this thing.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Data</em>: This is where address book entries live.</li>\n<li><em>Model</em>: A set of objects encapsulating the data, this is how address book entries will be accessed.</li>\n<li><em>REST API</em>: Model objects exposed as resources identified by URI, serialized and deserialized as XML, and manipulated by GET / PUT / POST / DELETE methods.</li>\n<li><em>XSLT Filter</em>: XML data produced by REST API calls can be first passed through XSL at a given URL before being served up as a response.  </li>\n<li><em>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</em>: Thanks to the XSLT filter layer, the XML vocabulary used to describe address book entries can be transformed into user interface presentation.</li>\n<li><em>HTTP</em>: Everything happens via HTTP...</li>\n<li><em>Web Browser Client</em>: ...and everything is viewed in a web browser.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, I call this a loosely-joined architecture because I want to stress that you should be able to swap out just about any part of this whenever you want.  </p>\n<p>Want the <em>Data</em> to be in MySQL?  Fine.  Want it to be in flat files?  Fine.  Just make sure the <em>Model</em> can cope while maintaining a consistent interface for the <em>REST API*.  Want to change the user interface in the browser?  Great-- ideally, all you have to do is change some XSLT files.  I&apos;m writing everything from the *XSLT Filter</em> down to the <em>Model</em> in Python.  Don&apos;t like that?  Fine.  Rewrite it all in Perl, and hopefully everything from the XSLT up to the browser will still be useful to you.</p>\n<p>At some point, you might even want to ditch the browser for a native desktop client.  Fabulous! Just ignore everything past the <em>REST API</em> and <em>HTTP</em>, don&apos;t use any XSLT in the <em>Filter</em>, and use the API and XML directly.</p>\n<p>I don&apos;t think any of this is particularly revolutionary-- although I thought it was when I first saw Amazon Web Services doing some of this, and I hope to throw a little GMail in as well.  I hope that this will all be useful as I muddle through explaining what I&apos;m doing.  In the meantime, you can see me getting the stage set as I start checking things into my Subversion repository over here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/svn/trunk/hacks/abook/\">http://www.decafbad.com/svn/trunk/hacks/abook/</a></li></ul>",
