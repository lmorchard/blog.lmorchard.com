As shop in junior high taught me, a lathe is powerful tool <a href=\"http://www.baileycraft.com/spsd400.htm\">capable</a> of doing quite a variety of things.  Some of those things leave you with jewelry and maybe more tools, and other (mis-)uses leave you with nasty injuries.</p>\n<p>If you&#39;ll pardon the bad pun, a general-purpose computer is a &#8220;<strong>meta lathe</strong>&#8221;, capable of an enormous range of things.  A &#8220;meta lathe&#8221; can be more dangerous than a metal lathe because it can be used on itself to expand its own capabilities.

Most of them aren&#39;t trained meta lathe technicians, nor do they want to be.  Mostly, they just want to live better, be happier and more productive, talk to each other, maybe play some games.  For them, the computer should melt into the fabric of their lives while they get on with <em>doing other things</em>.  It&#39;s only a few odd ducks, including alpha geeks like myself, who want to crack things open, go meta, and turn the machine back upon itself.  </p>\n<p>So, why are all these people using full-on meta lathes again?  </p>\n<p>See, I think it all started back with the <a href=\"http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1976.htm\">Homebrew Club</a> and their contraptions.  These were proto-lathes right from the start.  <a href=\"http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1978.htm\">Pretty soon</a>, there rose assemblers and operating systems, which made it easier to write software like VisiCalc and WordStar--and so these meta lathes started looking interesting to people outside the Homebrew Clubs.  However, these users didn&#39;t want meta lathes--they didn&#39;t even know what meta lathes were--they just wanted VisiCalc and WordStar and you needed one of these weird boxes to run them.  </p>\n<p>Problem is, the modern descendants of VisiCalc and WordStar have yet to be separated from the meta lathe platforms on which they were crafted.  It&#39;s like you&#39;ve made a bracelet or a ring on the lathe--but instead of unclamping it and taking it off the machine, you just wear it: bracelet, lathe, and all.
