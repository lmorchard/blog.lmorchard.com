        <section class="post-content">
          <p>So, I think I&#39;m almost out of steam for now on this weekend&#39;s thoughts.</p>
<p>I&#39;m starting to get interested in things like embedded Linux to make custom limited-purpose kernels and application environments.  And I want to order things like <a href="http://www.gumstix.com/sys_tinycomp.html">Gumstix</a> to play with building little appliances--though admittedly, in part, because I just want more toys and blinking lights.  (Maybe what I&#39;m really interested in is just Lego MindStorms.)</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also been thinking that I really don&#39;t know enough about the state-of-the-art in security on today&#39;s shared general-purpose computers to talk with much authority about ditching them for hordes of limited-purpose appliances.  I&#39;ve read some books and some blogs, for what that&#39;s worth.  And I&#39;ve played a bit with <a href="http://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/papers/jail/jail-4.html#section4">chroot and jail</a>, <a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">User-mode Linux</a>, virtual machines, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/Episode035/default.asp">Managed Code</a> as things to look into in the pursuit of further simplified and isolated systems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have concerns that ditching the open, general-purpose PC could kill a lot of freedom.  This is especially worrisome if appliance vendors lock into proprietary networking and communication standards, or require nasty licenses like for the CSS algorithm used with DVDs.  I&#39;d really want to see the fabric between appliances, the circulatory system between my PC&#39;s exploded organs, based on open standards and protocols.  Right now, the general-purpose PC is virtual and fluid enough to dodge efforts to hold it in place, but firmware and hardware are practically forever.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to have to buy a license to operate my meta lathe--my distaste for Microsoft is more about the claustrophobia I personally experience as a tinkerer within their environments than with any worries about spyware or viruses.  I feel like it&#39;s a dangerous time for tinkerers right now, and I don&#39;t want to see anything happen that would weaken our positions.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t want to see JavaScript, VB for Applications, or other end-user programming facilities to vanish.  And I think it&#39;d be disastrous if there was no way for kids today to <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly_digital">become Newly Digital</a>.</p>
<p>Whew.  So I think that&#39;s about all for now.  Knowing me, I probably won&#39;t post here again for a year or so.  :)</p>
