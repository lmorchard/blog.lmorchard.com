        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&amp;apos;s the last month of 2004 tomorrow, and it&amp;apos;s occurred to me that I haven&amp;apos;t spent much time around here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing a quick check, it looks like I&amp;apos;ve written a little over 50 posts &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2004/&quot;&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;, down from around 170 &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2003/&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;.  And the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2002/&quot;&gt;year before that&lt;/a&gt; was around 340.  Mainly, my activity around here has progressed toward much more link blogging using my own tools and, more recently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;.  When I actually have written something of my own lately, I&amp;apos;ve tended toward sweating over longer entries or nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does all this mean I&amp;apos;m an ex-blogger?  Or was I ever?  On the other hand, who really cares?  Funny thing is, I&amp;apos;m sure I can find a few dozen entries I&amp;apos;ve written, self-flagellating about not writing more often.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to let you read from my handwritten journals, you&amp;apos;d find the same thing every few entries.  It seems I suffer from a strange complex of guilt and pedestal building: I feel guilty for not writing more, but then when I have something quick I could write, I feel guilty for not having something grander to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&amp;apos;s also the fact that I had a really busy streak in my work-a-day life for awhile there, but for the past month or so I&amp;apos;ve mostly been lying fallow.  Now, I&amp;apos;m getting antsy to produce some &lt;strong&gt;Worthwhile Things&lt;/strong&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bah.  How about an early New Years&amp;apos; Resolution to follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/22/bloggingyourbliss&quot;&gt;my own advice&lt;/a&gt; and let my brain dribble barely-worthy crap here on a more regular basis.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, how about I make this the last entry I write about not writing entries?  I&amp;apos;m sure I can come up with other topics about which to write when I can&amp;apos;t think of what to write.&lt;/p&gt;

<div class="content">Like the "show about nothing" or "blogging about blogging" you could just "write about (not) writing" it's brilliant!
Back in 1998 or so, when there were like a dozen or so bloggers, before the word was really invented, I suggested that everyone pick a buddy, and if the buddy went more than a few days without writing, it was your duty to bug them to write something.
Perhaps you need a buddy...</div>
