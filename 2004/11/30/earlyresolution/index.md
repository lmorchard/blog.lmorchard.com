It's the last month of 2004 tomorrow, and it's occurred to me that I haven't spent much time around here.  

Doing a quick check, it looks like I've written a little over 50 posts [this year](/blog/2004/), down from around 170 [last year](/blog/2003/).  And the [year before that](/blog/2002/) was around 340.  Mainly, my activity around here has progressed toward much more link blogging using my own tools and, more recently, [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us).  When I actually have written something of my own lately, I've tended toward sweating over longer entries or nothing at all.

Does all this mean I'm an ex-blogger?  Or was I ever?  On the other hand, who really cares?  Funny thing is, I'm sure I can find a few dozen entries I've written, self-flagellating about not writing more often.  

If I were to let you read from my handwritten journals, you'd find the same thing every few entries.  It seems I suffer from a strange complex of guilt and pedestal building: I feel guilty for not writing more, but then when I have something quick I could write, I feel guilty for not having something grander to offer.

Of course, there's also the fact that I had a really busy streak in my work-a-day life for awhile there, but for the past month or so I've mostly been lying fallow.  Now, I'm getting antsy to produce some **Worthwhile Things** again.

Bah.  How about an early New Years' Resolution to follow [my own advice](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/22/bloggingyourbliss) and let my brain dribble barely-worthy crap here on a more regular basis.  

And, how about I make this the last entry I write about not writing entries?  I'm sure I can come up with other topics about which to write when I can't think of what to write.

            <div class="content">Like the "show about nothing" or "blogging about blogging" you could just "write about (not) writing" it's brilliant!

Back in 1998 or so, when there were like a dozen or so bloggers, before the word was really invented, I suggested that everyone pick a buddy, and if the buddy went more than a few days without writing, it was your duty to bug them to write something.

Perhaps you need a buddy...</div>
