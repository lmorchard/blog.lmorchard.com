    "html": "<p>So, like I was saying:  I&#39;ve been working on <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/kwiki?FeedReactor\">FeedReactor</a> and have been doing some things with it that I find rather interesting, independent of news aggregation.  </p>\n<p>One of the core goals I have for FeedReactor is to explore what it takes to build a web app that exploits <a href=\"http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html\">principles of REST architecture</a>.  Having already <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooccb\">sung the praises</a> of XML-RPC, I wanted to get immersed in REST and see what all the hubbub was about.  I&#39;ve got some ways to go, but I think I understand the major concepts now, and it&#39;s a pretty nifty frame within which to work.</p>\n<p>But, two other things I&#39;ve added to my mix have really made things interesting for me:  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>XSLT filtering</li>\n<li>The XmlHTTPRequest object</li>\n</ol>\n<p>XSLT and REST make a really good pair, as <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1\">Amazon Web Services already demonstrate</a>.  Inspired by that API (<a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/09/02/xsl_scraper\">and earlier experiments</a>), I use XML for all the input and output formats in my API and accept a query string parameter that contains the path to an XSLT file.  When this parameter is supplied, the XML output by the API is first processed using the given XSLT.  (Think of it like piping API output through <code>xsltproc</code>.)</p>\n<p>So, with a properly constructed collection of XSLT, I can present a browser-viewable HTML user interface served up directly from REST API calls.  Links, frame sets, and iframes present in the HTML lead the user from that call to the next XSLT-wrapped REST API call. </p>\n<p>But, once the initial HTML-and-JavaScript payload reaches the browser, it gets better (<a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/10/22/43OPstrategic_1.html\">ala Gmail</a>):  </p>\n<p>On older browsers (if I happen to care about them), I can make new HTTP requests back to the server <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/iframe.html\">from JavaScript using iframes</a>.  In this case, XSLT filtering lets me retrofit the API&#39;s responses to the HTML-and-JavaScript crud I need to serve up to make things happen back in the browser client.  Unfortunately, passing data <em>to</em> the API (which expects XML, not form submissions) is still a bit wonky and requires some hacks and exceptions involving hidden forms and such.</p>\n<p>However, on the newer browsers, it&#39;s all about the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html\">XmlHTTPRequest object</a>.  With this facility, I can make clean asynchronous requests back to the REST API, including XML data in the request body if I feel like it.  Responses are handled by JavaScript callbacks, which twiddle the browser DOM to update the user interface in response.  </p>\n<p>So, after the major initial contact with the API to supply the browser with HTML by way of XSLT, most future interactions take place in the form of direct calls to the REST API using XML.  Although for some things, it&#39;s easier to just reload a page of HTML, it&#39;s nicer for most interactions to be handled via DOM manipulations in-place.  I&#39;ve been amazed at the Gmail-like responsiveness I get from FeedReactor when I&#39;m skimming through news items, marking some as seen or flagged, and popping open the descriptions on others.  </p>\n<p>I suppose I <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be amazed at the responsiveness, since I&#39;m using some of the same techniques as Gmail.  However, my daily-use installation of FeedReactor is presently running on an old 300Mhz Debian Linux PC at home, and it&#39;s taking me through the daily produce of 600 subscribed feeds faster than any desktop aggregator has yet.  Of course, this is partly a product of my familiarity with the UI I&#39;ve cobbled together, but... <em>the server&#39;s running on a 300Mhz PC with 256MB of RAM!</em>  And the client is my 867Mhz G4 PowerBook, running Firefox or Safari, depending on my mood.</p>\n<p>Although I can&#39;t see when I&#39;ll have time for it, I really want to explore this approach further using desktop apps on OS X and accessing the API from Flash movies (maybe using <a href=\"http://openlaszlo.org/\">Laszlo</a>).

You see, this is the very sort of thing I started this blog to combat-- I come up with some keen ideas and start hacking away by my lonesome.  But then, I eventually get frustrated with something and wander off.  </p>\n<p>I&#39;ve left dozens of mini- and saddeningly macro-projects in my wake, forgotten on hard drives long since trashed, none of them ever seeing the light of day.  Because, when I just work by myself, I don&#39;t get any feedback for having been dumb, and I don&#39;t get any gratification for having been clever.</p>\n<p>The problem is that I go out on these long arcs of fiddling, nothing ever in any satisfyingly complete state, and move onto something else before I feel like things are in any shape to share with anyone.  What I really should be doing is documenting things here as I go along, releasing pico-projects demonstrating the little things that make me squeak in geekish joy as I discover them.  Then, when or if I ever release the Big Wonderful Project, all the little pieces will have already been shared and explained.

    "body": "Despite going between large helpings of long work hours and laziness, there has been at least one project I've been working on periodically: [FeedReactor](http://decafbad.com/kwiki/?FeedReactor).  \r\n\r\nI've been alternating in my head between rushing off and [starting a business](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/20/bootstrapping_out_into_open_space) or giving the whole thing up.  You see, this is the very sort of thing I started this blog to combat-- I come up with some keen ideas and start hacking away by my lonesome.  But then, I eventually get frustrated with something and wander off.  \r\n\r\nI've left dozens of mini- and saddeningly macro-projects in my wake, forgotten on hard drives long since trashed, none of them ever seeing the light of day.  Because, when I just work by myself, I don't get any feedback for having been dumb, and I don't get any gratification for having been clever.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I go out on these long arcs of fiddling, nothing ever in any satisfyingly complete state, and move onto something else before I feel like things are in any shape to share with anyone.  What I really should be doing is documenting things here as I go along, releasing pico-projects demonstrating the little things that make me squeak in geekish joy as I discover them.  Then, when or if I ever release the Big Wonderful Project, all the little pieces will have already been shared and explained.  And if I never do release the beast, no matter-- the pieces and micro-innovations (if I produce any) will survive.  \r\n\r\nAnd then there's the thing I've been missing all along:  feedback.  If I happen to spew out anything that catches anyone's interest, maybe a bit of a give-and-take loop will form that will cause me to *happily* abandon the Big Wonderful thing and regroup around something unexpected and even more fun that sprang from something I thought was just a neat side-effect of something else.\r\n\r\nSee, in abstract, I understand how all this is supposed to work.  I just have to drum it into my mad-scientist skull.  \r\n\r\n(I wonder if [trepanation](http://www.trepanationguide.com/) would help with that?)\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086850\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7d1c8d2b1a7643236a4661e9a974dee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\">George Hotelling</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086850\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-11-30T15:36:17\">2004-11-30T15:36:17</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I saw a really good quote on del.icio.us/tag/gtd - \"You can do anything but you can't do everything.\"  \r\n\r\nI've got a ton of project ideas bouncing around too, but I'm trying to look at them from the perspective \"If I want to do x I can't do y\" which gives me a better way to weigh whether something is a good investment of my time.

And the <a href=\"/blog/2002/\">year before that</a> was around 340.

When I actually have written something of my own lately, I&apos;ve tended toward sweating over longer entries or nothing at all.</p>\n<p>Does all this mean I&apos;m an ex-blogger?  Or was I ever?  On the other hand, who really cares?  Funny thing is, I&apos;m sure I can find a few dozen entries I&apos;ve written, self-flagellating about not writing more often.  </p>\n<p>If I were to let you read from my handwritten journals, you&apos;d find the same thing every few entries.  It seems I suffer from a strange complex of guilt and pedestal building: I feel guilty for not writing more, but then when I have something quick I could write, I feel guilty for not having something grander to offer.</p>\n<p>Of course, there&apos;s also the fact that I had a really busy streak in my work-a-day life for awhile there, but for the past month or so I&apos;ve mostly been lying fallow.
