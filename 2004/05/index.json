    "html": "<p>I&#39;ve written before about becoming <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly_digital\">newly digital</a>, and although I had my start an Atari 800, the Commodore 64 is where I really settled in for a self-education in how these machines worked.  That was the first I managed to convince my family to buy, and the first anyone left in my unsupervised hands.  And as I did manage to go through at least 4 of the things, the results were not always pretty.  My mom was still finding &#39;extra&#39; screws and bits of solder in my old room&#39;s carpet years after I&#39;d moved out, until she finally tore it up and replaced it a year or two ago.</p>\n<p>However, with less physically destructive hacking, in software, is how I spent more of my time.  I used to love typing in the programs from <a href=\"http://www.myoldcomputers.com/museum/mag/gaz.htm\">Compute!&#39;s Gazette</a> and <a href=\"http://www.retroarchive.org/cpm/cdrom/ENTERPRS/C64/AHOY/\">Ahoy</a> magazines.  Once I&#39;d seen a program of theirs run once or twice, I&#39;d fire up the <a href=\"http://www.ffd2.com/fridge/programs/supermon.s\">monitor program</a> and step through the assembly code to see how it worked and what I could tweak.  </p>\n<p>Early on in my junior high, an older guy (well, in his early 40&#39;s - positively ancient to me in my early 10&#39;s) who helped run a nearby computer store I haunted introduced me to <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/\">The Transactor</a>.  Now, this was what I had been really wanting!  <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/\">The Transactor</a> was a Canadian-produced magazine on the C64 (and later the Amiga) which dispensed with any niceties of games or home productivity crap and dove straight into the good stuff.  </p>\n<p>There were very few pictures in <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/\">The Transactor</a>: the magazine&#39;s pages contained mostly dense text and code listings.  The first issue I got my hands on featured <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/v5/i5/p030.html\">the first in a series of articles</a> describing a wedged-in, extensive enhancement to the Microsoft Basic contained in the C64&#39;s ROM.  The arrival of a new issue at our house was one of my favorite events - I read each from cover to cover until they stopped coming.  </p>\n<p>One of the final issues presented <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/v9/i6/p024.html\">an article</a> in which the author expanded the C64&#39;s 64K of RAM up to a whopping 1,024K of RAM with a combination of bank-switching in software, a modified external memory cartridge, and desoldering and replacing the RAM chips inside the C64 itself.  In my mind, today&#39;s overclocking and funky glowing case-mods pale in comparison to hacks of that caliber.  (Although, the hackers prying secrets out of gaming consoles--like my modded XBox--seem to have the spirit!)</p>\n<p>So anyway, the point of all this nostalgia is this:  I&#39;ve always wanted to be the kind of hacker who did those sorts of clever things and wrote about them for other kids like me to read and try.  </p>\n<p>While I can&#39;t really attest to my own cleverness, I can at least work toward the writing part.

Nibble wasn't the only magazine of that type either, just the biggest. Call-APPLE (the newsletter of the Apple Pugetsound Program Library Exchange, a big Seattle user group) ran a legendary article once on how to make the disk operating system load files about 5 times faster.\nA friend of mine and I submitted several programs to Nibble, but neither of us ever had one accepted. I did later publish some articles in a small assembly language newsletter and wound up editing a couple for the same publisher. This was the start of my writing career. I later slung code and words for a couple of Apple ii and Mac software developers and then switched over to doing just the words, which I've been doing ever since.\nAhh, good times, good times.\nI have a bunch of things (scripts, mostly) kind of half-finished and partially released; maybe i should get serious about cleaning them up and publishing them in some way.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084300\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=702e6eecfa91e5a207315789aa02d7c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Ken Stailey</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084300\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-06-11T04:12:15\">2004-06-11T04:12:15</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">So lucky you could convince your family to buy computers.

Nibble wasn't the only magazine of that type either, just the biggest. Call-APPLE (the newsletter of the Apple Pugetsound Program Library Exchange, a big Seattle user group) ran a legendary article once on how to make the disk operating system load files about 5 times faster.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine and I submitted several programs to Nibble, but neither of us ever had one accepted. I did later publish some articles in a small assembly language newsletter and wound up editing a couple for the same publisher. This was the start of my writing career. I later slung code and words for a couple of Apple ii and Mac software developers and then switched over to doing just the words, which I've been doing ever since.\r\n\r\nAhh, good times, good times.\r\n\r\nI have a bunch of things (scripts, mostly) kind of half-finished and partially released; maybe i should get serious about cleaning them up and publishing them in some way.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084300\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=702e6eecfa91e5a207315789aa02d7c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Ken Stailey</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084300\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-06-11T04:12:15\">2004-06-11T04:12:15</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">So lucky you could convince your family to buy computers.

Anyway, try again with a different password or two and I finally get to what I want.\r\n\r\nTalk about [surprising the user][surprise]...\r\n\r\n[surprise]: http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch11s01.html\r\n[cdnow]: http://news.com.com/2100-1023-976008.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090382\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=99b77c34a0e26fd04a058f8c2dbab290&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090382\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-05-19T19:27:06\">2004-05-19T19:27:06</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">That would actually be pretty cool if it didn't sound like such a pain in the ass.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090383\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://glinden.blogspot.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8b702a775f458d5c2cf53f1021cb3ac6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://glinden.blogspot.com\">Greg Linden</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090383\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-05-19T20:27:15\">2004-05-19T20:27:15</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">If you're curious, the reason that feature exists is because some people share e-mail addresses.

It wasn't until months later that I realized that you're never done.  After the third upgrade of X11, I realized that the bigger and more important a package is, the more bugs it contains, and the quicker they are found (\"many eyes\" and all that), so you end up recompiling X and Mozilla a lot more often than you'd planned.\nAs for performance, it's the only Linux I've ever installed on my iBook, so I don't have anything to compare it to.

I use Virtual PC for my Linux fix (actually, for GNUCash and some other minor programs that I don't want to buy for Windows). If Valve/Steam ever ported Steam and HL to Linux though... the battle would be on. =)\nMy server, however, is Gentoo (It's been Gentoo, OpenBSD, and Slackware), but I like Gentoo the best.

But, just what *do* you do with a machine entirely devoted to Windows, anyway?\r\n\r\nAnd just why can't I get an [ancient game][subspace] working acceptably on my PowerBook under Virtual PC anyway?! \r\n\r\n[cygwinmysql]: http://anfaenger.de/cygwin-1.5/mysql/\r\n[gentoo]: http://www.gentoo.org/\r\n[dllhell]: http://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Database/DLLHell.aspx\r\n[ext2fsd]: http://ext2.yeah.net\r\n[ext2fs3]: http://www.ext2fs-anywhere.com/\r\n[ut]: http://www.unrealtournament.com/\r\n[subspace]: http://www.subspacehq.com/\r\n[cygwin]: http://www.subspacehq.com/\r\n[colinux]: http://www.colinux.org/\r\n[tv]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/10/homebrew_entertainment_appliances_cheap_open_and_embattled\r\n[account]: http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001962.html\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088030\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.geocities.com/rschmertz/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=368fade064c39e0034b5dc07782acc41&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.geocities.com/rschmertz/\">Bob S</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088030\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-05-12T10:16:08\">2004-05-12T10:16:08</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Yes, compiling everything does get old.  When I first started out w/ Gentoo, I thought, \"cool, it'll take me maybe a couple of days to build everything, but once I'm done, I'll have a screaming fast system\".  It wasn't until months later that I realized that you're never done.  After the third upgrade of X11, I realized that the bigger and more important a package is, the more bugs it contains, and the quicker they are found (\"many eyes\" and all that), so you end up recompiling X and Mozilla a lot more often than you'd planned.\r\n\r\nAs for performance, it's the only Linux I've ever installed on my iBook, so I don't have anything to compare it to.

    "html": "<p>I&#39;ve <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/07/oooach\">been tinkering</a> for years now with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/02/27/ooooch\">TiVO-zing my PC</a>, with varying degrees of success.  But, that&#39;s not what I really want.  Lately, I&#39;ve been reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262640414/0xdecafbad-20\">The Invisible Computer</a> by Donald A. Norman, and it&#39;s gotten me thinking: What I really want is a family of information appliances.  I&#39;d like to have a little Linux box with a capture card or two that just silently whirrs away, filling up a file-server Linux box (maybe like <a href=\"http://gizmodo.net/archives/002007.php\">this one</a>) with recorded video.  And then, I&#39;d like a Linux box in the living room whose sole purpose is to pull content from the file-server and present it on the screen and speakers in our living room.</p>\n<p>So far, I&#39;ve got the file-server Linux box in the basement that can supply the laptops and other devices in the apartment with various forms of audio and visual and other data.  Another fun recent advance is that I&#39;ve modded my XBox, replacing my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/07/30/powerbook_on_tv\">PowerBook as a home entertainment system component</a>.  The XBox isn&#39;t a little Linux box in the current configuration--<a href=\"http://gentoox.shallax.com/\">though it could be</a>--but it&#39;s open enough for my tastes, running the <a href=\"http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/\">XBox Media Center</a>.  </p>\n<p>But, I still just can&#39;t quite seem to get the TV capture end of things working to my satisfaction.  I think it has to do with the ATI All-in-Wonder card I have, and various trials and tribulations involved in trying to get it usable and capturing under Linux.  But now, since I&#39;ve given up on Linux for the moment and reinstalled WinXP, the card isn&#39;t even working the way it <em>used to</em> on <em>Windows</em> using ATI&#39;s own drivers and software.  I&#39;ve been flirting with the idea of picking up <a href=\"http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/prods_pvrs.html\">a WinTV card from Hauppage</a>, since I&#39;ve heard much better noises from that direction.  </p>\n<p>One dim ray of hope for the ATI comes from <a href=\"http://www.snapstream.com/\">SnapStream Media</a> and their <a href=\"http://www.snapstream.com/Products/Products_PVS3.asp\">Beyond TV product</a>.  This thing is very slick and allows complete control via web browser.  It&#39;s quite possibly worth the money if you have a capable computer and don&#39;t feel like tinkering much.  However, this app seems a bit heavyweight for my on-hand equipment.  But, it works, if I don&#39;t ask too much from the PC otherwise.  (I&#39;m really trying to stretch some all-but-obsolete PC hardware here, having not spent a dime on Wintel since I got my iBook a few years ago.)</p>\n<p>But, wait.  Isn&#39;t TiVO actually a little Linux box that whirrs away, filling up a hard drive with recorded video.  If I&#39;m starting down a slippery slope of maybe <em>buying</em> something like Beyond TV, why haven&#39;t I just broken down and gotten one of those?  </p>\n<p>Well, the first thing is that I want to tinker--like <a href=\"http://www-tech.mit.edu/V124/N20/ValentiIntervie.20f.html\">this guy</a>, who said he built his own high-definition television and amazed Jack Valenti.  I modded my XBox, which is certainly not cheerful news to Microsoft, and I know that you can do some tinkering with a TiVO, but that&#39;s certainly not supported either.  Wouldn&#39;t it be interesting if manufacturers of entertainment appliances ran things like video game companies, encouraging and supporting creative modifications and enhancements to their products?

    "body": "I've [been tinkering][homebrewpvr] for years now with [TiVO-zing my PC][tivopc], with varying degrees of success.  But, that's not what I really want.  Lately, I've been reading [The Invisible Computer][invisible computer] by Donald A. Norman, and it's gotten me thinking: What I really want is a family of information appliances.  I'd like to have a little Linux box with a capture card or two that just silently whirrs away, filling up a file-server Linux box (maybe like [this one][martian_storage]) with recorded video.  And then, I'd like a Linux box in the living room whose sole purpose is to pull content from the file-server and present it on the screen and speakers in our living room.\r\n\r\nSo far, I've got the file-server Linux box in the basement that can supply the laptops and other devices in the apartment with various forms of audio and visual and other data.  Another fun recent advance is that I've modded my XBox, replacing my [PowerBook as a home entertainment system component][pbtv].  The XBox isn't a little Linux box in the current configuration--[though it could be][gentoox]--but it's open enough for my tastes, running the [XBox Media Center][xbmc].  \r\n\r\nBut, I still just can't quite seem to get the TV capture end of things working to my satisfaction.  I think it has to do with the ATI All-in-Wonder card I have, and various trials and tribulations involved in trying to get it usable and capturing under Linux.  But now, since I've given up on Linux for the moment and reinstalled WinXP, the card isn't even working the way it *used to* on *Windows* using ATI's own drivers and software.  I've been flirting with the idea of picking up [a WinTV card from Hauppage][wintv], since I've heard much better noises from that direction.  \r\n\r\nOne dim ray of hope for the ATI comes from [SnapStream Media][snapstream] and their [Beyond TV product][beyondtv].  This thing is very slick and allows complete control via web browser.  It's quite possibly worth the money if you have a capable computer and don't feel like tinkering much.  However, this app seems a bit heavyweight for my on-hand equipment.  But, it works, if I don't ask too much from the PC otherwise.  (I'm really trying to stretch some all-but-obsolete PC hardware here, having not spent a dime on Wintel since I got my iBook a few years ago.)\r\n\r\nBut, wait.  Isn't TiVO actually a little Linux box that whirrs away, filling up a hard drive with recorded video.  If I'm starting down a slippery slope of maybe *buying* something like Beyond TV, why haven't I just broken down and gotten one of those?  \r\n\r\nWell, the first thing is that I want to tinker--like [this guy][interview], who said he built his own high-definition television and amazed Jack Valenti.  I modded my XBox, which is certainly not cheerful news to Microsoft, and I know that you can do some tinkering with a TiVO, but that's certainly not supported either.  Wouldn't it be interesting if manufacturers of entertainment appliances ran things like video game companies, encouraging and supporting creative modifications and enhancements to their products?  Imagine that.\r\n\r\nThe second thing is that, at the moment, I'm cheap.  Not that retail appliances like a TiVO are all *that* expensive for what they do, but I know that I can D.I.Y. with much less expensive stuff.  And right now, I'm trying to do it with very old stuff and having a surprising amount of success.\r\n\r\nThe third and most important thing is this: were I to buy something to fit one or all of these functions from someone else, I'd be at the mercy of their whims and the whims of their lawyers and the MPAA/RIAA lawyers talking to their lawyers.  As it is, I'm sure I'm breaking a slew of laws just doing what I have so far with my own equipment.  Oh, and it's always happy times when they turn around an [change their terms on you][itunes] after you've paid to get in the door.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be nice if we had a friendly environment for open experimentation with [information appliances][invisible computer] and cooperative content producers?  I'd love to pay a monthly fee to have shows by Joss Whedon stream on down do my file-server with BitTorrent.  I'd love to subscribe to favorite indie bands' releases and have them show up in the music folder.  I'm cheap, so I'd like the price to be low, but I'll still pay for what I like.  And I'd love to do all this, still being able to tinker, still seeing that people producing things I like get paid, without going to jail or letting them empty my wallet with a wet/dry vac.\r\n\r\n[gentoox]: http://gentoox.shallax.com/\r\n[interview]: http://www-tech.mit.edu/V124/N20/ValentiIntervie.20f.html\r\n[itunes]: http://george.hotelling.net/90percent/itunes_45_good_and_bad.php\r\n[beyondtv]: http://www.snapstream.com/Products/Products_PVS3.asp\r\n[snapstream]: http://www.snapstream.com/\r\n[xbmc]: http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/\r\n[wintv]: http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/prods_pvrs.html\r\n[invisible computer]: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262640414/0xdecafbad-20\r\n[martian_storage]: http://gizmodo.net/archives/002007.php\r\n[wireless_storage]: http://www.buffalotech.com/wireless/products/NetworkProducts/HDH120LAN.html\r\n[missadroit]: http://missadroit.livejournal.com\r\n[sp]: http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~john/procrastination.html\r\n[intimidation]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/04/29/_look_its_a_post_about_not_posting\r\n[procrastination]: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001079\r\n[homebrewpvr]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/07/oooach\r\n[tivopc]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/02/27/ooooch\r\n[pbtv]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/07/30/powerbook_on_tv\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082794\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d3520ad50fa42c9319830bd9f0900c5d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">John Burton</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082794\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-05-10T23:46:04\">2004-05-10T23:46:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I couldn't cope without my tivo.

Actually, they&#39;re not my glasses, but this one guy&#39;s <a href=\"http://cavedoni.com/2004/02/rss1\">offering a service</a> and this other guy&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.aaronland.info/xsl/atom/0.3/\">offering some XSLT</a> -- both or either of these can help make all that annoying Atom gibberish look just like RSS to you and your favorite aggregator.  Hooray for the <a href=\"http://udell.roninhouse.com/bytecols/2001-08-15.html\">URL-as-command-line</a>!</p>\n<p>For instance, if you hate that <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/xml/atom.xml\">Mark Pilgrim&#39;s feed</a> is only available in Atom flavor now, screw him and get it <a href=\"http://cavedoni.com/2004/02/rss1?uri=http://diveintomark.org/xml/atom.xml\">RSS flavored</a> anyway!  The feed even <a href=\"http://rss.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcavedoni.com%2F2004%2F02%2Frss1%3Furi%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fdiveintomark.org%2Fxml%2Fatom.xml\">validates as RSS</a>.  (Though, if you&#39;re in the RSS-loving camp, I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;d want to hear from the likes of <em>him</em> anyway.)</p>\n<p>You know what this means?  It means you can forget about Atom.  Whenever you see an Atom feed, just put on your RSS-colored glasses.  Hell, if you&#39;re an aggregator developer, make the RSS-colored glasses built-in.  You don&#39;t even have to embed an XSLT processor in your application: just offer the service from your own web servers and substitute the filter URL automatically when one of your users tries to subscribe to an Atom feed.  </p>\n<p>(Though, you know, it would be awfully nice of you to throw in an XSLT processor.  At least one aggregator author thinks it&#39;s <a href=\"http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/04/new_gray_boxes_.html\">a good idea</a>.  So does <a href=\"http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000454.html\">this user / customer</a>.  But, it&#39;s admittedly an idea bordering on NeatLikeDigitalWatches.)</p>\n<p>Or, get this: borrow a service or a stylesheet hosted by an Atom sympathizer.  If there&#39;s demand and I feel like taking some abuse, I&#39;ll host such a service right here.  (Though I&#39;d likely live to regret doing <em>that</em>!)  In fact, using a set of RSS-colored glasses maintained by an Atom sympathizer is the best thing.  Let that poor altruistic sucker keep up with the rapid pace of change in the Atom world, updating XSLT, while you just happily go on seeing the world in RSS.</p>\n<p>There.  Problem solved.
