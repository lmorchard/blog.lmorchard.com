  "html": "<p>I&#39;ve written before about becoming <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/13/newly_digital\">newly digital</a>, and although I had my start an Atari 800, the Commodore 64 is where I really settled in for a self-education in how these machines worked.  That was the first I managed to convince my family to buy, and the first anyone left in my unsupervised hands.  And as I did manage to go through at least 4 of the things, the results were not always pretty.  My mom was still finding &#39;extra&#39; screws and bits of solder in my old room&#39;s carpet years after I&#39;d moved out, until she finally tore it up and replaced it a year or two ago.</p>\n<p>However, with less physically destructive hacking, in software, is how I spent more of my time.  I used to love typing in the programs from <a href=\"http://www.myoldcomputers.com/museum/mag/gaz.htm\">Compute!&#39;s Gazette</a> and <a href=\"http://www.retroarchive.org/cpm/cdrom/ENTERPRS/C64/AHOY/\">Ahoy</a> magazines.  Once I&#39;d seen a program of theirs run once or twice, I&#39;d fire up the <a href=\"http://www.ffd2.com/fridge/programs/supermon.s\">monitor program</a> and step through the assembly code to see how it worked and what I could tweak.  </p>\n<p>Early on in my junior high, an older guy (well, in his early 40&#39;s - positively ancient to me in my early 10&#39;s) who helped run a nearby computer store I haunted introduced me to <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/\">The Transactor</a>.  Now, this was what I had been really wanting!  <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/\">The Transactor</a> was a Canadian-produced magazine on the C64 (and later the Amiga) which dispensed with any niceties of games or home productivity crap and dove straight into the good stuff.  </p>\n<p>There were very few pictures in <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/\">The Transactor</a>: the magazine&#39;s pages contained mostly dense text and code listings.  The first issue I got my hands on featured <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/v5/i5/p030.html\">the first in a series of articles</a> describing a wedged-in, extensive enhancement to the Microsoft Basic contained in the C64&#39;s ROM.  The arrival of a new issue at our house was one of my favorite events - I read each from cover to cover until they stopped coming.  </p>\n<p>One of the final issues presented <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/v9/i6/p024.html\">an article</a> in which the author expanded the C64&#39;s 64K of RAM up to a whopping 1,024K of RAM with a combination of bank-switching in software, a modified external memory cartridge, and desoldering and replacing the RAM chips inside the C64 itself.  In my mind, today&#39;s overclocking and funky glowing case-mods pale in comparison to hacks of that caliber.

Nibble wasn't the only magazine of that type either, just the biggest. Call-APPLE (the newsletter of the Apple Pugetsound Program Library Exchange, a big Seattle user group) ran a legendary article once on how to make the disk operating system load files about 5 times faster.\nA friend of mine and I submitted several programs to Nibble, but neither of us ever had one accepted. I did later publish some articles in a small assembly language newsletter and wound up editing a couple for the same publisher. This was the start of my writing career. I later slung code and words for a couple of Apple ii and Mac software developers and then switched over to doing just the words, which I've been doing ever since.\nAhh, good times, good times.\nI have a bunch of things (scripts, mostly) kind of half-finished and partially released; maybe i should get serious about cleaning them up and publishing them in some way.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084300\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=702e6eecfa91e5a207315789aa02d7c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Ken Stailey</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084300\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-06-11T04:12:15\">2004-06-11T04:12:15</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">So lucky you could convince your family to buy computers.

Nibble wasn't the only magazine of that type either, just the biggest. Call-APPLE (the newsletter of the Apple Pugetsound Program Library Exchange, a big Seattle user group) ran a legendary article once on how to make the disk operating system load files about 5 times faster.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine and I submitted several programs to Nibble, but neither of us ever had one accepted. I did later publish some articles in a small assembly language newsletter and wound up editing a couple for the same publisher. This was the start of my writing career. I later slung code and words for a couple of Apple ii and Mac software developers and then switched over to doing just the words, which I've been doing ever since.\r\n\r\nAhh, good times, good times.\r\n\r\nI have a bunch of things (scripts, mostly) kind of half-finished and partially released; maybe i should get serious about cleaning them up and publishing them in some way.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084300\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=702e6eecfa91e5a207315789aa02d7c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Ken Stailey</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084300\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-06-11T04:12:15\">2004-06-11T04:12:15</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">So lucky you could convince your family to buy computers.
