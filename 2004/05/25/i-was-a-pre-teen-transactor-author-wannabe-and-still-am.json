That was the first I managed to convince my family to buy, and the first anyone left in my unsupervised hands.  And as I did manage to go through at least 4 of the things, the results were not always pretty.  My mom was still finding &#39;extra&#39; screws and bits of solder in my old room&#39;s carpet years after I&#39;d moved out, until she finally tore it up and replaced it a year or two ago.</p>\n<p>However, with less physically destructive hacking, in software, is how I spent more of my time.  I used to love typing in the programs from <a href=\"http://www.myoldcomputers.com/museum/mag/gaz.htm\">Compute!&#39;s Gazette</a> and <a href=\"http://www.retroarchive.org/cpm/cdrom/ENTERPRS/C64/AHOY/\">Ahoy</a> magazines.  Once I&#39;d seen a program of theirs run once or twice, I&#39;d fire up the <a href=\"http://www.ffd2.com/fridge/programs/supermon.s\">monitor program</a> and step through the assembly code to see how it worked and what I could tweak.  </p>\n<p>Early on in my junior high, an older guy (well, in his early 40&#39;s - positively ancient to me in my early 10&#39;s) who helped run a nearby computer store I haunted introduced me to <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/\">The Transactor</a>.  Now, this was what I had been really wanting!  <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/\">The Transactor</a> was a Canadian-produced magazine on the C64 (and later the Amiga) which dispensed with any niceties of games or home productivity crap and dove straight into the good stuff.  </p>\n<p>There were very few pictures in <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/\">The Transactor</a>: the magazine&#39;s pages contained mostly dense text and code listings.  The first issue I got my hands on featured <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/v5/i5/p030.html\">the first in a series of articles</a> describing a wedged-in, extensive enhancement to the Microsoft Basic contained in the C64&#39;s ROM.  The arrival of a new issue at our house was one of my favorite events - I read each from cover to cover until they stopped coming.  </p>\n<p>One of the final issues presented <a href=\"http://cbm.csbruce.com/~csbruce/cbm/transactor/v9/i6/p024.html\">an article</a> in which the author expanded the C64&#39;s 64K of RAM up to a whopping 1,024K of RAM with a combination of bank-switching in software, a modified external memory cartridge, and desoldering and replacing the RAM chips inside the C64 itself.  In my mind, today&#39;s overclocking and funky glowing case-mods pale in comparison to hacks of that caliber.  (Although, the hackers prying secrets out of gaming consoles--like my modded XBox--seem to have the spirit!)</p>\n<p>So anyway, the point of all this nostalgia is this:  I&#39;ve always wanted to be the kind of hacker who did those sorts of clever things and wrote about them for other kids like me to read and try.  </p>\n<p>While I can&#39;t really attest to my own cleverness, I can at least work toward the writing part.  Last Summer, <a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/dnn/\">Morbus Iff</a> hooked me into writing a handful of pieces for <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/spiderhks/\">O&#39;Reilly&#39;s Spidering Hacks</a> and I had a lot of fun with it.  Now that it seems like my brain is working again, I&#39;d like to try writing a bit more in that vein.  Eventually--when I grow up--I&#39;d really, really like to be a PhD-holding Computer Scientist doing research in academia or in some posh corporate lab - but for now, while I get my act together in that regard, I think I&#39;d like to try out being a junior amateur computer scientist and publish here for awhile.</p>\n<p>I know of a few bloggers and <a href=\"http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/WebTechniques/\">columnists</a> (<a href=\"http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/\">here too</a>) who&#39;ve regularly posted nifty little projects on the web, some of whom even get paid to do so and have to face deadlines and editors in the process.  Me, I don&#39;t have an editor and can only set my own deadlines, so I&#39;m curious to see if I can commit to a regular schedule for these mini-projects - say once a month, or even bi-weekly.  But, I&#39;d like to try; it&#39;d be nice to work toward a little more activity around this site than collecting links and the occasional run of babble.  </p>\n<p>Writing in public about these intentions might be the oomph I need to get me started: all five of you out there reading this blog can be my editors!  I plan to work on small- to mid-sized projects, presented in a periodic column format with entries around 2500-5000 words each.  One of my first challenges is to brainstorm a list of topics; I&#39;ve already got a handful of things I could work on, but I might need to troll the <a href=\"http://www.lazyweb.org\">lazyweb</a> to find a few more inspirations.  Also, feel free to comment or ping me with suggestions!  (And, if I don&#39;t seem to be actually getting any new entries out for a period of time, feel free to give me a kick in the pants!)</p>\n<p>In the meantime, stay tuned!  I might just have my first installment coming up in a bit...</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084289\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084289\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-05-25T01:38:02\">2004-05-25T01:38:02</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">This sounds like a great idea, can&#39;t wait to see what you come up with.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221084290&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://admin.support.journurl.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f89d3df08b8dedac1a0fde900a586db&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://admin.support.journurl.com/&quot;&gt;Roger Benningfield&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221084290&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-05-25T01:39:53&quot;&gt;2004-05-25T01:39:53&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;God, how I loved Ahoy!
