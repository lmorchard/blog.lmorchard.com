        <h1 class="title">Just what does one use a Windows PC for anyway?</h1>
        
        <section class="post-content">
          <p>Huh.  Having just read <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001962.html">Jeremy Zawodny&#39;s account</a> of how easy it was for him to move everything over from one PowerBook to another, and wondering if Windows would ever offer that ease, has me wondering why I bothered to re-install WinXP on my aging desktop PC.  Not quite the same thing, but it&#39;s making me appreciate the Windows-free life we&#39;ve been living at home here.</p>
<p>I had been running Debian Linux on the box, and it mostly served as a file server and a workbench for various experiments.  Well, I got the bright idea that I might be able to get most of the same benefits, and get my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/10/homebrew_entertainment_appliances_cheap_open_and_embattled">TV capturing</a> working again, by reverting to WinXP along with an installation of <a href="http://www.colinux.org/">coLinux</a> and / or <a href="http://www.subspacehq.com/">Cygwin</a>.  Oh yeah, and I&#39;d be able to play a few <a href="http://www.subspacehq.com/">old games</a> I&#39;d <a href="http://www.unrealtournament.com/">been missing</a> too!  Also, I keep meaning to play with the .Net framework and Virtual PC on my PowerBook just hasn&#39;t worked out so well.</p>
<p>Well, the first thing I bumped into was that the big drive I was using for file serving was formatted as ext2.  Not really a good option for WinXP.</p>
<p>So, I started playing with <a href="http://www.colinux.org/">coLinux</a> with some interesting results.  Managed to get it up and running with a <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> image, and then I discovered that <a href="http://www.colinux.org/">coLinux</a> could mount the ext2 partition directly from the WinXP device path.  One installation of Samba later, and I was mounting the ext2 partition under Windows.  Unfortunately, I now had this poor machine loaded down with both Windows <em>and</em> Linux at the same time.  NeatLikeDigitalWatches, at least for this underpowered machine.</p>
<p>So, I shut down <a href="http://www.colinux.org/">coLinux</a> and checked out <a href="http://ext2.yeah.net">ext2fsd</a> but couldn&#39;t get write support working.  After that, <a href="http://www.ext2fs-anywhere.com/">Ext2FS Anywhere</a> seems to have done a decent job of bridging the filesystem gap... though now I&#39;m getting all kinds of odd errors and reports of resources running out.  Now, I&#39;m thinking there might be some voodoo conflicts going on here, and early onset of <a href="http://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Database/DLLHell.aspx">DLL Hell</a>.</p>
<p>But, ignoring the waves of voodoo for now, I was jonesing for a Unix fix, so I installed <a href="http://www.subspacehq.com/">Cygwin</a>.  I like <a href="http://www.subspacehq.com/">Cygwin</a>.  But, a little ways into things, trying to get <a href="http://anfaenger.de/cygwin-1.5/mysql/">MySQL</a> working, I&#39;m starting to miss my Debian install and apt-get.  (Gentoo&#39;s emerge isn&#39;t too bad either, though the compiling-from-source thing gets old.)</p>
<p>Bah.  Thinking I might reformat and try out a Gentoo install now.</p>
<p>Now, I realize that I&#39;m trying to do some very un-Windows things with this WinXP install, and I&#39;m doing it on hardware weaker than the XBox I just recently started hacking around with.  But, just what <em>do</em> you do with a machine entirely devoted to Windows, anyway?</p>
<p>And just why can&#39;t I get an <a href="http://www.subspacehq.com/">ancient game</a> working acceptably on my PowerBook under Virtual PC anyway?! </p>

<div class="content">Yes, compiling everything does get old.  When I first started out w/ Gentoo, I thought, "cool, it'll take me maybe a couple of days to build everything, but once I'm done, I'll have a screaming fast system".  It wasn't until months later that I realized that you're never done.  After the third upgrade of X11, I realized that the bigger and more important a package is, the more bugs it contains, and the quicker they are found ("many eyes" and all that), so you end up recompiling X and Mozilla a lot more often than you'd planned.
As for performance, it's the only Linux I've ever installed on my iBook, so I don't have anything to compare it to.  (shrugs)</div>

<div class="content">I'm not sure if I would use Gentoo as a desktop system.  As a server, it's wonderful, but of the three Gentoo servers I've helped setup, it's generally been as bare a system as possible (and as far as Apache goes, did *not* use emerge but downloaded and compiled that separately since the level of customization was rather steep).
But I do have to ask---why did you need to upgrade X?  I have a RedHat 5.2 system I use for my desktop system, and I haven't needed to upgrade X on that since it was installed um ... five years (?!) ago.</div>

<div class="content">Well, never really having a Windows PC in my home (except for the one I found in a dumpster that had WWG 3.11 on it) I really don't know what you would do with it. I mean, even if you just want to do browser testing with various versions of Windows/IE, you are probably better off using Virtual PC if you've already got it.
I suppose you use a Windows PC for things that just won't work on other operating systems. What those things are just aren't very important to me at home, and seem to be on a list that is shrinking as time goes by...</div>

<div class="content">well, this is a weird coincidence
I saw your shoelace links in del.icio.us and followed from there _and I have just finished merging two very old pcs into one, 192Mo and a Pentium MMX at 233Hz on which I installed XP thinking it would not work but it is superfast (and I don't understand why) and now I have also installed remote desktop and it works just fine
so, I have this perfect box which I can control w/o it having a keyboard or mouse or screen
it's out there in the living room and
I don't know what to do with it at all</div>

<div class="content">My desktop computer primarily runs Gentoo Linux, but also has windows XP for those times when Windows can do the job better. The only reasons I ever boot up Windows any more are when I need to code something for work (.NET is the platform we use there) or to play Windows-only games every weekend at a LAN party. With my Athlon64 3000+, the time to compile applications is well within my tolerance level so I feel that Gentoo is well-suited for me. I don't know what I would do if I had to use Windows exclusively again.</div>

</div>
<div class="content">I currently use Windows exclusively becuase Getting Linux+Wireless with a Dell Inspiron is a little more effort than I'm willing to invest (I've figured out all kinds of nify server related things, but getting wireless just seems to be a demon I can't tame)... so... I use Virtual PC for my Linux fix (actually, for GNUCash and some other minor programs that I don't want to buy for Windows). If Valve/Steam ever ported Steam and HL to Linux though... the battle would be on. =)
My server, however, is Gentoo (It's been Gentoo, OpenBSD, and Slackware), but I like Gentoo the best. Just watch out for those upgrades, it's a doozie (etc-update.... killed my server once... Linux sys admin, still isn't for the faint of heart).</div>
