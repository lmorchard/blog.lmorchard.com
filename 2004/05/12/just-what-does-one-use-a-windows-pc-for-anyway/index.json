With my Athlon64 3000+, the time to compile applications is well within my tolerance level so I feel that Gentoo is well-suited for me.

I use Virtual PC for my Linux fix (actually, for GNUCash and some other minor programs that I don't want to buy for Windows). If Valve/Steam ever ported Steam and HL to Linux though... the battle would be on. =)\nMy server, however, is Gentoo (It's been Gentoo, OpenBSD, and Slackware), but I like Gentoo the best.

The only reasons I ever boot up Windows any more are when I need to code something for work (.NET is the platform we use there) or to play Windows-only games every weekend at a LAN party. With my Athlon64 3000+, the time to compile applications is well within my tolerance level so I feel that Gentoo is well-suited for me.

I use Virtual PC for my Linux fix (actually, for GNUCash and some other minor programs that I don't want to buy for Windows). If Valve/Steam ever ported Steam and HL to Linux though... the battle would be on. =)\r\nMy server, however, is Gentoo (It's been Gentoo, OpenBSD, and Slackware), but I like Gentoo the best. Just watch out for those upgrades, it's a doozie (etc-update.... killed my server once...
