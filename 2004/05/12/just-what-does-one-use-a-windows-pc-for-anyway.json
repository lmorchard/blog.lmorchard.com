Having just read <a href=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001962.html\">Jeremy Zawodny&#39;s account</a> of how easy it was for him to move everything over from one PowerBook to another, and wondering if Windows would ever offer that ease, has me wondering why I bothered to re-install WinXP on my aging desktop PC.  Not quite the same thing, but it&#39;s making me appreciate the Windows-free life we&#39;ve been living at home here.</p>\n<p>I had been running Debian Linux on the box, and it mostly served as a file server and a workbench for various experiments.  Well, I got the bright idea that I might be able to get most of the same benefits, and get my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/10/homebrew_entertainment_appliances_cheap_open_and_embattled\">TV capturing</a> working again, by reverting to WinXP along with an installation of <a href=\"http://www.colinux.org/\">coLinux</a> and / or <a href=\"http://www.subspacehq.com/\">Cygwin</a>.  Oh yeah, and I&#39;d be able to play a few <a href=\"http://www.subspacehq.com/\">old games</a> I&#39;d <a href=\"http://www.unrealtournament.com/\">been missing</a> too!  Also, I keep meaning to play with the .Net framework and Virtual PC on my PowerBook just hasn&#39;t worked out so well.</p>\n<p>Well, the first thing I bumped into was that the big drive I was using for file serving was formatted as ext2.  Not really a good option for WinXP.</p>\n<p>So, I started playing with <a href=\"http://www.colinux.org/\">coLinux</a> with some interesting results.  Managed to get it up and running with a <a href=\"http://www.gentoo.org/\">Gentoo Linux</a> image, and then I discovered that <a href=\"http://www.colinux.org/\">coLinux</a> could mount the ext2 partition directly from the WinXP device path.  One installation of Samba later, and I was mounting the ext2 partition under Windows.  Unfortunately, I now had this poor machine loaded down with both Windows <em>and</em> Linux at the same time.  NeatLikeDigitalWatches, at least for this underpowered machine.</p>\n<p>So, I shut down <a href=\"http://www.colinux.org/\">coLinux</a> and checked out <a href=\"http://ext2.yeah.net\">ext2fsd</a> but couldn&#39;t get write support working.  After that, <a href=\"http://www.ext2fs-anywhere.com/\">Ext2FS Anywhere</a> seems to have done a decent job of bridging the filesystem gap... though now I&#39;m getting all kinds of odd errors and reports of resources running out.  Now, I&#39;m thinking there might be some voodoo conflicts going on here, and early onset of <a href=\"http://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Database/DLLHell.aspx\">DLL Hell</a>.</p>\n<p>But, ignoring the waves of voodoo for now, I was jonesing for a Unix fix, so I installed <a href=\"http://www.subspacehq.com/\">Cygwin</a>.  I like <a href=\"http://www.subspacehq.com/\">Cygwin</a>.  But, a little ways into things, trying to get <a href=\"http://anfaenger.de/cygwin-1.5/mysql/\">MySQL</a> working, I&#39;m starting to miss my Debian install and apt-get.  (Gentoo&#39;s emerge isn&#39;t too bad either, though the compiling-from-source thing gets old.)</p>\n<p>Bah.  Thinking I might reformat and try out a Gentoo install now.</p>\n<p>Now, I realize that I&#39;m trying to do some very un-Windows things with this WinXP install, and I&#39;m doing it on hardware weaker than the XBox I just recently started hacking around with.  But, just what <em>do</em> you do with a machine entirely devoted to Windows, anyway?</p>\n<p>And just why can&#39;t I get an <a href=\"http://www.subspacehq.com/\">ancient game</a> working acceptably on my PowerBook under Virtual PC anyway?! </p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088030\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.geocities.com/rschmertz/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=368fade064c39e0034b5dc07782acc41&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.geocities.com/rschmertz/\">Bob S</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088030\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-05-12T10:16:08\">2004-05-12T10:16:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">Yes, compiling everything does get old.  When I first started out w/ Gentoo, I thought, &quot;cool, it&#39;ll take me maybe a couple of days to build everything, but once I&#39;m done, I&#39;ll have a screaming fast system&quot;.  It wasn&#39;t until months later that I realized that you&#39;re never done.  After the third upgrade of X11, I realized that the bigger and more important a package is, the more bugs it contains, and the quicker they are found (&quot;many eyes&quot; and all that), so you end up recompiling X and Mozilla a lot more often than you&#39;d planned.\n\nAs for performance, it&#39;s the only Linux I&#39;ve ever installed on my iBook, so I don&#39;t have anything to compare it to.

I have a RedHat 5.2 system I use for my desktop system, and I haven&#39;t needed to upgrade X on that since it was installed um ... five years (?!) ago.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221088040&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.skipjack.info&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8f3e01fca940ba7827cd0ff419a789f3&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://www.skipjack.info&quot;&gt;Matthew&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221088040&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-05-15T14:39:26&quot;&gt;2004-05-15T14:39:26&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;I use my windows box just for games.
