I&apos;ve gone through phases of wanting this place to be a <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/25/i_was_a_preteen_transactor_author_wannabe_and_still_am\">bit of a techie zine</a>, I&apos;ve <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/07/14/dork_funk\">been in a funk</a>, and lately I&apos;ve been telling myself that I should <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/29/blogging_without_thought\"><em>blog like no one&apos;s watching</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Funny thing is, between those thoughts and my recent activity on a project, I&apos;ve been posting quite a bit more than I have in a long time.  If I were to critique recent posts, I&apos;d beat myself up for being either far too nerdy and obscure, or being inane.  Yet, oddly enough, I&apos;d gotten comments and emails that demonstrate obvious interest.</p>\n<p>But, it&apos;s not a thing to manipulate like search engine listings.  When I&apos;ve <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/06/16/wishofthemonthclub1\">written something</a> that I expected to get a lot of comments, it didn&apos;t at first.  When I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/15/manipulating_aggregate_resources_in_a_rest_api\">posted something</a> that I expected to float by without much comment, it got eight right away.  I suppose one could carefully monitor and analyze trendy topics in blogs and try to post only things with high buzz factor, but the best thing is just to write like no one&apos;s watching and be pleasantly surprised when you <em>do</em> get attention.</p>\n<p>The way I perceive this whole blogosphere working, long term, is for bloggers to read some Joseph Campbell and <a href=\"http://www.jcf.org/bliss.php\"><strong>&#x201C;Follow Your Bliss&#x201D;</strong></a>.  You could serve the whims of &#x201C;traffic&#x201D; for awhile, but if it&apos;s not following your bliss, you&apos;ll get tired of keeping up.  But if you hook into your bliss, there&apos;s bound to be traffic-a-plenty coming just to watch you do your own funky breakdance on that piece of cardboard you threw down on your domain name.</p>\n<p>Maybe I&apos;m a bit too optimistic about <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/\">noospheric homesteading</a>, but I expect that the pressures of this space will eventually leave only two kinds of bloggers: the ones who get paid enough, and the ones who have to be here because their bliss won&apos;t let them do anything else.</p>\n<p>(And I expect the economics to slant in favor of bliss.)</p>\n"

I look at nifty services like del.icio.us, BlogLines, and Flickr, and think, &#8220;Hey, I have some good ideas, too.  I <em>could</em> possibly put together something like this.  But how the <strong>!@#$%</strong> do those guys pay their hosting bills?  Let alone make a living?&#8221;  </p>\n<p>I know the answer to this in some cases is that the costs are paid out-of-pocket, and the people behind the sites have day jobs that pay well enough.  And sometimes the goodwill and respect earned by such endeavors pays off indirectly.  In other cases, I&#39;ve heard that some venture capital is involved.  So that at least informs me as to where short-term means of support come from.</p>\n<p>In any case, when I know that I haven&#39;t paid a dime for my usage of any of these services-- and I imagine that anything I might do would be targeted toward someone like me (though that&#39;s probably part of my problem)-- I have no clue what kind of business model they&#39;re following.  </p>\n<p>What, advertising?  I know I personally provide a dismal click-through rate, unless the ads are tuned just so and with the right shiny bits.  But then, I consider that if I were to plaster credit card logos and PayPal buttons right up front, I&#39;d turn away users in droves.  (Then again, I do appear to shell out at least $50 per month in internet services beyond my bandwidth bill.)</p>\n<p>But, see, I haven&#39;t a clue about business.  I just like to cultivate nifty ideas, and I keep thinking that at least <em>one</em> of them could be the right thing at the right time and in the right place to work out for me.  And I have to assume that the people who <strong>have</strong> done something, and <strong>keep</strong> doing something, where I haven&#39;t done <strong>anything</strong> know something I don&#39;t.</p>\n<p>Then again, I thought I&#39;d figured out what was going on during the dot-com boom, and I assumed all those people projectile vomiting money everywhere knew what they were doing too.  (Even though they all seemed <strong>insane</strong>.)</p>\n<p>So all I&#39;m left with is that I <em>think</em> I have the occasional good idea, but with no way of know how to run with it.  And all these internet entrepreneurs apparently bootstrapping out into open space don&#39;t make sense to me either.</p>\n<p>Anyway...  It all seems like magic to me.

    "body": "<blockquote>Russell's Unproven Yet Seemingly Obvious Number One Rule For Web Based Services: Don't launch without a way of making money.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><small>Source: <cite><a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008040.html\">Where's the Biz?</a></cite></small></div>\r\n\r\nThis dovetails in nicely with my thinking about hosting, and with FeedReactor.  I look at nifty services like del.icio.us, BlogLines, and Flickr, and think, &#8220;Hey, I have some good ideas, too.  I *could* possibly put together something like this.  But how the **!@#$%** do those guys pay their hosting bills?  Let alone make a living?&#8221;  \r\n\r\nI know the answer to this in some cases is that the costs are paid out-of-pocket, and the people behind the sites have day jobs that pay well enough.  And sometimes the goodwill and respect earned by such endeavors pays off indirectly.  In other cases, I've heard that some venture capital is involved.  So that at least informs me as to where short-term means of support come from.\r\n\r\nIn any case, when I know that I haven't paid a dime for my usage of any of these services-- and I imagine that anything I might do would be targeted toward someone like me (though that's probably part of my problem)-- I have no clue what kind of business model they're following.  \r\n\r\nWhat, advertising?  I know I personally provide a dismal click-through rate, unless the ads are tuned just so and with the right shiny bits.  But then, I consider that if I were to plaster credit card logos and PayPal buttons right up front, I'd turn away users in droves.  (Then again, I do appear to shell out at least $50 per month in internet services beyond my bandwidth bill.)\r\n\r\nBut, see, I haven't a clue about business.  I just like to cultivate nifty ideas, and I keep thinking that at least *one* of them could be the right thing at the right time and in the right place to work out for me.  And I have to assume that the people who **have** done something, and **keep** doing something, where I haven't done **anything** know something I don't.\r\n\r\nThen again, I thought I'd figured out what was going on during the dot-com boom, and I assumed all those people projectile vomiting money everywhere knew what they were doing too.  (Even though they all seemed **insane**.)\r\n\r\nSo all I'm left with is that I *think* I have the occasional good idea, but with no way of know how to run with it.  And all these internet entrepreneurs apparently bootstrapping out into open space don't make sense to me either.\r\n\r\nAnyway...  It all seems like magic to me.  Maybe one day I'll figure it out.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086985\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://taint.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8d1615d9a1f4ba77b7827a3320abe27a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://taint.org/\">Justin</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086985\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-20T19:26:30\">2004-09-20T19:26:30</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I generally find that I just hack projects without thinking it through, so it could just be a lack of forethought. ;)\r\n\r\nmind you, I haven't put up a Flickr, a del.icio.us, or similar -- but IIRC the HotOrNot guys had pretty much that style at the start, and had to retrofit a way to get paid on, afterwards.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086987\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086987\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-21T12:14:28\">2004-09-21T12:14:28</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">\"But, see, I haven’t a clue about business.

I've got four boxees with them right now, and have nothing but good stories to tell. They seem to do everything right, for a really good price.  As Roger points out, they're definitely very customer focused, to the point they have a one-ring SLA on their NOC phone.  One ring on an 800 number, and you're not only talking to a warm person, but a warm person with a clue.\nI've worked on a lot of ev1 servers, and have many, many horror stories to tell.  I've had to walk noc technicians through using ping, had newly commissioned boxes comprimised before I could even login (I logged in within 12 hours of the box being setup).  And I've heard really, really frightening stories of major security issues (like using one of the four major IM networks to shuttle customer box root passwords around).  They have good prices, and generally don't screw up too bad if nothing goes wrong with your box, but that's about it...</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084275\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cb564795a1912c36f9fa1399fd22ce29&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/\">Bryce</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084275\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-22T09:21:05\">2004-09-22T09:21:05</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Thought I'd toss a few more things out at you:\n0) Stock Apache installations are usually not tuned for low memory utilization. Try lowering all of the following settings: MinSpareServers, MaxSpareServers, StartServers, MaxClients, MaxRequestsPerChild. And get rid of any modules that you aren't using.\n1) Most VPS / VDS / UML hosting companies will tell you upfront what your RAM limit will be and offer a number of service levels.\n2) Consider going back to a BSD account. Typically they do not have fixed RAM allocations because they are not true virtual machines. I know for a fact that the iServer / Verio (ex-employer) VPS platform uses soft limits but their offerings cost more than many dedicated products. You already know that JohnCompanies has a BSD product, and I've heard good things about JVDS.\n3) 1&1 offers managed dedicated servers without root access for $59-$109. If you're trying not to be a SysAdmin that may be a good option.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084276\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jm3.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4a0577bc70bd8b9b1b2b2b20820ee4f9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jm3.net\">jm3</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084276\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-23T11:13:22\">2004-09-23T11:13:22</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">i've always had good service with pair.com, but i'm not sure about their dedicated server programs. only used their shared services. they impress me, tho.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
    "body": "Now that I've just moved over to this JohnCompanies hosting, I'm realizing several things:\r\n\r\n* Virtual dedicated hosting on a shared box is not nearly the same as having your own box.\r\n* While I mostly know what I'm doing, I do have a bit to learn about tweaking a linux server.\r\n* I don't know a good deal in hosting when I see it.\r\n\r\nMainly, I think it's that whatever I'm doing with FeedReactor is intermittently killing this box.  But I suspect it's worse than that, though this surprises me since when last I used JohnCompanies, I was used to rock solid service-- so I have to assume the instability is my fault.  (I keep hitting memory limits that result in random failures and malloc denials.)\r\n\r\nI've had several generous offers to host my experiments and I, but eventually, I think I should just rent my own dedicated hardware somewhere.  Anyone have some good advice on where and how much?\r\n\r\nSo far I'm looking at:\r\n\r\n* <http://www.ev1servers.net/> (Thanks to [Imajes](http://imajes.info/))\r\n* <http://www.serverbeach.com/>\r\n\r\nMaybe someday soon I'll come up with something that would justify and fund decent hosting.  In the meantime, I'm hoping for something around US$100 or less that doesn't die all the time.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084260\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.acetylene.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a91cc3f530193ccc9b218cd27bb04fcf&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.acetylene.net/\">Nicholas Dunham</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084260\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-20T16:25:07\">2004-09-20T16:25:07</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I've been using ev1 for a couple of years now.

I've got four boxees with them right now, and have nothing but good stories to tell. They seem to do everything right, for a really good price.  As Roger points out, they're definitely very customer focused, to the point they have a one-ring SLA on their NOC phone.  One ring on an 800 number, and you're not only talking to a warm person, but a warm person with a clue.\r\n\r\nI've worked on a lot of ev1 servers, and have many, many horror stories to tell.  I've had to walk noc technicians through using ping, had newly commissioned boxes comprimised before I could even login (I logged in within 12 hours of the box being setup).  And I've heard really, really frightening stories of major security issues (like using one of the four major IM networks to shuttle customer box root passwords around).  They have good prices, and generally don't screw up too bad if nothing goes wrong with your box, but that's about it...</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084275\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cb564795a1912c36f9fa1399fd22ce29&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/\">Bryce</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084275\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-22T09:21:05\">2004-09-22T09:21:05</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Thought I'd toss a few more things out at you:\r\n\r\n0) Stock Apache installations are usually not tuned for low memory utilization. Try lowering all of the following settings: MinSpareServers, MaxSpareServers, StartServers, MaxClients, MaxRequestsPerChild. And get rid of any modules that you aren't using.\r\n\r\n1) Most VPS / VDS / UML hosting companies will tell you upfront what your RAM limit will be and offer a number of service levels.\r\n\r\n2) Consider going back to a BSD account. Typically they do not have fixed RAM allocations because they are not true virtual machines. I know for a fact that the iServer / Verio (ex-employer) VPS platform uses soft limits but their offerings cost more than many dedicated products. You already know that JohnCompanies has a BSD product, and I've heard good things about JVDS.\r\n\r\n3) 1&1 offers managed dedicated servers without root access for $59-$109. If you're trying not to be a SysAdmin that may be a good option.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084276\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://jm3.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4a0577bc70bd8b9b1b2b2b20820ee4f9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://jm3.net\">jm3</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084276\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-23T11:13:22\">2004-09-23T11:13:22</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">i've always had good service with pair.com, but i'm not sure about their dedicated server programs. only used their shared services. they impress me, tho.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

After making sure things seemed reasonably stable post-server-move, I migrated my CVS repository here to <a href=\"http://subversion.tigris.org/\">Subversion</a>.  There were one or two tiny bumps in the road-- such as a default setting in Apache to deny access to anything starting with .ht (ie. .htaccess)-- but so far, so good.  <a href=\"http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/\">ViewCVS</a> appears to support Subversion, and I&#39;ve also discovered an alternate frontend called <a href=\"http://websvn.tigris.org/\">WebSVN</a>.  I like ViewCVS better, but WebSVN offers RSS feeds on commits.</p>\n<p>One consequence to this move is that soon, when I take down everything related to CVS, I&#39;ll have plenty of broken links (since I frequently link to ViewCVS pages for my projects).  So, I think my next step will be to set up some redirects to a reasonable number of things for continuity&#39;s sake.</p>\n<p>So, anyway... if you&#39;ve been keeping up with <code>dbagg3</code>, the action&#39;s not in CVS anymore.

    "body": "So, I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.  After making sure things seemed reasonably stable post-server-move, I migrated my CVS repository here to [Subversion][subversion].  There were one or two tiny bumps in the road-- such as a default setting in Apache to deny access to anything starting with .ht (ie. .htaccess)-- but so far, so good.  [ViewCVS][viewcvs] appears to support Subversion, and I've also discovered an alternate frontend called [WebSVN][websvn].  I like ViewCVS better, but WebSVN offers RSS feeds on commits.\r\n\r\nOne consequence to this move is that soon, when I take down everything related to CVS, I'll have plenty of broken links (since I frequently link to ViewCVS pages for my projects).  So, I think my next step will be to set up some redirects to a reasonable number of things for continuity's sake.\r\n\r\nSo, anyway... if you've been keeping up with `dbagg3`, the action's not in CVS anymore.

The major resources involved include <strong>subscriptions</strong> and <strong>entries</strong>.  Quite often, while working on the UI, I find a need to manipulate ranges and collections of these resources-- things like: &#8220;mark these 12 entries as read&#8221; and &#8220;give me an aggregate of the new entries for these 6 subscriptions&#8221;.</p>\n<p>So, I have been using URLs like the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>POST /subscriptions/523/entries/12322,12326,12325,12388,12412/notes/</code></li>\n<li><code>GET /subscriptions/312,443,523/now-12.xml</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Doing things this way is terribly convenient with regard to stuffing many things into one HTTP request.  Problem is, with respect to REST, these URLs no longer refer to individual resources--  they&#39;re aggregate references.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this apparent break with the REST philosophy, and was reminded of it after skimming through <a href=\"http://www.markbaker.ca/Talks/2004-xmlself/all.htm\">Mark Baker&#39;s notes on a talk</a> today.  </p>\n<p>So... am I missing a more elegant RESTful way of doing this which doesn&#39;t result in a quadrillion HTTP requests?</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090514\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://trevor.smith.name/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e873edb1d1943ea7087468439ce64d37&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://trevor.smith.name/\">Trevor F.

The thing that worries me is that now you're generating state on the server (a new \"aggregate resource\" with its own identifier), and it's not clear that it's needed. How long does the server have to keep the list around? Could other clients access it if they guessed the ID?\nIt's the PUT request that causes the problems. It's a high price to pay for a modest improvement in the GET request.\nOn second thought, I don't see much wrong with the original. URLs can be algorithmic, and this one just happens to refer to a list of things. The thing that throws it into a different mental category for me is probably the combinatorial explosion. But does it really matter that now, for practical purposes, the REST service could no longer be fully indexed by search engines?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090519\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090519\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-15T19:57:21\">2004-09-15T19:57:21</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I've wondered about this in the context of an application I'm designing that allows wildcard queries (e.g. /id/1*/details.html) as part of the URL path.  To me, it seems OK to do that, from REST's \"document-centric\" viewpoint, since it seems reasonable that I could actually have an actual document with that path.  Your original GET request seems like the same thing to me.\nI could be completely wrong though--I'd be the first to admit that I still find REST a bit difficult to pin down.

I can't remember what they look like, but it's really nothing more than several HTTP requests packaged in XML.  They use it for doing atomic operations on several files/resources.  It's kind of REST, kind of anti-REST.\nOtherwise, of course, the query string is reasonably unordered and allows multiple pieces of data, i.e., /subscriptions/now-12.xml?id=1&id=2&id=3\nAnother option is to somehow define sets.  E.g., something like POST /createset (request body contains the IDs) and then the server responds with an identifier for that set, and then you work with that identifier.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090522\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0d0148e03ff9f1639cab8b35bf625db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Ken Meltsner</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090522\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-16T15:31:28\">2004-09-16T15:31:28</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">You could have the system return an existing identifier as the response to sending it a set of identifiers, if that set has already been defined.\nThat is, treat the GET as more of a \"return existing or create a new one\" operation.

    "body": "Here's a tiny bit of a REST-ian quandary:  I'm working through this API for `dbagg3`.  The major resources involved include **subscriptions** and **entries**.  Quite often, while working on the UI, I find a need to manipulate ranges and collections of these resources-- things like: &#8220;mark these 12 entries as read&#8221; and &#8220;give me an aggregate of the new entries for these 6 subscriptions&#8221;.\r\n\r\nSo, I have been using URLs like the following:\r\n\r\n* `POST /subscriptions/523/entries/12322,12326,12325,12388,12412/notes/`\r\n* `GET /subscriptions/312,443,523/now-12.xml`\r\n\r\nDoing things this way is terribly convenient with regard to stuffing many things into one HTTP request.  Problem is, with respect to REST, these URLs no longer refer to individual resources--  they're aggregate references.\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about this apparent break with the REST philosophy, and was reminded of it after skimming through [Mark Baker's notes on a talk][mbakerrest] today.  \r\n\r\nSo... am I missing a more elegant RESTful way of doing this which doesn't result in a quadrillion HTTP requests?\r\n\r\n[mbakerrest]: http://www.markbaker.ca/Talks/2004-xmlself/all.htm\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090514\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://trevor.smith.name/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e873edb1d1943ea7087468439ce64d37&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://trevor.smith.name/\">Trevor F.

The thing that worries me is that now you're generating state on the server (a new \"aggregate resource\" with its own identifier), and it's not clear that it's needed. How long does the server have to keep the list around? Could other clients access it if they guessed the ID?\r\n\r\nIt's the PUT request that causes the problems. It's a high price to pay for a modest improvement in the GET request.\r\n\r\nOn second thought, I don't see much wrong with the original. URLs can be algorithmic, and this one just happens to refer to a list of things. The thing that throws it into a different mental category for me is probably the combinatorial explosion. But does it really matter that now, for practical purposes, the REST service could no longer be fully indexed by search engines?</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090519\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090519\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-15T19:57:21\">2004-09-15T19:57:21</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I've wondered about this in the context of an application I'm designing that allows wildcard queries (e.g. /id/1*/details.html) as part of the URL path.  To me, it seems OK to do that, from REST's \"document-centric\" viewpoint, since it seems reasonable that I could actually have an actual document with that path.  Your original GET request seems like the same thing to me.\r\n\r\nI could be completely wrong though--I'd be the first to admit that I still find REST a bit difficult to pin down.  It seems like it's a lot like the old saw about pornography: I can't define it, but I know it when I see it :-).</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090520\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090520\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-15T20:55:05\">2004-09-15T20:55:05</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Upon further reading: isn't Jeremy's method wrong per Paul Prescod's \"Common REST Mistakes\" (http://www.prescod.net/rest/mistakes/)?  In particular:\r\n\r\n\"Do not invent proprietary object  identifiers.\"\r\n\r\nAnd...\r\n\r\n\"If you use URI syntax with UUIDs or something like that then you  get half of the benefit of URIs.

I can't remember what they look like, but it's really nothing more than several HTTP requests packaged in XML.  They use it for doing atomic operations on several files/resources.  It's kind of REST, kind of anti-REST.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, of course, the query string is reasonably unordered and allows multiple pieces of data, i.e., /subscriptions/now-12.xml?id=1&id=2&id=3\r\n\r\nAnother option is to somehow define sets.  E.g., something like POST /createset (request body contains the IDs) and then the server responds with an identifier for that set, and then you work with that identifier.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090522\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0d0148e03ff9f1639cab8b35bf625db&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"\">Ken Meltsner</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090522\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-16T15:31:28\">2004-09-16T15:31:28</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">You could have the system return an existing identifier as the response to sending it a set of identifiers, if that set has already been defined.\r\n\r\nThat is, treat the GET as more of a \"return existing or create a new one\" operation.

But I just have to get this out: I&#39;m easily excited by shiny code and gadgets, but it&#39;s so much easier to get excited when I can see something in working condition before taking a screwdriver to it.  So... remember <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/30/dbagg3_makingprogress\">when I mentioned all those URLs</a>?  They&#39;re working out nicely.</p>\n<p>First, check out a simple two-pane view of news items, ala <a href=\"http://www.bloglines.com/\">Bloglines</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml?xsl=xsl/two-pane/index.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml?xsl=xsl/two-pane/index.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taking this apart, you can see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A user account: <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml</a></li>\n<li>Some XSL: <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/xsl/two-pane/index.xsl\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/xsl/two-pane/index.xsl</a></li>\n<li>... and a specified content type (text/html)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your curiosity is piqued by this, view source and pay attention to link URLs.  It&#39;s more of the same:  XML produced by a REST API, passed through XSL, delivered as HTML.</p>\n<p>Here, take a look at another view on this demo user&#39;s aggregated items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/outliner/index.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/outliner/index.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, this only seems to be working decently with Firefox and Safari.  MSIE seems to be balking at the dynamic stuff, though I&#39;ve had it working there in a previous incarnation of this code.  So hopefully this will be fixed soon.</p>\n<p>At any rate, what you should see is a single-pane outliner-style display of feed entries.  This is the style of aggregator UI I&#39;ve been using for almost 3 years now.  Disclosure triangles open entries up to show summaries and further content.  &#8220;[seen]&#8221; links hide the entries, while &#8220;[queue]&#8221; hides an entry while tossing it into a queue for viewing later.</p>\n<p>Speaking of that, you can see what&#39;s in the queue right now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;show_queued=1\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;show_queued=1</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a display of queued entries, with another stylesheet applied that shows everything in a flat and open blog-like template.  It&#39;s not reverse-chronological, but that&#39;s not hard to accomplish with a flag or a tweak to an &lt;xsl:sort&gt; tag.  </p>\n<p>So that&#39;s just the start of things.  Remember <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/23/slicing_and_dicing_to_make_atom_soup_in_dbagg3\">when I was rambling on about XML storage and query</a>?  A URL like this is one product of that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),'OS%20X')]\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),&#39;OS%20X&#39;)]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This should show you a flat listing of all entries whose titles contain &#8220;OS X&#8221;.  This is far from perfect, but it&#39;s very exciting to me-- it&#39;s got a lot of promise, stuff that first caught my eye when I saw <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/04/15/semanticblog.html\">Jon Udell playing</a> <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/06/10/xpathsearch.html?page=1\">awhile back</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, something that you might not notice until doing a bit more digging, is that all these attributes like &#8220;seen&#8221; and &#8220;query&#8221; are annotations made by the user on entries.  If you take a peek at <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/js/agg.js\">some of the Javascript</a> under the hood, you might notice some XmlHTTPRequest code going on.  To mark something as &#8220;seen&#8221; or &#8220;queued&#8221;, I POST XML to a URL like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The upshot of this is that these attributes are not limited to &#8220;seen&#8221; or &#8220;queued&#8221; flags-- in fact, these annotations can (well, in theory) be any pairing of arbitrary XML and a name.  This annotation then gets injected into the entry, when viewed by the user who owns the annotation, like so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In fact, you could invent a new annotation called &#39;tags&#39; and filter for entries with this annotation with a URL like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;entry%5C_notes%5C_xpath=//dbagg3:note%5B@name=&#39;tags&#39;\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&#38;content-type=text/html&#38;entry\\_notes\\_xpath=//dbagg3:note[@name=&#39;tags&#39;</a> and contains(text(),&#39;#food#&#39;) and contains(text(),&#39;#odd#&#39;)]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eventually, what I&#39;d <em>really</em> like to see this start doing is something akin to del.icio.us-style tagging while you&#39;re reading.  Then, you can have public queries that pull feeds based on your (and others&#39;) tags and spit things back out as feeds again with the proper XSL stylings.</p>\n<p>So at this point, it&#39;s all URLs and barely working HTML, but it&#39;s exciting to me at least.  And it&#39;s dogfood for me, since I&#39;m using this crud to get my daily (hourly?) fix.  Pretty soon, I&#39;ll be diving into wrapping more of a proper usable web app around this, with user management and stuff that works in MSIE.  Until then, maybe someone else will see this and catch a buzz from it.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=dbagg3alive</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090566\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e1cc8e7103bb0f77a7d7abf91b1a961b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Christopher</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090566\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-14T09:40:02\">2004-09-14T09:40:02</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Very cool!

Remember <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/23/slicing_and_dicing_to_make_atom_soup_in_dbagg3\">when I was rambling on about XML storage and query</a>?  A URL like this is one product of that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),&apos;OS%20X&apos;)]\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),&apos;OS%20X&apos;)]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This should show you a flat listing of all entries whose titles contain &#x201C;OS X&#x201D;.  This is far from perfect, but it&apos;s very exciting to me-- it&apos;s got a lot of promise, stuff that first caught my eye when I saw <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/04/15/semanticblog.html\">Jon Udell playing</a> <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/06/10/xpathsearch.html?page=1\">awhile back</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, something that you might not notice until doing a bit more digging, is that all these attributes like &#x201C;seen&#x201D; and &#x201C;query&#x201D; are annotations made by the user on entries.  If you take a peek at <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/js/agg.js\">some of the Javascript</a> under the hood, you might notice some XmlHTTPRequest code going on.  To mark something as &#x201C;seen&#x201D; or &#x201C;queued&#x201D;, I POST XML to a URL like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The upshot of this is that these attributes are not limited to &#x201C;seen&#x201D; or &#x201C;queued&#x201D; flags-- in fact, these annotations can (well, in theory) be any pairing of arbitrary XML and a name.  This annotation then gets injected into the entry, when viewed by the user who owns the annotation, like so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In fact, you could invent a new annotation called &apos;tags&apos; and filter for entries with this annotation with a URL like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry%5C_notes%5C_xpath=//dbagg3:note%5B@name=&apos;tags&apos;\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry\\_notes\\_xpath=//dbagg3:note[@name=&apos;tags&apos;</a> and contains(text(),&apos;#food#&apos;) and contains(text(),&apos;#odd#&apos;)]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eventually, what I&apos;d <em>really</em> like to see this start doing is something akin to del.icio.us-style tagging while you&apos;re reading.  Then, you can have public queries that pull feeds based on your (and others&apos;) tags and spit things back out as feeds again with the proper XSL stylings.</p>\n<p>So at this point, it&apos;s all URLs and barely working HTML, but it&apos;s exciting to me at least.  And it&apos;s dogfood for me, since I&apos;m using this crud to get my daily (hourly?) fix.  Pretty soon, I&apos;ll be diving into wrapping more of a proper usable web app around this, with user management and stuff that works in MSIE.  Until then, maybe someone else will see this and catch a buzz from it.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>\n"
