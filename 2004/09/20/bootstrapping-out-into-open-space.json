I look at nifty services like del.icio.us, BlogLines, and Flickr, and think, &#8220;Hey, I have some good ideas, too.  I <em>could</em> possibly put together something like this.  But how the <strong>!@#$%</strong> do those guys pay their hosting bills?  Let alone make a living?&#8221;  </p>\n<p>I know the answer to this in some cases is that the costs are paid out-of-pocket, and the people behind the sites have day jobs that pay well enough.  And sometimes the goodwill and respect earned by such endeavors pays off indirectly.  In other cases, I&#39;ve heard that some venture capital is involved.  So that at least informs me as to where short-term means of support come from.</p>\n<p>In any case, when I know that I haven&#39;t paid a dime for my usage of any of these services-- and I imagine that anything I might do would be targeted toward someone like me (though that&#39;s probably part of my problem)-- I have no clue what kind of business model they&#39;re following.  </p>\n<p>What, advertising?  I know I personally provide a dismal click-through rate, unless the ads are tuned just so and with the right shiny bits.  But then, I consider that if I were to plaster credit card logos and PayPal buttons right up front, I&#39;d turn away users in droves.  (Then again, I do appear to shell out at least $50 per month in internet services beyond my bandwidth bill.)</p>\n<p>But, see, I haven&#39;t a clue about business.  I just like to cultivate nifty ideas, and I keep thinking that at least <em>one</em> of them could be the right thing at the right time and in the right place to work out for me.  And I have to assume that the people who <strong>have</strong> done something, and <strong>keep</strong> doing something, where I haven&#39;t done <strong>anything</strong> know something I don&#39;t.</p>\n<p>Then again, I thought I&#39;d figured out what was going on during the dot-com boom, and I assumed all those people projectile vomiting money everywhere knew what they were doing too.  (Even though they all seemed <strong>insane</strong>.)</p>\n<p>So all I&#39;m left with is that I <em>think</em> I have the occasional good idea, but with no way of know how to run with it.  And all these internet entrepreneurs apparently bootstrapping out into open space don&#39;t make sense to me either.</p>\n<p>Anyway...  It all seems like magic to me.  Maybe one day I&#39;ll figure it out.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086985\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://taint.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=8d1615d9a1f4ba77b7827a3320abe27a&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://taint.org/\">Justin</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086985\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-20T19:26:30\">2004-09-20T19:26:30</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">I generally find that I just hack projects without thinking it through, so it could just be a lack of forethought. ;)\n\nmind you, I haven&#39;t put up a Flickr, a del.icio.us, or similar -- but IIRC the HotOrNot guys had pretty much that style at the start, and had to retrofit a way to get paid on, afterwards.</div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221086987&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://rasterweb.net/raster/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://rasterweb.net/raster/&quot;&gt;Pete Prodoehl&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221086987&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-09-21T12:14:28&quot;&gt;2004-09-21T12:14:28&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&quot;But, see, I haven’t a clue about business.

I do tend to think, whether correctly or not, that some of the things I want to do with FeedReactor will be solutions to some interesting problems..  but that depends upon a) whether I&#39;m not just full of it, and b) whether I&#39;ll have the time to take it where it needs to go.</p>\n<p>(Strangely enough, I love discovering when I&#39;m full of it.)</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221086991&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://laughingmeme.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=858042a97c035a51ca2097eac37422b4&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://laughingmeme.org&quot;&gt;kellan&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221086991&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-09-22T23:24:24&quot;&gt;2004-09-22T23:24:24&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;It doesn&#39;t help you figure out a concrete business model, but one piece of the puzzle is its gotten a *lot* cheaper lately to build a web start up.\n</code></pre><p>The hardware is cheaper, the software is cheaper, the bandwidth is cheaper, and the tools are better.  </p>\n<p>But even more important we saw some of the largest banks in the world pour a not inconsiderable portion of their wealth for a few years into creating an educated class of both developers and users.  Having participated in several dotcoms I can look back and point to the VCs for creating a huge number of the challenges we faced.  But they also gave me a hell of a financial aid package for the best possible education in web development a person could hope for.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221086992&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://rasterweb.net/raster/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://rasterweb.net/raster/&quot;&gt;Pete Prodoehl&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221086992&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-09-23T14:46:01&quot;&gt;2004-09-23T14:46:01&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Casrter sez: &quot;The odds are that FeedReactor won’t be a viable business…&quot;\n</code></pre><p>Ah, but what if FeedReactor were available to the Enterprise, internally managed, in a private and secure way?

If there&#39;s a component that&#39;s good, the bigger company may buy, license, or hire.</div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
