You have a business when you make something that someone else wants. Bloglines makes something that lots of people want -- there's probably some way to make money from it, whether it's through advertising or selling some add-on service.\nFeed processors aren't for ordinary people, they are something that services like Bloglines want, or corporate IT groups want. \nThere are two ways to make money in this second category.\n1) Get a business partner, and develop something that can be sold to software and services companies.\n2) Develop a superb open source toolkit, and make money from customizing it. \nThe fact that feed processors will eventually be a part of Bloglines etc. is a plus, because organizations make build-buy decisions. If there's a component that's good, the bigger company may buy, license, or hire.</div>\n\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n",

I do tend to think, whether correctly or not, that some of the things I want to do with FeedReactor will be solutions to some interesting problems..  but that depends upon a) whether I'm not just full of it, and b) whether I'll have the time to take it where it needs to go.\r\n\r\n(Strangely enough, I love discovering when I'm full of it.)</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086991\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=858042a97c035a51ca2097eac37422b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://laughingmeme.org\">kellan</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086991\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-22T23:24:24\">2004-09-22T23:24:24</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">It doesn't help you figure out a concrete business model, but one piece of the puzzle is its gotten a *lot* cheaper lately to build a web start up.\r\n\r\nThe hardware is cheaper, the software is cheaper, the bandwidth is cheaper, and the tools are better.  \r\n\r\nBut even more important we saw some of the largest banks in the world pour a not inconsiderable portion of their wealth for a few years into creating an educated class of both developers and users.  Having participated in several dotcoms I can look back and point to the VCs for creating a huge number of the challenges we faced.  But they also gave me a hell of a financial aid package for the best possible education in web development a person could hope for.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086992\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db0fab74bcb564ebb09295498b892fb6&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://rasterweb.net/raster/\">Pete Prodoehl</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086992\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-23T14:46:01\">2004-09-23T14:46:01</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Casrter sez: \"The odds are that FeedReactor won’t be a viable business…\"\r\n\r\nAh, but what if FeedReactor were available to the Enterprise, internally managed, in a private and secure way? Any value there? I mean, I still can't believe companies allow employees to use AIM instead of just throwing a Jabber server in place. (Oh, wait til Tiger for that one...)\r\n\r\nAnyway, there probably is a business model, I just can't see it, but then I'm just anothr hacker with little business sense.... sigh...</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086993\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.alevin.com/weblog\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=daf7369d879800bafa19c1887faa82b9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.alevin.com/weblog\">Adina Levin</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086993\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-29T10:19:15\">2004-09-29T10:19:15</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I don't think it's that complicated. You have a business when you make something that someone else wants. Bloglines makes something that lots of people want -- there's probably some way to make money from it, whether it's through advertising or selling some add-on service.\r\n\r\nFeed processors aren't for ordinary people, they are something that services like Bloglines want, or corporate IT groups want. \r\n\r\nThere are two ways to make money in this second category.\r\n\r\n1) Get a business partner, and develop something that can be sold to software and services companies.\r\n\r\n2) Develop a superb open source toolkit, and make money from customizing it. \r\n\r\nThe fact that feed processors will eventually be a part of Bloglines etc. is a plus, because organizations make build-buy decisions. If there's a component that's good, the bigger company may buy, license, or hire.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",
