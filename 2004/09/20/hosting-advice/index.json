So, I'm still poking around to see what's up.  Looks like there's a control panel available to me now, so I can see various resource limits, and it looks like I'm still running one of them into the red, but I was told that that wouldn't be causing my problems.\nNonetheless, I've been killing off services and trying to keep that number lower.\nIn any case, I had a FreeBSD server at JC a year or two ago, for a year.. and I also switched for the cost, so I'm used to the great service :)  I think once I know a bit more, I'll have to bounce a few more emails their way</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084269\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7d1c8d2b1a7643236a4661e9a974dee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\">George Hotelling</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084269\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-20T20:11:59\">2004-09-20T20:11:59</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I went with Andy's ServerMatrix suggestion when I asked the same question and have been very happy with my service.

I moved a bunch of stuff there almost a year ago, and have been 99% satisfied. (The 1% relates to some early growing pains when they were expanding their datacenters.)\nThe biggest plus with SM, though, is that they're actively customer-oriented. New deals, upgrades to existing accounts, and extra options pop up in their support forum all the time... and every member of staff that I've dealt with has been quite friendly and competent.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084271\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://gfmorris.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=901ef755790fbe0f71d1282e916a7e84&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://gfmorris.net/\">Geof</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084271\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-21T11:36:05\">2004-09-21T11:36:05</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">SB isn't the world's greatest, no ... but they do okay.

I've got four boxees with them right now, and have nothing but good stories to tell. They seem to do everything right, for a really good price.  As Roger points out, they're definitely very customer focused, to the point they have a one-ring SLA on their NOC phone.  One ring on an 800 number, and you're not only talking to a warm person, but a warm person with a clue.\nI've worked on a lot of ev1 servers, and have many, many horror stories to tell.  I've had to walk noc technicians through using ping, had newly commissioned boxes comprimised before I could even login (I logged in within 12 hours of the box being setup).  And I've heard really, really frightening stories of major security issues (like using one of the four major IM networks to shuttle customer box root passwords around).  They have good prices, and generally don't screw up too bad if nothing goes wrong with your box, but that's about it...</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084275\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cb564795a1912c36f9fa1399fd22ce29&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/\">Bryce</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084275\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-22T09:21:05\">2004-09-22T09:21:05</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Thought I'd toss a few more things out at you:\n0) Stock Apache installations are usually not tuned for low memory utilization. Try lowering all of the following settings: MinSpareServers, MaxSpareServers, StartServers, MaxClients, MaxRequestsPerChild. And get rid of any modules that you aren't using.\n1) Most VPS / VDS / UML hosting companies will tell you upfront what your RAM limit will be and offer a number of service levels.\n2) Consider going back to a BSD account. Typically they do not have fixed RAM allocations because they are not true virtual machines. I know for a fact that the iServer / Verio (ex-employer) VPS platform uses soft limits but their offerings cost more than many dedicated products. You already know that JohnCompanies has a BSD product, and I've heard good things about JVDS.\n3) 1&1 offers managed dedicated servers without root access for $59-$109. If you're trying not to be a SysAdmin that may be a good option.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084276\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jm3.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4a0577bc70bd8b9b1b2b2b20820ee4f9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jm3.net\">jm3</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084276\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-23T11:13:22\">2004-09-23T11:13:22</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">i've always had good service with pair.com, but i'm not sure about their dedicated server programs. only used their shared services. they impress me, tho.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

I've got four boxees with them right now, and have nothing but good stories to tell. They seem to do everything right, for a really good price.  As Roger points out, they're definitely very customer focused, to the point they have a one-ring SLA on their NOC phone.  One ring on an 800 number, and you're not only talking to a warm person, but a warm person with a clue.\r\n\r\nI've worked on a lot of ev1 servers, and have many, many horror stories to tell.  I've had to walk noc technicians through using ping, had newly commissioned boxes comprimised before I could even login (I logged in within 12 hours of the box being setup).  And I've heard really, really frightening stories of major security issues (like using one of the four major IM networks to shuttle customer box root passwords around).  They have good prices, and generally don't screw up too bad if nothing goes wrong with your box, but that's about it...</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084275\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cb564795a1912c36f9fa1399fd22ce29&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.ntwizards.net/\">Bryce</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084275\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-22T09:21:05\">2004-09-22T09:21:05</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Thought I'd toss a few more things out at you:\r\n\r\n0) Stock Apache installations are usually not tuned for low memory utilization. Try lowering all of the following settings: MinSpareServers, MaxSpareServers, StartServers, MaxClients, MaxRequestsPerChild. And get rid of any modules that you aren't using.\r\n\r\n1) Most VPS / VDS / UML hosting companies will tell you upfront what your RAM limit will be and offer a number of service levels.\r\n\r\n2) Consider going back to a BSD account. Typically they do not have fixed RAM allocations because they are not true virtual machines. I know for a fact that the iServer / Verio (ex-employer) VPS platform uses soft limits but their offerings cost more than many dedicated products. You already know that JohnCompanies has a BSD product, and I've heard good things about JVDS.\r\n\r\n3) 1&1 offers managed dedicated servers without root access for $59-$109. If you're trying not to be a SysAdmin that may be a good option.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084276\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://jm3.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4a0577bc70bd8b9b1b2b2b20820ee4f9&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://jm3.net\">jm3</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084276\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-23T11:13:22\">2004-09-23T11:13:22</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">i've always had good service with pair.com, but i'm not sure about their dedicated server programs. only used their shared services. they impress me, tho.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",
