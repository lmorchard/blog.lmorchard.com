Eventually, I&#39;ve really got to break down and get that thing built and running on my server and my laptop-- it really seems like I&#39;m reinventing so many wheels by not basing <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg3/\"><code>dbagg3</code></a> on it.</p>\n<p>But, while I&#39;m in the process of wheel reinvention, how about I borrow Kimbro&#39;s idea?

It works a little something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>feed_xd = XPathDict(file=&quot;sample-atom.xml&quot;)\nfor entry_node in feed_xd.nodes(&quot;//atom:entry&quot;):\n    entry = XPathDict(doc=entry_node.doc, node=entry_node)\n    print &quot;Title: &quot; % entry[&#39;atom:title&#39;]\n    if &#39;atom:author&#39; in entry:\n        print &quot;Author: &quot; % entry[&#39;atom:author/atom:name&#39;]\n\nxml = &quot;&quot;&quot;\n   &lt;dbagg3:user xmlns=&quot;http://purl.org/atom/ns#&quot; \n            xmlns:dbagg3=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2004/07/dbagg3/&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;name&gt;deusx&lt;/name&gt;\n        &lt;email&gt;deus_x@pobox.com&lt;/email&gt;\n        &lt;url&gt;http://www.decafbad.com/&lt;/url&gt;\n        &lt;dbagg3:prefs&gt;\n            &lt;dbagg3:pref name=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/dbagg3:pref&gt;\n        &lt;/dbagg3:prefs&gt;\n   &lt;/dbagg3:author&gt;\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\nmap = (\n    (&#39;userName&#39;,  &#39;a:name&#39;),\n    (&#39;userEmail&#39;, &#39;a:email&#39;),\n    (&#39;fooPref&#39;,   &quot;dbagg3:prefs/dbagg3:pref[@name=&#39;foo&#39;]&quot;)\n)\n\nxd = XPathDict(xml=xml)\nxd.cd(&quot;/dbagg3:user&quot;)\nprint xd.extract(map)\n\n#    {&#39;userName&#39;  : &#39;deusx&#39;, \n#     &#39;userEmail&#39; : &#39;deus_x@pobox.com&#39;, \n#     &#39;fooPref&#39;   : &#39;bar&#39;}</code></pre>\n<p>There isn&#39;t any spectacular code behind all this, and the idea <em>was</em> Kimbro&#39;s, but it&#39;s working.
