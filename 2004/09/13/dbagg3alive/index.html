        <meta property="og:description" content="Got some very good work in this weekend on switching servers and getting dbagg3 in some semblance of working order somewhere other than on my overworked and decidedly non-publicly-demonstrable laptop.
This stuff is so this side of premature, that I&#39;m probably about to cause JohnCompanies to send hit-men out to cancel me, along with my hosting account (have I said that I really appreciate the help so far?).  But I just have to get this out: I&#39;m easily excited by shiny code and gadgets, but it&#39;s so much easier to get excited when I can see something in working condition before taking a screwdriver to it.  So... remember when I mentioned all those URLs?  They&#39;re working out nicely.
First, check out a simple two-pane view of news items, ala Bloglines:

http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml?xsl=xsl/two-pane/index.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html

Taking this apart, you can see:

A user account: http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml
Some XSL: http://feeds.decafbad.com/xsl/two-pane/index.xsl
... and a specified content type (text/html)

If your curiosity is piqued by this, view source and pay attention to link URLs.  It&#39;s more of the same:  XML produced by a REST API, passed through XSL, delivered as HTML.
Here, take a look at another view on this demo user&#39;s aggregated items:

http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/outliner/index.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html

Unfortunately, this only seems to be working decently with Firefox and Safari.  MSIE seems to be balking at the dynamic stuff, though I&#39;ve had it working there in a previous incarnation of this code.  So hopefully this will be fixed soon.
At any rate, what you should see is a single-pane outliner-style display of feed entries.  This is the style of aggregator UI I&#39;ve been using for almost 3 years now.  Disclosure triangles open entries up to show summaries and further content.  “[seen]” links hide the entries, while “[queue]” hides an entry while tossing it into a queue for viewing later.
Speaking of that, you can see what&#39;s in the queue right now:

http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;show_queued=1

Here is a display of queued entries, with another stylesheet applied that shows everything in a flat and open blog-like template.  It&#39;s not reverse-chronological, but that&#39;s not hard to accomplish with a flag or a tweak to an &lt;xsl:sort&gt; tag.  
So that&#39;s just the start of things.  Remember when I was rambling on about XML storage and query?  A URL like this is one product of that:

http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),&#39;OS%20X&#39;)]

This should show you a flat listing of all entries whose titles contain “OS X”.  This is far from perfect, but it&#39;s very exciting to me-- it&#39;s got a lot of promise, stuff that first caught my eye when I saw Jon Udell playing awhile back.
Now, something that you might not notice until doing a bit more digging, is that all these attributes like “seen” and “query” are annotations made by the user on entries.  If you take a peek at some of the Javascript under the hood, you might notice some XmlHTTPRequest code going on.  To mark something as “seen” or “queued”, I POST XML to a URL like this:

http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/

The upshot of this is that these attributes are not limited to “seen” or “queued” flags-- in fact, these annotations can (well, in theory) be any pairing of arbitrary XML and a name.  This annotation then gets injected into the entry, when viewed by the user who owns the annotation, like so:

http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml

In fact, you could invent a new annotation called &#39;tags&#39; and filter for entries with this annotation with a URL like this:

http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry\_notes\_xpath=//dbagg3:note[@name=&#39;tags&#39; and contains(text(),&#39;#food#&#39;) and contains(text(),&#39;#odd#&#39;)]

Eventually, what I&#39;d really like to see this start doing is something akin to del.icio.us-style tagging while you&#39;re reading.  Then, you can have public queries that pull feeds based on your (and others&#39;) tags and spit things back out as feeds again with the proper XSL stylings.
So at this point, it&#39;s all URLs and barely working HTML, but it&#39;s exciting to me at least.  And it&#39;s dogfood for me, since I&#39;m using this crud to get my daily (hourly?) fix.  Pretty soon, I&#39;ll be diving into wrapping more of a proper usable web app around this, with user management and stuff that works in MSIE.  Until then, maybe someone else will see this and catch a buzz from it.

        <p>Got some very good work in this weekend on switching servers and getting <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg3/"><code>dbagg3</code></a> in some semblance of working order somewhere other than on my overworked and decidedly non-publicly-demonstrable laptop.</p>

<div class="content">Could not find the Trackback-URL. So here my two-cents-worth as a comment:
Leslie Michael Orchard (of Decafbad) did it again. He has a demo of his latest projekt online: Dbagg3 (a.k.a . FeedReactor?) I am very impressed. It is still in its embryonic state but show great promise.
