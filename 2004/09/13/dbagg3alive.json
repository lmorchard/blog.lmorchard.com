But I just have to get this out: I&apos;m easily excited by shiny code and gadgets, but it&apos;s so much easier to get excited when I can see something in working condition before taking a screwdriver to it.  So... remember <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/30/dbagg3_makingprogress\">when I mentioned all those URLs</a>?  They&apos;re working out nicely.</p>\n<p>First, check out a simple two-pane view of news items, ala <a href=\"http://www.bloglines.com/\">Bloglines</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml?xsl=xsl/two-pane/index.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml?xsl=xsl/two-pane/index.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taking this apart, you can see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A user account: <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo.xml</a></li>\n<li>Some XSL: <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/xsl/two-pane/index.xsl\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/xsl/two-pane/index.xsl</a></li>\n<li>... and a specified content type (text/html)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your curiosity is piqued by this, view source and pay attention to link URLs.  It&apos;s more of the same:  XML produced by a REST API, passed through XSL, delivered as HTML.</p>\n<p>Here, take a look at another view on this demo user&apos;s aggregated items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/outliner/index.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/outliner/index.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, this only seems to be working decently with Firefox and Safari.  MSIE seems to be balking at the dynamic stuff, though I&apos;ve had it working there in a previous incarnation of this code.  So hopefully this will be fixed soon.</p>\n<p>At any rate, what you should see is a single-pane outliner-style display of feed entries.  This is the style of aggregator UI I&apos;ve been using for almost 3 years now.  Disclosure triangles open entries up to show summaries and further content.  &#x201C;[seen]&#x201D; links hide the entries, while &#x201C;[queue]&#x201D; hides an entry while tossing it into a queue for viewing later.</p>\n<p>Speaking of that, you can see what&apos;s in the queue right now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;show_queued=1\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;show_queued=1</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a display of queued entries, with another stylesheet applied that shows everything in a flat and open blog-like template.  It&apos;s not reverse-chronological, but that&apos;s not hard to accomplish with a flag or a tweak to an &lt;xsl:sort&gt; tag.  </p>\n<p>So that&apos;s just the start of things.  Remember <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/23/slicing_and_dicing_to_make_atom_soup_in_dbagg3\">when I was rambling on about XML storage and query</a>?  A URL like this is one product of that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),&apos;OS%20X&apos;)]\" target=\"new\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry_xpath=//entry/title[contains(text(),&apos;OS%20X&apos;)]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This should show you a flat listing of all entries whose titles contain &#x201C;OS X&#x201D;.  This is far from perfect, but it&apos;s very exciting to me-- it&apos;s got a lot of promise, stuff that first caught my eye when I saw <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/04/15/semanticblog.html\">Jon Udell playing</a> <a href=\"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/06/10/xpathsearch.html?page=1\">awhile back</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, something that you might not notice until doing a bit more digging, is that all these attributes like &#x201C;seen&#x201D; and &#x201C;query&#x201D; are annotations made by the user on entries.  If you take a peek at <a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/js/agg.js\">some of the Javascript</a> under the hood, you might notice some XmlHTTPRequest code going on.  To mark something as &#x201C;seen&#x201D; or &#x201C;queued&#x201D;, I POST XML to a URL like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567/notes/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The upshot of this is that these attributes are not limited to &#x201C;seen&#x201D; or &#x201C;queued&#x201D; flags-- in fact, these annotations can (well, in theory) be any pairing of arbitrary XML and a name.  This annotation then gets injected into the entry, when viewed by the user who owns the annotation, like so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/638/entries/60567.xml</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In fact, you could invent a new annotation called &apos;tags&apos; and filter for entries with this annotation with a URL like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry\\_notes\\_xpath=//dbagg3:note[@name=&apos;tags&apos;\">http://feeds.decafbad.com/api/users/demo/subscriptions/now-12.xml?xsl=xsl/full.xsl&amp;content-type=text/html&amp;entry\\_notes\\_xpath=//dbagg3:note[@name=&apos;tags&apos;</a> and contains(text(),&apos;#food#&apos;) and contains(text(),&apos;#odd#&apos;)]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eventually, what I&apos;d <em>really</em> like to see this start doing is something akin to del.icio.us-style tagging while you&apos;re reading.  Then, you can have public queries that pull feeds based on your (and others&apos;) tags and spit things back out as feeds again with the proper XSL stylings.</p>\n<p>So at this point, it&apos;s all URLs and barely working HTML, but it&apos;s exciting to me at least.  And it&apos;s dogfood for me, since I&apos;m using this crud to get my daily (hourly?) fix.  Pretty soon, I&apos;ll be diving into wrapping more of a proper usable web app around this, with user management and stuff that works in MSIE.

I am very impressed. It is still in its embryonic state but show great promise. </p>\n<p>The current demo may look unimpressing to the uninitiated but actually implements already a lot of functionality in a rather light package. All this functionality can be accessed elegantly through the REST-API.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>I am looking into integrating dbagg3 into my own feedbox-project (see here). I hope Leslie aggrees with us doing some tinkering around ...</p>\n<p>... in more detail \nLINK: <a href=\"http://notizen.typepad.com/aus_der_provinz/2004/09/cool_new_embryo.html\">http://notizen.typepad.com/aus_der_provinz/2004/09/cool_new_embryo.html</a></div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
