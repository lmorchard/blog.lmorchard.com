So it looks like there are some people starting to follow to what I&apos;m doing with <code>dbagg3</code>, and they&apos;re showing me how woefully prepared I am for the attention from tinkerers who are actually trying to, you know, <strong>run</strong> my code.  Things have been crazy busy for me at work, so I haven&apos;t been getting done what I&apos;ve planned.  But, I do need to pull a few things together and clean a few things up.  I&apos;ll soon be answering the smattering of email I&apos;ve gotten so far, but until then, a few quick thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>My source control is a bit of a mess at the moment.

I already know that this is a horrible habit, but since no one&apos;s really been looking, I haven&apos;t been called on it until now.  (Heh, heh--d&apos;oh.)  Planning this weekend (but hopefully today) to resolve this, so that moving forward, svn trunk will be (as far as possible) in a working state at any given moment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I&apos;ve hacked one of my dependencies, SQLObject, by applying <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=9122066\">a patch</a> to support SELECT DISTINCT queries.  This has understandably caused problems for some people who have no idea what I did.  This patch has turned out to be essential, though I don&apos;t know if/when it will or would be included in a release of SQLObject.  So...
