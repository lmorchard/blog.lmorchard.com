        <meta property="og:description" content="Wow.  So it looks like there are some people starting to follow to what I&#39;m doing with dbagg3, and they&#39;re showing me how woefully prepared I am for the attention from tinkerers who are actually trying to, you know, run my code.  Things have been crazy busy for me at work, so I haven&#39;t been getting done what I&#39;ve planned.  But, I do need to pull a few things together and clean a few things up.  I&#39;ll soon be answering the smattering of email I&#39;ve gotten so far, but until then, a few quick thoughts:

My source control is a bit of a mess at the moment.  Not only have I switched from CVS to SVN-- but even if you followed me in that migration, I&#39;ve not kept committed code in working order.  I already know that this is a horrible habit, but since no one&#39;s really been looking, I haven&#39;t been called on it until now.  (Heh, heh--d&#39;oh.)  Planning this weekend (but hopefully today) to resolve this, so that moving forward, svn trunk will be (as far as possible) in a working state at any given moment.

I&#39;ve hacked one of my dependencies, SQLObject, by applying a patch to support SELECT DISTINCT queries.  This has understandably caused problems for some people who have no idea what I did.  This patch has turned out to be essential, though I don&#39;t know if/when it will or would be included in a release of SQLObject.  So...  I wonder if I should dump my working copy of SQLObject into source control?  Otherwise, applying the DISTINCT patch to your SQLObject install should work.

At some point very soon, I want to change the name of this thing to feedReactor.  Yes, I know there&#39;s already a feedparser, and a feeddemon, and a feedburner, and someone&#39;s probably got a feedkitchensink in the works, but I like this name and want to run with it.


So, in the meantime while I straighten some things out, please excuse the mess and thanks for bearing with me!" />

<div class="content">I think having a copy of your SQLObject tree would be most helpful.
First of all, that patch applies (or at least _did_ apply a few weeks ago) to their development version, while you're using the 0.5 Version, right? 
I also 'back-ported' the patch to 0.5.2 (only the distinct part though), but I'm still getting errors...
cheers,
Christian</div>

<div class="content">Woops, just tried it again with a fresh svn-upped dbagg3 and it seems to work now.
Good stuff :-)
