        <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wow.  So it looks like there are some people starting to follow to what I&amp;apos;m doing with &lt;code&gt;dbagg3&lt;/code&gt;, and they&amp;apos;re showing me how woefully prepared I am for the attention from tinkerers who are actually trying to, you know, &lt;strong&gt;run&lt;/strong&gt; my code.  Things have been crazy busy for me at work, so I haven&amp;apos;t been getting done what I&amp;apos;ve planned.  But, I do need to pull a few things together and clean a few things up.  I&amp;apos;ll soon be answering the smattering of email I&amp;apos;ve gotten so far, but until then, a few quick thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My source control is a bit of a mess at the moment.  Not only have I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/16/moving_time_from_cvs_to_subversion&quot;&gt;switched from CVS to SVN&lt;/a&gt;-- but even if you followed me in that migration, I&amp;apos;ve not kept committed code in working order.  I already know that this is a horrible habit, but since no one&amp;apos;s really been looking, I haven&amp;apos;t been called on it until now.  (Heh, heh--d&amp;apos;oh.)  Planning this weekend (but hopefully today) to resolve this, so that moving forward, svn trunk will be (as far as possible) in a working state at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;ve hacked one of my dependencies, SQLObject, by applying &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=9122066&quot;&gt;a patch&lt;/a&gt; to support SELECT DISTINCT queries.  This has understandably caused problems for some people who have no idea what I did.  This patch has turned out to be essential, though I don&amp;apos;t know if/when it will or would be included in a release of SQLObject.  So...  I wonder if I should dump my working copy of SQLObject into source control?  Otherwise, applying the DISTINCT patch to your SQLObject install should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point very soon, I want to change the name of this thing to &lt;strong&gt;feedReactor&lt;/strong&gt;.  Yes, I know there&amp;apos;s already a &lt;em&gt;feedparser&lt;/em&gt;, and a &lt;em&gt;feeddemon&lt;/em&gt;, and a &lt;em&gt;feedburner&lt;/em&gt;, and someone&amp;apos;s probably got a &lt;em&gt;feedkitchensink&lt;/em&gt; in the works, but I like this name and want to run with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the meantime while I straighten some things out, please excuse the mess and thanks for bearing with me!&lt;/p&gt;

<div class="content">I think having a copy of your SQLObject tree would be most helpful.
First of all, that patch applies (or at least _did_ apply a few weeks ago) to their development version, while you're using the 0.5 Version, right? 
I also 'back-ported' the patch to 0.5.2 (only the distinct part though), but I'm still getting errors...
cheers,
Christian</div>

<div class="content">Woops, just tried it again with a fresh svn-upped dbagg3 and it seems to work now.
Good stuff :-)
