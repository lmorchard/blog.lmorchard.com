So it looks like there are some people starting to follow to what I&#39;m doing with <code>dbagg3</code>, and they&#39;re showing me how woefully prepared I am for the attention from tinkerers who are actually trying to, you know, <strong>run</strong> my code.  Things have been crazy busy for me at work, so I haven&#39;t been getting done what I&#39;ve planned.  But, I do need to pull a few things together and clean a few things up.  I&#39;ll soon be answering the smattering of email I&#39;ve gotten so far, but until then, a few quick thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>My source control is a bit of a mess at the moment.  Not only have I <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/09/16/moving_time_from_cvs_to_subversion\">switched from CVS to SVN</a>-- but even if you followed me in that migration, I&#39;ve not kept committed code in working order.  I already know that this is a horrible habit, but since no one&#39;s really been looking, I haven&#39;t been called on it until now.  (Heh, heh--d&#39;oh.)  Planning this weekend (but hopefully today) to resolve this, so that moving forward, svn trunk will be (as far as possible) in a working state at any given moment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I&#39;ve hacked one of my dependencies, SQLObject, by applying <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=9122066\">a patch</a> to support SELECT DISTINCT queries.  This has understandably caused problems for some people who have no idea what I did.  This patch has turned out to be essential, though I don&#39;t know if/when it will or would be included in a release of SQLObject.  So...  I wonder if I should dump my working copy of SQLObject into source control?  Otherwise, applying the DISTINCT patch to your SQLObject install should work.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>At some point very soon, I want to change the name of this thing to <strong>feedReactor</strong>.  Yes, I know there&#39;s already a <em>feedparser</em>, and a <em>feeddemon</em>, and a <em>feedburner</em>, and someone&#39;s probably got a <em>feedkitchensink</em> in the works, but I like this name and want to run with it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, in the meantime while I straighten some things out, please excuse the mess and thanks for bearing with me!</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>shortname=dbagg3mess</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083379\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1229fe3e2959517f522393889bedbf61&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Christian Henz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083379\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-18T06:25:13\">2004-09-18T06:25:13</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">I think having a copy of your SQLObject tree would be most helpful.\nFirst of all, that patch applies (or at least _did_ apply a few weeks ago) to their development version, while you're using the 0.5 Version, right? \nI also 'back-ported' the patch to 0.5.2 (only the distinct part though), but I'm still getting errors...\ncheers,\nChristian</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083380\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1229fe3e2959517f522393889bedbf61&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Christian Henz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083380\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-09-18T07:28:15\">2004-09-18T07:28:15</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Woops, just tried it again with a fresh svn-upped dbagg3 and it seems to work now.\nGood stuff :-)\ncheers,\nChristian</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
