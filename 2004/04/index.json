Just like the way stuff sweeps through dorms or boarding schools where lots of overly open and suggestible people are crammed together, we all notice a bit of a slowdown, so we have less to react to, so then someone writes about it being slow...\nThe nice thing is that every single time, there are even more new people who aren't being infected, and may even still be in their first flush of infatuation with weblogs, posting like rats with a crack dispensing lever. Pick a keyword that you're interested in, and trot it over to Feedster or PubSub or one of the dozens of others, and find some new stuff to read, poke around their blogrolls, basically act like it's 2000 (or whatever your year was) again. Or, look through your referrers (how long has it been?) for people you don't recognize linking to you, and see what they have to say.

Doesn't seem like a lot of interesting public projects are in action right now.

Don't know what the RDF people are into right now.  Can't think of anything cool to do with the Topic Exchange, and I'm running out of disk space and bandwidth anyway.

Granted, I have more things I want to do with this site (and want to write about them), but I want to get down to actual writing and tinkering and writing about tinkering with things other than this blog.\r\n\r\nOf course, over the last year or two, I have stopped monitoring a handful of feeds that tended to be at the center of various teacup tempests, so maybe I've just moved myself far enough from the fray that things just sound quiet.  I'm sure there are still the old wars still raging that I've just managed to quarantine from my scans.  Eh, if so, that's not a bad thing.\r\n\r\nSo now that I'm ostensively back...  what am I missing?\r\n\r\n[io]: http://radio.outliners.com/beta\r\n[mt_beef]: http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/04/wheres_the_beef.shtml\r\n[lazyweb]: http://www.lazyweb.org/\r\n[rest_vs_xmlrpc]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/11/26/oooccb\r\n[rss_wars]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/09/17/ooobgh\r\n[trackback_buzz]: http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/archives/000300.html#000300\r\n[radio_tweaks]: http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/stories/2002/03/06/howToDisplayWhichRssFeedsYoureSubscribedTo.html\r\n[rss_autodetection]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/31/oooago\r\n[dbagg2]: http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg2/\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082371\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082371\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-30T00:59:12\">2004-04-30T00:59:12</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">I've noticed that too.

Just like the way stuff sweeps through dorms or boarding schools where lots of overly open and suggestible people are crammed together, we all notice a bit of a slowdown, so we have less to react to, so then someone writes about it being slow...\r\n\r\nThe nice thing is that every single time, there are even more new people who aren't being infected, and may even still be in their first flush of infatuation with weblogs, posting like rats with a crack dispensing lever. Pick a keyword that you're interested in, and trot it over to Feedster or PubSub or one of the dozens of others, and find some new stuff to read, poke around their blogrolls, basically act like it's 2000 (or whatever your year was) again. Or, look through your referrers (how long has it been?) for people you don't recognize linking to you, and see what they have to say. Either way, does wonders for me.</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082376\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=475a543984769e9890f8dc0091f602c3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/\">Phillip Pearson</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082376\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-05-02T05:35:55\">2004-05-02T05:35:55</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Feels quiet to me.  Doesn't seem like a lot of interesting public projects are in action right now.  IMHO the good stuff is going on behind closed doors - Bloglines, Technorati, Six Apart, Google, etc.  UserLand, which always seemed to be at the center of anything new and interesting, is in maintenance mode, and the Atom boys are just quietly doing their stuff.  Don't know what the RDF people are into right now.  Can't think of anything cool to do with the Topic Exchange, and I'm running out of disk space and bandwidth anyway.  Marc Canter et all are going strong with the PeopleAggregator open source SNS project, but I don't exactly know where they're aiming there.\r\n\r\nUmm ...</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        </ul>\r\n    \r\n        </div>\r\n    ",

    "html": "<p>So.  It&#39;s been awhile since I spent much time here actually writing.  The <a href=\"/links/\">quick links</a> have been fun, but they&#39;re just not the same as really posting something of my own.  There&#39;ve been numerous reasons for my semi-disappearance, but I think I&#39;d finally like to come back now.  Maybe I&#39;ll even spend a few entries writing about what&#39;s happened over the past year or so.  It&#39;s been a bit of a trip.</p>\n<p>But first, I&#39;ve got to get this new site launched.  By the time you read this, there will have been some changes.  It will have been a little over a year since the last time I did <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/colophon/oooooa.html\">something drastic</a> around here.  In fact, I&#39;d intended this to happen right around <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooooab.html\">this site&#39;s birthday</a>, but I think I needed to read <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2004/04/22.html\">Joel on Software on Perfectionism</a>, and <a href=\"http://mamamusings.net/archives/2004/04/23/you_may_ask_yourself_how_did_i_get_here.php\">mamamusing&#39;s Talking Heads reference</a>, to get me to finally bite the bullet and push the button.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s bound to be bugs and problems galore here, but I&#39;ve got to get past the tinkering and strip away my excuses for not actually writing here.  I actually started putting this new site together back in early December, and have been putzing around since.  Now that it&#39;s just about there, I realize I&#39;m actually afraid to start writing again.  (As if I were any sort of writer worth reading before.  Bah.  Get over it.)</p>\n<p>Here it is, then.  I&#39;m back to using Movable Type, probably just in time to fuss about upgrading to 3.0.  Nothing wrong with <a href=\"http://www.blosxom.com/\">blosxom</a>, or <a href=\"http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/pyblosxom/\">pyblosxom</a> for that matter, but a confluence of available plugins, exasperation, and fiddling brought me back.  I think the result&#39;s turned out rather nifty, so one of my first runs of entries will be a sort of colophon.  Maybe someone else will find something worthwhile in that.  </p>\n<p>This time, I&#39;ve gone from having a wiki and a blog to having a wiki, a blog, and a linkblog.  (There&#39;ve got to be better words for these things.)  The links were mashed up with the rare blog entry, and I got more than one comment wishing they were separate.  Makes sense to me.  So...  three separate parts to this site, each separate for a reason, but all intermingled too.</p>\n<p>Anyway, before I ramble on too much longer about an idea which might just be NeatLikeDigitalWatches instead of <em>actually</em> neat, I should get this thing launched and start using it...</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090195\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090195\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T02:40:22\">2004-04-26T02:40:22</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Welcome back--good to hear from you!</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090196\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7d1c8d2b1a7643236a4661e9a974dee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\">George Hotelling</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090196\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T02:43:54\">2004-04-26T02:43:54</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">As Rands said[1], \"better is the enemy of done.\"  Glad to see you've finally launched!\n1: http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/04/19/heinous.html</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090197\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=99b77c34a0e26fd04a058f8c2dbab290&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090197\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T04:06:32\">2004-04-26T04:06:32</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">it's about friggin time.  :-P</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090199\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.innoq.com/blog/st\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=afd6dc452bc20f8f06612d4792bb8be3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.innoq.com/blog/st\">Stefan Tilkov</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090199\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T11:10:04\">2004-04-26T11:10:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Even the links were good, but this is great.

    "body": "So.  It's been awhile since I spent much time here actually writing.  The [quick links][links] have been fun, but they're just not the same as really posting something of my own.  There've been numerous reasons for my semi-disappearance, but I think I'd finally like to come back now.  Maybe I'll even spend a few entries writing about what's happened over the past year or so.  It's been a bit of a trip.\r\n\r\nBut first, I've got to get this new site launched.  By the time you read this, there will have been some changes.  It will have been a little over a year since the last time I did [something drastic][drastic] around here.  In fact, I'd intended this to happen right around [this site's birthday][birthday], but I think I needed to read [Joel on Software on Perfectionism][perfectionism], and [mamamusing's Talking Heads reference][talkingheads], to get me to finally bite the bullet and push the button.\r\n\r\nThere's bound to be bugs and problems galore here, but I've got to get past the tinkering and strip away my excuses for not actually writing here.  I actually started putting this new site together back in early December, and have been putzing around since.  Now that it's just about there, I realize I'm actually afraid to start writing again.  (As if I were any sort of writer worth reading before.  Bah.  Get over it.)\r\n\r\nHere it is, then.  I'm back to using Movable Type, probably just in time to fuss about upgrading to 3.0.  Nothing wrong with [blosxom][blosxom], or [pyblosxom][pyblosxom] for that matter, but a confluence of available plugins, exasperation, and fiddling brought me back.  I think the result's turned out rather nifty, so one of my first runs of entries will be a sort of colophon.  Maybe someone else will find something worthwhile in that.  \r\n\r\nThis time, I've gone from having a wiki and a blog to having a wiki, a blog, and a linkblog.  (There've got to be better words for these things.)  The links were mashed up with the rare blog entry, and I got more than one comment wishing they were separate.  Makes sense to me.  So...  three separate parts to this site, each separate for a reason, but all intermingled too.\r\n\r\nAnyway, before I ramble on too much longer about an idea which might just be NeatLikeDigitalWatches instead of *actually* neat, I should get this thing launched and start using it...\r\n\r\n[links]: /links/\r\n[drastic]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/colophon/oooooa.html\r\n[birthday]: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooooab.html\r\n[perfectionism]: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2004/04/22.html\r\n[talkingheads]: http://mamamusings.net/archives/2004/04/23/you_may_ask_yourself_how_did_i_get_here.php\r\n[blosxom]: http://www.blosxom.com/\r\n[pyblosxom]: http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/pyblosxom/\r\n\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\r\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\r\n            \r\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\r\n            \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090195\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=266511c4b3124a981ccd3b1716e0bb0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.scifihifi.com\">Buzz Andersen</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090195\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T02:40:22\">2004-04-26T02:40:22</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Welcome back--good to hear from you!</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090196\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c7d1c8d2b1a7643236a4661e9a974dee&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://george.hotelling.net/\">George Hotelling</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090196\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T02:43:54\">2004-04-26T02:43:54</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">As Rands said[1], \"better is the enemy of done.\"  Glad to see you've finally launched!\r\n\r\n1: http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/04/19/heinous.html</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090197\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=99b77c34a0e26fd04a058f8c2dbab290&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090197\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T04:06:32\">2004-04-26T04:06:32</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">it's about friggin time.  :-P</div>\r\n            \r\n        </li>\r\n    \r\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090199\">\r\n            <div class=\"meta\">\r\n                <div class=\"author\">\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.innoq.com/blog/st\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=afd6dc452bc20f8f06612d4792bb8be3&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\r\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \r\n                       href=\"http://www.innoq.com/blog/st\">Stefan Tilkov</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090199\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T11:10:04\">2004-04-26T11:10:04</time></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"content\">Even the links were good, but this is great.
