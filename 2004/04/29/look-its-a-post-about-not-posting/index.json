  "html": "<p>Yeah, so this blog thing.  I finally switched it over to the stuff I&#39;ve been fiddling with in silence for months - and then I proceeded to immediately shut back up.</p>\n<p>Well, not exactly.  I&#39;ve still been <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/links/\">posting links</a> occasionally, but that&#39;s old hat now.  The only new thing is the infrastructure behind how I share them.  I&#39;ve been out of the blogging habit for awhile now - maybe as long I&#39;d been in the habit.  For most of last year, it was because my brain was <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2003/07/23/sleep_apnea\">just not up</a> to stringing these word things together with any reliable coherency.  (Planning on writing more about that soon.)  But, since I&#39;ve been recovering my sanity, I&#39;ve been both procrastinating and intimidating myself about this place.</p>\n<p>The intimidation, if that&#39;s the right word, comes from a sort of pedestal building I&#39;ve been doing with regards to writing here.  I want to write good things here, important things here.  When an idea for writing pops, I think of things I&#39;ve read things from bloggers like <a href=\"http://www.diveintomark.org\">Mark Pilgrim</a>, <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/\">Shelley Powers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.com\">Sam Ruby</a>, <a href=\"http://www.markbernstein.org/\">Mark Bernstein</a>, and a slew of others.  Then, I censor myself, since of course <em>my</em> stuff would never be as good as all that.  So, I never get started again, and thus atrophies my <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/03/20/assets\">most valuable asset</a>.</p>\n<p>Thing is though, were any of those authors to read this, they&#39;d likely each shy away from the credit I give them.  Because they&#39;re just people who happen to write.  Granted, they&#39;re good, but part of that is because they write.  Though some of them <a href=\"http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/02/19/weblog_writing.html\">have a process</a>, most of them <strong>just write</strong>.  That&#39;s part of what having a blog is about - just writing and getting it out there.</p>\n<p>So I think I&#39;m taking this crap too seriously in my head.  I need to just get back to doing it.  Granted, I don&#39;t want to open up the taps and spew LiveJournal-quality angst and hate-my-parents stream-of-consciousness around here.  But, I think can come up with some quality off-the-cuff notions to jot down here.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve got a &quot;queue&quot; of sorts in my <a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/\">Tinderbox</a> of Very Important Things to write, and I do still want to get to those, but I think I need to knock down my self-imposed barriers to posting and just do it. </p>\n<p>Whew.  Heh.  So I just managed to post about my non-posting.  How do you like that?</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088566\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://halfass.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=057c407b2bbfa3cdb3e930bc7131a07f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://halfass.com\">Scott Partee</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221088566\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2004-04-29T15:24:33\">2004-04-29T15:24:33</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">Just came back after a while of non-reading due to work and blah.
