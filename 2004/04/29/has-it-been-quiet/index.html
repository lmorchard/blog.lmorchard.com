        <section class="post-content">
          <p>I know I&#39;ve been Rip-van-Winkeling it in the blogosphere, but has it been getting quieter?  At least in the tech circles?  Going back through some of my archives, I see <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/09/17/ooobgh">raging RSS wars</a>, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/11/26/oooccb">REST vs XML-RPC</a> arguments, and a slew of little <a href="http://www.lazyweb.org/">Lazyweb mini-innovations</a> on a daily basis.  Hell, even the next long-anticipated release of MovableType is <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/04/wheres_the_beef.shtml">reported to be meatless</a>.  Also, since I&#39;ve started actually paying attention to some statistics in <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/cvs/dbagg2/">my aggregator</a>, I&#39;ve noticed a large swath of my 2-3 year old subscriptions have been long silent.  </p>
<p>Seems like it&#39;s been a long time since something with the buzz of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/archives/000300.html#000300">Trackback</a> or <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/stories/2002/03/06/howToDisplayWhichRssFeedsYoureSubscribedTo.html">Radio UserLand tweaks</a> or <a href="http://radio.outliners.com/beta">Instant outlining</a> or <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/31/oooago">RSS autodetection</a> poked its head up.  Maybe it&#39;s just blog tech reaching a plateau of relative maturity, or maybe everyone&#39;s just getting bored with this stuff.  Personally, one of the main reasons I switched back to MovableType was because of all the long-solved problems and plugins written for me.  I&#39;m mostly tapped out with tinkering with blog software itself.  Granted, I have more things I want to do with this site (and want to write about them), but I want to get down to actual writing and tinkering and writing about tinkering with things other than this blog.</p>
<p>Of course, over the last year or two, I have stopped monitoring a handful of feeds that tended to be at the center of various teacup tempests, so maybe I&#39;ve just moved myself far enough from the fray that things just sound quiet.  I&#39;m sure there are still the old wars still raging that I&#39;ve just managed to quarantine from my scans.  Eh, if so, that&#39;s not a bad thing.</p>
<p>So now that I&#39;m ostensively back...  what am I missing?</p>

<div class="content">Fewer unemployed/underemployed technocrati?
Also, I wonder how much online journaling has gone underground, hidden behind access control or just not posted to the web for personal, professional, or legal reasons?</div>

<div class="content">Hey, even Kottke's been pretty quiet lately.  I think maybe the buzz over weblogs has just died down; I mean, how long can people weblog about weblogging about conferences about weblogging about kitten pictures?</div>

<div class="content">Eh, you've been around long enough to have gone through several of these, haven't you? Just like the way stuff sweeps through dorms or boarding schools where lots of overly open and suggestible people are crammed together, we all notice a bit of a slowdown, so we have less to react to, so then someone writes about it being slow...
The nice thing is that every single time, there are even more new people who aren't being infected, and may even still be in their first flush of infatuation with weblogs, posting like rats with a crack dispensing lever. Pick a keyword that you're interested in, and trot it over to Feedster or PubSub or one of the dozens of others, and find some new stuff to read, poke around their blogrolls, basically act like it's 2000 (or whatever your year was) again. Or, look through your referrers (how long has it been?) for people you don't recognize linking to you, and see what they have to say. Either way, does wonders for me.</div>

<div class="content">Feels quiet to me.  Doesn't seem like a lot of interesting public projects are in action right now.  IMHO the good stuff is going on behind closed doors - Bloglines, Technorati, Six Apart, Google, etc.  UserLand, which always seemed to be at the center of anything new and interesting, is in maintenance mode, and the Atom boys are just quietly doing their stuff.  Don't know what the RDF people are into right now.  Can't think of anything cool to do with the Topic Exchange, and I'm running out of disk space and bandwidth anyway.  Marc Canter et all are going strong with the PeopleAggregator open source SNS project, but I don't exactly know where they're aiming there.
