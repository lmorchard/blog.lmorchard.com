          <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>I think coding is an essential skill for modern humans
surrounded by code and machines that run it. Please learn to code.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mita/2508770940/?ref=nf" style="display: block; float: right; text-decoration: none; border: none; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; width: 310px;"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2001/2508770940_b88b955aaa.jpg" style="width: 275px; border: 2px solid #ddd; padding: 1em; background: #fff;" /></a></p>
<p>I disagree with Jeff Atwood on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html">&quot;Please don&#39;t learn to code&quot;</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;everyone should learn to code&quot; movement isn&#39;t just wrong
because it falsely equates coding with essential life skills like
reading, writing, and math. I wish. It is wrong in so many other
ways. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, I <em>do</em> regard coding as an essential modern skill. Yes,
<a href="http://dmlcentral.net/blog/cathy-davidson/why-we-need-4th-r-reading-writing-arithmetic-algorithms" title="Why We Need a 4th R: Reading, wRiting, aRithmetic, algoRithms">right alongside reading, writing, and &#39;rithmatic</a>. At least
this part of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html">the post</a> had me nodding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suppose I can support learning a tiny bit about programming just
so you can recognize what code is, and when code might be an
appropriate way to approach a problem you have. But I can also
recognize plumbing problems when I see them without any particular
training in the area.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="visible-pipes">Visible pipes</h2>
<p>Luckily, pipes are not as occult as code. If you go into a basement or
open the door under a sink, you can see them and follow where they go.
That&#39;s <em>some</em> training, albeit informal or self-directed. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;d get exposed to code in the same way: View
Source in a browser <em>used</em> to be a decent start on the web, <a href="http://saveviewsource.org/">but
that&#39;s less helpful lately</a>. Code elsewhere has
typically been hard to get at, Open Source notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Still, I&#39;d bet there are people in the world for whom running water
comes from <em>magic</em> and drains into <em>magic*.  Where *magic</em> means: &quot;I
never thought about it, never needed to, and am sometimes vaguely
afraid of it.&quot;</p>
<p>For that class of homeowner, <a href="http://www.gkdating.com/mad-men-lessons-three-men-and-a-sink/" title="Mad Men Lessons: Three Men and a Sink">the kitchen floods when the sink springs
a leak, until an expert arrives</a>. It&#39;s not the end of
the world, and plenty of people get by just fine like that. But, I
certainly wouldn&#39;t agree that &quot;<strong>Please don&#39;t learn about pipes</strong>&quot; is
good advice in general.</p>
<h2 id="learning-by-doing">Learning by doing</h2>
<p>Admittedly, &quot;<strong>learn to plumb</strong>&quot; isn&#39;t the same as &quot;<strong>learn about
pipes</strong>&quot;. But, is there a difference between &quot;<strong>learn <em>to</em> code</strong>&quot; and
&quot;<strong>learn <em>about</em> code</strong>&quot;? I don&#39;t think so. Like writing, code doesn&#39;t
seem like a thing that&#39;s easy to learn <em>about</em> without <em>doing</em> it.</p>
<p>When I write &quot;coder&quot;, I generally mean this: Someone who is capable of
encoding his or her intent and decision process into a form that can
drive a CPU to perform tasks on his or her behalf.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a very broad definition, but it implies a lot. First, you have
to realize that <em>you</em> can make a CPU can do things on your
behalf--it&#39;s okay, you won&#39;t break it. It&#39;s a tool made by
humans and you as a human can understand it. Then, you need a notion
of <a href="http://rwxweb.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/teaching-algorithmic-thinking/">algorithmic thinking</a>, in order to formulate your
intent and reasoning in a form that a CPU can execute. These are not
natural or intuitive things.</p>
<p>I agree with that it&#39;s good to &quot;<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html">recognize what code is, and when code
might be an appropriate way to approach a problem</a>&quot;.  But,
if you&#39;ve never made a CPU do your bidding, it&#39;s easy to see it as a
mysterious black box with a will of its own--possibly malicious or
at least capricious.</p>
<p>And, if you&#39;ve never worked to force your thoughts into to the
confoundingly literal and common senseless constraints of computer
programming, it&#39;s hard to even imagine how code works. If you can&#39;t
imagine how it works, how do you work it into your mental toolkit for
getting things done?</p>
<p>Learn to code, and a lot of other things get dragged into your head
along the way.</p>
<h2 id="who-needs-all-these-coders">Who needs all these coders?</h2>
<p>And then, there were these bits from &quot;<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html">Please Don&#39;t Learn to
Code</a>&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It assumes that adding naive, novice,
not-even-sure-they-like-this-whole-programming-thing coders to the
workforce is a net positive for the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It implies that there&#39;s a thin, easily permeable membrane between
learning to program and getting paid to program professionally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is looking at work from the wrong angle. It isn&#39;t about <em>getting
paid to program</em>, so much as <em>coding to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/08/be-good-at-your-job.html">be good at your
job</a></em>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not talking about Java-heads who live all day in Eclipse.  I&#39;m
talking about the Excel-head who used to rock <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications">VBA macros</a>, who
maybe just started playing with <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/">Google Apps Script</a>. I have no
idea how popular Google Apps Script might or might not be, but I&#39;ve
seen some crazy amazing things done in VBA by sales and account reps
who&#39;d punch you in the nose if you called them geeks.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the future of work is heading toward more work
with greater volumes of information and data. Should <strong>professional
programers</strong> be the only people in an organization who know how to
apply computational power to solve problems? Maybe the vendors will
sweep in, clean up all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib_/_Dream_Machines">the cybercrud</a>, and get the real work
done for us.</p>
<h2 id="programming-should-not-be-a-priesthood">Programming should not be a priesthood</h2>
<p>Consider writing: there&#39;s a lot to learn and it used to be a thing
done only by a few scribes. But, people today get a lot of mileage out
of just sticky notes and email. Sure, improving your grammar and
learning how to structure an essay can help in many, many ways. But,
you don&#39;t need to be a <strong>professional writer</strong> to be a <strong>professional
who uses written language</strong>.</p>
<p>The same can apply for coding. The problem, though, is that the
sticky-notes-and-email level of competence barely exists or is near
impossible to access. So, not only do I think we need more coders--we
also need more tools that support coding and make coding more
accessible. I think we should support <strong>professionals who use code</strong>.</p>
<p>More than that, I think we should encourage and support <strong>humans who
code</strong>. I really do consider coding next to reading, writing, and
math. I don&#39;t think we can all rely on someone else to write the
perfect app for the work we&#39;ll need to do in the future. I expect the
successful people will be those who can apply <a href="http://teddziuba.com/2010/10/taco-bell-programming.html">Taco Bell
programming</a> to reams of data and find answers. We&#39;ll need
to ride <a href="http://www.dougengelbart.org/history/pix.html#6">bicycles, not tricycles</a>.</p>
