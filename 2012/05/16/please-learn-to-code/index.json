I wish. It is wrong in so many other\nways. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact, I <em>do</em> regard coding as an essential modern skill. Yes,\n<a href=\"http://dmlcentral.net/blog/cathy-davidson/why-we-need-4th-r-reading-writing-arithmetic-algorithms\" title=\"Why We Need a 4th R: Reading, wRiting, aRithmetic, algoRithms\">right alongside reading, writing, and 'rithmatic</a>. At least\nthis part of <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html\">the post</a> had me nodding:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I suppose I can support learning a tiny bit about programming just\nso you can recognize what code is, and when code might be an\nappropriate way to approach a problem you have. But I can also\nrecognize plumbing problems when I see them without any particular\ntraining in the area.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"visible-pipes\">Visible pipes</h2>\n<p>Luckily, pipes are not as occult as code. If you go into a basement or\nopen the door under a sink, you can see them and follow where they go.\nThat's <em>some</em> training, albeit informal or self-directed. </p>\n<p>I'm not sure how you'd get exposed to code in the same way: View\nSource in a browser <em>used</em> to be a decent start on the web, <a href=\"http://saveviewsource.org/\">but\nthat's less helpful lately</a>. Code elsewhere has\ntypically been hard to get at, Open Source notwithstanding.</p>\n<p>Still, I'd bet there are people in the world for whom running water\ncomes from <em>magic</em> and drains into <em>magic</em>.  Where <em>magic</em> means: \"I\nnever thought about it, never needed to, and am sometimes vaguely\nafraid of it.\"</p>\n<p>For that class of homeowner, <a href=\"http://www.gkdating.com/mad-men-lessons-three-men-and-a-sink/\" title=\"Mad Men Lessons: Three Men and a Sink\">the kitchen floods when the sink springs\na leak, until an expert arrives</a>. It's not the end of\nthe world, and plenty of people get by just fine like that. But, I\ncertainly wouldn't agree that \"<strong>Please don't learn about pipes</strong>\" is\ngood advice in general.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learning-by-doing\">Learning by doing</h2>\n<p>Admittedly, \"<strong>learn to plumb</strong>\" isn't the same as \"<strong>learn about\npipes</strong>\". But, is there a difference between \"<strong>learn <em>to</em> code</strong>\" and\n\"<strong>learn <em>about</em> code</strong>\"? I don't think so. Like writing, code doesn't\nseem like a thing that's easy to learn <em>about</em> without <em>doing</em> it.</p>\n<p>When I write \"coder\", I generally mean this: Someone who is capable of\nencoding his or her intent and decision process into a form that can\ndrive a CPU to perform tasks on his or her behalf.</p>\n<p>That's a very broad definition, but it implies a lot. First, you have\nto realize that <em>you</em> can make a CPU can do things on your\nbehalf--it's okay, you won't break it. It's a tool made by\nhumans and you as a human can understand it. Then, you need a notion\nof <a href=\"http://rwxweb.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/teaching-algorithmic-thinking/\">algorithmic thinking</a>, in order to formulate your\nintent and reasoning in a form that a CPU can execute. These are not\nnatural or intuitive things.</p>\n<p>I agree with that it's good to \"<a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html\">recognize what code is, and when code\nmight be an appropriate way to approach a problem</a>\".  But,\nif you've never made a CPU do your bidding, it's easy to see it as a\nmysterious black box with a will of its own--possibly malicious or\nat least capricious.</p>\n<p>And, if you've never worked to force your thoughts into to the\nconfoundingly literal and common senseless constraints of computer\nprogramming, it's hard to even imagine how code works. If you can't\nimagine how it works, how do you work it into your mental toolkit for\ngetting things done?</p>\n<p>Learn to code, and a lot of other things get dragged into your head\nalong the way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-needs-all-these-coders\">Who needs all these coders?</h2>\n<p>And then, there were these bits from \"<a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html\">Please Don't Learn to\nCode</a>\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It assumes that adding naive, novice,\nnot-even-sure-they-like-this-whole-programming-thing coders to the\nworkforce is a net positive for the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It implies that there's a thin, easily permeable membrane between\nlearning to program and getting paid to program professionally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is looking at work from the wrong angle.
