While it&#8217;s true that many apps <em>will</em> run in Firefox Nightly, and there is an emulator you can build from the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"b2g\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">b2g</a> repo, most apps are presently problematic in Firefox Nightly, and I&#8217;ve never gotten the emulator to build successfully.</p>\n<p>You can either <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client#Building_the_desktop_client\">build your own B2G Desktop</a>, or <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client#Download_a_nightly_build\">download a nightly build</a>. I&#8217;ve done both, and generally I recommend sticking with the nightly Aurora builds.</p>\n<p>On OS X, I was able to download a nightly build and launch it with a double-click. That got things running &#8211; hooray! But, it didn&#8217;t get me productive straight away: The nightly build comes equipped with its own embedded build of Gaia, which makes it handy for trying out your own 3rd party apps but not-so-handy for hacking on Gaia itself.</p>\n<p>To improve this situation, you need to do two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gaia/Hacking#Nightly_Builds\">Build your own Gaia profile</a> from your own clone of <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia\">mozilla-b2g/gaia</a>. This is pretty much just running <code>make</code> or <code>DEBUG=1 make</code> from your git clone. </li>\n<li>Run <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop from a terminal <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client#Running_the_desktop_client\">with command line options</a> that tell it to use your new Gaia profile, rather than the built-in. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, at this point, I have the Gaia source and a means by which to run it on my laptop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"breaking-things\"><span id=\"Breaking_things\">Breaking things</span></h2>\n<p>After getting the project running as intended, I break something. And by that, I mean that I change a button title somewhere to &#8220;LOL BUTTS&#8221; or intentionally introduce an exception or syntax error somewhere. Then, I fix it. This is practice that exposes me to the guts of the thing; gets me into the edit/build/run cycle; shows me what it does when something goes wrong; and pushes me toward finding the tests.</p>\n<p>But, I think I picked the wrong week to step into the arena, because everything came pre-broken. There were semi-known bugs preventing nightly builds of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop from running my fresh clone of Gaia. It took me most of my first week to track down those bugs in bugzilla, find workarounds, and finally get something going. And then, it all broke again. And I found workarounds again.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I was at a point where I built my own <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop from source with a particular patch from a particular bug applied, and <em>that</em> got me to the point where I could <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/commit/9f0129c7a5f04d58bbbe140de2b9562e3172d23c\">submit my first pull request</a> to fix a broken test.</p>\n<p>Happily, things seem to have stabilized since I started: <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop nightlies have been cooperating with bleeding-edge Gaia lately, so I&#8217;ve been able to stop building my own. So, now, when I find a combination of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop and phone and Gaia checkout that works, I cling to that for dear life until it&#8217;s absolutely necessary for me to update one of the parts.</p>\n<p>In short, FirefoxOS is very much in flux, right now. Bring a hard hat and expect delays.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fixing-things\"><span id=\"Fixing_things\">Fixing things</span></h2>\n<p>Once I&#8217;ve broken something and then fixed it, I usually have a sense for how to get real work done. Since then, I&#8217;ve been slowly wrapping my head around <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/tree/master/apps/calendar\">the core Calendar app</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/commits?author=lmorchard\">my bug fixes have finally started trickling in</a>.</p>\n<p>Cobbling together a reliable Gaia-hacking workflow is complicated, though:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some Gaia apps work in Firefox Nightly, at least partially. This is great, because Firefox has all the great tools like the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"DOM\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/DOM?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">DOM</a> inspector and web console. And, for the most part, you can just save-and-refresh to see changes. </li>\n<li>All Gaia apps work in <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop, usually, though sometimes there are&#8230; quirks. This is good for seeing how changes work in a closer-to-real environment. But, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop has none of the web developer tools offered by Firefox. And, to see changes, I generally have to save, relaunch <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop, then relaunch the app within the simulator. That&#8217;s pretty inconvenient.</li>\n<li>All Gaia apps work on the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a>-supplied dev phone &#8211; which almost no one has. Well, they work more often than they do on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop and Firefox, anyway. But, including a phone in the dev iteration loop is downright painful: As opposed to the usual webdev experience of save-and-refresh, the phone demands a save-build-flash-restart-relaunch cycle. </li>\n<li>There is one awesome thing, at least for <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/tree/master/apps/calendar\">the Calendar app</a>: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Gaia_Unit_Tests\">There are unit tests which run in B2G Desktop, but are driven by a node.js controller in my shell</a>. That lets me beat up on my code &amp; logic in a &#8220;headless&#8221; context before jumping into Firefox, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop, or the phone for a fuller integration test and a manual run-through. In fact, the unit testing framework even watches for file changes and will re-run tests right after a save, complete with a Growl notification of pass/fail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"room-for-improvement\"><span id=\"Room_for_improvement\">Room for improvement</span></h2>\n<p>Slowly but surely, I&#8217;ve gotten my minigun barrel spun up to start firing <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/25/lead-bullets/\">piles of lead bullets</a> at Gaia bugs. But, it has been and continues to be a challenge. I&#8217;m hard-pressed to recommend it as a fun-time leisure project to anyone without a <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a> paycheck, or even as an off-hours interest for those who live-and-breathe Firefox. This is to be expected, since it&#8217;s not even a v1.0 project yet &#8211; but, I really, really hope things improve in the not-so-distant future.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We need to make sure that new contributors can get quickly from cloning the source to running the code. And it should <em>always</em> work &#8211; as in big, noisy automated tests fail when it breaks. I don&#8217;t care if it works fine on the phone if I can&#8217;t hack on it, at least from a contributor perspective. </li>\n<li>We need a consistent and convenient development environment for Gaia. All day, I bounce between things that are partly broken in Firefox, partly broken in <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop, and mostly working on the phone. This kills productivity and enthusiasm, all day. And, many times, no one else in the <a href=\"irc://irc.mozilla.org/gaia\">#gaia channel on IRC</a> knows what I&#8217;m on about when I say something&#8217;s broken &#8211; because everyone&#8217;s dev environment is a unique little snowflake. </li>\n<li>My ideal workflow would never leave Firefox and my editor: Consider it a variant of the Responsive Design View, and ensure all the various APIs expected on a real phone are either working properly, polyfilled, or usefully stubbed out. Then, when it&#8217;s perfect in my most comfy environment, I can try it on a phone or standalone simulator as an afterthought. The <a href=\"http://www.blueskyonmars.com/2012/11/08/r2d2b2g-is-becoming-the-firefox-os-simulator/\">upcoming built-in Firefox OS Simulator</a> (née <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/10/r2d2b2g-an-experimental-prototype-firefox-os-test-environment/\">r2d2b2g</a>) looks promising, but it needs to be seamless. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"still-digging\"><span id=\"Still_digging\">Still digging</span></h2>\n<p>Even with the challenges, and even if my contributions are small, I&#8217;m happy to have the opportunity to work on FirefoxOS. It&#8217;s a big deal; it&#8217;s the next Firefox. So, I plan to keep ramming my head against this stuff to help make it better, and I hope we can start taking time to make making it better better, too!</p>\n",

This is practice that exposes me to the guts of the thing; gets me into the edit/build/run cycle; shows me what it does when something goes wrong; and pushes me toward finding the tests.\r\n\r\nBut, I think I picked the wrong week to step into the arena, because everything came pre-broken. There were semi-known bugs preventing nightly builds of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop from running my fresh clone of Gaia. It took me most of my first week to track down those bugs in bugzilla, find workarounds, and finally get something going. And then, it all broke again. And I found workarounds again.\r\n\r\nEventually, I was at a point where I built my own <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop from source with a particular patch from a particular bug applied, and *that* got me to the point where I could [submit my first pull request][18] to fix a broken test.\r\n\r\nHappily, things seem to have stabilized since I started: <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop nightlies have been cooperating with bleeding-edge Gaia lately, so I&#8217;ve been able to stop building my own. So, now, when I find a combination of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop and phone and Gaia checkout that works, I cling to that for dear life until it&#8217;s absolutely necessary for me to update one of the parts.\r\n\r\nIn short, FirefoxOS is very much in flux, right now. Bring a hard hat and expect delays.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Fixing_things\">Fixing things</span>\r\n\r\nOnce I&#8217;ve broken something and then fixed it, I usually have a sense for how to get real work done. Since then, I&#8217;ve been slowly wrapping my head around [the core Calendar app][19], and [my bug fixes have finally started trickling in][20].\r\n\r\nCobbling together a reliable Gaia-hacking workflow is complicated, though:\r\n\r\n*   Some Gaia apps work in Firefox Nightly, at least partially. This is great, because Firefox has all the great tools like the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"DOM\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/DOM?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">DOM</a> inspector and web console. And, for the most part, you can just save-and-refresh to see changes. \r\n*   All Gaia apps work in <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop, usually, though sometimes there are&#8230; quirks. This is good for seeing how changes work in a closer-to-real environment. But, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop has none of the web developer tools offered by Firefox. And, to see changes, I generally have to save, relaunch <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop, then relaunch the app within the simulator. That&#8217;s pretty inconvenient.\r\n*   All Gaia apps work on the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a>-supplied dev phone &#8211; which almost no one has. Well, they work more often than they do on <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop and Firefox, anyway. But, including a phone in the dev iteration loop is downright painful: As opposed to the usual webdev experience of save-and-refresh, the phone demands a save-build-flash-restart-relaunch cycle. \r\n*   There is one awesome thing, at least for [the Calendar app][19]: [There are unit tests which run in B2G Desktop, but are driven by a node.js controller in my shell][21]. That lets me beat up on my code & logic in a &#8220;headless&#8221; context before jumping into Firefox, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop, or the phone for a fuller integration test and a manual run-through. In fact, the unit testing framework even watches for file changes and will re-run tests right after a save, complete with a Growl notification of pass/fail.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Room_for_improvement\">Room for improvement</span>\r\n\r\nSlowly but surely, I&#8217;ve gotten my minigun barrel spun up to start firing [piles of lead bullets][22] at Gaia bugs. But, it has been and continues to be a challenge. I&#8217;m hard-pressed to recommend it as a fun-time leisure project to anyone without a <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a> paycheck, or even as an off-hours interest for those who live-and-breathe Firefox. This is to be expected, since it&#8217;s not even a v1.0 project yet &#8211; but, I really, really hope things improve in the not-so-distant future.\r\n\r\n*   We need to make sure that new contributors can get quickly from cloning the source to running the code. And it should *always* work &#8211; as in big, noisy automated tests fail when it breaks. I don&#8217;t care if it works fine on the phone if I can&#8217;t hack on it, at least from a contributor perspective. \r\n*   We need a consistent and convenient development environment for Gaia. All day, I bounce between things that are partly broken in Firefox, partly broken in <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"B2G\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">B2G</a> Desktop, and mostly working on the phone. This kills productivity and enthusiasm, all day. And, many times, no one else in the [#gaia channel on IRC][23] knows what I&#8217;m on about when I say something&#8217;s broken &#8211; because everyone&#8217;s dev environment is a unique little snowflake. \r\n*   My ideal workflow would never leave Firefox and my editor: Consider it a variant of the Responsive Design View, and ensure all the various APIs expected on a real phone are either working properly, polyfilled, or usefully stubbed out. Then, when it&#8217;s perfect in my most comfy environment, I can try it on a phone or standalone simulator as an afterthought. The [upcoming built-in Firefox OS Simulator][24] (née [r2d2b2g][25]) looks promising, but it needs to be seamless. \r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Still_digging\">Still digging</span>\r\n\r\nEven with the challenges, and even if my contributions are small, I&#8217;m happy to have the opportunity to work on FirefoxOS. It&#8217;s a big deal; it&#8217;s the next Firefox. So, I plan to keep ramming my head against this stuff to help make it better, and I hope we can start taking time to make making it better better, too!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/17/on-the-other-end-of-a-self-imposed-death-march-project#p[BInCtb]\r\n [2]: http://www.mozilla.org/firefoxos/\r\n [3]: http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/\r\n [4]: https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia\r\n [5]: https://developer.mozilla.org/\r\n [6]: http://blog.margaretleibovic.com/post/32836884540/challenges-getting-started-with-gaia\r\n [7]: http://bluesock.org/~willg/blog/gaia/gaia_onboarding.html\r\n [8]: http://schalk-neethling.com/2012/10/debugging-b2g-desktop-blank-screen-on-launch-gaia/\r\n [9]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS\r\n [10]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gaia/Hacking\r\n [11]: https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/B2G\r\n [12]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Gonk\r\n [13]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Gecko\r\n [14]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client#Building_the_desktop_client\r\n [15]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client#Download_a_nightly_build\r\n [16]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gaia/Hacking#Nightly_Builds\r\n [17]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client#Running_the_desktop_client\r\n [18]: https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/commit/9f0129c7a5f04d58bbbe140de2b9562e3172d23c\r\n [19]: https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/tree/master/apps/calendar\r\n [20]: https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/commits?author=lmorchard\r\n [21]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Gaia_Unit_Tests\r\n [22]: http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/25/lead-bullets/\r\n [23]: irc://irc.mozilla.org/gaia\r\n [24]: http://www.blueskyonmars.com/2012/11/08/r2d2b2g-is-becoming-the-firefox-os-simulator/\r\n [25]: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/10/r2d2b2g-an-experimental-prototype-firefox-os-test-environment/",

One might ask the guests&#8217; opinion about the bonfire &#8211; but that&#8217;s just being a gracious host.\r\n\r\nA better scenario might be if the homeowner decided to start filming a reality show. Still, I think you agreed to a release at the door. It might have even been printed the plastic cups, and drinking the beer sealed the deal. That release covered this contingency, no matter how intuitively distasteful it seems. (Sounds shady to me, but then so do terms of service pages.)\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"The_cake_eating_vs_having_it\">The cake: eating vs having it</span>\r\n\r\nYou can&#8217;t both pay to party by supplying your content and then later claim ownership of the payment. You ate the cake; you can&#8217;t take it home after. You can express your feelings of stomach ache (which is also content), but the lesson here is Facebook never was and never will be a private space. There might have been perceived partitions at one point, but those partitions can move whenever the homeowners want.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Where_to_go_from_here\">Where to go from here</span>\r\n\r\nAs I see it, you have three options:\r\n\r\n1.  Pay to create your own private social spaces on the web. That, at least, [makes you the customer][9].\r\n2.  Accept Facebook for what it is: A party in a stranger&#8217;s backyard, at which you are both a guest and [the product on sale][9].\r\n3.  Lobby your lawmakers to outlaw what Facebook does with your content. Good luck.\r\n\r\nI&#8217;m willing to bet #1 and #2 are cheaper and much more practical than #3.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/24/freedom-of-from-choice#p[Dygtcp]\r\n [2]: http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/yes-facebook-this-was-a-privacy-bungle-heres-what-you-shouldve-done.php#comment-667692804\r\n [3]: http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/yes-facebook-this-was-a-privacy-bungle-heres-what-you-shouldve-done.php\r\n [4]: http://www.readwriteweb.com/\r\n [5]: http://video.adultswim.com/robot-chicken/this-deals-getting-worse-all-the-time.html\r\n [6]: http://tos-dr.info/\r\n [7]: http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/21/sponsored-stories-lawsuit/\r\n [8]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre#.22Free_beer.22_vs_.22free_speech.22_distinction\r\n [9]: http://www.metafilter.com/95152/Userdriven-discontent#3256046",

These restaurants have <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=tasting+menu\">tasting menus</a> with wine pairings. This is dinner on cruise control, and we let the chef drive. It&#8217;s great when it works, because the chef makes expert choices.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, it doesn&#8217;t work. There might be something we don&#8217;t like: Rabbit are pets, for instance. We&#8217;re not fans of seafood, though some menus have surprised us. We also have food allergies. Usually—though not always—we can ask for a substitution. Otherwise, we chalk it up to adventure.</p>\n<p>But, overall, ordering from the tasting menu and trying the wine pairings makes date night simple with a side of novelty. It&#8217;s on the high end of freedom from choice. We choose to go out, and we choose the restaurant, but we leave the rest to experts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"suds-and-swine\"><span id=\"Suds_and_swine\">Suds and swine</span></h2>\n<p>On the other end of things, I like to make homebrew—<a href=\"http://www.alphadictionary.com/goodword/word/zymurgy\">zymurgy</a>, not software. There&#8217;s a spectrum of choice to be had here, too. But, even with <a href=\"https://www.homebrewing.org/2-Hearted-Clone_p_518.html\">a kit</a>, the process is much more involved than just ordering a pint. I also have <a href=\"http://rogueestate.com/\">friends who are great cooks</a>. When we all get together, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/k1ds3ns4t10n/6114071558/\">it&#8217;s a party</a>.</p>\n<p>But, that party is <em>about</em> the food and drink, about sharing the process and the product. It&#8217;s not a simple date night: The choices are the focus as much as the participants. It&#8217;s a chance to show off and try new things, become experts ourselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"power-and-ease-of-use\"><span id=\"Power_and_ease_of_use\">Power and ease of use</span></h2>\n<p>Where am I going with this? Well, <a href=\"http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/todaysPodcast\">Dave Winer said this in a podcast</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In software, the tricky parts are where the power comes from, and the ease of use comes from where you limit the amount of options. The more limited the options, the easier it is, but the less powerful it is. It&#8217;s just an engineering tradeoff there. It&#8217;s like the tradeoff between heat and motion in physics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The folks at Apple are masters of tasting menus and wine pairings when it comes to consumer electronics. You pick Apple because you don&#8217;t want to think about most of the choices. They have experts in various forms of design, and their products are elegant, beautiful, and generally work great together. It&#8217;s blindingly obvious from their bank balance that this is something people are more than happy to pay for.</p>\n<p>Why? Because you have better things to do with your time than to futz with impedance mismatches and arcane interfaces. You know, like do the things for which you bought the gadgets in the first place (eg. work, play, communicate, etc).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, you have something like the Linux ecosystem. Therein, many others have made choices for you. But, all the choices are still open to you—and many <em>must</em> be made by you. The result is kind of a mess at times, with little or no top-down unifying vision. But, the grit and the loose coupling between the parts are the stuff of freedom. Freedom of choice is dirty and complex, especially when lots of players are involved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"choose-not-to-decide-or-diy\"><span id=\"Choose_not_to_decide_or_DIY\">Choose not to decide, or DIY</span></h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=OnxkfLe4G74#t=70s\">If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice</a>—you&#8217;ve just chosen to let an expert make most of the choices for you.</p>\n<p>What happens when disagree with some of those choices? If you&#8217;re lucky, you can ask for substitutions (or tweak some options). But, you might have to go to a different restaurant (ie. another manufacturer). If you&#8217;re really unlucky, you&#8217;ll find that you disagree with <em>almost all of the restaurants and manufacturers</em>. Sometimes, we just grin and bear it, because switching is too inconvenient.</p>\n<p>And beyond switching, do-it-yourself is just plain hard. You can crawl up the spectrum toward greater freedom-of-choice—but that demands greater knowledge, skill, and attention. You have to discover the choices, make them, and then track what you&#8217;ve done. In fact, it rises to the level of a <em>hobby</em> at a certain point, and you spend as much time (or more) on the infrastructure as the things it&#8217;s there to support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sharpen-the-saw\"><span id=\"Sharpen_the_saw\">Sharpen the saw</span></h2>\n<p>Here, I guess, it&#8217;s a personal decision: How much time are you willing to spend on the devices through which you do your thinking? Because, that&#8217;s what computers, tablets, smartphones, and software are: They&#8217;re <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/out-of-our-brains/\">cognitive prosthetics</a>, addons to your brain that expand your capabilities to think, remember, and communicate. How comfortable are you with the choices made by your chosen experts in shaping the patterns of your mind?</p>\n<p>Me, I&#8217;ve been a hobbyist in this field since very shortly after I learned how to read. My take on the power / ease-of-use spectrum was best put by Doug Engelbart, who asked &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.dougengelbart.org/history/pix.html#6a\">Would you rather ride a tricycle or a bicycle to get across town?</a>&#8221; I&#8217;d rather have the freedom to program and recombine (and crash and twist my ankle), than take on an extra stabilizing wheel or slow down.</p>\n<p>But, even if you&#8217;re not willing to rise to the level of cognitive prosthetics hobbyist, think about <a href=\"https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits-habit7.php\">sharpening the saw</a>. Have you ever tried meditation? Written a journal? Taken training? Practiced a skill? Have you ever taken a critical look at the technology in your life and considered how it&#8217;s serving you and your mind? It&#8217;s all in the same category, to me. It&#8217;s an effort, and it takes time—but it&#8217;s self-investment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"food-for-thought\"><span id=\"Food_for_thought\">Food for thought</span></h2>\n<p>In my head, earlier versions of this were more judgmental: <em>Holy crap how can so many people be so passive about the technology in their lives</em>?</p>\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s obvious: <em>People don&#8217;t have time for this crap. You&#8217;re the weirdo who&#8217;s been doing it almost since birth.</em></p>\n<p>Still, just like attention to diet and exercise (of which I need more, myself), I think intentional use of technology is crucial. Take stock of your choices and freedoms. Be mindful of where you are on the freedom-of / freedom-from spectrum.</p>\n<p>Do your gadgets and services make you more free and capable in ways about which you care? Have you given up things you&#8217;d rather not have given up (eg. time, cost, privacy, flexibility, lock-in, reliability, longevity)? Do you trust what your chosen experts are doing for you, are they working for your interests?</p>\n<p>Of course, in my personal life, it&#8217;s a hobby. And it&#8217;s my job. And I spend way more time on mindful technology than I should, versus mindful eating and living. <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/17/on-the-other-end-of-a-self-imposed-death-march-project\">Like I said</a>, I need to work on that. But, hopefully, I&#8217;ve managed to lay out some ideas in this post about freedom, choice, and technology without coming off as a total angry nerd.</p>\n",

It&#8217;s an effort, and it takes time—but it&#8217;s self-investment.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"Food_for_thought\">Food for thought</span>\r\n\r\nIn my head, earlier versions of this were more judgmental: *Holy crap how can so many people be so passive about the technology in their lives*?\r\n\r\nOf course, it&#8217;s obvious: *People don&#8217;t have time for this crap. You&#8217;re the weirdo who&#8217;s been doing it almost since birth.*\r\n\r\nStill, just like attention to diet and exercise (of which I need more, myself), I think intentional use of technology is crucial. Take stock of your choices and freedoms. Be mindful of where you are on the freedom-of / freedom-from spectrum.\r\n\r\nDo your gadgets and services make you more free and capable in ways about which you care? Have you given up things you&#8217;d rather not have given up (eg. time, cost, privacy, flexibility, lock-in, reliability, longevity)? Do you trust what your chosen experts are doing for you, are they working for your interests?\r\n\r\nOf course, in my personal life, it&#8217;s a hobby. And it&#8217;s my job. And I spend way more time on mindful technology than I should, versus mindful eating and living. [Like I said][11], I need to work on that. But, hopefully, I&#8217;ve managed to lay out some ideas in this post about freedom, choice, and technology without coming off as a total angry nerd.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://www.google.com/search?q=tasting+menu\r\n [2]: http://www.alphadictionary.com/goodword/word/zymurgy\r\n [3]: https://www.homebrewing.org/2-Hearted-Clone_p_518.html\r\n [4]: http://rogueestate.com/\r\n [5]: http://www.flickr.com/photos/k1ds3ns4t10n/6114071558/\r\n [6]: http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/todaysPodcast\r\n [7]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=OnxkfLe4G74#t=70s\r\n [8]: http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/out-of-our-brains/\r\n [9]: http://www.dougengelbart.org/history/pix.html#6a\r\n [10]: https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits-habit7.php\r\n [11]: http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/17/on-the-other-end-of-a-self-imposed-death-march-project",

The <em>very</em> first thing is to create a new <a href=\"http://github.com/lmorchard\">github.com</a> repo (complete with <code>README.md</code> and <code>.gitignore</code>) and then:</p>\n<pre><code>cd ~/Dropbox/Public/\ngit clone git@github.com:lmorchard/my-project.git\ncd my-project</code></pre>\n<p>And <em>then</em>, I start thinking about getting it onto the web.</p>\n<p>That might sound backward: If all I have is a <code>README</code>, aren&#8217;t I jumping the gun? Well, no—I like to iterate, especially when experimenting with something new. Start simple, try one little thing, repeat. And, because this is a new pan-device world we&#8217;re living in, I&#8217;m often sitting on my couch hacking with a laptop in front, tablet to the left, and phone to the right.</p>\n<p>So, before I even write the first line of &#8220;Hello world&#8221; in <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML</a>, I want to have a way to get at it from all the gadgets. If it were just my laptop, I could open a <code>file://</code> URL and be done with it. Oh, but not really: Many of the new <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML5\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/html5?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML5</a>-and-friends technologies depend on things like domain origins and real HTTP connections.</p>\n<p>I could <a href=\"http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/tech-tip-really-simple-http-server-python\">start up a disposable HTTP server in the project directory</a> on my laptop and point the other gadgets at that.

But, that&#8217;s limited to my LAN, I can&#8217;t share it with others for quick alpha testing, and I can&#8217;t check it out when I&#8217;m away from home and the laptop is closed.</p>\n<p>That leaves me with my own web server. But, you know, that&#8217;s a pain in the butt and I&#8217;m getting tired of being sysadmin to my own server. Let&#8217;s take it to the cloud!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-i-abuse-github-pages\"><span id=\"How_I_abuse_Github_Pages\">How I (ab)use Github Pages</span></h2>\n<p>Since I started with GitHub, <em>my project is already on the web</em>. Or, mostly it is, but just not exactly how I&#8217;d like it. To get the project published at a URL, this is what I do:</p>\n<pre><code>git co -b gh-pages\ngit push origin gh-pages\ngit co master</code></pre>\n<p>Give it a few, and you&#8217;ll receive an email from <a href=\"http://pages.github.com/\">Github Pages</a> (re: <code>[my-project] Page build successful</code>). Give it a few more, since this is the first time for the project. Shortly, the <code>README</code> shows up at an URL like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>http://lmorchard.github.com/my-project/README.md</code></pre>\n<p>After that, whenever I want to publish updates to the app, this is what I do:</p>\n<pre><code>git co gh-pages\ngit rebase master\ngit push origin gh-pages\ngit co master</code></pre>\n<p>And, within seconds (usually), my app is updated on the web. With free hosting, because the folks at GitHub are really nice.</p>\n<p>But, though this works nicely for an app demo or beta, try not to abuse their hospitality by using your <a href=\"http://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> URL as the official distribution point for your app.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-i-abuse-dropbox\"><span id=\"How_I_abuse_Dropbox\">How I (ab)use Dropbox</span></h2>\n<p>You know, all that committing and pushing and rebasing can really get tiresome. And, it craps up my commit history while I&#8217;m just kind of twiddling some bits back and forth to see what happens. We&#8217;re living in the future, damn it, I don&#8217;t have to put up with this!</p>\n<p>And, so, I don&#8217;t. Maybe you noticed that I ran <code>git clone</code> from inside my <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/help/16/en\">Dropbox Public folder</a>. Anything in that folder <em>is already on the web</em>: Each file has a public URL, and I can acquire it with a right-click in Finder (ie. Dropbox &gt; Copy Public Link). The result is something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>https://dl.dropbox.com/u/279855/my-project/README.md</code></pre>\n<p>It&#8217;s a crufty URL, but an URL nonetheless. Dropbox public links also mirror the folder structure, so that an <code>index.html</code> can load all the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"CSS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">CSS</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> it wants from relative URLs just like a normal web host.</p>\n<p>With Dropbox, then, my hacking cycle with Dropbox looks like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Save in MacVim</li>\n<li>Switch to Firefox</li>\n<li>Refresh</li>\n<li>Repeat</li>\n</ol>\n<p>More often than not, my app has gotten updated on the Dropbox servers somewhere between steps #1 and #3. That&#8217;s a much tighter iteration loop than doing the GitHub dance. In fact, it&#8217;s pretty much indistinguishable from just working on my laptop with <code>file://</code> URLs or a disposable HTTP server on my LAN.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s some bad news, though. I&#8217;ve just read that <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/help/16/en\">new accounts created after 7/31/2012 no longer get a Public folder</a>. So, it would seem that the days of carefree hosting-by-Public-folder are on the way out. But fret not: the folks at Dropbox have <a href=\"https://tech.dropbox.com/?p=345\">provided an alternative for hosting static web apps under development</a>. They&#8217;ve also opened up their API for use by open <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"web apps\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Apps?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">web apps</a> with <a href=\"https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js\">dropbox-js</a>. In fact, this API will play a part in the app about which I plan to blog.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-i-use-amazon-s3\"><span id=\"How_I_use_Amazon_S3\">How I use Amazon S3</span></h2>\n<p>So, (ab)using GitHub and Dropbox for hosting your app under development is fine and dandy. But, you definitely don&#8217;t want to rely on them for publishing your app for wider distribution. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch\">There ain&#8217;t no such thing as a free lunch</a> (TANSTAAFL), and someone&#8217;s bound to shut you down or send you a bill—best to get that out of the way up front.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services</a> will happily accept <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/\">the change from your penny jar</a> to serve up small collections of web content. Well, they will after you&#8217;ve turned the physical pennies into numbers in a bank account, but my point is that Amazon S3 is *<a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/\">super cheap</a>*. And, since I&#8217;m talking about a single-page web app here, <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2011/02/17/Amazon-S3-Website-Features/\">plain old static web hosting</a> is all you need for now.</p>\n<p>In fact, if you own a domain name, you can control the URL from which S3 serves up your content. Basically, you just:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>create a DNS record with a CNAME to S3 (eg. <code>my-project.lmorchard.com</code> -&gt; <code>s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code>);</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home\">create a bucket named for your domain</a> (eg. <code>my-project.lmorchard.com</code>);</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/02/host-your-static-website-on-amazon-s3.html\">check a box in the properties panel to enable static hosting</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The above is vaguely more advanced than either GitHub or Dropbox, but this is playing with power. And, with great power comes great responsibility to read the fine manual. Still, it&#8217;s not that hard and it&#8217;s not that spendy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-i-make-amazon-s3-work-like-dropbox\"><span id=\"How_I_make_Amazon_S3_work_like_Dropbox\">How I make Amazon S3 work like Dropbox</span></h3>\n<p>So, great: You&#8217;ve got Amazon S3 serving content at a URL of your choice. And, you can upload content using the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home\">control panel</a> or one of the many fine desktop clients available. But, that sounds a bit like the GitHub deployment dance, just GUI-er. Not bad for Official Releases of your app—but what a pain for development!</p>\n<p>Apropos of that, I have a small trick on OS X that makes Amazon S3 as convenient as Dropbox:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Install <a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/kicker\">kicker</a>;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Install <a href=\"http://s3tools.org/s3cmd\">s3cmd</a> and configure it with your S3 credentials;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Run <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/notational-vapor/blob/master/s3-sync.sh\">this</a> from your project directory in a terminal: \nkicker -c -e &#8216;s3cmd -vfrP &#8211;exclude=&#8221;<em>swp&#8221; &#8211;exclude=&#8221;.git</em>&#8221; sync . s3://my-project.lmorchard.com/&#8217;</li> </ul> \nWhat this does is start <code>kicker</code> to monitor your files. Whenever anything changes, <code>s3cmd</code> uploads the changes to Amazon S3. After the first run, my content shows up at an URL like:</p>\n<pre><code>http://my-project.lmorchard.com/README.md</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, again, my hacking cycle with Amazon S3 looks like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Save changes</li>\n<li>Switch to browser</li>\n<li>Refresh</li>\n<li>Repeat</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Again, this turns out to be nearly indistinguishable from working on <code>localhost</code> or with <code>file://</code> URLs, because the kicker-s3cmd team has generally already shipped off my changes before I can get to the browser. I&#8217;m sure something similar to the above can be cobbled together on Linux or Windows, but I don&#8217;t work there so I&#8217;ve not bothered to figure it out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"in-conclusion\"><span id=\"In_conclusion\">In conclusion</span></h2>\n<p>Developing open <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"web apps\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Apps?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">web apps</a> on the open web can be fun, fast, cheap, and convenient. I&#8217;ve got more posts forthcoming, at least in my head, but hopefully this one gives some starting points.</p>\n<p>I may also revise and further develop this post, since I left quite a bit of reading to the reader with links to follow. There are also even more cheap and easy web hosts, so maybe I&#8217;ll explore those as well. In the meantime, feel free to leave some comments!</p>\n",

Dropbox public links also mirror the folder structure, so that an `index.html` can load all the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"CSS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">CSS</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JS\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">JS</a> it wants from relative URLs just like a normal web host.\r\n\r\nWith Dropbox, then, my hacking cycle with Dropbox looks like this:\r\n\r\n1.  Save in MacVim\r\n2.  Switch to Firefox\r\n3.  Refresh\r\n4.  Repeat\r\n\r\nMore often than not, my app has gotten updated on the Dropbox servers somewhere between steps #1 and #3. That&#8217;s a much tighter iteration loop than doing the GitHub dance. In fact, it&#8217;s pretty much indistinguishable from just working on my laptop with `file://` URLs or a disposable HTTP server on my LAN.\r\n\r\nThere&#8217;s some bad news, though. I&#8217;ve just read that [new accounts created after 7/31/2012 no longer get a Public folder][8]. So, it would seem that the days of carefree hosting-by-Public-folder are on the way out. But fret not: the folks at Dropbox have [provided an alternative for hosting static web apps under development][9]. They&#8217;ve also opened up their API for use by open <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"web apps\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Apps?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">web apps</a> with [dropbox-js][10]. In fact, this API will play a part in the app about which I plan to blog.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"How_I_use_Amazon_S3\">How I use Amazon S3</span>\r\n\r\nSo, (ab)using GitHub and Dropbox for hosting your app under development is fine and dandy. But, you definitely don&#8217;t want to rely on them for publishing your app for wider distribution. [There ain&#8217;t no such thing as a free lunch][11] (TANSTAAFL), and someone&#8217;s bound to shut you down or send you a bill—best to get that out of the way up front.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, [Amazon Web Services][12] will happily accept [the change from your penny jar][13] to serve up small collections of web content. Well, they will after you&#8217;ve turned the physical pennies into numbers in a bank account, but my point is that Amazon S3 is *[super cheap][13]*. And, since I&#8217;m talking about a single-page web app here, [plain old static web hosting][14] is all you need for now.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if you own a domain name, you can control the URL from which S3 serves up your content. Basically, you just:\r\n\r\n1.  create a DNS record with a CNAME to S3 (eg. `my-project.lmorchard.com` -> `s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`);\r\n2.  [create a bucket named for your domain][15] (eg. `my-project.lmorchard.com`);\r\n3.  [check a box in the properties panel to enable static hosting][16].\r\n\r\nThe above is vaguely more advanced than either GitHub or Dropbox, but this is playing with power. And, with great power comes great responsibility to read the fine manual. Still, it&#8217;s not that hard and it&#8217;s not that spendy.\r\n\r\n### <span id=\"How_I_make_Amazon_S3_work_like_Dropbox\">How I make Amazon S3 work like Dropbox</span>\r\n\r\nSo, great: You&#8217;ve got Amazon S3 serving content at a URL of your choice. And, you can upload content using the [control panel][15] or one of the many fine desktop clients available. But, that sounds a bit like the GitHub deployment dance, just GUI-er. Not bad for Official Releases of your app—but what a pain for development!\r\n\r\nApropos of that, I have a small trick on OS X that makes Amazon S3 as convenient as Dropbox:\r\n\r\n*   Install [kicker][17];\r\n*   Install [s3cmd][18] and configure it with your S3 credentials;\r\n*   Run [this][19] from your project directory in a terminal: \r\n    kicker -c -e &#8216;s3cmd -vfrP &#8211;exclude=&#8221;*swp&#8221; &#8211;exclude=&#8221;.git*&#8221; sync . s3://my-project.lmorchard.com/&#8217;</li> </ul> \r\n    What this does is start `kicker` to monitor your files. Whenever anything changes, `s3cmd` uploads the changes to Amazon S3. After the first run, my content shows up at an URL like:\r\n    \r\n        http://my-project.lmorchard.com/README.md\r\n\r\nSo, again, my hacking cycle with Amazon S3 looks like this:\r\n\r\n1.  Save changes\r\n2.  Switch to browser\r\n3.  Refresh\r\n4.  Repeat\r\n\r\nAgain, this turns out to be nearly indistinguishable from working on `localhost` or with `file://` URLs, because the kicker-s3cmd team has generally already shipped off my changes before I can get to the browser. I&#8217;m sure something similar to the above can be cobbled together on Linux or Windows, but I don&#8217;t work there so I&#8217;ve not bothered to figure it out.\r\n\r\n## <span id=\"In_conclusion\">In conclusion</span>\r\n\r\nDeveloping open <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"web apps\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Apps?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">web apps</a> on the open web can be fun, fast, cheap, and convenient. I&#8217;ve got more posts forthcoming, at least in my head, but hopefully this one gives some starting points.\r\n\r\nI may also revise and further develop this post, since I left quite a bit of reading to the reader with links to follow. There are also even more cheap and easy web hosts, so maybe I&#8217;ll explore those as well.

Instead, I&#8217;d rather they focused on making it easier for me, their paying customer, to get to connect where I want and stay out of my way.</p>\n<p>Mobile ISPs tend to mean cell phone carriers. Since they subsidize devices here in the US, they&#8217;re always looking for new ways to make up that cost. So, it&#8217;s in their interest to &#8220;add value&#8221; rather than just get out of my way.</p>\n<p>Granted, I haven&#8217;t had much issue at all with Sprint, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been loyal to them for over 10 years. They could turn evil and value-addy at any minute, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/08/technology/sprint_earnings/index.htm?iid=EL\">especially since they broke the bank to get the iPhone</a>, but they&#8217;ve been good to me so far. (Although, I <em>do</em> miss that <a href=\"http://community.sprint.com/baw/community/sprintblogs/blog/2011/09/15/sprint-discontinuing-sprint-premier\">Sprint Premier program they started and then couldn&#8217;t afford any more</a>. I just hope that <a href=\"http://www.brighthand.com/default.asp?newsID=17990&amp;news=Sprint+Unlimited+Data\">unlimited data isn&#8217;t next</a>.)</p>\n<p>In other news, I just activated a Chromebook on Verizon&#8217;s network. There are pay-as-you-go options for when the 100MB free per month runs out. Seems pricier than I&#8217;d like, but that&#8217;s living in the USA (see also: device subsidies). But, the logistics of that sign-up process were pretty much what I wanted: Get a device, not from a carrier and not under contract, and just hook it up to a dumb pipe.</p>\n<p>Of course, Verizon just recently asserted that the pipe I&#8217;m paying for is <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/07/verizon-net-neutrality-violates-our-free-speech-rights/\">their microphone and platform for free speech</a>. So, I didn&#8217;t just hook up to a dumb pipe &#8211; I hooked up to an insidiously intelligent pipe with an agenda. It will probably be at cross purposes with me, a paying customer, at some point in the future.</p>\n<p>Really, I&#8217;d just like grown-up internet at my house and in my pocket. I give you money, and you give me bandwidth. Beyond that, let&#8217;s not bother each other. There are options, here, but they tend to approach $1000&#8217;s per month. And, as far as I can tell, they don&#8217;t perform nearly as well as the kid-stuff alternatives.</p>\n<p>You know, we have dumb roads here: They let any vehicles across as long as they&#8217;re not too wide, and not so heavy that they bust up the pavement. They don&#8217;t generally charge more for certain kinds of vehicles, though I suppose that might be different on certain toll roads in the country. (We don&#8217;t really have those near where I live.) But, even then, they don&#8217;t charge differently for delivery trucks from one vendor vs another. They don&#8217;t make you use a certain kind of fuel, or tires from a specific company. They don&#8217;t give you an incentive to drive a Ford versus a Chevy.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m willing to bet that if all our roads were privatized &#8211; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market_roads\" title=\"If you really think private roads are the ideal, tell me how they&#39;d end up different than the bandwidth stagnation we have in the USA\">a free-marketeer&#8217;s fever dream</a> &#8211; we&#8217;d have all the above in full effect.</p>\n<p>But, I haven&#8217;t the foggiest idea how to change this situation. My way of life generally depends on plentiful bandwidth, so a boycott is generally impractical because I&#8217;d pretty much have to abstain from using the entire industry. If the roads were in this shape, it&#8217;s not like I could just decide not to drive anywhere. So, government intervention seems like the only feasible way to go &#8211; get someone with a bigger stick, who ostensibly represents my interests better than the carriers, to make things change.</p>\n<p>Of course, that&#8217;s imperfect, because the people who should represent me seem more often than not to represent <em>their</em> paying customers. And, oddly enough, those customers often happen to be who <em>I&#8217;m</em> paying for a service. That&#8217;s just screwed up.</p>\n",

So, it&#8217;s in their interest to &#8220;add value&#8221; rather than just get out of my way.\r\n\r\nGranted, I haven&#8217;t had much issue at all with Sprint, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been loyal to them for over 10 years. They could turn evil and value-addy at any minute, [especially since they broke the bank to get the iPhone][2], but they&#8217;ve been good to me so far. (Although, I *do* miss that [Sprint Premier program they started and then couldn&#8217;t afford any more][3]. I just hope that [unlimited data isn&#8217;t next][4].)\r\n\r\nIn other news, I just activated a Chromebook on Verizon&#8217;s network. There are pay-as-you-go options for when the 100MB free per month runs out. Seems pricier than I&#8217;d like, but that&#8217;s living in the USA (see also: device subsidies). But, the logistics of that sign-up process were pretty much what I wanted: Get a device, not from a carrier and not under contract, and just hook it up to a dumb pipe.\r\n\r\nOf course, Verizon just recently asserted that the pipe I&#8217;m paying for is [their microphone and platform for free speech][5]. So, I didn&#8217;t just hook up to a dumb pipe &#8211; I hooked up to an insidiously intelligent pipe with an agenda. It will probably be at cross purposes with me, a paying customer, at some point in the future.\r\n\r\nReally, I&#8217;d just like grown-up internet at my house and in my pocket. I give you money, and you give me bandwidth. Beyond that, let&#8217;s not bother each other. There are options, here, but they tend to approach $1000&#8217;s per month. And, as far as I can tell, they don&#8217;t perform nearly as well as the kid-stuff alternatives.\r\n\r\nYou know, we have dumb roads here: They let any vehicles across as long as they&#8217;re not too wide, and not so heavy that they bust up the pavement. They don&#8217;t generally charge more for certain kinds of vehicles, though I suppose that might be different on certain toll roads in the country. (We don&#8217;t really have those near where I live.) But, even then, they don&#8217;t charge differently for delivery trucks from one vendor vs another. They don&#8217;t make you use a certain kind of fuel, or tires from a specific company. They don&#8217;t give you an incentive to drive a Ford versus a Chevy.\r\n\r\nI&#8217;m willing to bet that if all our roads were privatized &#8211; [a free-marketeer&#8217;s fever dream][6] &#8211; we&#8217;d have all the above in full effect.\r\n\r\nBut, I haven&#8217;t the foggiest idea how to change this situation. My way of life generally depends on plentiful bandwidth, so a boycott is generally impractical because I&#8217;d pretty much have to abstain from using the entire industry. If the roads were in this shape, it&#8217;s not like I could just decide not to drive anywhere. So, government intervention seems like the only feasible way to go &#8211; get someone with a bigger stick, who ostensibly represents my interests better than the carriers, to make things change.\r\n\r\nOf course, that&#8217;s imperfect, because the people who should represent me seem more often than not to represent *their* paying customers. And, oddly enough, those customers often happen to be who *I&#8217;m* paying for a service. That&#8217;s just screwed up.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/17/entertainment/la-et-ct-comcast-netflix-20120517\r\n [2]: http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/08/technology/sprint_earnings/index.htm?iid=EL\r\n [3]: http://community.sprint.com/baw/community/sprintblogs/blog/2011/09/15/sprint-discontinuing-sprint-premier\r\n [4]: http://www.brighthand.com/default.asp?newsID=17990&news=Sprint+Unlimited+Data\r\n [5]: http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/07/verizon-net-neutrality-violates-our-free-speech-rights/\r\n [6]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market_roads \"If you really think private roads are the ideal, tell me how they'd end up different than the bandwidth stagnation we have in the USA\"",

    "html": "<p>So, I read about <a href=\"http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html\">Blogging Like a Hacker</a> a few years ago. It sounded like a neat idea. A little over a year ago, after much procrastination, I <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/06/08/moved-to-jekyll\">switched to Jekyll and Disqus</a> for blogging and comments.</p>\n<p>Well, guess what? Though the process was novel, I didn&#8217;t blog with any more frequency than I have over the past couple of years. I think I&#8217;ve discovered this about myself: I like <a href=\"https://github.com/lmorchard/\">hacking like a hacker</a>, and I might even like writing a book like a hacker using <a href=\"http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/\">AsciiDoc</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/schacon/git-scribe\">git-scribe</a>. But, those are things which tend to demand deliberation and attention to detail.</p>\n<p>But for blogging? Forget all that fuss. At least, not the way I want to blog. I usually want to spew things that are longer than a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/lmorchard\">tweet</a>, but shorter than a formal essay. I might iterate by reviewing &amp; revising a few times, because I can&#8217;t resist. But, then, I&#8217;ll move on.</p>\n<p>And, for that kind of writing, the process of using git &amp; jekyll just throws too much friction into my brain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have to create a text file with a filename of proper form,</li>\n<li>edit the text with whatever&#8217;s floating in my brain stew,</li>\n<li>start up jekyll for a preview, wait, <code>Ctrl-C</code> after a few minutes,</li>\n<li>make sure I don&#8217;t have my other 1001 posts in the way because generating things takes <em>ffoorreevveerr</em>. (Tools like <a href=\"http://markedapp.com/\">Marked</a> help here, quite a lot.) </li>\n<li>start up jekyll again and load the new post in a browser</li>\n<li>repeat a few times</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh, and then once I&#8217;m happy with the post, I get to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>compose a commit message, </li>\n<li>push to my web server and github for good measure</li>\n<li>wander off while a post-receive hook regenerates my site on my server</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And then, very recently, I decided to check out WordPress again. I almost forgot how stupidly quick &amp; simple it was to set up.

    "body": "So, I read about [Blogging Like a Hacker][1] a few years ago. It sounded like a neat idea. A little over a year ago, after much procrastination, I [switched to Jekyll and Disqus][2] for blogging and comments.\r\n\r\nWell, guess what? Though the process was novel, I didn&#8217;t blog with any more frequency than I have over the past couple of years. I think I&#8217;ve discovered this about myself: I like [hacking like a hacker][3], and I might even like writing a book like a hacker using [AsciiDoc][4] and [git-scribe][5]. But, those are things which tend to demand deliberation and attention to detail.\r\n\r\nBut for blogging? Forget all that fuss. At least, not the way I want to blog. I usually want to spew things that are longer than a [tweet][6], but shorter than a formal essay. I might iterate by reviewing & revising a few times, because I can&#8217;t resist. But, then, I&#8217;ll move on.\r\n\r\nAnd, for that kind of writing, the process of using git & jekyll just throws too much friction into my brain:\r\n\r\n*   I have to create a text file with a filename of proper form,\r\n*   edit the text with whatever&#8217;s floating in my brain stew,\r\n*   start up jekyll for a preview, wait, `Ctrl-C` after a few minutes,\r\n*   make sure I don&#8217;t have my other 1001 posts in the way because generating things takes *ffoorreevveerr*. (Tools like [Marked][7] help here, quite a lot.) \r\n*   start up jekyll again and load the new post in a browser\r\n*   repeat a few times\r\n\r\nOh, and then once I&#8217;m happy with the post, I get to:\r\n\r\n*   compose a commit message, \r\n*   push to my web server and github for good measure\r\n*   wander off while a post-receive hook regenerates my site on my server\r\n\r\nAnd then, very recently, I decided to check out WordPress again. I almost forgot how stupidly quick & simple it was to set up. Things like that make me want to hack PHP again.\r\n\r\nIn WordPress, my process is this:\r\n\r\n*   visit my blog in my browser, create a new post; \r\n*   go tappy-tappy like a monkey writing Shakespeare, watch the preview pane;\r\n*   hit publish\r\n\r\nIf I&#8217;m feeling frisky, I can update a few more times and also hit some buttons to light up Facebook and Twitter with my new brain vomit.\r\n\r\nIn my brain, this process makes it feel like so much less of a pain, lame as that might sound. And it&#8217;s still self-hosted. And I can still do weird things, if I even care about that anymore. Which I don&#8217;t, at least not [as much as I did back in 2002][8].\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, a pile of static <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">HTML</a> generated from text files kept in git is a great way to archive & mothball a site.

Please learn to code.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mita/2508770940/?ref=nf\" style=\"display: block; float: right; text-decoration: none; border: none; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; width: 310px;\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2001/2508770940_b88b955aaa.jpg\" style=\"width: 275px; border: 2px solid #ddd; padding: 1em; background: #fff;\" /></a></p>\n<p>I disagree with Jeff Atwood on <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html\">&quot;Please don&#39;t learn to code&quot;</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The &quot;everyone should learn to code&quot; movement isn&#39;t just wrong\nbecause it falsely equates coding with essential life skills like\nreading, writing, and math. I wish. It is wrong in so many other\nways. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact, I <em>do</em> regard coding as an essential modern skill. Yes,\n<a href=\"http://dmlcentral.net/blog/cathy-davidson/why-we-need-4th-r-reading-writing-arithmetic-algorithms\" title=\"Why We Need a 4th R: Reading, wRiting, aRithmetic, algoRithms\">right alongside reading, writing, and &#39;rithmatic</a>. At least\nthis part of <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html\">the post</a> had me nodding:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I suppose I can support learning a tiny bit about programming just\nso you can recognize what code is, and when code might be an\nappropriate way to approach a problem you have. But I can also\nrecognize plumbing problems when I see them without any particular\ntraining in the area.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"visible-pipes\">Visible pipes</h2>\n<p>Luckily, pipes are not as occult as code. If you go into a basement or\nopen the door under a sink, you can see them and follow where they go.\nThat&#39;s <em>some</em> training, albeit informal or self-directed. </p>\n<p>I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;d get exposed to code in the same way: View\nSource in a browser <em>used</em> to be a decent start on the web, <a href=\"http://saveviewsource.org/\">but\nthat&#39;s less helpful lately</a>. Code elsewhere has\ntypically been hard to get at, Open Source notwithstanding.</p>\n<p>Still, I&#39;d bet there are people in the world for whom running water\ncomes from <em>magic</em> and drains into <em>magic*.  Where *magic</em> means: &quot;I\nnever thought about it, never needed to, and am sometimes vaguely\nafraid of it.&quot;</p>\n<p>For that class of homeowner, <a href=\"http://www.gkdating.com/mad-men-lessons-three-men-and-a-sink/\" title=\"Mad Men Lessons: Three Men and a Sink\">the kitchen floods when the sink springs\na leak, until an expert arrives</a>. It&#39;s not the end of\nthe world, and plenty of people get by just fine like that. But, I\ncertainly wouldn&#39;t agree that &quot;<strong>Please don&#39;t learn about pipes</strong>&quot; is\ngood advice in general.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learning-by-doing\">Learning by doing</h2>\n<p>Admittedly, &quot;<strong>learn to plumb</strong>&quot; isn&#39;t the same as &quot;<strong>learn about\npipes</strong>&quot;. But, is there a difference between &quot;<strong>learn <em>to</em> code</strong>&quot; and\n&quot;<strong>learn <em>about</em> code</strong>&quot;? I don&#39;t think so. Like writing, code doesn&#39;t\nseem like a thing that&#39;s easy to learn <em>about</em> without <em>doing</em> it.</p>\n<p>When I write &quot;coder&quot;, I generally mean this: Someone who is capable of\nencoding his or her intent and decision process into a form that can\ndrive a CPU to perform tasks on his or her behalf.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s a very broad definition, but it implies a lot. First, you have\nto realize that <em>you</em> can make a CPU can do things on your\nbehalf--it&#39;s okay, you won&#39;t break it.

Yes,\r\n[right alongside reading, writing, and 'rithmatic][rithms]. At least\r\nthis part of [the post][dontcode] had me nodding:\r\n\r\n[rithms]: http://dmlcentral.net/blog/cathy-davidson/why-we-need-4th-r-reading-writing-arithmetic-algorithms \"Why We Need a 4th R: Reading, wRiting, aRithmetic, algoRithms\"\r\n\r\n> I suppose I can support learning a tiny bit about programming just\r\n> so you can recognize what code is, and when code might be an\r\n> appropriate way to approach a problem you have. But I can also\r\n> recognize plumbing problems when I see them without any particular\r\n> training in the area.\r\n\r\n## Visible pipes\r\n\r\nLuckily, pipes are not as occult as code. If you go into a basement or\r\nopen the door under a sink, you can see them and follow where they go.\r\nThat's *some* training, albeit informal or self-directed. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how you'd get exposed to code in the same way: View\r\nSource in a browser *used* to be a decent start on the web, [but\r\nthat's less helpful lately][saveviewsource]. Code elsewhere has\r\ntypically been hard to get at, Open Source notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n[saveviewsource]: http://saveviewsource.org/\r\n\r\nStill, I'd bet there are people in the world for whom running water\r\ncomes from *magic* and drains into *magic*.  Where *magic* means: \"I\r\nnever thought about it, never needed to, and am sometimes vaguely\r\nafraid of it.\"\r\n\r\nFor that class of homeowner, [the kitchen floods when the sink springs\r\na leak, until an expert arrives][madmen]. It's not the end of\r\nthe world, and plenty of people get by just fine like that. But, I\r\ncertainly wouldn't agree that \"**Please don't learn about pipes**\" is\r\ngood advice in general.\r\n\r\n[madmen]: http://www.gkdating.com/mad-men-lessons-three-men-and-a-sink/ \"Mad Men Lessons: Three Men and a Sink\"\r\n\r\n## Learning by doing\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, \"**learn to plumb**\" isn't the same as \"**learn about\r\npipes**\". But, is there a difference between \"**learn *to* code**\" and\r\n\"**learn *about* code**\"? I don't think so. Like writing, code doesn't\r\nseem like a thing that's easy to learn *about* without *doing* it.\r\n\r\nWhen I write \"coder\", I generally mean this: Someone who is capable of\r\nencoding his or her intent and decision process into a form that can\r\ndrive a CPU to perform tasks on his or her behalf.\r\n\r\nThat's a very broad definition, but it implies a lot. First, you have\r\nto realize that *you* can make a CPU can do things on your\r\nbehalf--it's okay, you won't break it. It's a tool made by\r\nhumans and you as a human can understand it. Then, you need a notion\r\nof [algorithmic thinking][algothink], in order to formulate your\r\nintent and reasoning in a form that a CPU can execute. These are not\r\nnatural or intuitive things.\r\n\r\n[algothink]: http://rwxweb.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/teaching-algorithmic-thinking/\r\n\r\nI agree with that it's good to \"[recognize what code is, and when code\r\nmight be an appropriate way to approach a problem][dontcode]\".
