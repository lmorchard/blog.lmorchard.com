    He kicks back, alone at a corner table in low-g. He nurses a high gravity beer for the alcoholic irony. It’s his fourth, and the faces around him are blurred. Funny thing, though: with his glasses on, the faces would have been blurred even if he’d been sober.

    The spaceport bar is like a truck stop, circa last-century Earth: Most everyone is a pilot, in between arcs of long haul relativistic cargo flights. He’ll never see anyone from this crowd again – at least, not at mutually relevant life stages. In other words, that woman with the tinkling laugh at the bar will be all wrinkles or dead when he’s here next. Or, vice versa.
