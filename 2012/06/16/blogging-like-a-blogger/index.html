          <p>So, I read about <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">Blogging Like a Hacker</a> a few years ago. It sounded like a neat idea. A little over a year ago, after much procrastination, I <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2011/06/08/moved-to-jekyll">switched to Jekyll and Disqus</a> for blogging and comments.</p>
<p>Well, guess what? Though the process was novel, I didn&#8217;t blog with any more frequency than I have over the past couple of years. I think I&#8217;ve discovered this about myself: I like <a href="https://github.com/lmorchard/">hacking like a hacker</a>, and I might even like writing a book like a hacker using <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">AsciiDoc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/schacon/git-scribe">git-scribe</a>. But, those are things which tend to demand deliberation and attention to detail.</p>
<p>But for blogging? Forget all that fuss. At least, not the way I want to blog. I usually want to spew things that are longer than a <a href="http://twitter.com/lmorchard">tweet</a>, but shorter than a formal essay. I might iterate by reviewing &amp; revising a few times, because I can&#8217;t resist. But, then, I&#8217;ll move on.</p>
<p>And, for that kind of writing, the process of using git &amp; jekyll just throws too much friction into my brain:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have to create a text file with a filename of proper form,</li>
<li>edit the text with whatever&#8217;s floating in my brain stew,</li>
<li>start up jekyll for a preview, wait, <code>Ctrl-C</code> after a few minutes,</li>
<li>make sure I don&#8217;t have my other 1001 posts in the way because generating things takes <em>ffoorreevveerr</em>. (Tools like <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a> help here, quite a lot.) </li>
<li>start up jekyll again and load the new post in a browser</li>
<li>repeat a few times</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and then once I&#8217;m happy with the post, I get to:</p>
<ul>
<li>compose a commit message, </li>
<li>push to my web server and github for good measure</li>
<li>wander off while a post-receive hook regenerates my site on my server</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, very recently, I decided to check out WordPress again. I almost forgot how stupidly quick &amp; simple it was to set up. Things like that make me want to hack PHP again.</p>
<p>In WordPress, my process is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>visit my blog in my browser, create a new post; </li>
<li>go tappy-tappy like a monkey writing Shakespeare, watch the preview pane;</li>
<li>hit publish</li>
</ul>
<p>If I&#8217;m feeling frisky, I can update a few more times and also hit some buttons to light up Facebook and Twitter with my new brain vomit.</p>
<p>In my brain, this process makes it feel like so much less of a pain, lame as that might sound. And it&#8217;s still self-hosted. And I can still do weird things, if I even care about that anymore. Which I don&#8217;t, at least not <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/02/14/ooooab">as much as I did back in 2002</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, a pile of static <a target="_blank" title="HTML" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn">HTML</a> generated from text files kept in git is a great way to archive &amp; mothball a site. And, I&#8217;ve been wanting to do more things on <a href="http://lmorchard.com">http://lmorchard.com</a> &#8212; because <a href="http://decafbad.com">http://decafbad.com</a> isn&#8217;t my name, and there are surprisingly many decafbad&#8217;s on the net.</p>
<p>So, now&#8217;s as good a time as any. End of an era, and all that.</p>
<p>Oh, and also: WordPress is really easy to update, once I set up an FTP server. It scared me a little to try it the first time, but it just worked. And then it worked again. I never had to ssh into my server, just click buttons in my browser. And that&#8217;s about my speed when I&#8217;m in a lazy blogging state of mind.</p>
<p>Whew. This was a long post, given all I just said up there. So, I think it&#8217;s time to hit the publish button.</p>
