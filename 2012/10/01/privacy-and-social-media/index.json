Here&#8217;s What You Should&#8217;ve Done</a>, over on <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/\">ReadWriteWeb</a>. The post wraps up like so:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So this isn&#8217;t the fault of Facebook&#8217;s users. We knew what we were doing then, when we posted to our Walls. And we know what we&#8217;re doing now. The lesson here is that Facebook should have given us the option of selecting the privacy setting for those old Wall posts. Or maybe even made those old posts available to &#8220;Close Friends&#8221; only, as the default. Then we could adjust if we wished.</p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s mistake was that it had no right to assume that our &#8220;Friends&#8221; of 2007-09 means the same thing as &#8220;Friends&#8221; in 2012.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sorry, but no. The mistake was that <em>you</em> could assume many rights over content you&#8217;d submitted into Facebook&#8217;s ownership. If you had assumptions of rights or ownership, then in fact you <strong><em>did not know</em></strong> what you were doing then when you posted to your Walls, then or now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"darth-zuckerberg\"><span id=\"Darth_Zuckerberg\">Darth Zuckerberg?</span></h2>\n<p>Maybe this whole thing seems a bit Vader-ish. (ie. &#8220;<a href=\"http://video.adultswim.com/robot-chicken/this-deals-getting-worse-all-the-time.html\">I am altering the deal. Pray I don&#8217;t alter it any further.</a>&#8220;)</p>\n<p>But, even if your impression was that what you posted back then was &#8220;just between us&#8221; &#8211; the fact is that Facebook has always been well within their rights to alter the definition of &#8220;us&#8221; at any point they liked. I&#8217;d be amazed if the terms of service (<a href=\"http://tos-dr.info/\">which no one reads</a>, of course) didn&#8217;t give them plenty of room to do things just like this.</p>\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;m not a lawyer. But, I can imagine there are things companies put into terms of service that run afoul of actual laws. But, Facebook has lots of money, and that yields lots of incentive to look for legal exploits.</p>\n<p>And, accordingly, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/21/sponsored-stories-lawsuit/\">people have sued and won</a> where Facebook was vulnerable. But, I&#8217;m reasonably convinced that voluntarily posting your secrets to Facebook doesn&#8217;t come with a legal guarantee of privacy.
