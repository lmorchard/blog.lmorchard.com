And, I’m not, really. But, it turns out that <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/firefoxos/\">FirefoxOS</a> needs some help to reach its first release milestones. So, some of us <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/\">webdevs from around Mozilla</a> are temporarily switching our daily efforts over to slay bugs on <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia\">Gaia</a>. That’s the layer of <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/firefoxos/\">FirefoxOS</a> which provides the overall system UI and core apps.</p>\n",
