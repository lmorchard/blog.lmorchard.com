At <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a>, though, things have been getting steadily better and more interesting:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D18MCK/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004D18MCK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AvY4p2haL._SL160_.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0\" /></a></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s still the <em>sysadmin-as-remote-pair-of-hands-driven-by-trouble-tickets</em> thing going on, but less so every day. More and more, we&#8217;re getting into <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/MattBrandt/mozilla-continuous-deploment-on-sumo\">continuous deployment</a>. Our sysadmins are really smart cookies: They&#8217;re steadily replacing themselves with scripts of varying sizes. That way, they can get on to more interesting things. In fact, just recently, they gave us a great Big Red Button that deploys code from a git repository to the live site on demand. And, for some reason, I&#8217;m one of the people who got a key to it.</p>\n<p>Okay, maybe not <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D18MCK/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004D18MCK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20\"><em>that</em> exact button</a>, but ours is very keen. Of course, when it broke once, I felt like the Pakled on the right (and not Geordi):</p>\n<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'></span></p>\n<p>But, the Big Red Button hasn&#8217;t broken very often. So, I&#8217;d rather be a Pakled some of the time than pretend to be a rocket scientist all of the time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://octodex.github.com/\"><img src=\"http://octodex.github.com/images/twenty-percent-cooler-octocat.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: right; margin: 1em 0 1em 1em\" /></a> Oh yeah, and <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/\">we&#8217;re using GitHub a lot these days</a>. It&#8217;s crazypants awesome for collaboration, and it fits right in with our style because we want to do everything in the open anyway. We&#8217;ve even somehow lured people who don&#8217;t normally code into <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/commit/1a8038215a2c4bb7fba5ff098875d034704d79bd\">submitting Pull Requests</a>. And, it&#8217;s amazingly powerful to refer to specific lines of code and commits by URL in IRC or email.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://vagrantup.com/\"><img src=\"http://vagrantup.com/static/images/hippie.png\" style=\"width: 150px; float: left; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0\" /></a> I&#8217;ve also been getting a lot better at building development environments, <a href=\"http://opensourcebridge.org/wiki/2011/Inviting_Contributors_to_Open_Source_Webdev_through_Virtualization\">using Puppet and Vagrant</a> and Amazon EC2. I haven&#8217;t quite gotten to the point where I can borrow IT&#8217;s Puppet manifests directly &#8211; ie. those scripts with which sysadmins are replacing themselves.</p>\n<p>But, we are maintaining the recipes for spinning up dev servers right alongside the code. Our READMEs are shrinking, rather than growing &#8211; and yet we&#8217;re still adding more services and dependencies. I no longer really fear totally jack-knifing my dev rig, because I can just toss it and conjure up another in the time it takes me to run to lunch.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see, what else? I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll think of something. Until then, SHIP IT. (The post, I mean.)</p>\n"}
