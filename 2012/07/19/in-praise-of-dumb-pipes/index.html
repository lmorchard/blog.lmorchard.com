          <p>Something I&#8217;m having trouble finding these days is a dumb pipe. I just want a dumb pipe to the internet going to my house, and to the computer in my pocket. Let me give you money for bandwidth, and then <em>butt out</em>. <!--more--></p>
<p>Residential ISPs tend to mean cable companies. That, or telecoms who want to replace your cable company. It&#8217;s in their vertically-integrated interests to <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/17/entertainment/la-et-ct-comcast-netflix-20120517">make it harder for me to get to Netflix and easier to get to their own networked services</a>. Instead, I&#8217;d rather they focused on making it easier for me, their paying customer, to get to connect where I want and stay out of my way.</p>
<p>Mobile ISPs tend to mean cell phone carriers. Since they subsidize devices here in the US, they&#8217;re always looking for new ways to make up that cost. So, it&#8217;s in their interest to &#8220;add value&#8221; rather than just get out of my way.</p>
<p>Granted, I haven&#8217;t had much issue at all with Sprint, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been loyal to them for over 10 years. They could turn evil and value-addy at any minute, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/08/technology/sprint_earnings/index.htm?iid=EL">especially since they broke the bank to get the iPhone</a>, but they&#8217;ve been good to me so far. (Although, I <em>do</em> miss that <a href="http://community.sprint.com/baw/community/sprintblogs/blog/2011/09/15/sprint-discontinuing-sprint-premier">Sprint Premier program they started and then couldn&#8217;t afford any more</a>. I just hope that <a href="http://www.brighthand.com/default.asp?newsID=17990&amp;news=Sprint+Unlimited+Data">unlimited data isn&#8217;t next</a>.)</p>
<p>In other news, I just activated a Chromebook on Verizon&#8217;s network. There are pay-as-you-go options for when the 100MB free per month runs out. Seems pricier than I&#8217;d like, but that&#8217;s living in the USA (see also: device subsidies). But, the logistics of that sign-up process were pretty much what I wanted: Get a device, not from a carrier and not under contract, and just hook it up to a dumb pipe.</p>
<p>Of course, Verizon just recently asserted that the pipe I&#8217;m paying for is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/07/verizon-net-neutrality-violates-our-free-speech-rights/">their microphone and platform for free speech</a>. So, I didn&#8217;t just hook up to a dumb pipe &#8211; I hooked up to an insidiously intelligent pipe with an agenda. It will probably be at cross purposes with me, a paying customer, at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Really, I&#8217;d just like grown-up internet at my house and in my pocket. I give you money, and you give me bandwidth. Beyond that, let&#8217;s not bother each other. There are options, here, but they tend to approach $1000&#8217;s per month. And, as far as I can tell, they don&#8217;t perform nearly as well as the kid-stuff alternatives.</p>
<p>You know, we have dumb roads here: They let any vehicles across as long as they&#8217;re not too wide, and not so heavy that they bust up the pavement. They don&#8217;t generally charge more for certain kinds of vehicles, though I suppose that might be different on certain toll roads in the country. (We don&#8217;t really have those near where I live.) But, even then, they don&#8217;t charge differently for delivery trucks from one vendor vs another. They don&#8217;t make you use a certain kind of fuel, or tires from a specific company. They don&#8217;t give you an incentive to drive a Ford versus a Chevy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m willing to bet that if all our roads were privatized &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market_roads" title="If you really think private roads are the ideal, tell me how they&#39;d end up different than the bandwidth stagnation we have in the USA">a free-marketeer&#8217;s fever dream</a> &#8211; we&#8217;d have all the above in full effect.</p>
<p>But, I haven&#8217;t the foggiest idea how to change this situation. My way of life generally depends on plentiful bandwidth, so a boycott is generally impractical because I&#8217;d pretty much have to abstain from using the entire industry. If the roads were in this shape, it&#8217;s not like I could just decide not to drive anywhere. So, government intervention seems like the only feasible way to go &#8211; get someone with a bigger stick, who ostensibly represents my interests better than the carriers, to make things change.</p>
<p>Of course, that&#8217;s imperfect, because the people who should represent me seem more often than not to represent <em>their</em> paying customers. And, oddly enough, those customers often happen to be who <em>I&#8217;m</em> paying for a service. That&#8217;s just screwed up.</p>
