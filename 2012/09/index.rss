          <title>Freedom to Change Your Mind</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;I posted a few days ago about freedom of and from choice, but I think there’s something orthogonal to that spectrum: The freedom to change your mind, both figuratively and literally.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Things I learned from my High School science teacher</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;That’s not actually me in this picture: It’s something I found in an archive of a defunct GeoCities page, from who knows when. (Though, apparently, it was forged in the era of the Counting Crows.)
But, anyway, that’s Mr. Sabo there in the middle. He was my High School science teacher, and nearly every day I remember something that he taught me. Let’s see if I can come up with a few off the top of my head…&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Freedom {of,from} Choice</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Freedom of choice and freedom from choice lay on a spectrum. And, in technology, it’s no coincidence that more choice tends to be messier and complex, less choice tends to be cleaner and simple. It’s a trade-off between what you choose and what you leave up to an expert.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>Developing Open Web Apps: First, get it onto the web</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;I’ve been interested in developing open web apps (aka the single-page app) for years. But, it feels like the space is really on fire now, since the advent of HTML5 tech and the recent moves by Mozilla and Google toward truly “appifying” these things to compete with offerings from iOS and Android. Lots of pieces have come into alignment, and great things are coming together—never mind what the folks at Facebook say.
So, I think I’m going to build a simple app and blog about it. And, these days, the first thing I think about when starting a web app is: How do I get it onto the web?&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description

          <title>On the other end of a self-imposed death march project</title>
          <description
                >&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;So, I’m a couple of weeks back from a well-deserved vacation taken after the launch of a project well over 18 months in the making. I kind of overworked myself, voluntarily, and that needs to change.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description
