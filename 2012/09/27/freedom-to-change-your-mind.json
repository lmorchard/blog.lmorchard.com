So far, so good.</p>\n<h2 id=\"-span-id-changing_your_mind-changing-your-mind-span-\"><span id=\"Changing_your_mind\">Changing your mind</span></h2>\n<p>But, what about after you&#8217;ve made your choices about choices—can you change your mind later?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can you take your tools with you to a new ecosystem? </li>\n<li>If you can&#8217;t take them with, can you find alternatives?</li>\n<li>Are your thoughts and work expressed in ways that leave you free to change tools?</li>\n<li>Can you take possession of the thoughts you&#8217;ve poured into a tool or service?</li>\n<li>What happens when your relied-upon experts go out of business?</li>\n<li>Or, better yet, <a href=\"http://techland.time.com/2012/07/20/why-google-or-facebook-buying-your-favorite-startup-means-its-probably-toast/\">what happens when they cash out to Google or Facebook or Yahoo</a>?</li>\n<li>Do you own the device in your hand? Or, have you just gotten a limited license to use it?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And, this is probably overly clever, but when I write &#8220;change your mind&#8221; I mean both:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>reconsidering your decisions and</li>\n<li><em>altering your cognitive system</em>. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Because, as I&#8217;ve written before, these things are <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/out-of-our-brains/\">cognitive prosthetics</a>—they&#8217;re a part of your thinking apparatus. Again, it goes back to how much time you&#8217;re willing to devote to <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/24/freedom-of-from-choice#p[HIgHca]\">sharpening your saw</a> with intentional use of technology.</p>\n<p>Personally, I resist the notion of allowing parts of my extended mind to be controlled more by third-party experts than me. Even if I choose <em>for now</em> to leave myself in their hands, I want clearly marked exits and an escape plan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"-span-id-intersection_of_axes-intersection-of-axes-span-\"><span id=\"Intersection_of_axes\">Intersection of axes</span></h2>\n<p>So, if freedom {of,from} choice and freedom to change my mind are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality\">orthogonal</a>, what does that look like? (Maybe I&#8217;ll come back to this post with a drawing.)</p>\n<p>I would think that a high degree of freedom of choice would leave you quite free to change your mind later. But, I could imagine reworking that <a href=\"http://www.bigmessowires.com/2009/02/02/wire-wrap-photos/\">Big Mess &#8216;o Wires</a> would be a huge pain. So, I probably wouldn&#8217;t use a <a href=\"http://www.bigmessowires.com/2009/02/02/wire-wrap-photos/\">BMOW</a> as my daily workstation.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, some of the best designed systems <a href=\"http://tech.slashdot.org/story/04/03/04/1337259/your-future-cars-hood-will-be-welded-shut\">are trending</a> toward <a href=\"http://www.netc.org/openoptions/background/roadster.html\">hoods welded shut</a>. Shouldn&#8217;t it be possible to start from a product of expert design (an iPhone, for instance), only later to pop the cover off (literally or virtually) and do your own thing? There are jailbreaks—but why are you in a jail? And, doesn&#8217;t it seem like they&#8217;d make it airtight if they could?</p>\n<p>Is it just that <a href=\"http://www.imore.com/jailbreak-app-piracy-cost-theft\">app pirates are ruining it for the rest of us</a>? I mean, it&#8217;s mighty convenient to have your customers <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/07/06/theMicroChannelArchitectur.html\">locked in the trunk</a>: It&#8217;s harder for them to hurt themselves or the upholstery, and they can&#8217;t easily wander off if you make some turns they don&#8217;t like. But, that&#8217;s tinfoil-hat territory, and I could rant all day.</p>\n<p>Android seems to be doing well, and it&#8217;s <em>mostly</em> open. I&#8217;ve switched device vendors a few times, and all my apps have survived the changes. I&#8217;ve flashed my own choice of firmware on a few of my phones, and have been pleased. I have a sense of deeper choices available, should I ever want to chase after them.</p>\n<p>Palm&#8217;s webOS devices were <em>crazy</em> open—not open source per se, but <a href=\"http://webos.org/2009/06/10/palm-pre-konami-code-dev-mode/\">you could unlock root with the Konami code</a> and <a href=\"http://www.webos-internals.org/wiki/Applying_Patches\">apply patches to core applications</a>. Alas, webOS crashed and burned at HP. My hunch is that <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3062611/palm-webos-hp-inside-story-pre-postmortem\">being open isn&#8217;t what did them in</a>, though.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a> (disclaimer: my employer) is headed into that webOS territory with <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS\">FirefoxOS</a>. In that currently-coalescing ecosystem, the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/apps\">apps come from the open web</a>, aren&#8217;t gate-kept by a single <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"marketplace\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/Marketplace?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">marketplace</a>, and can even run on non-FirefoxOS devices. I suspect it won&#8217;t be as slick an ecosystem as Apple&#8217;s, <a href=\"http://blog.lmorchard.com/2012/09/24/freedom-of-from-choice#p[OtoFoc]\">because the loosely-coupled gates will let in more dirt</a>. But, it will be high on the freedom-to-change axis, and the quality of freedom-from-choice options will limited only by the talent of the designers involved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"-span-id-conclusion-conclusion-span-\"><span id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</span></h2>\n<p>So, I didn&#8217;t <em>really</em> mean to write an advertisement for <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS\">FirefoxOS</a>—I work for <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mozilla\" href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/?utm_source=wordpress%20blog&utm_medium=content%20link&utm_campaign=promote%20mdn\">Mozilla</a> because I love the mission, I&#8217;m not trying to shill. Really, I just think it&#8217;s very important to have a sense of your choices and freedoms when you accept technology into your life. And, of course, I have some very strong opinions, but this post and the one before it are intended as more about choice in general than my own choices or angst. If you&#8217;re happy with your choices, even upon close examination, then that&#8217;s great—just keep your wits about you.</p>\n"}
