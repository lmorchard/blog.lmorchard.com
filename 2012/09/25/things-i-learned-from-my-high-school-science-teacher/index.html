<li>You aren&#8217;t in control of an automobile; physics is. You merely provide suggestions. </li>
<li>Yield signs are stop signs: Since others are not in control of their automobiles, either, you should be more careful. </li>
<li>Always rotate the sample container while tipping out a measure of material. Never reach in with a scoop and risk contamination or unintentional reactions. </li>
<li>If you&#8217;ve learned to print in all caps from your drafting class, make sure the <em>real</em> capital letters are twice the height of the lower-case letters. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll fail the class. </li>
<li>The scientific method is the best means available to human beings for discovering and describing the universe, while compensating for our individual flaws and biases. </li>
<li>The scientific method doesn&#8217;t care about politics, even if scientists do. </li>
<li>You don&#8217;t know much about anything. But, that&#8217;s okay, because we have tools that help quantify how little we know about a given something. </li>
<li>Not knowing much is great, because it means there&#8217;s so much left to find. </li>
<li>Lending a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465026567/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0465026567&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=0xdecafbad01-20">Gödel, Escher, Bach</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=0xdecafbad01-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0465026567" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important; display: inline" /> to a young nerd will warp his or her brain, leaving it strange forever. </li>
<li>Dropping a soup-can sized chunk of pure sodium into a lake is awesome. </li>

<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'></span></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what Mr. Sabo is up to, these days. I heard he retired—good for him, sad for students. If he or anyone he knows ever reads this, I just want to say this: Thank you so much for teaching me so much. My brief time in your class had an astounding affect on my life.</p>
