Think about that.  So, maybe we shouldn't put games aside.  Really, unless Microsoft can somehow patent the crucial APIs exposed by Windows - if they haven't already - resistance is futile.  There are nerds motiviated and annoyed enough to reverse engineer and assimilate.  I'm not a lawyer, though:  I suppose by the point Wine actually becomes a threat of any sort, nasty things can be sprung.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083816\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://whump.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=152a649080e99c313ecae9a34c60d11d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://whump.com/\">Bill Humphries</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083816\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-10-18T06:45:51\">2007-10-18T06:45:51</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I haven't tried Team Fortress 2 with it yet.
