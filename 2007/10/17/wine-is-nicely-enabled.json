I <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/30/oooafh\">was using it</a> to run <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com/\">Radio UserLand</a> under Linux, about 5 years ago.  (Wow, has it been that long?)  I&#39;ve kind of assumed that Wine would get Good Enough at some point to run almost everything that matters that was written for Win95, Win98, Win2K, and eventually even WinXP.  And, games aside, pretty much everything that matters and that anyone bothers with runs on this range of Windows versions.  And, seeing as Windows Vista hasn&#39;t exactly set the world afire, I&#39;m betting that Wine might actually have a chance to catch up well enough to be trouble.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and <a href=\"http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxmac\">CrossOver Mac</a> is based on <a href=\"http://www.winehq.org\">Wine</a>.  And <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2007/10/04/crossover-6-2-supports-team-fortress-2/\">CrossOver Mac supports Team Fortress 2</a> <b>right now</b>, <i>without purchase of a Windows license</i>.  Think about that.  So, maybe we shouldn&#39;t put games aside.  Really, unless Microsoft can somehow patent the crucial APIs exposed by Windows - if they haven&#39;t already - resistance is futile.  There are nerds motiviated and annoyed enough to reverse engineer and assimilate.  I&#39;m not a lawyer, though:  I suppose by the point Wine actually becomes a threat of any sort, nasty things can be sprung.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083816\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://whump.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=152a649080e99c313ecae9a34c60d11d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://whump.com/\">Bill Humphries</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083816\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-10-18T06:45:51\">2007-10-18T06:45:51</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I haven&#39;t tried Team Fortress 2 with it yet.

The only tinkering I did was to reconfigure it to use alsa instead of oss to make the sound work.</p>\n\n<p>What did not work, however, is the purchasing interface in Steam. I regrettably had to return to Windows-land for a short period to actually buy Portal. It downloaded into Steam under Wine just fine afterwards, though.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that it &quot;just worked&quot; for me leaves me puzzled about what exactly you&#39;re doing wrong, Bill. Are you using an old version of Wine, perhaps? What is it doing when you try to run it?</p>\n\n<p><p>(It might be relevant that I&#39;m launching Portal from inside Steam rather than from its own &quot;shortcut&quot;.)</p></div></p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221083820&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://smokinn.tengun.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=6baebf88c88c0383b691aa8aa973914b&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://smokinn.tengun.net&quot;&gt;Guillaume Theoret&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221083820&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2007-11-13T04:32:40&quot;&gt;2007-11-13T04:32:40&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;They really have done an amazing job.
