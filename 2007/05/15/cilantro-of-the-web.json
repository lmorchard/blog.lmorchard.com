But, it&#39;s also <i>cut-and-paste of what I see</i> and <i>post-launch mashability</i>.  What else do we lose with Flash, Silverlight, and JavaFX?</p>\n<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;ve got an enormous amount of love for Flash, and think that it has its place right alongside images and textareas.  And most times, when you&#39;ve otherwise got some 3-ring circus of stuttering, lumbering DHTML and AJAX - a little dash of Flash is what you need.  But, you wouldn&#39;t make a meal of cilantro, and <a href=\"http://ihatecilantro.com/\">some people hate it altogether</a>.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086863\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.jm3.net/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/jm3.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.jm3.net/\">John Manoogian III (jm3)</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086863\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-05-16T22:41:10\">2007-05-16T22:41:10</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>perfect analogy.</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
