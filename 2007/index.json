I <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/30/oooafh\">was using it</a> to run <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com/\">Radio UserLand</a> under Linux, about 5 years ago.  (Wow, has it been that long?)  I've kind of assumed that Wine would get Good Enough at some point to run almost everything that matters that was written for Win95, Win98, Win2K, and eventually even WinXP.  And, games aside, pretty much everything that matters and that anyone bothers with runs on this range of Windows versions.  And, seeing as Windows Vista hasn't exactly set the world afire, I'm betting that Wine might actually have a chance to catch up well enough to be trouble.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and <a href=\"http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxmac\">CrossOver Mac</a> is based on <a href=\"http://www.winehq.org\">Wine</a>.  And <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2007/10/04/crossover-6-2-supports-team-fortress-2/\">CrossOver Mac supports Team Fortress 2</a> <b>right now</b>, <i>without purchase of a Windows license</i>.  Think about that.  So, maybe we shouldn't put games aside.  Really, unless Microsoft can somehow patent the crucial APIs exposed by Windows - if they haven't already - resistance is futile.  There are nerds motiviated and annoyed enough to reverse engineer and assimilate.  I'm not a lawyer, though:  I suppose by the point Wine actually becomes a threat of any sort, nasty things can be sprung.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083816\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://whump.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=152a649080e99c313ecae9a34c60d11d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://whump.com/\">Bill Humphries</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083816\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-10-18T06:45:51\">2007-10-18T06:45:51</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I haven't tried Team Fortress 2 with it yet.

I <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/30/oooafh\">was using it</a> to run <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com/\">Radio UserLand</a> under Linux, about 5 years ago.  (Wow, has it been that long?)  I've kind of assumed that Wine would get Good Enough at some point to run almost everything that matters that was written for Win95, Win98, Win2K, and eventually even WinXP.  And, games aside, pretty much everything that matters and that anyone bothers with runs on this range of Windows versions.  And, seeing as Windows Vista hasn't exactly set the world afire, I'm betting that Wine might actually have a chance to catch up well enough to be trouble.</p>\r\n<p>Oh yeah, and <a href=\"http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxmac\">CrossOver Mac</a> is based on <a href=\"http://www.winehq.org\">Wine</a>.  And <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2007/10/04/crossover-6-2-supports-team-fortress-2/\">CrossOver Mac supports Team Fortress 2</a> <b>right now</b>, <i>without purchase of a Windows license</i>.  Think about that.  So, maybe we shouldn't put games aside.  Really, unless Microsoft can somehow patent the crucial APIs exposed by Windows - if they haven't already - resistance is futile.  There are nerds motiviated and annoyed enough to reverse engineer and assimilate.  I'm not a lawyer, though:  I suppose by the point Wine actually becomes a threat of any sort, nasty things can be sprung.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083816\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://whump.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=152a649080e99c313ecae9a34c60d11d&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://whump.com/\">Bill Humphries</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083816\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-10-18T06:45:51\">2007-10-18T06:45:51</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I haven't tried Team Fortress 2 with it yet.

It&#39;s thanks to our privacy policy - although we have the email addresses of most everyone we&#39;ve been adding to the preview, we&#39;re not allowed to send anything other than password recovery emails.  Weird, I know, but sometimes organizations try to follow things like that.</p>\n<p>So, the problem is that we have many more people invited to the preview than have actually started using it.  As briefly mentioned in the <a href=\"http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2007/09/taste-test.html\">blog post announcing the preview</a>, you need to check your &quot;Links for You&quot; to see if you&#39;ve been sent a link to the preview.  </p>\n<p>But, if your invite has possibly been buried in other links from friends - you might just <a href=\"http://preview.delicious.com\">try signing into the preview</a> with the username and password from your existing delicious account!

    "body": "<b>Update:</b> <i>Oh!  And since even I missed this link in the original blog post, you can <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/help/preview\">request to be invited</a>.  Not sure if that results in an email, either, though.</i>\r\n\r\n<b>Update #2:</b>  <i>Also, we're <a href=\"http://www.deliciousforums.com/\">trying out Vanilla forums</a> as an alternative to the delicious mailing list.  If you're invited to the preview, your login should work there too.  We might even launch public forums once del 2 is out.</i>\r\n\r\nIn case anyone's forgotten:  I work on <a href=\"http://del.icio.us\">delicious</a>.  Since I've had a steady stream of friends and acquaintances asking me about how they can get into the invite, I thought I'd mention this:  \r\n\r\n<b>You may already have been invited!</b>  :)\r\n\r\nUnlike most Web 2.0 sites that open up a preview or invite-only thing with a mysterious sign-up form, we can't fire off an email when we create an account for someone on our preview.  It's thanks to our privacy policy - although we have the email addresses of most everyone we've been adding to the preview, we're not allowed to send anything other than password recovery emails.  Weird, I know, but sometimes organizations try to follow things like that.\r\n\r\nSo, the problem is that we have many more people invited to the preview than have actually started using it.  As briefly mentioned in the <a href=\"http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2007/09/taste-test.html\">blog post announcing the preview</a>, you need to check your \"Links for You\" to see if you've been sent a link to the preview.  \r\n\r\nBut, if your invite has possibly been buried in other links from friends - you might just <a href=\"http://preview.delicious.com\">try signing into the preview</a> with the username and password from your existing delicious account!  It might just work.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082580\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://lascribe.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=756d205a4a679da61c2c9654b96b242f&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://lascribe.net/\">chryss</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082580\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-09-28T19:58:43\">2007-09-28T19:58:43</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Sniff.

A priest spoke at the funeral whose words fell on me like bad pop-up and banner ads for the Catholic Jesus - propagandic, mildly annoying, and not at all relevant to me or my situation.  I didn't even bother to sing along or mouth a single \"amen\" like I might to be polite in other settings.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:13:18PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\n<p><a name=\"When:1:13:32PM\"></a>Instead, the things in which I find closure, if not solace, is to do quite a lot of mindful reflection on my life, my Dad's life, and how the patterns of my life have come about in reflection - or in recoil - of his.  I try to find the gifts for which I owe him thanks, and the things of which I should be wary and protect myself.  This, to me, is where to find the meaning in his passing.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:13:32PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\n<p><a name=\"When:1:20:57PM\"></a>Dad died of heart disease at the age of 55 - only 24 years ahead of me.  He didn't take his medicine or follow doctors' advice very well.  After the divorce, he retreated to a cottage in the woods hours north from most family and old friends.  He lived with a gorgeous dog and a girlfriend who was apparently alcoholic and a chronic smoker.  He left a lot of things he wanted to do undone - a bucket of fishing poles for retirement forgotten in a basement, for example.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:20:57PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\n<p><a name=\"When:1:55:32PM\"></a>I've been making a lot of calls for doctor appointments this week and inventorying the buckets of fishing poles in my basements.  No part of this story will be mine.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:55:32PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\n<p><a name=\"When:1:46:28PM\"></a>Dad always had tools and half-done projects laying around.  We had plenty of duct tape and electrical tape available, and seeing the insides of appliances and gadgets was commonplace.  I've known what a soldering iron was for as long as I can remember.  It was one of his screwdrivers I used to get inside first things I took apart.  I think the very first was a car stereo he left on top of my toy box in the course of working on a truck in the garage.  Unfortunately for both of us, it would be a few years before I learned how to put things back together.  But, he was very good at both, and I never wanted for a working car after I got my drivers' license - even if the whole wheel did come off the axel on one of them.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:46:28PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\n<p><a name=\"When:1:53:36PM\"></a>Dad as tinkerer - these are the stories I claim in the founding of me.  Relatives on Mom's side always say I got that from him, though I'm pretty sure I got an equal measure of smarts from them.  But, most gadgets I owned as a kid eventually acquired a wrapping of black electrical tape and I associate the scent of molten flux with him and being in his basement.  Perhaps not coincidentally, these are the things I'm most proud of in my own life - the things about being a tinkerer.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:53:36PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\n<p><a name=\"When:1:58:17PM\"></a>I've got a whole lot more banging around in my head, but I think this is plenty for now.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:58:17PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\n\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-229905900\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b40d3c076e9d86a575d9dfb4e30b6790&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">jenni -les Grandma</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-229905900\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-19T17:03:04\">2011-06-19T17:03:04</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">les , this is a nice tribute to your dad, i know he wasn't the best but he tried hard the best he knew how,and I know he loved you.

I'm not perfect in this, but I do experience quite a large degree of painful cognitive dissonance when I catch me trying to fool myself.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:18:56PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"When:1:13:18PM\"></a>In the wake of my Dad's passing, I'm working through a lot of things without the benefit of comforting religion.  A priest spoke at the funeral whose words fell on me like bad pop-up and banner ads for the Catholic Jesus - propagandic, mildly annoying, and not at all relevant to me or my situation.  I didn't even bother to sing along or mouth a single \"amen\" like I might to be polite in other settings.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:13:18PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"When:1:13:32PM\"></a>Instead, the things in which I find closure, if not solace, is to do quite a lot of mindful reflection on my life, my Dad's life, and how the patterns of my life have come about in reflection - or in recoil - of his.  I try to find the gifts for which I owe him thanks, and the things of which I should be wary and protect myself.  This, to me, is where to find the meaning in his passing.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:13:32PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"When:1:20:57PM\"></a>Dad died of heart disease at the age of 55 - only 24 years ahead of me.  He didn't take his medicine or follow doctors' advice very well.  After the divorce, he retreated to a cottage in the woods hours north from most family and old friends.  He lived with a gorgeous dog and a girlfriend who was apparently alcoholic and a chronic smoker.  He left a lot of things he wanted to do undone - a bucket of fishing poles for retirement forgotten in a basement, for example.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:20:57PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"When:1:55:32PM\"></a>I've been making a lot of calls for doctor appointments this week and inventorying the buckets of fishing poles in my basements.  No part of this story will be mine.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:55:32PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"When:1:46:28PM\"></a>Dad always had tools and half-done projects laying around.  We had plenty of duct tape and electrical tape available, and seeing the insides of appliances and gadgets was commonplace.  I've known what a soldering iron was for as long as I can remember.  It was one of his screwdrivers I used to get inside first things I took apart.  I think the very first was a car stereo he left on top of my toy box in the course of working on a truck in the garage.  Unfortunately for both of us, it would be a few years before I learned how to put things back together.  But, he was very good at both, and I never wanted for a working car after I got my drivers' license - even if the whole wheel did come off the axel on one of them.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:46:28PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"When:1:53:36PM\"></a>Dad as tinkerer - these are the stories I claim in the founding of me.  Relatives on Mom's side always say I got that from him, though I'm pretty sure I got an equal measure of smarts from them.  But, most gadgets I owned as a kid eventually acquired a wrapping of black electrical tape and I associate the scent of molten flux with him and being in his basement.  Perhaps not coincidentally, these are the things I'm most proud of in my own life - the things about being a tinkerer.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:53:36PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"When:1:58:17PM\"></a>I've got a whole lot more banging around in my head, but I think this is plenty for now.&nbsp;<a href=\"/decafbad/2007/09/25#When:1:58:17PM\"><img src=\"http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif\" width=\"6\" height=\"9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Permanent link to this item in the archive.\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-229905900\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b40d3c076e9d86a575d9dfb4e30b6790&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">jenni -les Grandma</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-229905900\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2011-06-19T17:03:04\">2011-06-19T17:03:04</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\">les , this is a nice tribute to your dad, i know he wasn't the best but he tried hard the best he knew how,and I know he loved you.

I don't want titles, comments, or extended entries - that's what a blog is for.  I don't want features added just for coolness sake or whatever.</p>\n<p>But, I can see a set of problems with the Twitter experience that might be helped with something that adds a bit more context - and something like tags seems like a lightweight and somewhat simple way to do it.  Making them sticky helps make them less cumbersome to use.</p>\n<p>I'd really like to be able to pick and choose the sorts of updates I receive from people I follow, across different means of receiving them.  For example, I might not want to get all of someone's random ponderings on my phone, but I'd like to get pinged when they start talking about when they're leaving for the party tonight.  If they switch to a new set of tags I'm watching for, this can happen.</p>\n<p>Or, maybe after a Hack Day London, I'd like to go back and see what the chatter was about - ie. I can <em>see</em> what went on via the hackdaylondon tag on Flickr, and I'd like something like that for Twitter.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085870\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.elroyjetson.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4a34cf8d239b6589024fc004cfdad5b8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.elroyjetson.org\">Elroy Jetson</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221085870\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-08-22T17:48:55\">2007-08-22T17:48:55</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I have to agree that having tags would make it nice to filter the wheat from the chafe.

Most of the time messages I post and I see others post to Twitter are random and inconsistent. In these normal circumstances having to send TWO messages to set the tags then send the tweet would be absurd.</p>\n<p>I like the idea but, for sticky tags, I can't see anything more than a conference tag to be actually useful AND easy to manage.</p>\n<p>Tagging IN the message might be useful but seems like a lot of overhead when we're already limited to 140 characters and not something I could see people actually starting to use. I don't ever wish I could filter out my friends posts.

I don't want titles, comments, or extended entries - that's what a blog is for.  I don't want features added just for coolness sake or whatever.</p>\n\n<p>But, I can see a set of problems with the Twitter experience that might be helped with something that adds a bit more context - and something like tags seems like a lightweight and somewhat simple way to do it.  Making them sticky helps make them less cumbersome to use.</p>\n\n<p>I'd really like to be able to pick and choose the sorts of updates I receive from people I follow, across different means of receiving them.  For example, I might not want to get all of someone's random ponderings on my phone, but I'd like to get pinged when they start talking about when they're leaving for the party tonight.  If they switch to a new set of tags I'm watching for, this can happen.</p>\n\n<p>Or, maybe after a Hack Day London, I'd like to go back and see what the chatter was about - ie. I can <em>see</em> what went on via the hackdaylondon tag on Flickr, and I'd like something like that for Twitter.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085870\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.elroyjetson.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4a34cf8d239b6589024fc004cfdad5b8&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.elroyjetson.org\">Elroy Jetson</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085870\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-08-22T17:48:55\">2007-08-22T17:48:55</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I have to agree that having tags would make it nice to filter the wheat from the chafe.

In other words, the risk you take with outsourcing is having your “value metric” not match any other active hoarding entities. The less exotic your tastes, the less of a problem this is. My tastes are exotic; I suspect yours are too.\"</p>\n\n<p><i>Trying out the OPML Editor again, pasting in an entry composed over at <a href=\"http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad\">my OPML blog</a>.</i></p>\n<p>Copyright and DRM and litigation aside, it's recently occurred to me as inevitable that digitized media and cultural artifacts will become increasingly more available and easier to obtain.  That in itself is not my big realization.  My realization is that I'm starting to feel less and less of a compulsion to hoard and collect things.</p>\n<p>For example: I used to carefully stick comic books in mylar bags with backing boards - not for resale value, but because I wanted them in good shape to read again years from now.  But nowadays, though I still pay for and buy comics, I see that complete archives of things like The Amazing Spider-Man are available as multi-gigabyte torrents.  Someday, you won't be able to buy Spider-Man anymore - but I bet that torrent will still be out there in some form or another.</p>\n<p>Another example: In high school, some friends and I semi-obsessively searched for and collected Nine Inch Nails albums and CD singles that fell into a numbered \"Halo\" sequence.  Never mind that this is probably what Trent Reznor was talking about when <a href=\"http://nin.com/tr/\">he recently wrote</a> \"Nothing but a consumer rip-off that I've been talked into my whole career.\"</p>\n<p>Living in a small town with crap for record stores, the Halos seemed so rare at the time, and having gaps in the numbered set was frustrating.  And imagine when we discovered that there was a \"Halo 00\"!  Of course, now you can find a complete archive of all the Halos in one big torrent - meticulously labeled, bestowed with cover art, and with lots of seeders.</p>\n<p>And that's barely scraping the surface.  You can find almost any music, any obscure old scifi TV show - anything that's got at least one person interested in scanning / converting / compressing the material and seeding a share.  And as long as there remains at least one person interested, the material continues on into the future.</p>\n<p>Now, mind you, this is all academic - I'm not encouraging you to seek out and download this stuff, and I'm not saying that <i>I've</i> downloaded this stuff.  That sort of thing could get you into trouble.</p>\n<p>Of course, someday, it might not get you into trouble.  And, in fact, someday all this might have become accepted tradition - an inherent human right even!  Right now, it's the norm for quite a number of people.  What makes it amazing and inevitable to me is that the trend seems to be toward more and more of this, not less.  And eventually, even the self-selecting nerd filters will fall away, everyone will play, and the content will stop skewing toward the techies.</p>\n<p>Someone, somewhere, with some old recording or tome or whatever will get ambitious enough some weekend to digitize the thing and share it - and 10 years later, it'll still be floating around because throughout that time at least one person at any given time felt it was important enough to keep going.  Really, all it takes is one person - and odds are, there'll always be at least one person interested who has the skill and inclination to relay into the future.</p>\n<p>And, really, all of this is just yet another corollary of Mark Pilgrim's \"<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2001/07/29/my_crush_on_spyro_what_flash_animations_remind_me_of_and_what_the_past_will_look_like_someday\">the only long-term effect of copy protection is to ensure that those who defeat it are immortalized</a>.\"</p>\n<p>So, yeah, I'm starting to feel optimistic enough to think maybe I don't need to hoard and collect the things that I feel are definitive of <i>me</i>.  That maybe it's okay to expect, down the road, to be able to search for and find that stuff again with ease and lighten up my own personal clutter.  Not quite there yet, and I don't trust it enough to shred my comics and CDs, but I think a turning point has passed.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090093\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3afbb1ce4530e00fa1cdbaeec44b59c4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"\">Bruce Thomas</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090093\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-05-16T00:52:00\">2007-05-16T00:52:00</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>20 years ago, we thought it was cool to collect different color tape rings...the little plastic rings in computer tape reels that prevented erasure and overwriting existing data.

I had what I thought was a decent collection - a dozen shows ranging from poor to OK quality. </p>\n<p>Fast forward to Fall 2006. When I found the Internet Live Music Archive I was like a kid in a candy store. 2000+ Dead recordings, many high quality soundboards, all with detailed reviews. And seemingly infinite bandwidth available for downloads.  I downloaded all I could, but not enough...</p>\n<p>In November 2006 the Dead decided that this was too much of a good thing and  <a href=\"http://dschwarz.blogspot.com/2005/11/too-good-to-last.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">opposite pulled the plug</a>.on soundboard downloads.</p>\n<p>Most of the shows are still available via BitTorrent (legal) but it's a hassle to find and download the right show. Slower, too.  Also, periodically the Dead ask that certain soundboards be taken out of circulation, usually because they are planning a commercial release of same.  So I'm finding and hoarding more shows before the Powers That Be take them out of circulation.  </p>\n<p>They'll always be available on the Darknet, but why take the chance... better to get a legal copy while I still can.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090096\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a1f131cb4b90d31bf78f7450404ab317&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com\">Jason Scott</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090096\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-05-18T20:48:33\">2007-05-18T20:48:33</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Hi, Les.</p>\n<p>I agree with you in a tangential way. Outsourcing hoarding is a good idea, but you have to stay on top of the pros and cons of it, just like real outsourcing.</p>\n<p>First of all, everything you're mentioning in terms of hoarding are commercial properties, either active or lapsed. Movies, albums, television shows. These are a specific type of data, one where the \"hard work\" has been done, that of composing a media work, and then presenting it to future audiences as a self-contained item. You get your hands on the two hour presentation of \"Catholic High School Girls in Trouble\" and you've got probably 99% of what the creators intended the audience to have for their money, and maybe 96% if the product ever came \"with\" anything, like a unique insert or a particularly nice DVD case (the Super Deluxe Edition of Catholic High School Girls in Trouble).</p>\n<p>That sort of data collection is very specific; it is spread to a large amount of people, who really \"get it\" as to what it is and why they'd want it. Perhaps you might find something exotic attached to it (the .AVI of the director directing the vital \"salad oil sequence\" of the movie) but generally people just have to have the movie and you're done.</p>\n<p>Less easy to keep track of are non-commercial properties, for example a recording of a specific performance by an obscure band that didn't last very long. Unless the band themselves recorded it, there might not be many recordings of who the opening act was at the local club on May 10th. And if there is, it might not be very good, having been recorded towards the back of the club, etc. Or let's go even beyond that... what about something like the program from all the plays put on by your high school during your time there? Even though hundreds of them were probably put out by every production held during your four years, it's unlikely you can find them online, scanned at all properly, or listed properly. In all likelihood, that information is gone.</p>\n<p>Now, contrast that with Console Game ROMs, which are now to the point of being nearly 100% complete and accounted for for every major console produced in the last 30 years. This is because so many hundreds of thousands of people WANT the things that they'll gladly work together to assemble them.</p>\n<p>On digitize.textfiles.com, you'll see I'm trying to scan in stuff that nobody likely wants, but all of which dates to the 1980s computer industry period. That stuff might or might not have relevance to you or me right now, but over time, I've been surprised when stuff has jumped into being wanted, like the Coleco Catalog which got some attention a while back.</p>\n<p>In other words, the risk you take with outsourcing is having your \"value metric\" not match any other active hoarding entities. The less exotic your tastes, the less of a problem this is. My tastes are exotic; I suspect yours are too.</p>\n<p>Also, your use of \"seeding a share\" belies one of the big issues: Torrents are not long-term providers of information. Go ahead and use mininova (I won't tell) and do searching on things you care about. You'll often see that any 3+ month old torrents are simply nowhere to be found, totally dead, unless it's a REAL blockbuster on the level of a major software or movie property.</p>\n<p>I hoard, constantly, which I know you know. But I know better than to sit around scanning in Nintendo Game Manuals or collecting TV shows by anything less a unit than the Season, since that'd just be redundant, wasted time.</p>\n<p>It keeps things interesting.</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090098\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221090098\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-05-18T22:22:46\">2007-05-18T22:22:46</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>@Jason:  Way to rain on my breathlessness there, man.

Mostly, I've gotten a good collection, but it's outstripped even my abilities. I'm happy to have the swath I do have, well over a terabyte and a half of podcasts. In doing this, I also developed some kick-ass archiving tools I'm using for other stuff.</p>\n<p>Again, I'm not THAT worried about indy podcasts. I'm worried about stuff that might never ever see digital form, or which nobody really cares about right now but will want to see down the line. But that's always the problem, isn't it?</p>\n<p>By the way, I too remember going through record store after record store trying to find every single obscure recording, remix album, and so on for the Art of Noise. I have some crazy stuff indeed, much of it not really something that translates well to digitial, like unusually-cut albums and transparent records. How much time I wasted doing that...</p></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

Never mind that this is probably what Trent Reznor was talking about when <a href=\"http://nin.com/tr/\">he recently wrote</a> \"Nothing but a consumer rip-off that I've been talked into my whole career.\"</p>\r\n<p>Living in a small town with crap for record stores, the Halos seemed so rare at the time, and having gaps in the numbered set was frustrating.  And imagine when we discovered that there was a \"Halo 00\"!  Of course, now you can find a complete archive of all the Halos in one big torrent - meticulously labeled, bestowed with cover art, and with lots of seeders.</p>\r\n<p>And that's barely scraping the surface.  You can find almost any music, any obscure old scifi TV show - anything that's got at least one person interested in scanning / converting / compressing the material and seeding a share.  And as long as there remains at least one person interested, the material continues on into the future.</p>\r\n<p>Now, mind you, this is all academic - I'm not encouraging you to seek out and download this stuff, and I'm not saying that <i>I've</i> downloaded this stuff.  That sort of thing could get you into trouble.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, someday, it might not get you into trouble.  And, in fact, someday all this might have become accepted tradition - an inherent human right even!  Right now, it's the norm for quite a number of people.  What makes it amazing and inevitable to me is that the trend seems to be toward more and more of this, not less.  And eventually, even the self-selecting nerd filters will fall away, everyone will play, and the content will stop skewing toward the techies.</p>\r\n<p>Someone, somewhere, with some old recording or tome or whatever will get ambitious enough some weekend to digitize the thing and share it - and 10 years later, it'll still be floating around because throughout that time at least one person at any given time felt it was important enough to keep going.  Really, all it takes is one person - and odds are, there'll always be at least one person interested who has the skill and inclination to relay into the future.</p>\r\n<p>And, really, all of this is just yet another corollary of Mark Pilgrim's \"<a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2001/07/29/my_crush_on_spyro_what_flash_animations_remind_me_of_and_what_the_past_will_look_like_someday\">the only long-term effect of copy protection is to ensure that those who defeat it are immortalized</a>.\"</p>\r\n<p>So, yeah, I'm starting to feel optimistic enough to think maybe I don't need to hoard and collect the things that I feel are definitive of <i>me</i>.  That maybe it's okay to expect, down the road, to be able to search for and find that stuff again with ease and lighten up my own personal clutter.  Not quite there yet, and I don't trust it enough to shred my comics and CDs, but I think a turning point has passed.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090093\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3afbb1ce4530e00fa1cdbaeec44b59c4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Bruce Thomas</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090093\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-05-16T00:52:00\">2007-05-16T00:52:00</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>20 years ago, we thought it was cool to collect different color tape rings...the little plastic rings in computer tape reels that prevented erasure and overwriting existing data.

I had what I thought was a decent collection - a dozen shows ranging from poor to OK quality. </p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to Fall 2006. When I found the Internet Live Music Archive I was like a kid in a candy store. 2000+ Dead recordings, many high quality soundboards, all with detailed reviews. And seemingly infinite bandwidth available for downloads.  I downloaded all I could, but not enough...</p>\n\n<p>In November 2006 the Dead decided that this was too much of a good thing and  <a href=\"http://dschwarz.blogspot.com/2005/11/too-good-to-last.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">opposite pulled the plug</a>.on soundboard downloads.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the shows are still available via BitTorrent (legal) but it's a hassle to find and download the right show. Slower, too.  Also, periodically the Dead ask that certain soundboards be taken out of circulation, usually because they are planning a commercial release of same.  So I'm finding and hoarding more shows before the Powers That Be take them out of circulation.  </p>\n\n<p>They'll always be available on the Darknet, but why take the chance... better to get a legal copy while I still can.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090096\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a1f131cb4b90d31bf78f7450404ab317&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com\">Jason Scott</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090096\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-05-18T20:48:33\">2007-05-18T20:48:33</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hi, Les.</p>\n\n<p>I agree with you in a tangential way. Outsourcing hoarding is a good idea, but you have to stay on top of the pros and cons of it, just like real outsourcing.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, everything you're mentioning in terms of hoarding are commercial properties, either active or lapsed. Movies, albums, television shows. These are a specific type of data, one where the \"hard work\" has been done, that of composing a media work, and then presenting it to future audiences as a self-contained item. You get your hands on the two hour presentation of \"Catholic High School Girls in Trouble\" and you've got probably 99% of what the creators intended the audience to have for their money, and maybe 96% if the product ever came \"with\" anything, like a unique insert or a particularly nice DVD case (the Super Deluxe Edition of Catholic High School Girls in Trouble).</p>\n\n<p>That sort of data collection is very specific; it is spread to a large amount of people, who really \"get it\" as to what it is and why they'd want it. Perhaps you might find something exotic attached to it (the .AVI of the director directing the vital \"salad oil sequence\" of the movie) but generally people just have to have the movie and you're done.</p>\n\n<p>Less easy to keep track of are non-commercial properties, for example a recording of a specific performance by an obscure band that didn't last very long. Unless the band themselves recorded it, there might not be many recordings of who the opening act was at the local club on May 10th. And if there is, it might not be very good, having been recorded towards the back of the club, etc. Or let's go even beyond that... what about something like the program from all the plays put on by your high school during your time there? Even though hundreds of them were probably put out by every production held during your four years, it's unlikely you can find them online, scanned at all properly, or listed properly. In all likelihood, that information is gone.</p>\n\n<p>Now, contrast that with Console Game ROMs, which are now to the point of being nearly 100% complete and accounted for for every major console produced in the last 30 years. This is because so many hundreds of thousands of people WANT the things that they'll gladly work together to assemble them.</p>\n\n<p>On digitize.textfiles.com, you'll see I'm trying to scan in stuff that nobody likely wants, but all of which dates to the 1980s computer industry period. That stuff might or might not have relevance to you or me right now, but over time, I've been surprised when stuff has jumped into being wanted, like the Coleco Catalog which got some attention a while back.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the risk you take with outsourcing is having your \"value metric\" not match any other active hoarding entities. The less exotic your tastes, the less of a problem this is. My tastes are exotic; I suspect yours are too.</p>\n\n<p>Also, your use of \"seeding a share\" belies one of the big issues: Torrents are not long-term providers of information. Go ahead and use mininova (I won't tell) and do searching on things you care about. You'll often see that any 3+ month old torrents are simply nowhere to be found, totally dead, unless it's a REAL blockbuster on the level of a major software or movie property.</p>\n\n<p>I hoard, constantly, which I know you know. But I know better than to sit around scanning in Nintendo Game Manuals or collecting TV shows by anything less a unit than the Season, since that'd just be redundant, wasted time.</p>\n\n<p>It keeps things interesting.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090098\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090098\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-05-18T22:22:46\">2007-05-18T22:22:46</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>@Jason:  Way to rain on my breathlessness there, man.  Here I was all looking forward to all those AT&amp;T commercials coming true!  You're definitely right though - there's a blind spot in my enthusiasm, and it's that I'm mostly thinking of commercial things with relatively broad appeal (even the nerdy skewed things).</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I'm hoping that things like indy podcasts and such get some archival and outsourced hoard love - though admittedly <em>you</em> are the only active hoarding entity I can think of with respect to podcasts.  (Still doing that, by the way?)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090099\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.textfiles.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a1f131cb4b90d31bf78f7450404ab317&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.textfiles.com\">Jason Scott</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090099\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-05-19T06:49:01\">2007-05-19T06:49:01</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I am hoarding the podcasts a ton less than I used to. Mostly, I've gotten a good collection, but it's outstripped even my abilities. I'm happy to have the swath I do have, well over a terabyte and a half of podcasts. In doing this, I also developed some kick-ass archiving tools I'm using for other stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Again, I'm not THAT worried about indy podcasts. I'm worried about stuff that might never ever see digital form, or which nobody really cares about right now but will want to see down the line. But that's always the problem, isn't it?</p>\n\n<p>By the way, I too remember going through record store after record store trying to find every single obscure recording, remix album, and so on for the Art of Noise. I have some crazy stuff indeed, much of it not really something that translates well to digitial, like unusually-cut albums and transparent records. How much time I wasted doing that...</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        </ul>\n    \n        </div>\n    ",

    "html": "<p>Yeah, things have been basically silent around here thanks to post-work brain fryage and a general lack of things to say.  Really, everyone else around the blogosphere seems to be covering things satisfactorily.  However, I have been idly working on a new project over the past few weeks, namely a total rewrite and redesign of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/?s=feedmagick\">my format-ignorant feed filtering and munging kit dubbed FeedMagick</a>.</p>\n<p>You can find <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/\">a demo installation of FeedMagick2 here</a> and find it <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/FeedMagick2/\">ready for checkout from SVN over here</a>.  It&#39;s basically just a step away from being a proof of concept, but I&#39;m hoping to get around to fleshing out docs and battening down the hatches with tests.  In any case, if my serial enthusiasm holds out, this thing could eventually subsume everything else I&#39;ve done with feeds.</p>\n<p>For now, peek at some of these highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/masterfeed\">Master Personal Feed</a> - One big feed blended from 10 other personal metadata feeds pulled from various Web-2.0-ish sites.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/magpiejson\">Feed to JSON via Magpie</a> - Get feed data parsed by way of <a href=\"http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/\">Magpie</a> into JSON data structures</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/flickrfavorites\">Flickr Favorites Feed</a> - Feed of photos marked as favorites by a Flickr user, pulled via the API</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/jbox\">jbox.com scraper</a> - Pipeline composed of <a href=\"http://tidy.sourceforge.net/\">HTML Tidy</a> and XSL to scrape <a href=\"http://jbox.com/\">jbox.com</a> to build an RSS feed of new items for sale.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beyond practical examples, there are some things under the hood that seem keen to me.  Apropos of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2007/02/15/thoughts-on-pipes-on-the-web-part-ii\">pipes-via-web ramblings</a> back in February, I&#39;m trying out a few different approaches to pipelining feed content through processor modules.  My original FeedMagick relied on feeding URLs to URLs as parameters.  That, unfortunately, can be mighty cumbersome and inefficient.  So, FeedMagick2 explores a few more approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The first and obvious approach is to chain them together in a single script.  So, I&#39;ve got objects instances that pass content from one to the next.  The thing is, the pipe works in reverse:  The driver script asks the last module in the pipe for content, which then asks the one before it for content, and so on.  At any point along the way, modules can cache the output of previous modules, and refrain from calling up the chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The second way to chain pipelines together is just like the first FeedMagick:  Some pipelines start with fetching a URL.

    "body": "Yeah, things have been basically silent around here thanks to post-work brain fryage and a general lack of things to say.  Really, everyone else around the blogosphere seems to be covering things satisfactorily.  However, I have been idly working on a new project over the past few weeks, namely a total rewrite and redesign of [my format-ignorant feed filtering and munging kit dubbed FeedMagick](http://decafbad.com/blog/?s=feedmagick).\r\n\r\nYou can find [a demo installation of FeedMagick2 here](http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/) and find it [ready for checkout from SVN over here](http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/FeedMagick2/).  It's basically just a step away from being a proof of concept, but I'm hoping to get around to fleshing out docs and battening down the hatches with tests.  In any case, if my serial enthusiasm holds out, this thing could eventually subsume everything else I've done with feeds.\r\n\r\nFor now, peek at some of these highlights:\r\n\r\n   * [Master Personal Feed](http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/masterfeed) - One big feed blended from 10 other personal metadata feeds pulled from various Web-2.0-ish sites.\r\n   * [Feed to JSON via Magpie](http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/magpiejson) - Get feed data parsed by way of [Magpie](http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/) into JSON data structures\r\n   * [Flickr Favorites Feed](http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/flickrfavorites) - Feed of photos marked as favorites by a Flickr user, pulled via the API\r\n   * [jbox.com scraper](http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/jbox) - Pipeline composed of [HTML Tidy](http://tidy.sourceforge.net/) and XSL to scrape [jbox.com](http://jbox.com/) to build an RSS feed of new items for sale.\r\n\r\nBeyond practical examples, there are some things under the hood that seem keen to me.  Apropos of my [pipes-via-web ramblings](http://decafbad.com/blog/2007/02/15/thoughts-on-pipes-on-the-web-part-ii) back in February, I'm trying out a few different approaches to pipelining feed content through processor modules.  My original FeedMagick relied on feeding URLs to URLs as parameters.  That, unfortunately, can be mighty cumbersome and inefficient.  So, FeedMagick2 explores a few more approaches:\r\n\r\n   * The first and obvious approach is to chain them together in a single script.  So, I've got objects instances that pass content from one to the next.  The thing is, the pipe works in reverse:  The driver script asks the last module in the pipe for content, which then asks the one before it for content, and so on.  At any point along the way, modules can cache the output of previous modules, and refrain from calling up the chain.\r\n\r\n   * The second way to chain pipelines together is just like the first FeedMagick:  Some pipelines start with fetching a URL.  That can be an original feed, or a URL leading to the output of an antecedent pipeline.  And, oh yeah, most pipelines are run via parameterized URLs, so there's that bit of handy recursion.\r\n\r\n   * The third way to chain pipelines together is with HTTP POST:  A pipeline can accept feed data via the request body of an HTTP POST, thus allowing antecedent pipelines (or even cURL scripts) to *push* data into the pipeline rather than getting *pulled* via URL.  This is kind of like my [years-old jiggery pokery](http://decafbad.com/blog/?s=xmlrpc+pipe) with [pipelines via XML-RPC](http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe), only much *much* simpler.\r\n\r\nI'm also poking around at making all of the above available at the command line via PHP-CLI, and I'm having gratuitous fun exploring PEAR to roll my own stripped-down web framework.  I still hate PHP, but I'm at least finding ways to entertain myself while I'm holding my nose.  Of course, I find weird things entertaining.\r\n\r\nAnd, as a side note, the only reason I'm using PHP is because I'd like to play around with the idea of the de facto WordPress installation requirements standard.  That is:  If you can run WordPress, you can run this.  In reality, I don't think I'm there, but I'm hoping to get close.  For one, I'm refusing to play with anything older than PHP 5.\r\n\r\nAnyway, play with it, tell me what you think and give me a reason to keep hacking at it.  :)\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082761\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jamesv.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c82c72ca4f9eab33a80a7bd839c1ae0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://jamesv.org\">jamesv</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082761\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-04-30T11:39:15\">2007-04-30T11:39:15</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Aw man, now I've got to port all the code you wrote while you were here over to this new hotness ;) I really like (and appreciate) the single script approach.</p>\n\n<p>Is caching at a module level done automatically, or is that something I need to flag in my original call?

    "html": "<p>I&#39;ve been trying to get myself serious about writing and even set up a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/skein/\">personal slush pile for my output</a>.  Then, I found <a href=\"http://ficlets.com/authors/l_m_orchard\">Ficlets</a>, and spewed a few quick starter stories there.  And then... I stopped.  I&#39;m hoping to pick it up again very soon, but I guess that&#39;s the nature of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiasm</a>—it doesn&#39;t just apply to hacking.</p>\n<p>So, here&#39;s something ironic:  I just spent a few hours tonight throwing together a hack for <a href=\"http://ficlets.com/authors/l_m_orchard\">Ficlets</a>.  See, <a href=\"http://ficlets.com/authors/l_m_orchard\">Ficlets</a> runs on original stories, comments, ratings, and sequels and prequels to stories.  You can get an Atom feed of an author&#39;s stories and a feed of comments—but it seems like there&#39;s no way to get notified of prequels and sequels, which are a very gratifying part of the whole shebang.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, check out this RSS feed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/www-bin/ficlets.php?author=l_m_orchard\"><code>http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/www-bin/ficlets.php?author=l_m_orchard</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#39;s a blend of all my stories, comments on my stories, as well as prequels and sequels found for my stories.  Subscribing to that feed will give me updates whenever there&#39;s anything new in all the above.  It&#39;s thrown together using a semi-crazy mix of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick\">FeedMagick</a> package for caching, and some XSL for scraping.  If you&#39;d like a feed like this of your own, just replace <code>l_m_orchard</code> for your own author name in the <code>author</code> parameter.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note, however, that this little service is hosted on my site and may go away at any time for any reason.</strong></p>\n<p>In case you&#39;re interested in what&#39;s under the hood, here&#39;s the quick and dirty XSL that&#39;s behind it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/ficlets.xsl\"><code>http://decafbad.com/2007/04/ficlets.xsl</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This thing&#39;s made possible because the <a href=\"http://ficlets.com/authors/l_m_orchard\">Ficlets</a> feeds are XML, <strong>and so are the XHTML pages happily infested with microformats</strong>.  If they ever go invalid, this scraper breaks.  But, that&#39;s the nature of scrapers, and it works for now.  Oh, and although they provide Atom, this feed is RSS 2.0.  Why?  Because it was easier that way.  I might put some more effort into an Atom feed, but my itch has so far been scratched.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084356\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rss-central.net/megalar\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1869681b309d36e59764f51c7f210406&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rss-central.net/megalar\">megalar</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084356\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-04-05T09:31:48\">2007-04-05T09:31:48</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I had already decided I was gonna grab your FeedMagick source and try to do something with it but this just gives me more incentive as a Ficlets lover.

    "body": "I've been trying to get myself serious about writing and even set up a [personal slush pile for my output](http://decafbad.com/skein/).  Then, I found [Ficlets][], and spewed a few quick starter stories there.  And then... I stopped.  I'm hoping to pick it up again very soon, but I guess that's the nature of my [serial enthusiasm](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast)—it doesn't just apply to hacking.\r\n\r\nSo, here's something ironic:  I just spent a few hours tonight throwing together a hack for [Ficlets][].  See, [Ficlets][] runs on original stories, comments, ratings, and sequels and prequels to stories.  You can get an Atom feed of an author's stories and a feed of comments—but it seems like there's no way to get notified of prequels and sequels, which are a very gratifying part of the whole shebang.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, check out this RSS feed:\r\n\r\n   * [`http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/www-bin/ficlets.php?author=l_m_orchard`](http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/www-bin/ficlets.php?author=l_m_orchard)\r\n\r\nThat's a blend of all my stories, comments on my stories, as well as prequels and sequels found for my stories.  Subscribing to that feed will give me updates whenever there's anything new in all the above.  It's thrown together using a semi-crazy mix of my [FeedMagick][] package for caching, and some XSL for scraping.  If you'd like a feed like this of your own, just replace `l_m_orchard` for your own author name in the `author` parameter.\r\n\r\n**Please note, however, that this little service is hosted on my site and may go away at any time for any reason.**\r\n\r\nIn case you're interested in what's under the hood, here's the quick and dirty XSL that's behind it:\r\n\r\n   * [`http://decafbad.com/2007/04/ficlets.xsl`](http://decafbad.com/2007/04/ficlets.xsl)\r\n\r\nThis thing's made possible because the [Ficlets][] feeds are XML, **and so are the XHTML pages happily infested with microformats**.  If they ever go invalid, this scraper breaks.  But, that's the nature of scrapers, and it works for now.  Oh, and although they provide Atom, this feed is RSS 2.0.  Why?  Because it was easier that way.  I might put some more effort into an Atom feed, but my itch has so far been scratched.\r\n\r\n[FeedMagick]: http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick\r\n[ficlets]: http://ficlets.com/authors/l_m_orchard\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084356\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rss-central.net/megalar\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1869681b309d36e59764f51c7f210406&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rss-central.net/megalar\">megalar</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084356\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-04-05T09:31:48\">2007-04-05T09:31:48</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I had already decided I was gonna grab your FeedMagick source and try to do something with it but this just gives me more incentive as a Ficlets lover.

    "html": "<p><strong>Update (15 Mar 2007):</strong> <i>So, long rant, but I may have found my problem - I had set podcasts in iTunes to sync only &quot;unplayed episodes&quot; to the iPod, which also seems to imply that they never sync / record data about having been played.  Or ratings from the iPod, for that matter.  I just changed that setting to &quot;all episodes&quot;, and podcasts seem to be showing up in my Recently Played smart playlist again.  Hopefully this gets me back to where I want to be.</i></p>\n<p><strong>Update (19 Mar 2007):</strong> <i>Hmm, nope.  Recently Played playlist seems to be updating now, but the iScrobbler-to-last.fm bit seems to be ignoring my iPod-played podcasts.  Bah.</i></p>\n<p>Is it just me, or has iTunes been gradually losing podcast tuner functionality with respect to the iPod?  </p>\n<p>I&#39;m seriously thinking of ditching it for <a href=\"http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php\">Juice</a> or something else.  Recently, the podcasts were completely segregated from the rest of the audio files, stuck into a much harder-to-manage interface.  Related to that, my main gripe at the moment is that I just can&#39;t seem to get my podcast listening behavior posted to <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/user/deusx/\">last.fm</a>.  Maybe I&#39;m weird, but I like to capture and publish that attention data from myself.  </p>\n<p>I listen to a <em>lot</em> of podcasts on the commute to and from work, which is part walking and part bus.  In fact, I probably listened to about a dozen episodes of various serials yesterday — but none of them show up in my iPod&#39;s Recently Played smart playlist.  So, subsequently, none made it to <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/user/deusx/\">last.fm</a>.  </p>\n<p>On the (increasingly rare) occasions I happened to listen to music on my iPod this week, those tracks showed up just fine.  And while at my desk, in iTunes itself, I don&#39;t seem to have these issues.  I seem to remember this working better in the past year or so.  For what it&#39;s worth, my podcasts are auto-synced with iTunes, but the rest of my library is manually managed — because I don&#39;t want 20GB of music on my iPod duplicated on my laptop.</p>\n<p>At one point, I remember that the &quot;Last Played&quot; criteria changed from just <em>starting</em> a podcast to <em>completely</em> playing it through.  This made clean up of old podcasts nicer, such that partially-played episodes didn&#39;t get clobbered when I still intended to finish them.  But lately, I&#39;ve stopped podcasts before they finish, because many have lengthy themes at the end or runs of promos I&#39;ve already heard during the day.  So, there go the &quot;Last Played&quot; and &quot;Play Count&quot; fields.</p>\n<p>But, I just tried manually fast-forwarding a few podcast episodes to the end on the iPod.  I tried playing the last few seconds in an attempt to force the play count to trip.  It seemed to work on the iPod itself - but when I reconnected to iTunes, no dice.  The &quot;Recently Played&quot; playlist shows nothing new, and the episode itself reflects no play counts in iTunes.  I&#39;m either very confused, or things are getting more broken.</p>\n<p>So, I thought, maybe I&#39;ll just rate the podcasts about which I want to publish my listening behavior.  Kind of like giving a &quot;digg&quot;.  Seems hackish and not as effortless as simply capturing my behavior - but, nope, I can&#39;t rate podcasts on the iPod.  There goes that idea, and another feature missing.</p>\n<p>Ugh.  So yeah, this is an semi-inarticulate rant about a problem whose issues and solution I don&#39;t quite yet have a handle on.  It&#39;s just frustrating that I don&#39;t seem to be able to easily track my own podcast listening behavior with iTunes and the iPod the way I <em>thought</em> I used to be able to do.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083477\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dschwarz.blogspot.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b6f94d1db720fcf70469e0d29029ff64&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://dschwarz.blogspot.com\">dschwarz</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083477\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-09T22:29:17\">2007-03-09T22:29:17</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>As long as you're ranting about iTunes' podcast management problems, let me mention one of my pet peeves:  I subscribe to a mix of time-sensitive podcasts (news programs) and other podcasts that are not time sensitive.

I'm not seeing features in Juice that will help in this instance.  I can't help with iSproggler, not a user.  I use the iTunes Agent to manage syncs of smart playlists to non-iPod devices.  So I'm no help on the iPod firmware issues either.</p>\n<p>If there is more to your comment on switching to Juice than emotion:\nI did switch from iTunes to Juice about 6 months ago for most of my podcasts.  I kept a couple of feeds behind so I could keep tabs on the changes in behavior.  Since I'm not an iPod owner, I switched to get per feed archive management and preprocessing before import into iTunes.  The default behavior of Juice is to import podcasts into the Music portion of the Library, not the Podcast portion.  That may or may not be a feature for you.  But most of this is likely no news to you.</p>\n<p>You're not alone at feeling like there are changes going on behind the scenes in iTunes/iPod.  Since we all know that Apple can/will change behavior regularly, and some of the behavior changes are subtle, we get spooked easier/more often?</p>\n<p>OT:  Over on the PlayListMag forums there are folks swearing that the changes in behavior for iTunes 7.1, in the CoverFlow viewing mode, that play-selection navigation is not consistent...</p>\n<p>Emotion is good, use the energy...</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083485\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jm3.net/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/jm3.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.jm3.net/\">John Manoogian III (jm3)</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083485\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-27T05:49:40\">2007-03-27T05:49:40</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>i don't speak from experience, here, but would songbird help the podcast situation at all?</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083486\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rss-central.net/home/megalar\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1869681b309d36e59764f51c7f210406&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rss-central.net/home/megalar\">megalar</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221083486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-31T13:50:39\">2007-03-31T13:50:39</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I have had nothing but headaches from itunes, thats why i switched to juice for podcasts.

If you find a good one, please blog about it.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083478\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\">Craig Maloney</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083478\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-10T02:45:47\">2007-03-10T02:45:47</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Damn, you must be waiting for the new Rush album with baited breath. :)</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083479\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083479\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-10T03:12:26\">2007-03-10T03:12:26</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>\"Damn, you must be waiting for the new Rush album with baited breath. :)\"</p>\n\n<p>Why, yes, yes I am.

I'm not seeing features in Juice that will help in this instance.  I can't help with iSproggler, not a user.  I use the iTunes Agent to manage syncs of smart playlists to non-iPod devices.  So I'm no help on the iPod firmware issues either.</p>\n\n<p>If there is more to your comment on switching to Juice than emotion:\nI did switch from iTunes to Juice about 6 months ago for most of my podcasts.  I kept a couple of feeds behind so I could keep tabs on the changes in behavior.  Since I'm not an iPod owner, I switched to get per feed archive management and preprocessing before import into iTunes.  The default behavior of Juice is to import podcasts into the Music portion of the Library, not the Podcast portion.  That may or may not be a feature for you.  But most of this is likely no news to you.</p>\n\n<p>You're not alone at feeling like there are changes going on behind the scenes in iTunes/iPod.  Since we all know that Apple can/will change behavior regularly, and some of the behavior changes are subtle, we get spooked easier/more often?</p>\n\n<p>OT:  Over on the PlayListMag forums there are folks swearing that the changes in behavior for iTunes 7.1, in the CoverFlow viewing mode, that play-selection navigation is not consistent...</p>\n\n<p>Emotion is good, use the energy...</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083485\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.jm3.net/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/jm3.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.jm3.net/\">John Manoogian III (jm3)</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083485\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-27T05:49:40\">2007-03-27T05:49:40</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>i don't speak from experience, here, but would songbird help the podcast situation at all?</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221083486\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rss-central.net/home/megalar\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1869681b309d36e59764f51c7f210406&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rss-central.net/home/megalar\">megalar</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221083486\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-31T13:50:39\">2007-03-31T13:50:39</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I have had nothing but headaches from itunes, thats why i switched to juice for podcasts.

For instance, consider both <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/services/api/auth.spec.html\">Flickr&#39;s</a> and <a href=\"http://upcoming.org/services/api/token_auth.php\">Upcoming&#39;s</a> 3rd party token-based authentication / authorization schemes.</p>\n<p>In particular, I&#39;m looking at things like del.icio.us&#39; own Daily Blog Post and others.  These can be used to auto-post content to one&#39;s blog generated elsewhere - but at the price of sharing login details.  Granted, you can mostly trust these 3rd parties not to do anything nasty with your credentials, but it would be nice not to have to.</p>\n<p>I figure that something RESTful like extending HTTP authentication (ala <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/12/17/dive.html\">Atom Authentication</a>) with a token scheme could be interesting, and possibly fit nicely into <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html\">APP</a> itself.  It could probably be retrofit into the <a href=\"http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi\">MetaWeblog API</a> by specifying a per-app user name and password.  I can imagine a WordPress admin plugin that issues approved authentication tokens to restrict the categories and other activities allowed by 3rd party apps.  </p>\n<p>Just something I&#39;m thinking about, as more services may or may not grow into delegated blog posting.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084462\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://beesbuzz.biz/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/plaidfluff.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://beesbuzz.biz/\">fluffy</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084462\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-05T22:40:26\">2007-03-05T22:40:26</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Wouldn't openID be a better candidate for this?</p></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084463\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084463\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-05T22:48:24\">2007-03-05T22:48:24</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Not really, unless I don't entirely understand OpenID.  </p>\n<p>OpenID offers way to authenticate <em>yourself</em>.

    "body": "Here's something I've been meaning to post about, brought back to mind from [Kim Cameron's post on \"Wrong-headed impersonation\"][kc]:  \r\n\r\nI wish that blog posting interfaces (ie. [MetaWeblog API][ma] and [Atom Publishing Protocol][app]) offered a way to delegate blog posting to a 3rd party app (desktop or web) in such a way as to avoid providing one's login details (i.e. user name and password).  For instance, consider both [Flickr's][fa] and [Upcoming's][ua] 3rd party token-based authentication / authorization schemes.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I'm looking at things like del.icio.us' own Daily Blog Post and others.  These can be used to auto-post content to one's blog generated elsewhere - but at the price of sharing login details.  Granted, you can mostly trust these 3rd parties not to do anything nasty with your credentials, but it would be nice not to have to.\r\n\r\nI figure that something RESTful like extending HTTP authentication (ala [Atom Authentication][aa]) with a token scheme could be interesting, and possibly fit nicely into [APP][app] itself.  It could probably be retrofit into the [MetaWeblog API][ma] by specifying a per-app user name and password.  I can imagine a WordPress admin plugin that issues approved authentication tokens to restrict the categories and other activities allowed by 3rd party apps.  \r\n\r\nJust something I'm thinking about, as more services may or may not grow into delegated blog posting.\r\n\r\n[aa]: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/12/17/dive.html\r\n[ma]: http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi\r\n[app]: http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html\r\n[fa]: http://www.flickr.com/services/api/auth.spec.html\r\n[ua]: http://upcoming.org/services/api/token_auth.php\r\n[kc]: http://www.identityblog.com/?p=701\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084462\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://beesbuzz.biz/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/plaidfluff.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://beesbuzz.biz/\">fluffy</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084462\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-05T22:40:26\">2007-03-05T22:40:26</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Wouldn't openID be a better candidate for this?</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084463\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=2377f34a68801b861c3e54e1301f0dce&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.decafbad.com\">l.m.orchard</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084463\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-03-05T22:48:24\">2007-03-05T22:48:24</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Not really, unless I don't entirely understand OpenID.  </p>\n\n<p>OpenID offers way to authenticate <em>yourself</em>.

I work at Yahoo! — so I guess I&#39;m vulnerable to bias — but it seems like the guys on this team just can&#39;t get a break.  They open up public suggestion boards to get open feedback on products — something that I think is very cool and clueful.  They took inspiration from Digg and other prior examples of web-based voting, and what do they get for their trouble?  A few hundred lemmings marching to the beat of &quot;OMFG HAX YOU STOLE DIGGS SITE!&quot;</p>\n<p>It&#39;s not a major news site; it&#39;s not like the front page of Yahoo! turned into a Digg clone and they started offering to pay top Digg users.  Seriously - it&#39;s just a suggestion board with simple flat comment threads that invites voting to surface good suggestions.  So it&#39;s got a big thumbs-up button reminiscent of <a href=\"http://digg.com\">Digg</a>&#39;s counter badges - they mentioned that it&#39;s like <a href=\"http://digg.com\">Digg</a>.  That&#39;s inspiration, maybe flattery-level imitation.  But theft?

I work at Yahoo! — so I guess I'm vulnerable to bias — but it seems like the guys on this team just can't get a break.  They open up public suggestion boards to get open feedback on products — something that I think is very cool and clueful.  They took inspiration from Digg and other prior examples of web-based voting, and what do they get for their trouble?  A few hundred lemmings marching to the beat of \"OMFG HAX YOU STOLE DIGGS SITE!\"\r\n\r\nIt's not a major news site; it's not like the front page of Yahoo! turned into a Digg clone and they started offering to pay top Digg users.  Seriously - it's just a suggestion board with simple flat comment threads that invites voting to surface good suggestions.  So it's got a big thumbs-up button reminiscent of [Digg][]'s counter badges - they mentioned that it's like [Digg][].  That's inspiration, maybe flattery-level imitation.  But theft?  If I were a thief, would I tell you where I stole my stuff from?\r\n\r\n[digg]: http://digg.com\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082493\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://negatendo.net/~brett/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4c39d783a464ec45de052c62873b4ac0&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://negatendo.net/~brett/\">Brett</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082493\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-02-15T17:06:18\">2007-02-15T17:06:18</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Digg always makes me think of: <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/01/mob_justice.html\n\">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/01/mob_justice.html</a></p>\n\n<p>\"piling on is safe and fun\"</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082494\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\">Craig</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221082494\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-02-15T18:37:08\">2007-02-15T18:37:08</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Delete this if you think this is off topic, but am I the only person on the planet that doesn't quite understand the allure of Digg?

Consider an idempotent GET request as a pure function call with no side-effects.  Then, consider a GET request that accepts a URL as a parameter — it&#39;s a nested function call: the outer GET must make an inner GET to fetch the parameter-supplied URL.  Give the inner URL another URL as a parameter, and you&#39;ve got yet another nested function call.  </p>\n<p>But, if you like, ignore the theoretical <a href=\"http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html\">benefits of functional programming</a> — flip the nested function calls inside out and you&#39;ve got a pipe.

Because, um, you know that bit he says about supporting undo up there?  That sounds oddly familiar.  \r\n\r\nOh yeah.  That's right.  [I implemented undo in XoxoOutliner][undo] back in November - and not very well, at that.  And, though I've got thoughts on how to implement it better - command pattern and all that - the fact remains that there are other apps that do most of what I've been playing with for this thing.\r\n\r\nIt's been some cool recreational programming, but I do have to admit this:  \r\n\r\nI started [XoxoOutliner][] as a sort of [yak shaving][yak] effort to provide me with a more nifty tool for idea management and writing - while at the same time giving me an excuse to not yet actually get down to the work of writing.\r\n\r\nMaybe I should just shell out for [a Tinderbox upgrade][tinderbox] and get down to writing again.

    "html": "<p>I think I&#39;m getting to a point where I need to do some personal rebalancing.  There are some things that I tell myself I&#39;d rather I was doing besides working in the day and playing World of Warcraft at night.  Some of them include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exploring San Francisco, the South Bay, and other interesting areas around here.</li>\n<li>Working on <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a> and other products of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiasm</a>.</li>\n<li>Continuing one of the half-dozen or so short stories I&#39;ve started.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The problem is that WoW gives such tasty little morsels of pseudo-achievement, and lately it&#39;s filled the spot for lunchtime babble at work that sports would occupy for other groups.  So, it&#39;s got some real-world rewards, but it&#39;s certainly not benefiting me in terms of personal growth - no matter how interesting I think the thing might be for <a href=\"http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/12/31/wow_talk_at_23c3.html\">The Future of Work</a> and all that.  But, you know, I could have just vegged out playing WoW back in Michigan.  There are Things to Do out here in California, and I&#39;ve got a lovely wife with whom to do them.</p>\n<p>As for exploring the area:  Alex and I have started making tentative forays the past couple of weeks.  Last week was a somewhat uninspiring trip to nearby downtown San Jose, which strangely seemed abandoned and under construction alternating by block.  The weekend before was a trip to the city to see Hayes Valley and North Beach, which was markedly more entertaining and worthwhile.  </p>\n<p>This weekend, I&#39;m recovering a bit on the couch.  Since recovering from <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/18/just-call-me-crash\">the crash</a>, I&#39;ve got quite a bit more mobility - but a full day of walking tends to drag me down for the next week or so.  I think we need to get around to hooking up with some friendly people around here for dinner, drinks, games, TV, and whatnot.  The only thing besides my leg that&#39;s troublesome is that I&#39;m an introvert - being around people is a drain, not an energizing agent.  That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t enjoy meeting people and being in interesting conversations, it&#39;s just that it costs me energy that makes me tend toward being a hermit.  So, eh, something to work against.</p>\n<p>As for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a>, I think it&#39;s in an interesting state: It works great for me for idea capture and simple outlining on my laptop under Firefox, but sucks completely in MSIE on Windows.  Thus, the itch is somewhat scratched, but doesn&#39;t offer much to anyone else but me.  I&#39;ve got a big list of planned work for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a> and some bugs to fix, but none of them have been compellingly itchy enough to re-trigger my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiasm</a>.  And, as I&#39;ve learned, I just can&#39;t guilt-trip or wish this enthusiasm into action.  If I don&#39;t feel like doing it, I don&#39;t get much done, regardless of how much potential I think this project might have in the abstract.</p>\n<p>As for writing:  I haven&#39;t done much writing since finishing the last book, though something I really want to <em>be</em> when I grow up (along with being a Computer Scientist) is a writer.  So, sooner or later, I want to actively pick up again.  I also figure it might be a future career option when my brain&#39;s gotten too addled (or just plain fed up) to be very effective as a coder.  And, I&#39;ve got craploads of story ideas that I&#39;d like to try out.  </p>\n<p>Stories ideas are cheap, though - it&#39;s the execution that counts.  I&#39;ve got to find a writing group or some arrangement that doesn&#39;t have me doing it in a vacuum.  I&#39;ve thought about starting up a separate writing blog and committing to a few hundred words a night of raw output, but not sure what that would do for me.  I might even just do it here, but not sure how it&#39;d be received.</p>\n<p>Anyway - just a wordy brain dump, partly for anyone who may be interested to hear it and partly just to get it out of my head.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086649\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://donovanwatts.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=188ad8b4dc99107d22c8b868e45f0508&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://donovanwatts.com\">Donovan Watts</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221086649\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-21T21:36:38\">2007-01-21T21:36:38</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Hi Les.

    "body": "I think I'm getting to a point where I need to do some personal rebalancing.  There are some things that I tell myself I'd rather I was doing besides working in the day and playing World of Warcraft at night.  Some of them include:\r\n\r\n* Exploring San Francisco, the South Bay, and other interesting areas around here.\r\n* Working on [XoxoOutliner](http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner) and other products of [serial enthusiasm](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast).\r\n* Continuing one of the half-dozen or so short stories I've started.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that WoW gives such tasty little morsels of pseudo-achievement, and lately it's filled the spot for lunchtime babble at work that sports would occupy for other groups.  So, it's got some real-world rewards, but it's certainly not benefiting me in terms of personal growth - no matter how interesting I think the thing might be for [The Future of Work](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/12/31/wow_talk_at_23c3.html) and all that.  But, you know, I could have just vegged out playing WoW back in Michigan.  There are Things to Do out here in California, and I've got a lovely wife with whom to do them.\r\n\r\nAs for exploring the area:  Alex and I have started making tentative forays the past couple of weeks.  Last week was a somewhat uninspiring trip to nearby downtown San Jose, which strangely seemed abandoned and under construction alternating by block.  The weekend before was a trip to the city to see Hayes Valley and North Beach, which was markedly more entertaining and worthwhile.  \r\n\r\nThis weekend, I'm recovering a bit on the couch.  Since recovering from [the crash](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/18/just-call-me-crash), I've got quite a bit more mobility - but a full day of walking tends to drag me down for the next week or so.  I think we need to get around to hooking up with some friendly people around here for dinner, drinks, games, TV, and whatnot.  The only thing besides my leg that's troublesome is that I'm an introvert - being around people is a drain, not an energizing agent.  That's not to say I don't enjoy meeting people and being in interesting conversations, it's just that it costs me energy that makes me tend toward being a hermit.  So, eh, something to work against.\r\n\r\nAs for [XoxoOutliner](http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner), I think it's in an interesting state: It works great for me for idea capture and simple outlining on my laptop under Firefox, but sucks completely in MSIE on Windows.  Thus, the itch is somewhat scratched, but doesn't offer much to anyone else but me.  I've got a big list of planned work for [XoxoOutliner](http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner) and some bugs to fix, but none of them have been compellingly itchy enough to re-trigger my [serial enthusiasm](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast).  And, as I've learned, I just can't guilt-trip or wish this enthusiasm into action.  If I don't feel like doing it, I don't get much done, regardless of how much potential I think this project might have in the abstract.\r\n\r\nAs for writing:  I haven't done much writing since finishing the last book, though something I really want to *be* when I grow up (along with being a Computer Scientist) is a writer.  So, sooner or later, I want to actively pick up again.  I also figure it might be a future career option when my brain's gotten too addled (or just plain fed up) to be very effective as a coder.  And, I've got craploads of story ideas that I'd like to try out.  \r\n\r\nStories ideas are cheap, though - it's the execution that counts.  I've got to find a writing group or some arrangement that doesn't have me doing it in a vacuum.  I've thought about starting up a separate writing blog and committing to a few hundred words a night of raw output, but not sure what that would do for me.  I might even just do it here, but not sure how it'd be received.\r\n\r\nAnyway - just a wordy brain dump, partly for anyone who may be interested to hear it and partly just to get it out of my head.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086649\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://donovanwatts.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=188ad8b4dc99107d22c8b868e45f0508&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://donovanwatts.com\">Donovan Watts</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086649\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-21T21:36:38\">2007-01-21T21:36:38</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hi Les.

For what it's worth, the Vienna team is working on BlogLines integration.</p>\n\n<p>@jose: Not sure when you tried Vienna last - it seems to have improved markedly, though that might just be my mileage with the MacBook Pro now.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085601\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e3b46099c3fd3844c4539b27f143fd97&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\">Michal Migurski</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085601\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-03T08:17:14\">2007-01-03T08:17:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I almost feel bad for wanting to switch. =)</p>\n\n<p>Vienna is <em>really good</em>.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085602\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7b3073e125f3ac8f09130950ef5d7790&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\">brian cors</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085602\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-03T16:45:29\">2007-01-03T16:45:29</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I checked out Vienna today a bit, and it's mucho nice.</p>\n\n<p>However, the one thing that I use the most on NNW is the ability to sync to NewsGator.  I use that on my cell to read feeds when I am out and about, and not at the desk.  And that setup is particularly nice because it syncs history between NewsGator and NNW, so I dont end up reading things again that I have already read.</p>\n\n<p>I'll definitely look at this as a freeware feed aggregator to use at work though, on our workstations.  I need to get a decent, easy to use one for people here to learn about RSS.  This might be the ticket.
