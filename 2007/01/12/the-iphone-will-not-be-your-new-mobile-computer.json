The last thing you want is to have loaded three apps on your phone and then you go to make a call and it doesn’t work anymore. These are more like iPods than they are like computers.”</blockquote><div class=\"quotesource\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/technology/12apple.html?ex=1326258000&en=905b9e9dd858350d&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss\">Steve Jobs Walks the Tightrope Again - New York Times</a></div>\nI understand what Apple&#39;s after here - a mobile environment is a whole lot less palatable when it&#39;s got crashes and glitches like the desktop and laptop world.  But, I have been known to <a href=\"http://ipodlinux.org/Main_Page\">run Linux on my iPod</a>, so I like to crack the closed shell on devices that go in my pockets.  Hopefully the iPhone&#39;s lockdown is more of a &quot;keep out&quot; sign, rather than a sealed vault.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090223\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.sencer.de\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=0e94b4d4662542b91df48f0ff3b36d26&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.sencer.de\">Sencer</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090223\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-12T16:11:07\">2007-01-12T16:11:07</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Of course there are hardware manufacturers that build smartphones which are interested in an open platform and a software eco-system. Like the greenphone (trolltech) or the FIC Neo 1973, which I am personally more excited about, because all of the phones software will be opensourced (and the first gen has a more affordable price, too). Iin fact the software of the phone is more like a platform (openmoko) that will in the long term hopefully run on all kinds of hardware, and it decidedly different than all the other platforms, because it is not restricted to a sandbox, but allows access to all the software and hardware.</p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221090224&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bf1e672f5e54581db4e6d45b7030d286&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Steven&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221090224&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2007-01-12T19:35:44&quot;&gt;2007-01-12T19:35:44&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t heard of a major crisis being caused by user-installed software on (1) Symbian phones, (2) Palm phones, (3) Java phones, (4) Windows phones.
