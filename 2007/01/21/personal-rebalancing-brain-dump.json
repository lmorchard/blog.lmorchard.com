There are some things that I tell myself I&#39;d rather I was doing besides working in the day and playing World of Warcraft at night.  Some of them include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exploring San Francisco, the South Bay, and other interesting areas around here.</li>\n<li>Working on <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a> and other products of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiasm</a>.</li>\n<li>Continuing one of the half-dozen or so short stories I&#39;ve started.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The problem is that WoW gives such tasty little morsels of pseudo-achievement, and lately it&#39;s filled the spot for lunchtime babble at work that sports would occupy for other groups.  So, it&#39;s got some real-world rewards, but it&#39;s certainly not benefiting me in terms of personal growth - no matter how interesting I think the thing might be for <a href=\"http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/12/31/wow_talk_at_23c3.html\">The Future of Work</a> and all that.  But, you know, I could have just vegged out playing WoW back in Michigan.  There are Things to Do out here in California, and I&#39;ve got a lovely wife with whom to do them.</p>\n<p>As for exploring the area:  Alex and I have started making tentative forays the past couple of weeks.  Last week was a somewhat uninspiring trip to nearby downtown San Jose, which strangely seemed abandoned and under construction alternating by block.  The weekend before was a trip to the city to see Hayes Valley and North Beach, which was markedly more entertaining and worthwhile.  </p>\n<p>This weekend, I&#39;m recovering a bit on the couch.  Since recovering from <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/18/just-call-me-crash\">the crash</a>, I&#39;ve got quite a bit more mobility - but a full day of walking tends to drag me down for the next week or so.  I think we need to get around to hooking up with some friendly people around here for dinner, drinks, games, TV, and whatnot.  The only thing besides my leg that&#39;s troublesome is that I&#39;m an introvert - being around people is a drain, not an energizing agent.  That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t enjoy meeting people and being in interesting conversations, it&#39;s just that it costs me energy that makes me tend toward being a hermit.  So, eh, something to work against.</p>\n<p>As for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a>, I think it&#39;s in an interesting state: It works great for me for idea capture and simple outlining on my laptop under Firefox, but sucks completely in MSIE on Windows.  Thus, the itch is somewhat scratched, but doesn&#39;t offer much to anyone else but me.  I&#39;ve got a big list of planned work for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a> and some bugs to fix, but none of them have been compellingly itchy enough to re-trigger my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiasm</a>.  And, as I&#39;ve learned, I just can&#39;t guilt-trip or wish this enthusiasm into action.  If I don&#39;t feel like doing it, I don&#39;t get much done, regardless of how much potential I think this project might have in the abstract.</p>\n<p>As for writing:  I haven&#39;t done much writing since finishing the last book, though something I really want to <em>be</em> when I grow up (along with being a Computer Scientist) is a writer.  So, sooner or later, I want to actively pick up again.  I also figure it might be a future career option when my brain&#39;s gotten too addled (or just plain fed up) to be very effective as a coder.  And, I&#39;ve got craploads of story ideas that I&#39;d like to try out.  </p>\n<p>Stories ideas are cheap, though - it&#39;s the execution that counts.  I&#39;ve got to find a writing group or some arrangement that doesn&#39;t have me doing it in a vacuum.  I&#39;ve thought about starting up a separate writing blog and committing to a few hundred words a night of raw output, but not sure what that would do for me.  I might even just do it here, but not sure how it&#39;d be received.</p>\n<p>Anyway - just a wordy brain dump, partly for anyone who may be interested to hear it and partly just to get it out of my head.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086649\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://donovanwatts.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=188ad8b4dc99107d22c8b868e45f0508&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://donovanwatts.com\">Donovan Watts</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086649\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-21T21:36:38\">2007-01-21T21:36:38</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hi Les.
