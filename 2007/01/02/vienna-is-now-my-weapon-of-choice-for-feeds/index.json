Some tie up my laptop in terms of memory and CPU, some aren't fast enough UI-wise to help me really blaze through skimming, and some aren't flexible enough for me to tweak to my particular liking.</p>\n<p>At this point, though, <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a> comes really close to what I've been wanting for years.  It's open source (<a href=\"http://vienna-rss.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vienna-rss/trunk/2.1.0/\">check it out!</a>); uses WebKit to offer a <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna_styles.php\">theme-able</a> feed item display (<a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/02/12/colloquy-irc\">hello Colloquy!</a>); and uses SQLite 3 for persistence (<a href=\"http://vienna-rss.sourceforge.net/public/DatabaseSchema.pdf\">with schema documentation!</a>).  Out of the box, it's a pretty nice app, but it was even nicer when I started poking under the hood.  I've even <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=31310885&amp;forum_id=48723\">submitted my first small patch</a>, which got accepted into the codebase.</p>\n<p>When last I tried <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a>, it was on my poor old PowerBook G4 12\" 867Mhz and it was a somewhat rough and bad tasting experience.  At the time, <a href=\"http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire\">NetNewsWire</a> was my tool of choice, and <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a> was lacking some features - like, say, a user-sortable list of subscription folders and feeds.  It also thrashed a lot and generally made me Force Quit it and move on.  But now, on my new-ish MacBook Pro, the performance is stellar with my set of 500+ feeds and my few showstopper missing features are no longer missing.  </p>\n<p>Now, it seems like <a href=\"http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire\">NetNewsWire</a> is the app that thrashes for me and gets a Force Quit.  I need to try <a href=\"http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire\">NNW</a> a bit more and figure out if it's just my initial import of subscriptions that drags things down - but <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a>'s got me now.  It's catching up mightily fast with the feature list of NNW.  And, nothing beats open source software for tossing in a few tweaks to things that are just <em>not quite</em> doing what I'd like.</p>\n<p>Again, since I'm a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiast</a>, I have no idea if I'll be a regular contributor of patches to <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a> or even offer any commitment to the project - but I'm definitely happy with it at the moment.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085597\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\"></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://decafbad.net\">Craig</a>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#comment-221085597\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-02T22:20:49\">2007-01-02T22:20:49</time></a></p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Not sure if you care much for web-based aggregators, but ReBlog is my current favorite.

ReBlog i've used before, too, but actually as a sort of newsdesk for a team at work - they skimmed through news stories and flagged items for republishing, which our CMS then plucked out of the outgoing ReBlog RSS feed.  Nice aggregator.  But, for me, nothing beats a desktop aggregator for swift skimming speed.  For what it's worth, the Vienna team is working on BlogLines integration.</p>\n\n<p>@jose: Not sure when you tried Vienna last - it seems to have improved markedly, though that might just be my mileage with the MacBook Pro now.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085601\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e3b46099c3fd3844c4539b27f143fd97&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\">Michal Migurski</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085601\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-03T08:17:14\">2007-01-03T08:17:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I almost feel bad for wanting to switch. =)</p>\n\n<p>Vienna is <em>really good</em>.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085602\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7b3073e125f3ac8f09130950ef5d7790&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\">brian cors</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085602\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-03T16:45:29\">2007-01-03T16:45:29</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I checked out Vienna today a bit, and it's mucho nice.</p>\n\n<p>However, the one thing that I use the most on NNW is the ability to sync to NewsGator.  I use that on my cell to read feeds when I am out and about, and not at the desk.  And that setup is particularly nice because it syncs history between NewsGator and NNW, so I dont end up reading things again that I have already read.</p>\n\n<p>I'll definitely look at this as a freeware feed aggregator to use at work though, on our workstations.  I need to get a decent, easy to use one for people here to learn about RSS.  This might be the ticket.
