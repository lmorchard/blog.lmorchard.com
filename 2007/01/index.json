    "html": "<p>I think I&#39;m getting to a point where I need to do some personal rebalancing.  There are some things that I tell myself I&#39;d rather I was doing besides working in the day and playing World of Warcraft at night.  Some of them include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exploring San Francisco, the South Bay, and other interesting areas around here.</li>\n<li>Working on <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a> and other products of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiasm</a>.</li>\n<li>Continuing one of the half-dozen or so short stories I&#39;ve started.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The problem is that WoW gives such tasty little morsels of pseudo-achievement, and lately it&#39;s filled the spot for lunchtime babble at work that sports would occupy for other groups.  So, it&#39;s got some real-world rewards, but it&#39;s certainly not benefiting me in terms of personal growth - no matter how interesting I think the thing might be for <a href=\"http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/12/31/wow_talk_at_23c3.html\">The Future of Work</a> and all that.  But, you know, I could have just vegged out playing WoW back in Michigan.  There are Things to Do out here in California, and I&#39;ve got a lovely wife with whom to do them.</p>\n<p>As for exploring the area:  Alex and I have started making tentative forays the past couple of weeks.  Last week was a somewhat uninspiring trip to nearby downtown San Jose, which strangely seemed abandoned and under construction alternating by block.  The weekend before was a trip to the city to see Hayes Valley and North Beach, which was markedly more entertaining and worthwhile.  </p>\n<p>This weekend, I&#39;m recovering a bit on the couch.  Since recovering from <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/18/just-call-me-crash\">the crash</a>, I&#39;ve got quite a bit more mobility - but a full day of walking tends to drag me down for the next week or so.  I think we need to get around to hooking up with some friendly people around here for dinner, drinks, games, TV, and whatnot.  The only thing besides my leg that&#39;s troublesome is that I&#39;m an introvert - being around people is a drain, not an energizing agent.  That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t enjoy meeting people and being in interesting conversations, it&#39;s just that it costs me energy that makes me tend toward being a hermit.  So, eh, something to work against.</p>\n<p>As for <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner\">XoxoOutliner</a>, I think it&#39;s in an interesting state: It works great for me for idea capture and simple outlining on my laptop under Firefox, but sucks completely in MSIE on Windows.

    "body": "I think I'm getting to a point where I need to do some personal rebalancing.  There are some things that I tell myself I'd rather I was doing besides working in the day and playing World of Warcraft at night.  Some of them include:\r\n\r\n* Exploring San Francisco, the South Bay, and other interesting areas around here.\r\n* Working on [XoxoOutliner](http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner) and other products of [serial enthusiasm](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast).\r\n* Continuing one of the half-dozen or so short stories I've started.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that WoW gives such tasty little morsels of pseudo-achievement, and lately it's filled the spot for lunchtime babble at work that sports would occupy for other groups.  So, it's got some real-world rewards, but it's certainly not benefiting me in terms of personal growth - no matter how interesting I think the thing might be for [The Future of Work](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/12/31/wow_talk_at_23c3.html) and all that.  But, you know, I could have just vegged out playing WoW back in Michigan.  There are Things to Do out here in California, and I've got a lovely wife with whom to do them.\r\n\r\nAs for exploring the area:  Alex and I have started making tentative forays the past couple of weeks.  Last week was a somewhat uninspiring trip to nearby downtown San Jose, which strangely seemed abandoned and under construction alternating by block.  The weekend before was a trip to the city to see Hayes Valley and North Beach, which was markedly more entertaining and worthwhile.  \r\n\r\nThis weekend, I'm recovering a bit on the couch.  Since recovering from [the crash](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/18/just-call-me-crash), I've got quite a bit more mobility - but a full day of walking tends to drag me down for the next week or so.  I think we need to get around to hooking up with some friendly people around here for dinner, drinks, games, TV, and whatnot.  The only thing besides my leg that's troublesome is that I'm an introvert - being around people is a drain, not an energizing agent.  That's not to say I don't enjoy meeting people and being in interesting conversations, it's just that it costs me energy that makes me tend toward being a hermit.  So, eh, something to work against.\r\n\r\nAs for [XoxoOutliner](http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner), I think it's in an interesting state: It works great for me for idea capture and simple outlining on my laptop under Firefox, but sucks completely in MSIE on Windows.  Thus, the itch is somewhat scratched, but doesn't offer much to anyone else but me.  I've got a big list of planned work for [XoxoOutliner](http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner) and some bugs to fix, but none of them have been compellingly itchy enough to re-trigger my [serial enthusiasm](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast).  And, as I've learned, I just can't guilt-trip or wish this enthusiasm into action.  If I don't feel like doing it, I don't get much done, regardless of how much potential I think this project might have in the abstract.\r\n\r\nAs for writing:  I haven't done much writing since finishing the last book, though something I really want to *be* when I grow up (along with being a Computer Scientist) is a writer.  So, sooner or later, I want to actively pick up again.  I also figure it might be a future career option when my brain's gotten too addled (or just plain fed up) to be very effective as a coder.

I've thought about starting up a separate writing blog and committing to a few hundred words a night of raw output, but not sure what that would do for me.  I might even just do it here, but not sure how it'd be received.\r\n\r\nAnyway - just a wordy brain dump, partly for anyone who may be interested to hear it and partly just to get it out of my head.\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086649\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://donovanwatts.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=188ad8b4dc99107d22c8b868e45f0508&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://donovanwatts.com\">Donovan Watts</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086649\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-21T21:36:38\">2007-01-21T21:36:38</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Hi Les.

Iin fact the software of the phone is more like a platform (openmoko) that will in the long term hopefully run on all kinds of hardware, and it decidedly different than all the other platforms, because it is not restricted to a sandbox, but allows access to all the software and hardware.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090224\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bf1e672f5e54581db4e6d45b7030d286&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Steven</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090224\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-12T19:35:44\">2007-01-12T19:35:44</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I haven't heard of a major crisis being caused by user-installed software on (1) Symbian phones, (2) Palm phones, (3) Java phones, (4) Windows phones.

Buff your stats so your avatar can finish better quests to get better items and start the whole cycle anew.*\r\n\r\nBut, alas, I don't know anything about auctions or markets, and I don't like people enough in the general case to put up with running an online game unless it made me piles of (actual) money and I never had to answer a support email.  :)\r\n\r\n[IdleRPG]: http://jotun.ultrazone.org/g7/\r\n[pq]: http://www.progressquest.com/\r\n[ah]: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/auctionhouses.shtml\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088279\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.jm3.net/\"><img src=\"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/jm3.jpg\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.jm3.net/\">John Manoogian III (jm3)</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088279\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-03T04:46:13\">2007-01-03T04:46:13</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>plus five mousepad of exalted jerking for coining the phase, \"buff your stats\"</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221088280\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=02ffe238ed68da35e8037df461552234&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://www.mpwilson.com/uccu/\">Mad William Flint</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221088280\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-03T13:23:29\">2007-01-03T13:23:29</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>EvE, I'm tellin ya.

It&#39;s open source (<a href=\"http://vienna-rss.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vienna-rss/trunk/2.1.0/\">check it out!</a>); uses WebKit to offer a <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna_styles.php\">theme-able</a> feed item display (<a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/02/12/colloquy-irc\">hello Colloquy!</a>); and uses SQLite 3 for persistence (<a href=\"http://vienna-rss.sourceforge.net/public/DatabaseSchema.pdf\">with schema documentation!</a>).  Out of the box, it&#39;s a pretty nice app, but it was even nicer when I started poking under the hood.  I&#39;ve even <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=31310885&amp;forum_id=48723\">submitted my first small patch</a>, which got accepted into the codebase.</p>\n<p>When last I tried <a href=\"http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\">Vienna</a>, it was on my poor old PowerBook G4 12&quot; 867Mhz and it was a somewhat rough and bad tasting experience.

And, nothing beats open source software for tossing in a few tweaks to things that are just *not quite* doing what I'd like.\r\n\r\nAgain, since I'm a [serial enthusiast][se], I have no idea if I'll be a regular contributor of patches to [Vienna][] or even offer any commitment to the project - but I'm definitely happy with it at the moment.\r\n\r\n[vpatch]: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=31310885&forum_id=48723\r\n[vt]: http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna_styles.php\r\n[vsvn]: http://vienna-rss.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vienna-rss/trunk/2.1.0/\r\n[vdb]: http://vienna-rss.sourceforge.net/public/DatabaseSchema.pdf\r\n[wk]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/02/12/colloquy-irc\r\n[Vienna]: http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php\r\n[NetNewsWire]: http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire\r\n[l1]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/18/good-gregarius\r\n[l2]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/12/further-work-on-decafbadnewsriver\r\n[l3]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/05/feedspool-is-progressing-nicely\r\n[l4]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/08/05/introducing-dbagg3-an-atom-powered-clientserver-aggregator\r\n[se]: http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\r\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085597\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ab21890e84fd31ff0d651d77bc82d118&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://decafbad.net\">Craig</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085597\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-02T22:20:49\">2007-01-02T22:20:49</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>Not sure if you care much for web-based aggregators, but ReBlog is my current favorite.

ReBlog i've used before, too, but actually as a sort of newsdesk for a team at work - they skimmed through news stories and flagged items for republishing, which our CMS then plucked out of the outgoing ReBlog RSS feed.  Nice aggregator.  But, for me, nothing beats a desktop aggregator for swift skimming speed.  For what it's worth, the Vienna team is working on BlogLines integration.</p>\n\n<p>@jose: Not sure when you tried Vienna last - it seems to have improved markedly, though that might just be my mileage with the MacBook Pro now.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085601\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e3b46099c3fd3844c4539b27f143fd97&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://mike.teczno.com\">Michal Migurski</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085601\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-03T08:17:14\">2007-01-03T08:17:14</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I almost feel bad for wanting to switch. =)</p>\n\n<p>Vienna is <em>really good</em>.</p></div>\n            \n        </li>\n    \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221085602\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7b3073e125f3ac8f09130950ef5d7790&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://brian.cors.org\">brian cors</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221085602\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-01-03T16:45:29\">2007-01-03T16:45:29</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I checked out Vienna today a bit, and it's mucho nice.</p>\n\n<p>However, the one thing that I use the most on NNW is the ability to sync to NewsGator.

And that setup is particularly nice because it syncs history between NewsGator and NNW, so I dont end up reading things again that I have already read.</p>\n\n<p>I'll definitely look at this as a freeware feed aggregator to use at work though, on our workstations.
