And, that&#39;s because my email address hasn&#39;t changed — thanks very much to the wonderful and awesome <a href=\"http://pobox.com/\">Pobox.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Likewise, I&#39;ve hopped from platform to platform in blogging and writing and generally emitting memelets from my brain.  In contrast to <a href=\"http://pobox.com/\">Pobox.com</a> though, anyone who could be bothered to follow me would have had to keep track of every new feed and site which happened to strike my fancy.  Knowing myself, I don&#39;t expect that my wandering ways to change — so the number of feeds in which my stuff lands will only increase.</p>\n<p>So, I&#39;d like to fix that.  In case you haven&#39;t seen it, <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/accum/\">I&#39;ve started building an Accumulator</a> for all the various feeds and accounts between which I&#39;m distributing my attention and User Generated Content these days.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m hoping to make this the definitive one-stop-shop for following me and my crap, eventually offering feeds at the root of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/\">decafbad.com</a> with facilities for picking and choosing what to include and what to leave out.  Hopefully, this will leave me able to just simply point interested parties at <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/\">decafbad.com</a>, and let them explore from there — rather than wandering over to this blog that&#39;s mostly quiet these days.</p>\n<p>And, of course, if in the end no one actually cares about my spew anyway — at least I&#39;ll have had fun with yet another new project.</p>\n<p>Oh, and Happy Holidays to you and yours!</p>\n"}
