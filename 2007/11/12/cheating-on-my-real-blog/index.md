<a href="http://decafbad.com/recaffeinated/index.html">decafbad recaffeinated</a> is what I'm so far calling the <a href="http://eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a>-built blog with which I'm cheating on both my <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/">OPML blog</a> and my "real" blog.  Come take a look, if you're so inclined to watch another of my experiments.  (*Update*:  It's recaffeinated, not recaffinated.  I ar gud speler.)
