Really, everyone else around the blogosphere seems to be covering things satisfactorily.  However, I have been idly working on a new project over the past few weeks, namely a total rewrite and redesign of <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/?s=feedmagick\">my format-ignorant feed filtering and munging kit dubbed FeedMagick</a>.</p>\n<p>You can find <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/\">a demo installation of FeedMagick2 here</a> and find it <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/FeedMagick2/\">ready for checkout from SVN over here</a>.  It&#39;s basically just a step away from being a proof of concept, but I&#39;m hoping to get around to fleshing out docs and battening down the hatches with tests.  In any case, if my serial enthusiasm holds out, this thing could eventually subsume everything else I&#39;ve done with feeds.</p>\n<p>For now, peek at some of these highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/masterfeed\">Master Personal Feed</a> - One big feed blended from 10 other personal metadata feeds pulled from various Web-2.0-ish sites.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/magpiejson\">Feed to JSON via Magpie</a> - Get feed data parsed by way of <a href=\"http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/\">Magpie</a> into JSON data structures</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/flickrfavorites\">Flickr Favorites Feed</a> - Feed of photos marked as favorites by a Flickr user, pulled via the API</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/inspect/jbox\">jbox.com scraper</a> - Pipeline composed of <a href=\"http://tidy.sourceforge.net/\">HTML Tidy</a> and XSL to scrape <a href=\"http://jbox.com/\">jbox.com</a> to build an RSS feed of new items for sale.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beyond practical examples, there are some things under the hood that seem keen to me.  Apropos of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2007/02/15/thoughts-on-pipes-on-the-web-part-ii\">pipes-via-web ramblings</a> back in February, I&#39;m trying out a few different approaches to pipelining feed content through processor modules.  My original FeedMagick relied on feeding URLs to URLs as parameters.  That, unfortunately, can be mighty cumbersome and inefficient.  So, FeedMagick2 explores a few more approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The first and obvious approach is to chain them together in a single script.  So, I&#39;ve got objects instances that pass content from one to the next.  The thing is, the pipe works in reverse:  The driver script asks the last module in the pipe for content, which then asks the one before it for content, and so on.  At any point along the way, modules can cache the output of previous modules, and refrain from calling up the chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The second way to chain pipelines together is just like the first FeedMagick:  Some pipelines start with fetching a URL.  That can be an original feed, or a URL leading to the output of an antecedent pipeline.  And, oh yeah, most pipelines are run via parameterized URLs, so there&#39;s that bit of handy recursion.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The third way to chain pipelines together is with HTTP POST:  A pipeline can accept feed data via the request body of an HTTP POST, thus allowing antecedent pipelines (or even cURL scripts) to <em>push</em> data into the pipeline rather than getting <em>pulled</em> via URL.  This is kind of like my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/?s=xmlrpc+pipe\">years-old jiggery pokery</a> with <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">pipelines via XML-RPC</a>, only much <em>much</em> simpler.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#39;m also poking around at making all of the above available at the command line via PHP-CLI, and I&#39;m having gratuitous fun exploring PEAR to roll my own stripped-down web framework.  I still hate PHP, but I&#39;m at least finding ways to entertain myself while I&#39;m holding my nose.  Of course, I find weird things entertaining.</p>\n<p>And, as a side note, the only reason I&#39;m using PHP is because I&#39;d like to play around with the idea of the de facto WordPress installation requirements standard.  That is:  If you can run WordPress, you can run this.  In reality, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m there, but I&#39;m hoping to get close.  For one, I&#39;m refusing to play with anything older than PHP 5.</p>\n<p>Anyway, play with it, tell me what you think and give me a reason to keep hacking at it.  :)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221082761\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jamesv.org\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c82c72ca4f9eab33a80a7bd839c1ae0b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://jamesv.org\">jamesv</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221082761\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-04-30T11:39:15\">2007-04-30T11:39:15</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Aw man, now I've got to port all the code you wrote while you were here over to this new hotness ;) I really like (and appreciate) the single script approach.</p>\n<p>Is caching at a module level done automatically, or is that something I need to flag in my original call?

    "html": "<p>I&#39;ve been trying to get myself serious about writing and even set up a <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/skein/\">personal slush pile for my output</a>.  Then, I found <a href=\"http://ficlets.com/authors/l_m_orchard\">Ficlets</a>, and spewed a few quick starter stories there.  And then... I stopped.  I&#39;m hoping to pick it up again very soon, but I guess that&#39;s the nature of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiasm</a>—it doesn&#39;t just apply to hacking.</p>\n<p>So, here&#39;s something ironic:  I just spent a few hours tonight throwing together a hack for <a href=\"http://ficlets.com/authors/l_m_orchard\">Ficlets</a>.  See, <a href=\"http://ficlets.com/authors/l_m_orchard\">Ficlets</a> runs on original stories, comments, ratings, and sequels and prequels to stories.  You can get an Atom feed of an author&#39;s stories and a feed of comments—but it seems like there&#39;s no way to get notified of prequels and sequels, which are a very gratifying part of the whole shebang.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, check out this RSS feed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/www-bin/ficlets.php?author=l_m_orchard\"><code>http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/www-bin/ficlets.php?author=l_m_orchard</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#39;s a blend of all my stories, comments on my stories, as well as prequels and sequels found for my stories.  Subscribing to that feed will give me updates whenever there&#39;s anything new in all the above.  It&#39;s thrown together using a semi-crazy mix of my <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick\">FeedMagick</a> package for caching, and some XSL for scraping.  If you&#39;d like a feed like this of your own, just replace <code>l_m_orchard</code> for your own author name in the <code>author</code> parameter.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note, however, that this little service is hosted on my site and may go away at any time for any reason.</strong></p>\n<p>In case you&#39;re interested in what&#39;s under the hood, here&#39;s the quick and dirty XSL that&#39;s behind it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://decafbad.com/2007/04/ficlets.xsl\"><code>http://decafbad.com/2007/04/ficlets.xsl</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This thing&#39;s made possible because the <a href=\"http://ficlets.com/authors/l_m_orchard\">Ficlets</a> feeds are XML, <strong>and so are the XHTML pages happily infested with microformats</strong>.  If they ever go invalid, this scraper breaks.  But, that&#39;s the nature of scrapers, and it works for now.  Oh, and although they provide Atom, this feed is RSS 2.0.  Why?  Because it was easier that way.  I might put some more effort into an Atom feed, but my itch has so far been scratched.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084356\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rss-central.net/megalar\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1869681b309d36e59764f51c7f210406&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \nhref=\"http://rss-central.net/megalar\">megalar</a>\n</div>\n<a href=\"#comment-221084356\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-04-05T09:31:48\">2007-04-05T09:31:48</time></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\"><p>I had already decided I was gonna grab your FeedMagick source and try to do something with it but this just gives me more incentive as a Ficlets lover.

    "body": "I've been trying to get myself serious about writing and even set up a [personal slush pile for my output](http://decafbad.com/skein/).  Then, I found [Ficlets][], and spewed a few quick starter stories there.  And then... I stopped.  I'm hoping to pick it up again very soon, but I guess that's the nature of my [serial enthusiasm](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast)—it doesn't just apply to hacking.\r\n\r\nSo, here's something ironic:  I just spent a few hours tonight throwing together a hack for [Ficlets][].  See, [Ficlets][] runs on original stories, comments, ratings, and sequels and prequels to stories.  You can get an Atom feed of an author's stories and a feed of comments—but it seems like there's no way to get notified of prequels and sequels, which are a very gratifying part of the whole shebang.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, check out this RSS feed:\r\n\r\n   * [`http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/www-bin/ficlets.php?author=l_m_orchard`](http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/www-bin/ficlets.php?author=l_m_orchard)\r\n\r\nThat's a blend of all my stories, comments on my stories, as well as prequels and sequels found for my stories.  Subscribing to that feed will give me updates whenever there's anything new in all the above.  It's thrown together using a semi-crazy mix of my [FeedMagick][] package for caching, and some XSL for scraping.  If you'd like a feed like this of your own, just replace `l_m_orchard` for your own author name in the `author` parameter.\r\n\r\n**Please note, however, that this little service is hosted on my site and may go away at any time for any reason.**\r\n\r\nIn case you're interested in what's under the hood, here's the quick and dirty XSL that's behind it:\r\n\r\n   * [`http://decafbad.com/2007/04/ficlets.xsl`](http://decafbad.com/2007/04/ficlets.xsl)\r\n\r\nThis thing's made possible because the [Ficlets][] feeds are XML, **and so are the XHTML pages happily infested with microformats**.  If they ever go invalid, this scraper breaks.  But, that's the nature of scrapers, and it works for now.  Oh, and although they provide Atom, this feed is RSS 2.0.  Why?  Because it was easier that way.  I might put some more effort into an Atom feed, but my itch has so far been scratched.\r\n\r\n[FeedMagick]: http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick\r\n[ficlets]: http://ficlets.com/authors/l_m_orchard\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n            \n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n            \n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221084356\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rss-central.net/megalar\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1869681b309d36e59764f51c7f210406&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://rss-central.net/megalar\">megalar</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221084356\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-04-05T09:31:48\">2007-04-05T09:31:48</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>I had already decided I was gonna grab your FeedMagick source and try to do something with it but this just gives me more incentive as a Ficlets lover.
