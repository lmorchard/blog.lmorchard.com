  "html": "<p>One bit of hackery I did this weekend was to explore the <a href=\"http://codeigniter.com/\">CodeIgniter PHP framework</a>, which is even less magic yet more glued-together out of the box than the <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/\">Zend Framework</a>.  Also, very much less magic than <a href=\"http://cakephp.org/\">CakePHP</a> and barely in the same universe as <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.com/\">Symfony</a>.  I think I may have found my sweet spot of simplicity and comprehensible magic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://codeigniter.com/\">CodeIgniter</a> has is a PHP 4 / 5 framework that provides a lightweight Model / View / Controller arrangement with URL routing and a useful but minimal constellation of utility classes and helpers.  The view templates are in PHP, with just a bit of pre-processing.  The controllers are plain-old PHP classes whose methods are called via simple URL routes.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/models.html\">model layer of CodeIgniter</a>, however, is the weakest part of the trio - which I actually like a lot.  It's not a magical ORM - instead it's just a simple superclass from which to derive, mostly there to suggest that a separate model is a good thing to write.  The DB abstraction classes just make the job of writing SQL statements easier and don't pretend that there's no impedance mismatch between objects and relational tables.</p>\n<p>The depth of code in <a href=\"http://codeigniter.com/\">CodeIgniter</a> is shallow enough that I felt I was able to get into developing quickly while still taking side trips through the framework methods I was calling and get at least a glance at what being taken care of for me.  <a href=\"http://codeigniter.com/forums/viewthread/50715/\">There's always danger in magic</a>, but this stuff doesn't really get out of hand.</p>\n<p>To doodle around with an idea, I threw together a layout decorator class to support the sort of nested templates I'm used to from <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.com/\">Symfony</a>.  Out of the box, <a href=\"http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/views.html\">CI views</a> are simple, offering facilities for calling sub-templates and \"partials\" but not directly providing conventions for such.  My first swatches of code add a bit of that.</p>\n<p>After playing around with layouts, the next thing I did was to use <a href=\"http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/sessions.html\">CI sessions</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/libraries/php\">PHP OpenID Library</a> to develop both an auth producer and consumer.  <a href=\"http://codeigniter.com/\">CodeIgniter</a> doesn't come with a ready-made user auth system, though it does come with <a href=\"http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/sessions.html\">its own implementation of sessions</a> using encrypted browser cookies to replace PHP's native sessions - another feature I really like.</p>\n<p>Kind of odd - but on the same toy app I can sign up for local accounts, sign into other sites with OpenID URLs based on local accounts, and sign into my <a href=\"http://codeigniter.com/\">CI</a> app with external OpenID identities.</p>\n<p>The wild bit is that I can even sign in locally with one OpenID URL, then use the newly created local profile to get a second OpenID URL to sign in somewhere else.  Seems interesting yet possibly dangerous.  I mostly just glued the right parts together and got the Auth_OpenID black-box modules working - now that I have an operational OpenID system, I need to study it further.</p>\n<p>The next thing I want to do is work more on profile managment, offer some of the <a href=\"http://openid.net/specs/openid-simple-registration-extension-1_1-01.html\">OpenID Simple Registration</a> fields, and look into <a href=\"http://drnicwilliams.com/2007/07/20/one-app-one-user-account-and-multiple-openids/\">supporting multiple auth IDs linked to the same user profile</a>.</p>\n<p>It might also be fun to do something like \"<a href=\"http://simonwillison.net/2007/Jul/13/\">catalogue the sites that a user logs into and automatically construct a homepage</a>.\"  Overall, I've got some vague notional ideas to build a personal status collector and maybe some federated social networking and messaging stuff.  But, one hack at a time.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, I'll get this code I've got so far into better shape and commit to my SVN repository.  Sooner than later, otherwise it'll never get off my dev box.</p>\n\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\"><h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n<ul class=\"comments\">\n<li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221087156\">\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\">\n<a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e17949267bbfe21a0fadf1bbf00592b4&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\"></a>\n<a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://plasmasturm.org/\">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#comment-221087156\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-07-24T01:34:03\">2007-07-24T01:34:03</time></a></p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"content\"><p>Hmm, a system that treats its own OpenIDs just like any other OpenID and considers them foreign credentials for which it creates a new account seems… weird.
