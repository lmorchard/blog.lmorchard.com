But, the guys behind <a href=\"http://jchutchins.net/7Son/Home/Home.html\">7th Son</a> and <a href=\"http://scottsigler.podshow.com/podcasts/\">Infection</a> are both very appreciative of fans and are quick to give shout-outs — so, it&#39;s providing me with a bit of fun and motivation to actually get something fictional written after years of sputtering activity.  So, hey, whatever works.  :)</p>\n"}
