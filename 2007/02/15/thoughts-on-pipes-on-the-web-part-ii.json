Pipes</a>.  On the surface, I think it&#39;s because it&#39;s not a freshly discovered concept for me, and also probably because I&#39;m tired and a bit hacked out right now.  But, I think there&#39;s a bit more to it.</p>\n<p>First of all, I&#39;m not impressed by GUI builders for most things.  Don&#39;t get me wrong:  That <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Pipes</a> GUI is pretty sweet and quite an impressive implementation — but as a rule, such things don&#39;t quite get my geek on.  So, there&#39;s that.</p>\n<p>Another thing is that I&#39;ve done something <em>kinda</em> like <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo! Pipes</a>, called <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick\">FeedMagick</a> — only, it doesn&#39;t have a GUI and I mostly abandoned it after releasing the code and having used it for a project at my old job.  It&#39;s one of those <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiasms</a> that I&#39;ve figured I&#39;d circle back to eventually.  I still think it&#39;s a pretty cool idea.  </p>\n<p>All kudos to the <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo! Pipes</a> team though: Unlike me, they&#39;ve actually got a living and breathing project — which trumps a paged-to-disk <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast\">serial enthusiasm</a> most days.</p>\n<p>So what else is really curbing my enthusiasm?  Well, <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo! Pipes</a> looks like a pretty self-contained pipes engine — data goes in one end, <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/F/frobnicate.html\">frobnication</a> happens in the middle, data comes out the other side.</p>\n<p>But, what I like about the notion of <a href=\"http://207.22.26.166/bytecols/2001-08-15.html\">the URL-line</a> is that you can take one URL and <em>supply it as a parameter to another URL</em> — making <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2002/04/18/oooaod\">messy pipelined URLs</a> while building a crazy web-wide distributed execution environment powered by HTTP and REST.  This is the kernel of the notion that I think really excites me about pipe on the web — I just haven&#39;t had a chance to do much with it lately.</p>\n<p>Depending on the perspective, true pipes on the web — that is, URLs fetching URLs — look to me like <a href=\"http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html\">functional programming</a> ala <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language\">Lisp</a>.  Consider an idempotent GET request as a pure function call with no side-effects.  Then, consider a GET request that accepts a URL as a parameter — it&#39;s a nested function call: the outer GET must make an inner GET to fetch the parameter-supplied URL.  Give the inner URL another URL as a parameter, and you&#39;ve got yet another nested function call.  </p>\n<p>But, if you like, ignore the theoretical <a href=\"http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html\">benefits of functional programming</a> — flip the nested function calls inside out and you&#39;ve got a pipe.  And, since you&#39;re using HTTP GET, you can get all the benefits of HTTP — like caching of execution results and a web full of distributed processing nodes, among other things.  </p>\n<p>I haven&#39;t explored <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo! Pipes</a> deeply enough yet, so maybe I&#39;m missing the features that pipe authors can used to call on other distributed pipe elements out on the web at large.  But, I think that&#39;s what ultimately gets me psyched about pipes the web and hasn&#39;t yet for <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo! Pipes</a>.</p>\n<p>And, of course, I think I&#39;m just a little hacked out and tired of whizbang new stuff right now.  :)</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221090511\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://journal.2manyjohns.com\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d9670e63de2bba834c5a725193702718&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"http://journal.2manyjohns.com\">John Evans</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221090511\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-02-15T13:59:01\">2007-02-15T13:59:01</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p>The thing that struck me about Pipes is that it seemed rather limiting to someone who can code but too geeky to someone who can&#39;t.
