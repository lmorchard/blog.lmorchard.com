Pipes</a> from my feed subscriptions.  That&#39;s crazy — I&#39;ve usually never seen more than 3-5 feeds linking to anyone thing, maybe as many as 8 if it&#39;s something <em>really</em> hot.  I read about it over morning coffee and aggregator skimming; I heard about it on <a href=\"http://www.twit.tv/88\">TWiT</a> on the bus to work; I was told all about it in the hallway once I got to work.  <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo! Pipes</a> has been hard to miss. </p>\n<p>With that in mind, it seems weird to me that <em>I</em> didn&#39;t get as excited about the release of <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Pipes</a> as everyone else in my local blogosphere seems to have.  <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Pipes</a> has all the ingredients of something that should <em>really</em> set me off.  Pipes, filters, mashups, RSS, Atom, RDF — (singing) these are a few of my favorite things!  So, what gives?  I&#39;m genuinely worried that I&#39;m sick, depressed, losing it, or otherwise replaced by a pod alien.  Possibly all the above.</p>\n<p>I knew about <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Pipes</a> as an internal project at Yahoo! quite awhile ago — possibly even in my first week or two after <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/24/go-west-young-man\">having joined</a>.  I&#39;m fuzzy on the timing here, but it&#39;s not important.  Someone mentioned it to me at some point, I poked at it a bit from the internal network, and thought it was neat / keen.  My main impression at the time was, &quot;Cool, someone&#39;s doing <a href=\"http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick\">FeedMagick</a>, but done right and with a slick visual layout tool.&quot;  </p>\n<p>Then, I got really busy with del.icio.us and wandered off.  So, the release wasn&#39;t big surprising news to me — my reaction was something like, &quot;Huh, so they did a public release of that?  Nice.&quot;  Clearly I need more caffeine.</p>\n<p>The thing is that the idea of pipes on the web is not itself a new concept to me.  I think my <a href=\"http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmlRpcFilteringPipe\">XmlRpcFilteringPipes</a> seems kinda silly in retrospect, and I&#39;m all about <a href=\"http://207.22.26.166/bytecols/2001-08-15.html\">the Power of the URL-line</a> nowadays — but suffice it to say that I&#39;ve been thinking about pipes on the web since as long ago as 2002 or so.  </p>\n<p>So, while I&#39;m all jaded and apparently incapable of feeling the wonder, this seems to be one of the biggest revelations to people playing with <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo! Pipes</a>:</p>\n<p><i>Pipes?  On the web?  <strong>BRILLIANT!</strong></i></p>\n<p>So, it&#39;s not you, it&#39;s me.  I think I&#39;ve got a serious deficit of enthusiasm for what&#39;s really a pretty cool thing.  I want to think a bit more about why that is.</p>\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments archived-comments\">\n            <h3>Archived Comments</h3>\n\n        <ul class=\"comments\">\n\n        <li class=\"comment\" id=\"comment-221086705\">\n            <div class=\"meta\">\n                <div class=\"author\">\n                    <a class=\"avatar image\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\"><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=390bc3dca83aea14b31f821e51a4400b&amp;size=32&amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png\"/></a>\n                    <a class=\"avatar name\" rel=\"nofollow\" \n                       href=\"\">Kenneth</a>\n                </div>\n                <a href=\"#comment-221086705\" class=\"permalink\"><time datetime=\"2007-02-15T14:06:37\">2007-02-15T14:06:37</time></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"content\"><p><a href=\"http://yakubovich.blogspot.com/2007/01/visipipe-visual-version-of-core-utils.html\">http://yakubovich.blogspot.com/2007/01/visipipe-visual-version-of-core-utils.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Might have been buried in all the buzz about Yahoo, but this sounds like a neat idea.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://proessays.com\">Kenneth Writer</a></p></div>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li class=&quot;comment&quot; id=&quot;comment-221086707&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://jeffdaly.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f2e613837687c930227127a7b0267dd0&amp;amp;size=32&amp;amp;default=http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1320279820/images/noavatar32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a class=&quot;avatar name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; \n                   href=&quot;http://jeffdaly.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Jeff Daly&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;#comment-221086707&quot; class=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2007-02-16T01:08:54&quot;&gt;2007-02-16T01:08:54&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re not alone. I was excited when I learned about Pipes, but ultimately I was let down by the lack of parsing tools. Pipes is seriously limited without any XPath/regular expression parsing capabilities. Fortunately, there is a post on XPath in the feature request page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"}
