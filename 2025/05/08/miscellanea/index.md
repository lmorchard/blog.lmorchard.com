- If I keep this weeknotes thing up, maybe I could find a way to make it a daynotes thing? I like how [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) and [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/) just kind of riff throughout the day with notions of various length and format - sometimes as short as a toot and sometimes expanding out into full essays.
- I think I'd need to restructure my layout here a bit, pull way back from the assumption that I'll often be posting Big Serious Things like magazine articles. Also make it way easier to just have a page-a-day open to catch things that tumble out of my brain.
- This is not terribly new - Dave's been doing it for decades. And, I did it his way for awhile using his OPML Editor. What's new is I'm sort of ruminating over reinventing all the wheels in ways particular to my current habits and energies.
- I like being a tinkerer and I like building stuff useful to myself. I wouldn't say I'm an inventor, as such, but I do have a lot of things in my personal environment that are peculiar and just-so to me that other folks might not find handy.
- I groused last week about how Apple prevents me from buying a book for my Kindle from my iPhone. It's been that way for a long while. Looks like maybe since they got smacked in court last week, [that maybe I'll be able to buy a book for my Kindle soon](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/05/06/external-purchasing-from-the-kindle-app/) (sorta)?
