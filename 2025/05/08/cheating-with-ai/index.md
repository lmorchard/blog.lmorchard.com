Flipped through Tiktok this morning and saw a girl complaining about how AI gave her all the wrong answers for cheating on her business final exam. Like this would be a relatable thing.

She's kind of fighting for her life in the comments with folks dragging her. She seems not quite to believe that cheating on a final exam in business with AI is an abnormal thing.

Like, it sounds worse than denial, like she's baffled that it's even questionable and she thinks everyone's lying to her to be mean.
