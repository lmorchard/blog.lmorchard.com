I just found this [permacomputing wiki](https://permacomputing.net/) via [tante](https://masto.hackers.town/@tante@tldr.nettime.org/114459769793690044), where there's [a statement of principles](https://permacomputing.net/Principles/) that I think jibe well with what Wendell Berry wrote:

> - Care for life
> - Care for the chips
> - Keep it small
> - Hope for the best, prepare for the worst
> - Keep it flexible
> - Build on a solid ground
> - Amplify awareness
> - Expose everything
> - Respond to changes
> - Everything has a place
