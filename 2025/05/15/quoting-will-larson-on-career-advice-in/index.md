> I can’t give advice on what you should do, but if you’re finding this job market difficult, it’s certainly not personal. My sense is that’s basically the experience that everyone is having when searching for new roles right now. If you are in a role today that’s frustrating you, my advice is to try harder than usual to find a way to make it a rewarding experience, even if it’s not perfect. I also wouldn’t personally try to sit this cycle out unless you’re comfortable with a small risk that reentry is quite difficult: I think it’s more likely that the ecosystem is meaningfully different in five years than that it’s largely unchanged.

It sure does feel personal if the paycheck stops, but I know what he means. It's not "not personal" so much as *impersonal* like a funnel cloud.

Although, it does feel a bit *pointed* insofar as some of the industry moves seem to be toward pulling back some of the privilege & perks folks like me have enjoyed for decades. Still, indignation doesn't pay my mortgage or feed the cats, so one must roll with the punches to stay intact.
