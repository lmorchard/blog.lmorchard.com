- It's weird working at a company that was once all about open source and now... isn't so much. There are things I'm doing that I don't think I should be talking about. And yet, I want to talk about them.
- But, also, I think we *should* be talking about them. And also making it all open source. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Been checking out are.na - [it seems like Pinterest for horn-rimmed-glasses aesthetics](https://www.are.na/les-orchard/arena-babysteps-for-me). That's not meant as an insult, mind you.
