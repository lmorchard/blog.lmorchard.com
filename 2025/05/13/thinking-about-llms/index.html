        <p>I'm in a weird place with this current AI wave in the tech industry. I feel like a good chunk of folks would tar &amp; feather me if I wrote anything but a complete denunciation, while another chunk I already blocked during the crypto &amp; NFT craze. I still feel like writing something, though, if only to bounce it off the screen for myself.</p>

<p>The way LLMs have been trained <a href="https://allenpike.com/2024/llms-trained-on-internet">is problematic at best</a>. In <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Fully_Automated_Luxury_Gay_Space_Communism">an ideal world</a>, we could train these systems with full consent and reciprocal compensation for the intellectual produce they consume. And we could be <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/can-we-be-normal-about-ai-now-that-deepseek-happened">normal about LLMs as a technology</a>. Instead, we have <a href="https://blog.lmorchard.com/2024/03/11/dance-for-the-bots/">an extractive regime disrupting the very ecosystems fueling it</a>.</p>
<p>That said, my continuing paycheck seems contingent on developing AI literacy while abiding these unpleasantries. As Upton Sinclair wrote, "<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair">It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.</a>" The thing is, I do understand it rather decently - but my mortgage doesn't care, and I can't retire for another 30 years at least. So, I need to "stay current".</p>
<p>Still, I've long been fascinated with both artificial and natural intelligence. As a kid, I loved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron">Tron</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automan">Automan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Rider">Knight Rider</a>. I read Hofstadter's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach"><em>GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach</em></a> and Minsky's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Mind"><em>Society of Mind</em></a> in high school. I double-majored in Computer Science and Psychology in college. I almost majored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science">Cognitive Science</a>, but the advanced math made me surly. So I'm admittedly susceptible to enthusiasm toward this technology, though I'm trying to stay grounded.</p>
<p>I think it's hyperbolic to say LLMs are entirely useless. Used carefully, judiciously, and honestly, they can function as labor-saving devices and thought amplifiers. That's a lot of caveats, I know. The enormous question is whether the value outweighs the costs. My hunch is it will, eventually, even if LLMs don't measure up to the hype. A market correction likely lies ahead.</p>
<p>All that preamble aside, here's what I understand so far: LLMs aren't thinking, nor will they conjure an AGI genie from GPU exhaust. They're powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">Chinese rooms</a> that manipulate symbols probabilistically, recontextualizing and reconstituting patterns of language that roughly map to human thought. </p>
<p>And I think that, through the process of training over mind-bogglingly enormous volumes of exemplar language, these models have managed to extract &amp; encode a great many subtle rules of symbolic manipulation which can perform rather convincing and <em>practically useful</em> quasi-thinking functions.</p>
<p>In other words, though they may be "<a href="https://thecleverest.com/gpt3-is-just-spicy-autocomplete/">spicy autocomplete</a>", the spice is potent. There's real utility in a system that can accept intentions expressed in ways that demand less of a user to meet the computer on its own turf. That's a real advance in user interfaceâand I'm especially interested in how this stuff looks <a href="https://hello-jp.net/building-beyond-the-buzz/chatbots-are-ai-antipatterns">as we move beyond chatbots</a>.</p>
<p>When a coding assistant produces code that closely matches what I would have written anywayâand faster than consulting docs and Stack Overflowâthat's valuable. Yes, "hallucinations" happen, but with sufficient context, narrowed outputs, and result testing, they're manageable.</p>
<p>That's the key to good LLM use, IMO: results must be tested and verified, ideally via automation but otherwise through human inspection.</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI">agentic AI</a> isn't magic. It turns out some of what we doâespecially in building softwareâcan be patently rote. With guiding prompts and rich context, an agentic system equipped with an LLM can effectively emulate an iterative development process. It doesn't "know" what it's doing; it's just that countless humans have done this before and written about it. So, it can effectively emulate an iterative process by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs">Mad-Libs</a>'ing its way through with context and feedback.</p>
<p>That said, I don't think <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">pure vibe coding</a> is wise beyond initial exploration. Keep a steady hand on the tiller and take responsibility for the output.</p>
<p>To sum up, I think there's a <em>there</em> there with LLMs and agentsâfraught and compromised though it may be. In another universe, I might wait until the dust settles, maybe build furniture instead. But here and now, this stuff genuinely fascinates me. So, I'll likely keep tinkering and writing about it.</p>
