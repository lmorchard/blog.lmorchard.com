Just realized today that I've written my 359th three-page week-daily handwritten journal entry on my [BOOX Tab Ultra C e-ink tablet](https://shop.boox.com/collections/all/products/tabultrac). I've also got paper volumes going back to 2017 with similar cadence. That's a lot of writing that no one but me will probably ever read. But, I do read it, occasionally, to sort myself out.

I've got a back-burnered side project to train a handwriting recognition model to actually convert my journal entries to text. I should get back to that. No off-the-shelf model has yet been able to successfully decipher my script.

I've also got a notion, once I've converted my journals, to try feeding them to an LLM - either as a fine-tuned model or searching via RAG. Then, I could maybe pull themes and trends out of my past writing and ask annoying questions of my insufferable past self.
