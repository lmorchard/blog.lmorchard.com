Android Authority, "[YouTube’s new ads will ruin the best part of a video on purpose](https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-peak-points-ads-3557905/)":

> YouTube is always cooking up new ways to show you ads. Be it skippable ads, non-skippable ads, mid-rolls, or bumpers, the goal, as always, is to find more places to make more money. And now, thanks to AI, YouTube has found a brand-new spot to squeeze in ads — right when something exciting happens in a video.

I don't think I quite understand the point of ads on YouTube, these days. Are they there to get me to think favorably of an advertiser and buy something from them? Or are they there to annoy me into paying for YouTube Premium? Does this make anyone happy?
