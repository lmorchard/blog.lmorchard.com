- Hello world!
- I listen to podcasts at between 1.8x - 2.5x, depending on the day's mental weather. That means, when I've met a podcaster I listen to, they sound drugged or drunk to me.
	- Iâ€™ve had folks tell me this sounds stressful. But, I get distracted in the gaps and my mind wanders. Easier for me to follow rapid word dumps. 
	- This is not a flex, this is a coping strategy. 
- The new Peter Murphy album, "[Silver Shade](https://petermurphy.bandcamp.com/album/silver-shade)", sure is Peter Murphy. 
	- I don't hate this at all.
	- I'm really digging the collabs he did here, teaming up with folks like Boy George, Trent Reznor, and Justin Chancellor.
- Hey, you, service provider on the web that I pay for: I am annoyed that I'm constantly signed out when I come to visit. You don't remember me, and you are constantly trying to call-to-action and dark-pattern me into your growth hacks when I already have an account.
