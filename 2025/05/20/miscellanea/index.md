- Hello world!
- [Added support for a `draft: true` flag on entries here](https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/commit/954919050fca61d04d6e89beec96b0ea374ba74d), which should at least help me keep half-broken things from deploying mid-rant
- Now I just have to make sure to use that flag right so I *still* don't include half-broken things here ðŸ˜…
- I should figure out a decent way for showing really long strings here, like the path names in that cloud saves post today ðŸ¤”
- How the hell do I remember things like "[Pumas on Hoverbikes](https://monkeybagel.com/pumas.html) is at monkeybagel.com" but I have to remind myself to eat lunch as a separate step from making lunch?
