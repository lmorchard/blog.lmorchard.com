- Hello world!
- Nice day in Portland! Took the car to get serviced, walked for a sammich at [Snappy's](https://www.makeitsnappys.com/), then walked over to [TOTL Games](https://totlgames.com/) to see what's what there. Bought myself an Xbox 360 HDD expansion. Someday, I'll get around to hacking that thing and loading it up with all the Rock Band ever.
- Time for a bike ride! I've got a 15 mile route in Portland that I take around [the Willamette River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willamette_River) just about any weekend when the weather's pleasant. Not all that long, but rather pleasant, and gets me out of the house.
- I'm still playing with #meshtastic a little, but I think the two devices I have are really only receiving and not managing to transmit to anyone. At least, no one's ever really responded to any of my "ping" messages. Not sure whether I want to go further down the rabbit hole and buy any more robust antennas and the associated paraphernalia that goes along with.
