I asked [Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet) via [Aider](https://aider.chat/) to take a look at [the core libraries](https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/tree/main/lib) for my Easy-Blog Oven and to try drafting a quick user manual for it. [I think the result is actually not bad at all](https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com/blob/main/MANUAL.md)?

Aider tells me it cost about US$0.17 in API credits. It caught all the major quirky features I've hacked into the system over the years. I only made one or two minor edits before checking it into the repo.

I've been meaning to write something like this for myself for years, if only to remind myself how it all works after long periods of neglect. It's a boring task and one of those things I'd most likely never get around toâ€”especially not for one of my own projects.

This is also one of those kinds of things [I've been reticent to write about](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/13/thinking-about-llms/), anticipating negative feedback. But, it really is kind of neat and I found it personally useful. I can totally see the value in this kind of thing, when packaged up in friendlier UX for other folks.
