This kind of thing is very exciting to me. While [I think](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/05/13/thinking-about-llms/) vibe coding is currently flawed & fraught for folks who don't entirely understand the code, I agree with Simon Willison that "[everyone deserves the ability to automate tedious tasks in ther lives with computers](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/#let-s-not-lose-track-of-what-makes-vibe-coding-special)".

There's a lot of hype and cynicism in tension out there. But, I've personally cycled through a bunch of AI tools in the past few years. I've seen their actual utility and glimmers of where they can go next.

Trying to stay sober here, but I'd love to see more tools meet users where they are and lower the technical bar overall. I think it's both possible and worth it to work toward improving the capability & reliability of these tools for folks outside of the programming "priesthood".
