In this scenario, if Google bans your account - by mistake or for some reason unrelated to email - you lose access to everything everywhere. For example, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/terraria-developer-cancels-google-stadia-port-after-youtube-account-ban/\">the Terraria developer who cancelled his Stadia port over losing access to everything Google</a>. Does a password reset email make a sound if you're not allowed into the woods to hear it?</p>\n<p>Anyway, for now, I did figure out how to clean things up without a support ticket:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Rename second account from <a href=\"mailto:me@lmorchard.com\">me@lmorchard.com</a> to <a href=\"mailto:lmorchard2@fastmail.com\">lmorchard2@fastmail.com</a> - which they allowed in settings</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Delete alias <a href=\"mailto:me@lmorchard.com\">me@lmorchard.com</a> on second account</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Delete the domain lmorchard.com from the second account</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Add the domain lmorchard.com and alias me@ to my primary account</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Triple check that my MX, CNAME, and TXT records for lmorchard.com were all correct</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All the renaming and deleting shenanigans in that specific order turned out necessary to ensure the right things were freed up at the right points in sequence. Can't add domain to first account while another account has it. Can't remove domain while aliases are still using it. Can't remove alias while account is still named after it. All in all, a minor <a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/chicken_crossing.html\">fox, chicken, corn puzzle</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"garden-irrigation-automation\">Garden Irrigation Automation</h2>\n<p>I've never had a particularly green thumb.
