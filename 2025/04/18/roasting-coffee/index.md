I've been roasting coffee at home, off and on for years now. I roasted some more last weekend.

It started as a kind of ADHD enthusiasm hobby about 15 years ago. I read a dozen books, fell down the rabbit hole of forums and docs online. My first few dozen batches were carefully logged. I tried filling my head with details of varietals and roasting profiles. This was serious scientific business! Until I got bored of that, at which point I stopped being careful.

These days, I mostly just wing it and push the buttons on [the Behmor toaster oven](https://www.sweetmarias.com/behmor-2000ab-plus-roaster.html). I hang out and watch to make sure nothing catches on fire. I listen for the cracks and sniff the air to decide when to end the roast.

It takes about 20 minutes, all told, and the coffee ends up plenty good enough for a week of daily drinking. And, given the current era of tariff madness, green coffee beans end up a little cheaper and have a relatively long shelf life that make them worth buying in bulk and hoarding in the basement pantry.
